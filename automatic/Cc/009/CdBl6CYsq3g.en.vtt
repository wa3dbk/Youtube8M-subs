00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.520
 and with that I greet you dear people 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.829
 to our cool video guide deep out of the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.509
 black rock foundry of emotion 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.540
 yes we see the good gruol here already 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.520
 before us and left and right each one 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.920
 world market that is just for 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.110
 clarification as for the groups too 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.750
 stand or you like your groups 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.160
 you have to split the first ability 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.469
 I already introduce you here 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.180
 wants to handle and that is the 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.000
 inferno schnitzer and you see already 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.350
 inferno sharpener is a lot of text and 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.810
 below is 17 or 18 million fire 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.300
 damage which evenly to all 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.460
 opponents of the halt of infernos 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.320
 carver is then split 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.450
 and that's what it's all about 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.309
 the task really has that 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.850
 Removal carvers are distributed in the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.740
 Taunton to both camps or that google 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.710
 the distance top then in the camps 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.350
 works and yes you need two tanks around 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.340
 the ability overwhelming blows the 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.189
 I do not continue here now 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.509
 Imagine dealing with handles 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.479
 especially the tanks actually only the 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.310
 Tanks are a stuck then the ten 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.170
 percent more harm caused and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.490
 At some point it will not work anymore 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.499
 then had tank change completed 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.209
 are needed for exactly this reason 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:33.219
 you keep two tanks one cares 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:35.950
 around the inferno and the other one 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.810
 thinks well or the overwhelming 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.909
 otherwise I would like to beat it completely 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.439
 just over the head over blow 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.240
 come talk you see this here 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.249
 is then such a tidy ground 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.619
 effect on the floor and there you go 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.539
 Of course, out as a farrier clearly 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.179
 furthermore, it is petrified 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.859
 still shouting that very important 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.929
 you do not want your players there 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.159
 blow up you see you are right with us 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.679
 just three players in this 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.929
 petrify cringe and yes just 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.069
 eight meters distance hold bigfix had 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.439
 a nice indication 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.609
 and then nothing else happened 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.130
 I would say we look directly 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:11.470
 in the video then really demanding 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.330
 the boss is not now but that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.280
 girl right in the video under the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.260
 pulheimer is already running as I said 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.680
 boss is now rotated 180 degrees 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.560
 as pretty as 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.340
 he was shot is a tank in ours 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.200
 fall straight without turning and often 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.879
 ends now as soon as the boss the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.250
 inferno schlitzer acts and turns that 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.489
 in the green camp and so beautiful 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.409
 otherwise shot as an active person 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.840
 So hangs as active brought attention 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.609
 Please be sure that your overwhelming 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.230
 Do not hit the weapons too high with 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.769
 on the other hand, we are watching over our heads here 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.969
 beat and again on the 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.040
 overwhelming blows comes to speak 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.989
 every aspect seems ten percent more 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.689
 yes we see the fossilized here now 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.519
 crashing in my case and yes very much 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.680
 nicely distributed by the affected 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.840
 Players all other players stay 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.099
 of course in the camp, really 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.739
 remove and then supported too 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.629
 intercept and only the affected 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.909
 players are running out we are here in 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.079
 the heroic difficulty level 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:14.659
 21 players and over head was again 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.310
 from the boss so no idea the boss is 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.680
 actually a joke as I said is yes 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.079
 Also optional the first instance of what you do 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.940
 There is really free choice how to run 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.349
 Leuchtmann left one runs right if 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.840
 If you walk to the right you come in here 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.519
 the cave of gruol and there are 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.579
 we also look at green and you look 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.169
 the video guide here from us 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.829
 and yes inferno slicer comes now the 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:38.900
 fifth in the fall after that comes again 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.900
 petrified blaring the remove 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.639
 Schnitzer away turned back up 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.199
 and auction that shake now 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.699
 right after a few players 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:51.650
 otherwise would have now synonymous because of 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.169
 destructive rampage come in yes 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.280
 seven seconds he comes 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:57.199
 and yes that was a little stupid here 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.079
 We almost or have ourselves 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:01.530
 blasted each other and yes that was 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.200
 then rather a bit uncool 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.640
 otherwise a fall under you then runs 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.580
 Of course, now it starts 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.490
 amoklauf of he now works more often 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.850
 beating your head and has increased that 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.260
 pace by 50 percent active straight and there 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.440
 It just means please take care 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.770
 do not let it hit you 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.910
 and otherwise just continue as usual 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:28.650
 in the text I say simply 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.960
 bosnia war so half we have 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.030
 now equaled 50 percent had 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.130
 the boss still the killing spree is now 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.480
 also over 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.980
 i forgot skill somewhere 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.760
 I'll take a look at my monitor no 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.919
 I do not have 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.780
 So that was really it 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.460
 most important or the 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.070
 most important in this fight is the 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.590
 inferno slashes that on the camps 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.530
 distributed and in no case stop 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.080
 the boss in the tank meets because of this 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.810
 is then dead that is turns the inferno 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.460
 please always in each of the slots 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.530
 former camps I have here again 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.320
 that are crashing on me and here yes the 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.630
 druid I do not know who it is 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.800
 blow me up here or I'll jump 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.810
 where no idea 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.390
 You get hold of each one or the longer one 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.800
 which the baw actively slower 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.250
 So you will not be there 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.620
 somehow run to the end of the room 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.740
 and yes that's just the way it is 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.660
 problematic on this substance as well as 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.539
 now here from us left and right in 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.820
 cave collapse see and then the 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.960
 This is okay here 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.450
 Now we're left lucky 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.830
 Collapse past right is still active 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.020
 but of course we have the 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.100
 possibility left a bit yes us 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.710
 to widen 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.380
 and here again an inferno strong into 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.030
 other camp and yes that actually works 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.350
 everything wonderful we have a dead one 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.150
 player I do not know why he 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.820
 has died again the the 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.770
 problematic now is new increase 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.450
 Collapse left and the overhead strong 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.240
 but you have enough time 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.310
 really stepped inferno again 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.960
 our kempter has our tank off 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.880
 torn one group i do not know 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.710
 why he probably has to 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.650
 still stood in caves collapse 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.150
 have no idea petrified 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.250
 shout again at me I move 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.780
 me here of course nice far from the 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.270
 other players away if here now 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.720
 caught and we hurt a bit 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.950
 but that's just the way it was said 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.620
 concerned players run out of the raid 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.690
 and then everything is fine 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:30.320
 destructive rampage once again though 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.150
 the boss has only 15 percent left 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.070
 and yes, I can stand this 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.710
 actually ever say goodbye because 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.420
 The stock exchange can not see more so it 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.120
 Now, it's outrageous but you have to say 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.970
 we are in with 21 players in here 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.690
 the heroic difficulty of it 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.750
 60 70 percent have been drinking since we 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.910
 simply the maximum charge for the mails 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.100
 We wanted to pick a house here 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.490
 Drinks taken so wonder 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.440
 but not all in all 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.720
 Everything important was said, I remove 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.300
 like to repeat it again 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.220
 camps turn as a tank to watch out for 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.040
 the overwhelming blows not 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.590
 to collect then to collect stack 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.030
 actually everything is easy and yes at this 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.590
 I thank you for your help 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.540
 Attention I hope I could you 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.280
 the boss did well explain perhaps 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.690
 you have already seen the basics guide 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.460
 Everything was important 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.050
 in it 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.730
 yes and thank me, of course 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.120
 again with my money dispute of 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:32.900
 terror and say see you soon 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.900
 it well to
