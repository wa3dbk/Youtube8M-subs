not<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.510> welcoming<00:00:48.960> i<00:00:49.579> think<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.760> i<00:00:51.300> feel

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
not as welcoming i think because i feel

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.680 
not as welcoming i think because i feel
closer<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.020> military<00:00:52.230> base<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.520> lot<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
closer to a military base a lot of the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.420 
closer to a military base a lot of the
like<00:00:55.020> restaurant<00:00:55.469> owners<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:55.949> bar<00:00:56.129> owners

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
like restaurant owners or bar owners

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.490 
like restaurant owners or bar owners
they<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:56.820> allow<00:00:57.180> military<00:00:57.719> personnel<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500

they don't allow military personnel to
come<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.190> guess<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.609> create<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
come in because I guess they create a

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.329
