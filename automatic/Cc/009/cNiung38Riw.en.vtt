00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 The English team, nobody's talking about it. 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.260
 based everything beauty and fashion you miss 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.930
 of making this video between civilians 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.060
 fiddle with the mother edition that misses good 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.260
 It's been so long, but it's already been a while. 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.619
 good quota 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.689
 But anyway it's as usual I am 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.399
 quite late with videos by 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.579
 youtube everything else 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.010
 I do not know why I do not think some do. 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.540
 I'm not a boy, not on time. 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.969
 but anyway 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.920
 but it's not what counts for you to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.660
 stop like it happened today in this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.059
 Day, why? I'll talk that day. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.739
 because it is almost midnight before I 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.489
 I'm recording the audio over to whoever 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.070
 it's on 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.449
 I 'm recording is an audio over the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.199
 gameplay 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.910
 So it's the audio I'm recording here. 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.670
 now they 're 11 57 right and that's the way it is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.490
 because I would exclude one for whom 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.409
 do not know I record with myles action or 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.600
 At least I recorded well, I kept going. 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.189
 recording I'll still buy a new one 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.680
 but anyway I record kombi emires action 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.290
 but he just sent a damn trick. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.600
 here on my pc I kind of did not want to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.790
 would exclude connected to the week 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.009
 director of the program on the folder 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.930
 had videos on and sent me 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.060
 I got really horny and I was pretty 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.460
 turned on because hand 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.770
 I like rio de janeiro cool on it good went 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.110
 a sum so high but so far 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.140
 money money money is on 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:48.090
 But anyway I kind of just wanted to tell 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.240
 You, for me, stop and stop. 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.540
 the 100 channel videos I 'm going to buy 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.549
 again the action that is a program that 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.710
 today a very good program for you that 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.030
 It's starting there I 'm not very anxious 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.969
 on youtube but for you it's starting 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.369
 I highly recommend this stay 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.009
 this program is not because a 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.810
 face great program is not a walk 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.129
 I went to see him, it's never good to lose. 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.410
 but I just did not do anything because I was dumb 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:17.160
 Ass, you can call me an ass. 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.890
 why old our mother that anger and anger 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.390
 face is black is coming back with all 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.360
 best hand is buying the peripherals 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.340
 Well then, I kind of wanted it too. 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.610
 the tip is that you give me a tip 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.570
 because I'm a full blown fella 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.190
 in the world of peripheral games 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.190
 computer parts for computers 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.220
 parts for everything 's sound has everything 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.110
 complete fusca turned on so i wanted 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.150
 much your help for you that is a 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.100
 man who says there was a friend there 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.660
 Your comment to send to me here O 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.060
 recommend a I want so I hand myself 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.890
 I want the top equipment even on 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.110
 Whether as is clear so 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.970
 Let's put some hand in the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.770
 awareness because I'm not rich, huh? 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.600
 but if given der need to understand is I will 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.300
 buying and improving the quality of 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.810
 audio is also briefly the image of the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.510
 channel 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.610
 but anyway what I had to give is the one that 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.500
 type will delay videos a little 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.460
 because I have no action program 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.110
 that I record 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.640
 so this is a word that goes 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.480
 make it hard to record videos 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.880
 linked 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.670
 so it's smart understanding of all is 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.890
 Are you going to ask me on the beach? 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.650
 you are without a recording program and 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.690
 cites coca in the bottom gameplay 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.700
 human is because this gameplay I've 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.400
 had recorded it was scheduled to do 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.250
 another gameplay stop is on 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.050
 But it did not work, but what? 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.450
 I just had it recorded so I had 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.070
 that to leave even one of the best is 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.780
 because the rest is all programmed right 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.650
 so I count on the support of all 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.850
 you 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.980
 is in between let's say another one 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.989
 week is not going to be anything other than 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.140
 custom knows I 'm a pretty face 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.810
 delayed not a little punctual but I 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.690
 I really wanted your support. 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.730
 I will soon be giving news to 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.860
 You who do not follow me on social networks 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.739

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.530

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.049

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.789
 But anyway twitter twitter facebook will leave 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.510
 all the inscription boys is then is 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.250
 that's right 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.210
 the news is given just not to let 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.840

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.389

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.759
