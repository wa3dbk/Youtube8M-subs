00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.969
 time of day dear colleague on this 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.130
 lesson we continue this lesson we Dusya 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.960
 let's talk about what else 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.710
 ways of coloring paper and the second way 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.970
 which i used is okra painting 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.090
 paper ordinary paints 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.170
 ordinary watercolors 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.469
 seemingly still have a boss she is much 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 richer much and box but the city 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:48.120
 falls immediately otherwise you will all be 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:52.050
 paint and everything that surrounds you will also 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.340
 all colors will be the only color 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.420
 which more or less keeps its well 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.960
 let's say paint is not toiled this is watercolor 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.170
 Now we will do it to start 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.729
 we are on the bed table for something like that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 so as not to mess the table itself take a simple 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.530
 paper 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 already the office on the white paper further 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.900
 we need ordinary paint 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.890
 I paint these paints from my child 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.350
 them and take a brush bigger size 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.939
 I have this fifth number and water is all 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.270
 what kind of paint do we want 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.110
 you need to moisten it first 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.040
 wet it so that it softens a little 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:50.070
 let's say what we still need cosmo and 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.150
 good too but let's say purple 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.550
 Yes, I say this example 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.090
 can also be painted the same way 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.290
 any to any color whatever you want on 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.280
 extreme case if there is no war already 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.780
 opportunities to buy let's say in the store 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.740
 yes let's get down to the first method 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:21.030
 painting the easiest the easiest is 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.120
 we take a big brush we take a paint we take 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.950
 paint and start there in bold fat 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:38.130
 bold mow in this way all 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:44.950
 very easy to take no regrets and handsome 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:47.080
 all hope you understand but there is another 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.860
 way so you can also paint 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.230
 quickly we take for this we take a 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.220
 instant cotton wool 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:02.519
 This is how the answer pompon make him 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.980
 round was also wet Cossack 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.900
 we can even moisten the paint 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.530
 dampen the cotton fleece a little 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.209
 nothing bad will take paint 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.090
 take and 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:23.700
 from the same way we start working 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:27.600
 wetted and drove 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.870
 here it seems now that the bands are up 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.830
 lanes but when will you do the modules 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:40.950
 do module such bands will not be visible 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:45.459
 but more or less now here we are now 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:52.000
 fleece just you so rossvik these bands 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:55.230
 tariff valleys that's how it turns out that's how 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.660
 it turns out but everything is great 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.120
 now we put off his side dry 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.819
 of course pale of course nothing 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.139
 score 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:09.579
 but with no other way out for cheats, I tell you 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:13.609
 showed the second paper coloring 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:17.209
 alternative so let's say now you 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:19.989
 introduce the soup and another ariana painting 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.870
 papers of this cats.com spray can 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.030
 spray paint is considered the same 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.880
 alternative 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.599
 more expensive more expensive because 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.789
 when painting paper absorbs quickly and 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:37.550
 color and rather saturated 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.070
 but in some cases it is necessary to 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.009
 this resorting especially if your you 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:47.360
 interested in such a silver or 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:50.900
 golden or browsers for this 1 best 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.130
 option is a balloon like here's 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:58.870
 I have a can of silver color 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:01.000
 silver elder black too 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.970
 can cover 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.930
 black well or any other is 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.820
 just let the green lie for a long time 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.139
 its anyway ever using here 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.590
 let's start giving these 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.440
 and now I show how to do this before 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.440
 how to get started with the show on paper 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.479
 spray can need well ventilated 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:36.500
 suit room 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:37.940
 my case the back where i but u 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:44.409
 me this here 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:49.810
 kerchief cowboy style then pre 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.810
 I first need to poke a can 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:06:07.049
 so roughly written 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:07.049
 and start painting 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:20.039
 preliminary of course still indulge 

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:21.659
 so from the bottom to paint understood 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.149
 raised 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:34.059
 I 'll do it now 

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:38.079
 by 19 paint one sheet 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:40.869
 now i think it will dry up 

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:43.629
 the next day I will say this 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:46.029
 showed one more but i'm on a helmet 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:49.329
 the paper has come to an end our 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:54.939
 lessons in this lesson we have read 

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:57.539
 with two kinds of painting paper 1 we 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:59.289
 painted with watercolors 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:04.079
 watercolors 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:07.059
 second, we sprayed messenger 

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:09.099
 it turned out great it brought up 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:13.829
 staysail as far as the other side 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:16.649
 you can even see how the coloring came 

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:21.009
 use what I advise you 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:23.469
 be sure to use it all you can 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:25.589
 come in handy until the next lesson before 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:25.589
