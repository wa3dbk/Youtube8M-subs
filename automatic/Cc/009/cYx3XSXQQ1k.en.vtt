00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
by here they will see like a massive set

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.490 
by here they will see like a massive set
of<00:01:11.820> doors<00:01:11.970> activate<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.720> ghost<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.170> open

these doors and then through these doors

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.960 
these doors and then through these doors
a<00:01:15.540> bunch<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.290> Cabal<00:01:16.770> will<00:01:16.799> basically<00:01:17.340> spawn<00:01:17.759> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
a bunch of Cabal will basically spawn I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.179 
a bunch of Cabal will basically spawn I
put<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> resupply<00:01:18.840> codon<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.590> I'd<00:01:19.680> actually<00:01:19.860> get

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
put a resupply codon so I'd actually get

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.550 
put a resupply codon so I'd actually get
some<00:01:20.460> glimmer<00:01:21.060> from<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> normal<00:01:21.750> enemies<00:01:22.049> but

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
in the ship which actually spawned in it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.020 
in the ship which actually spawned in it
spawns<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.110> bunch<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.470> normal<00:01:26.100> red<00:01:26.340> enemies<00:01:26.790> and
