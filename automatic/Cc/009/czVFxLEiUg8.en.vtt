00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.149 
so for the first time plants vs zombies
is<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.080> space<00:01:25.320> complete<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:25.950> low

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
is going to space complete with low

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
is going to space complete with low
gravity<00:01:26.400> physics<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> great<00:01:27.840> white

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
gravity physics we have the great white

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.630 
gravity physics we have the great white
north<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> frozen<00:01:29.280> wasteland

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
north which is the frozen wasteland

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.940 
north which is the frozen wasteland
where<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> Yeti<00:01:30.390> lives<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.439> Zambia

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
where the Yeti lives and we have Zambia

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.160 
where the Yeti lives and we have Zambia
so<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.549> garden<00:01:32.939> 14<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.329> dr.<00:01:33.750> zomboss<00:01:34.049> is

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so in garden 14 to dr. zomboss is

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
so in garden 14 to dr. zomboss is
actually<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.220> he's<00:01:35.520> transformed<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
actually one and he's transformed to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090 
actually one and he's transformed to
ruby<00:01:36.360> into<00:01:36.630> Zambia<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> see<00:01:37.950> what

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
ruby into Zambia so we get to see what

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.590 
ruby into Zambia so we get to see what
that's<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> how<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> zombies<00:01:39.240> work<00:01:39.390> and
