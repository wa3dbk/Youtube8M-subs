condition and a genetic condition you

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.240 
condition and a genetic condition you
are<00:00:58.390> born<00:00:58.660> with<00:00:58.870> your<00:00:59.350> body<00:00:59.560> is<00:00:59.710> made<00:00:59.920> up<00:01:00.100> of

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
are born with your body is made up of

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.240 
are born with your body is made up of
genes<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:01.020> genes<00:01:02.020> are<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.530> instructions

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
genes and genes are the instructions

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.969 
genes and genes are the instructions
that<00:01:03.370> tell<00:01:03.790> your<00:01:04.360> body<00:01:04.570> how<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.019> grow<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.799> how

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
that tell your body how to grow and how

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.399 
that tell your body how to grow and how
to<00:01:06.040> work<00:01:06.369> so<00:01:07.299> in<00:01:07.360> your<00:01:07.509> case<00:01:07.780> one<00:01:08.170> of<00:01:08.290> your

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
to work so in your case one of your

to work so in your case one of your
genes<00:01:08.759> didn't<00:01:09.759> work<00:01:09.970> properly<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.590> have

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
genes didn't work properly so you have

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.270 
genes didn't work properly so you have
ectodermal<00:01:12.880> dysplasia<00:01:13.479> and<00:01:13.869> some<00:01:14.860> parts<00:01:15.220> of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
ectodermal dysplasia and some parts of

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.449 
but it still doesn't get you out of
cleaning<00:02:09.160> your<00:02:09.250> gums<00:02:12.990> get<00:02:13.990> hot<00:02:14.290> sometimes<00:02:14.590> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
cleaning your gums get hot sometimes the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.930 
cleaning your gums get hot sometimes the
reason<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:15.970> get<00:02:16.180> hot<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:17.080> because<00:02:17.400> your<00:02:18.400> sweat

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
reason you get hot is because your sweat

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.680 
reason you get hot is because your sweat
glands<00:02:19.350> haven't<00:02:20.350> formed<00:02:20.830> properly<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.690> sweat

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
glands haven't formed properly and sweat

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.350 
glands haven't formed properly and sweat
glands<00:02:23.020> help<00:02:23.530> control<00:02:24.220> your<00:02:25.030> body's

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
glands help control your body's

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.400 
glands help control your body's
temperature<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.980> when<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:28.000> get<00:02:28.209> hot<00:02:28.510> people

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
temperature so when you get hot people

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.880 
temperature so when you get hot people
normally<00:02:29.830> sweat<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.700> cause<00:02:31.000> people<00:02:31.450> down

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
normally sweat that cause people down

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.530 
normally sweat that cause people down
but<00:02:32.890> because<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.340> can't<00:02:33.580> sweat<00:02:33.970> we<00:02:34.209> have<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
but because you can't sweat we have to

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.809 
but because you can't sweat we have to
call<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.870> down<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.230> other<00:02:35.380> ways<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.640> that's

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
call you down in other ways so that's

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.930 
call you down in other ways so that's
why<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.360> have<00:02:37.600> lots<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.989> drinks<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.800> lots<00:02:39.790> of
