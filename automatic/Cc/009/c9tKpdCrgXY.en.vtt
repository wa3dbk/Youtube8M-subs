Blaster as you can see this is actually
the<00:00:46.379> second<00:00:46.710> time<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.860> soaked<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the second time I soaked it because I

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.270 
the second time I soaked it because I
don't<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.850> stripped<00:00:48.180> bolts<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.620> know<00:00:49.710> pail

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
don't like stripped bolts you know pail

blaster<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.000> differential<00:00:54.570> fluid

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
blaster and the differential fluid

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.090 
blaster and the differential fluid
there's<00:00:56.039> your<00:00:56.219> tag<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:57.270> axle<00:00:57.690> tag<00:00:57.949> that<00:00:58.949> will

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
there's your tag your axle tag that will

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.709 
there's your tag your axle tag that will
tell<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> what<00:00:59.640> kind<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.000> differential<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
tell you what kind of differential you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.150 
tell you what kind of differential you
have<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> whether<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.770> need<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> add

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
have and whether or not you need to add

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.340 
have and whether or not you need to add
limited-slip<00:01:03.059> additive<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> actually

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
limited-slip additive which is actually

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.280 
limited-slip additive which is actually
like<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.530> friction<00:01:04.769> modifier<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.840> has<00:01:07.020> all<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
like a friction modifier it has all the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.420 
like a friction modifier it has all the
codes<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.619> pretty<00:01:10.680> sure<00:01:11.010> these<00:01:11.100> 1/2

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
codes on it so I'm pretty sure these 1/2

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.770 
codes on it so I'm pretty sure these 1/2
inch<00:01:11.640> bolts<00:01:11.970> we're<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> take<00:01:12.479> all<00:01:12.659> those

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
inch bolts we're going to take all those

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.499 
inch bolts we're going to take all those
off<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.619> take<00:01:14.520> differential<00:01:15.150> I'll<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.390> what

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
off and take differential I'll see what

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.929 
off and take differential I'll see what
the<00:01:15.600> fluid<00:01:15.840> looks<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:17.009> truck<00:01:17.280> has<00:01:17.580> just

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the fluid looks like this truck has just

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.999 
the fluid looks like this truck has just
over<00:01:18.360> 80,000<00:01:19.140> miles<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.860> never

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
over 80,000 miles on it and it's never

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.620 
over 80,000 miles on it and it's never
been<00:01:20.189> changed<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.880> I'd<00:01:21.000> imagine<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.509> going

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
been changed so I'd imagine it's going

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.990 
been changed so I'd imagine it's going
to<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.780> pretty<00:01:21.930> nasty<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:23.400> move<00:01:23.700> all<00:01:23.850> those

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to be pretty nasty but move all those

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.850 
to be pretty nasty but move all those
bolts<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> top<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.740> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
bolts out of the top one in just so that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.370 
bolts out of the top one in just so that
the<00:01:26.630> differential<00:01:27.630> cover<00:01:27.780> doesn't<00:01:28.049> fall<00:01:28.290> in

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the differential cover doesn't fall in

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
the differential cover doesn't fall in
the<00:01:28.439> bucket<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> lightly<00:01:30.240> tap<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the bucket and you want to lightly tap a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.460 
the bucket and you want to lightly tap a
screwdriver<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.340> differential<00:01:33.259> then<00:01:34.259> pry

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
screwdriver on the differential then pry

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.969 
screwdriver on the differential then pry
it<00:01:34.530> open

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it open

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.289 
it open
get<00:01:35.369> all<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> fluid<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.740> then<00:01:37.740> take<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.310> top

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
get all the fluid out then take that top

get all the fluid out then take that top
bolt<00:01:39.570> out<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.700> then<00:01:41.700> I'll<00:01:41.820> show<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.210> we

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
bolt out and then I'll show you what we

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
bolt out and then I'll show you what we
do<00:01:42.360> bet<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:42.990> peel<00:01:43.259> off<00:01:43.439> all<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> old<00:01:43.860> RTV
