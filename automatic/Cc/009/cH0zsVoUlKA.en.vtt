 4 The word today is Bike Mate Slim launch additional tipping bypass 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.310
 I think there are a lot of people who are curious about Dream Cue. 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.270
 Let me give you an explanation of how we have changed with the trial. 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.630
 I got it. 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.280
 Now let's move on. The first feature is the click-to-touch film 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.820
 You guys 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.670
 Days, even now do not you have one weak feature in our products, 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.010
 The touch reacts with the smartphone. 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.499
 Of course, this phenomenon pilriah inspiration or something to play in domestic cases was good 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.949
 There was a sticking phenomenon of smartphone . 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:51.510
 Well, if I write it down now , it would be bypass. 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.859
 That is, the film becomes thicker and easier. 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.870
 The impression is gone 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:01:01.979
 So I used to be in the case of the smartphone l when I was a little uncomfortable. 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.749
 As you can see now, it 's too wet to pull out again. 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.749
 This is the biggest difference. 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:15.080
 Now, four second 4 As you can see you now 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.770
 In our case, we have no case in the example and you start to figure it out. 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.420
 It would have been hard. 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.500
 But now we have no worries because we make it in two sizes 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.680
 because of 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.680
 Uh, you guys are cutting down on the iPhone right now . 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.970
 Galaxy s seconds is the web rice 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.080
 You can not think of sci as a small smartphone. 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:48.300
 Yes, I usually do 3.5 to 5 inches to live. 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.020
 It is suitable for s size . 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.940
 50 won 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.500
 Now I can guess a little loose eojil This website from the fourth 4.5 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.170
 I'll be up to an inch. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.540
 In the past, but we've added do not like to write poetry Galaxy s kisses 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.570
 Now it's good to go in and out of the case. 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.720
 You're going to have a lot of Japanese books on the 9th. 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.170
 1 iPhone s modern necessity too thick 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:19.080
 But what size should I buy in this case? 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:24.600
 Yes I will be going for that on the iPhone, for example the thin 8t case 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:29.220
 If you do not have a good experience in the case of a good one, the size of the bass is good 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:34.560
 Inde heard the case, for example, silicon Carrick million jobs and self-shaved so 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:39.030
 When you are working on a thick case , even if you use the site is right 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.920
 It is better to establish the size of the opinion that subtracts 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.670
 Three times . Yes. Our products are down here. 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:53.160
 There are two holes that we are now back sound Can I view him support 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:57.680
 You said we have to wait upon hearing the charge, neither half or music 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.680
 I got out of the hole and I went through the hole. 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.200
 Air holes in the here and now stretched under the same site on the side we see a product or two 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.330
 I did. 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:13.800
 Oh dwaeseo those charged under No. 80, even if such a galaxy called the iPhone only that 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:18.900
 I think I can short- circuit those things that the battery can discharge when I use it for a long time. 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:23.700
 Then, because the bottom hole is important for you to call on your smartphone 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:28.260
 I do not get a phone call like this , 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.890
 It's a system that we can not do at once, 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.760
 Listen to music then because I can not get open for 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.800

 You can hear it from the built-in speaker as obt you see now 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.200
 The third time I'll try it. Yes. 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:55.650
 Ahhh 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:04:00.510
 4 It 's a good time to get out of the sound of the sound in this book. 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:05.480
 Maybe this is music, and you can ride on the quiet bike road. 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.480
 You do not have a world economy to listen alone . 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:17.730
 What I do is under partial music came out perforated top've written earphones 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.680
 You can give the same, but this is dangerous in some circumstances. 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:25.050
 Please refrain 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.310

 Uh, uh, professor. Actually, battery charge is not possible. 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.660
 Most bakgo such that one battery pack board chair is also free, I've 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:51.130
 4 because there are three people who will have it. 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:55.240
 If I look at one of them , I never do it with the iPhone . 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:59.890
 It's surprisingly long at runtime . 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.900
 2 When I used my smartphone or i-hall , 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.470
 Quickly concentrate 1 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:11.080

 l Size x You do not get in when you rest 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:42.790
 Close to our offline because the law we are not leaving early interference 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:48.940

 In addition, I walked in and closed it in front of the smartphone during exercise, 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:25.699
 We put a strap ring on it so you can hang around. 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:29.179
 It is also a part that you consider to be more convenient to use. 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:32.749
