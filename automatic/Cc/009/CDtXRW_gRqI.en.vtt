00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
direction this was for the actual cut

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
direction this was for the actual cut
that<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.330> had<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.470> um<00:01:11.659> this<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.840> made<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that I had but um this just made it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
that I had but um this just made it
easier<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.500> me<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:14.040> was<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.490> good<00:01:14.760> height<00:01:14.970> my

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
easier for me it was a good height my

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.670 
easier for me it was a good height my
own<00:01:15.720> son<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:17.180> 39<00:01:18.180> inches<00:01:18.570> tall<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:18.840> 38<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
own son is 39 inches tall so 38 and a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.340 
own son is 39 inches tall so 38 and a
half<00:01:19.830> inches<00:01:20.189> obviously<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.420> goes<00:01:21.900> around<00:01:22.140> his

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
half inches obviously it goes around his

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.380 
half inches obviously it goes around his
neck<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.400> little<00:01:23.670> bit<00:01:23.790> long<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.270> him

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
neck so it's a little bit long for him

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.140 
neck so it's a little bit long for him
at<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.630> point<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:25.920> sure<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> next

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
at this point but I'm sure in the next

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
at this point but I'm sure in the next
year<00:01:27.330> or<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> perfect<00:01:28.229> height

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
year or so this will be a perfect height

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.819 
year or so this will be a perfect height
and<00:01:29.600> where<00:01:30.600> he<00:01:30.810> isn't<00:01:31.110> really<00:01:31.229> dressing<00:01:31.680> up

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and where he isn't really dressing up

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.710 
and where he isn't really dressing up
yet<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.280> gonna<00:01:33.090> work<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.600> me<00:01:35.210> for<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
yet this is gonna work for me for the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.620 
yet this is gonna work for me for the
width<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.890> I'm<00:01:38.189> comparing<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> width

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

fabric<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.790> how<00:01:47.939> why<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.840> want<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
fabric up and see how why do you want it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.539 
fabric up and see how why do you want it
to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.500> child's<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:50.220> child<00:01:50.430> is

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
to be on your child's if your child is

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.859 
to be on your child's if your child is
bigger<00:01:50.729> you're<00:01:50.939> probably<00:01:51.180> gonna<00:01:51.450> wanna<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.780> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
bigger you're probably gonna wanna do it

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.920 
bigger you're probably gonna wanna do it
a<00:01:51.930> little<00:01:52.020> different<00:01:53.329> but<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> way<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:54.810> me

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
a little different but the way for me

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.260 
a little different but the way for me
was<00:01:55.100> 20<00:01:56.100> inches<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.610> I'm<00:01:56.700> gonna<00:01:56.850> cut<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> here

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
was 20 inches that I'm gonna cut it here

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.260 
was 20 inches that I'm gonna cut it here
and<00:01:58.790> rather<00:01:59.790> than<00:02:01.520> rather<00:02:02.520> than<00:02:02.759> cut<00:02:02.969> straight

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and rather than rather than cut straight

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.210 
and rather than rather than cut straight
down<00:02:03.540> here<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> did<00:02:06.680> where<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> other<00:02:07.979> one

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
down here what I did where the other one

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.430 
down here what I did where the other one
was<00:02:08.340> folded<00:02:08.819> over<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.420> cut<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.289> could

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
was folded over and cut so that I could

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.550 
was folded over and cut so that I could
follow<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.009> natural<00:02:11.160> line<00:02:11.750> over<00:02:12.750> here<00:02:12.780> most

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
follow the natural line over here most

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.809 
follow the natural line over here most
just<00:02:13.739> being<00:02:13.920> lazy<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.280> mean<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.550> can<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.760> it

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
just being lazy I mean you can do it

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.650 
just being lazy I mean you can do it
however<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.090> want<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:17.300> hearing<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.360> might<00:02:18.510> have

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
it folded over you can see and I've

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.589 
it folded over you can see and I've
measured<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:22.080> 10<00:02:22.349> inches<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.860> course

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
measured out 10 inches because of course

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.330 
measured out 10 inches because of course
half<00:02:24.599> of<00:02:24.810> 20<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.530> 10

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
half of 20 is 10

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.180 
half of 20 is 10
you've<00:02:27.000> got<00:02:27.150> your<00:02:27.239> natural<00:02:27.360> hold<00:02:27.980> your<00:02:28.980> fold

quarter<00:02:57.989> circle<00:02:58.319> here<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:59.220> it'll<00:02:59.370> be

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
quarter circle here and then it'll be

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.860 
quarter circle here and then it'll be
even<00:02:59.760> on<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.120> other<00:03:00.239> side<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.630> it'll<00:03:00.750> look

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
even on the other side so it'll look

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.000 
even on the other side so it'll look
exactly<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.410> same<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:03.500> let<00:03:04.500> me<00:03:04.590> show<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
one that i embroidered lined up next to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.630 
one that i embroidered lined up next to
it<00:03:14.220> as<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:14.580> see<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.849> is<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> pretty<00:03:15.269> small

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
it as you can see this is a pretty small

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.039 
it as you can see this is a pretty small
small<00:03:17.640> cut<00:03:17.880> you're<00:03:18.060> making<00:03:18.450> it's<00:03:18.600> not<00:03:18.780> huge

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
small cut you're making it's not huge

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.920 
small cut you're making it's not huge
but<00:03:19.109> it's<00:03:19.380> big<00:03:19.530> enough<00:03:20.209> at<00:03:21.209> least<00:03:21.420> for<00:03:21.600> my<00:03:21.720> son

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
but it's big enough at least for my son

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.470 
but it's big enough at least for my son

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
at this point so I'm just gonna follow

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.720 
at this point so I'm just gonna follow
this<00:03:24.690> around<00:03:24.959> if<00:03:25.620> you're<00:03:25.950> having<00:03:26.280> any

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
this around if you're having any

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.390 
this around if you're having any
question<00:03:27.420> about<00:03:27.570> how<00:03:27.690> too<00:03:27.750> big<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.109> do<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.530> make

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
question about how too big to do it make

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.910 
question about how too big to do it make
it<00:03:29.549> small<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:29.880> then<00:03:30.329> make<00:03:31.079> it<00:03:31.109> bigger<00:03:31.380> if<00:03:31.709> it

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
it small and then make it bigger if it

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.059 
it small and then make it bigger if it
doesn't<00:03:32.190> fit<00:03:32.340> it's<00:03:32.850> pretty<00:03:33.060> easy<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.450> cut<00:03:33.630> it's

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
doesn't fit it's pretty easy to cut it's

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.479 
doesn't fit it's pretty easy to cut it's
not<00:03:35.069> easy<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.489> put<00:03:35.670> fabric<00:03:35.970> back<00:03:36.120> together<00:03:37.489> so

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
not easy to put fabric back together so

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.780 
not easy to put fabric back together so
I'm<00:03:38.579> just<00:03:38.760> gonna<00:03:38.880> take<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.340> very

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790

use red or white thread is white so this

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.230 
use red or white thread is white so this
is<00:05:51.890> what<00:05:52.040> I<00:05:52.070> did<00:05:52.250> with<00:05:52.400> my<00:05:52.520> other<00:05:52.550> one<00:05:52.820> is<00:05:53.090> I

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
is what I did with my other one is I

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.900 
is what I did with my other one is I
have<00:05:53.270> it<00:05:53.570> vertically<00:05:54.470> here<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.919> horizontally

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
have it vertically here and horizontally

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.210 
have it vertically here and horizontally
on<00:05:56.000> this<00:05:56.150> side<00:05:56.360> obviously<00:05:57.200> you're<00:05:57.650> doing

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
on this side obviously you're doing

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.279 
on this side obviously you're doing
opposite<00:05:58.700> sides<00:05:58.910> so<00:05:59.479> I'm<00:05:59.570> just<00:05:59.720> gonna<00:05:59.840> throw

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
opposite sides so I'm just gonna throw

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.580 
opposite sides so I'm just gonna throw
them<00:06:00.470> on<00:06:00.590> the<00:06:00.770> same<00:06:00.950> way<00:06:01.160> I<00:06:01.400> use<00:06:02.169> cheap<00:06:03.169> velcro

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
and the reason I did that is because I

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.680 
and the reason I did that is because I
didn't<00:06:07.190> want<00:06:07.340> it<00:06:07.370> to<00:06:07.520> stick<00:06:07.789> to<00:06:07.820> well<00:06:08.270> I<00:06:08.479> have

didn't want it to stick to well I have
some<00:06:08.870> great<00:06:09.020> diaper<00:06:09.260> velcro<00:06:09.800> it<00:06:10.039> will<00:06:10.250> hold

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
some great diaper velcro it will hold

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.550 
some great diaper velcro it will hold
like<00:06:11.750> nobody's<00:06:12.169> business

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
like nobody's business

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.610 
like nobody's business
and<00:06:12.830> I<00:06:13.490> do<00:06:13.669> not<00:06:14.000> want<00:06:14.300> this<00:06:14.900> to<00:06:15.080> hold<00:06:15.260> that<00:06:15.440> well

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.969 
and I do not want this to hold that well
my<00:06:15.919> son<00:06:16.240> likes<00:06:17.500> to<00:06:18.500> have<00:06:18.590> control<00:06:18.950> over

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 
my son likes to have control over

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.350 
my son likes to have control over
whether<00:06:19.280> he<00:06:19.370> can<00:06:19.550> take<00:06:19.700> things<00:06:19.880> off<00:06:20.030> and<00:06:20.270> on

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
whether he can take things off and on

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.940 
whether he can take things off and on
and<00:06:20.510> this<00:06:20.660> is<00:06:20.810> something<00:06:21.200> I<00:06:21.380> want<00:06:21.590> him<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:21.860> be

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
and this is something I want him to be

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.740 
and this is something I want him to be
able<00:06:22.039> to<00:06:22.160> have<00:06:22.340> control<00:06:22.669> over<00:06:22.700> and<00:06:23.300> also<00:06:23.630> just

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
able to have control over and also just

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.080 
able to have control over and also just
in<00:06:23.870> case<00:06:24.080> again<00:06:24.650> they<00:06:25.099> get<00:06:25.250> something<00:06:25.430> trapped

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
in case again they get something trapped

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.320 
in case again they get something trapped
in<00:06:26.240> a<00:06:26.300> door<00:06:26.510> or<00:06:27.520> you<00:06:28.520> know<00:06:28.610> another<00:06:28.849> kid<00:06:29.090> pulls

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
in a door or you know another kid pulls

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.170 
in a door or you know another kid pulls
on<00:06:29.510> it<00:06:29.660> it<00:06:29.750> just<00:06:29.870> pops<00:06:30.110> right<00:06:30.320> off<00:06:30.380> so<00:06:31.310> that's

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
on it it just pops right off so that's

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.909 
on it it just pops right off so that's
what<00:06:32.270> I<00:06:32.330> recommend<00:06:32.479> again<00:06:33.050> you<00:06:33.200> can<00:06:33.349> do<00:06:33.800> what

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 
what I recommend again you can do what

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.770 
what I recommend again you can do what
you<00:06:34.039> want<00:06:34.220> there's<00:06:35.150> probably<00:06:35.450> some<00:06:35.599> other

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
you want there's probably some other

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.850 
you want there's probably some other
ways<00:06:35.960> to<00:06:35.990> put<00:06:36.440> on<00:06:36.760> these<00:06:37.760> things<00:06:37.820> I<00:06:38.860> was

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
ways to put on these things I was

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.170 
ways to put on these things I was
thinking<00:06:39.919> if<00:06:40.250> you<00:06:40.340> have<00:06:40.490> like<00:06:40.640> a<00:06:40.700> double<00:06:41.000> sided

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
thinking if you have like a double sided

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.700 
thinking if you have like a double sided
clip<00:06:41.660> you<00:06:41.900> could<00:06:42.050> probably<00:06:42.229> just<00:06:42.410> get<00:06:42.680> a

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
clip you could probably just get a

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.800 
clip you could probably just get a
little<00:06:42.890> clip<00:06:43.160> clip<00:06:43.669> it<00:06:43.820> here<00:06:44.090> on<00:06:44.240> one<00:06:44.390> side<00:06:44.419> and

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
little clip clip it here on one side and

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.089 
little clip clip it here on one side and
then<00:06:44.900> have<00:06:45.080> the<00:06:45.200> other<00:06:45.260> clip<00:06:45.590> clip<00:06:45.830> onto<00:06:45.979> a

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
then have the other clip clip onto a

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:48.100 
then have the other clip clip onto a
shirt<00:06:46.400> that<00:06:46.669> might<00:06:47.210> work<00:06:47.390> great<00:06:47.419> as<00:06:47.750> well<00:06:47.930> and

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
shirt that might work great as well and

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.810 
shirt that might work great as well and
actually<00:06:48.530> wouldn't<00:06:48.860> go<00:06:48.950> around<00:06:49.130> their<00:06:49.280> neck

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
actually wouldn't go around their neck

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.750 
actually wouldn't go around their neck
in<00:06:50.000> that<00:06:50.030> case<00:06:50.360> so<00:06:51.349> um<00:06:51.590> there's<00:06:52.520> some<00:06:52.640> ideas

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
in that case so um there's some ideas
