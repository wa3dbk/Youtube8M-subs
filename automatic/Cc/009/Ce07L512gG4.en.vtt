approach<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.430> rock<00:02:14.640> music<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.480> think<00:02:15.690> this

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
approach to rock music and I think this

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.420 
approach to rock music and I think this
clarity<00:02:16.170> makes<00:02:16.410> their<00:02:16.590> mix<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.920> influences

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430

really<00:02:17.640> obvious<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.210> time<00:02:18.450> around<00:02:18.660> too<00:02:18.900> and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
really obvious this time around too and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.680 
really obvious this time around too and
in<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.320> good<00:02:19.470> way<00:02:19.650> pop<00:02:20.340> rock<00:02:20.670> psychedelic<00:02:21.210> pop

piano<00:02:22.350> rock<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.890> think<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.130> little<00:02:23.250> bit<00:02:23.370> of

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
piano rock and I think a little bit of

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.060 
piano rock and I think a little bit of
progressive<00:02:24.030> rock<00:02:24.210> too<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.020> song<00:02:25.380> 23

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
progressive rock too with the song 23

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.160 
progressive rock too with the song 23
the<00:02:26.190> only<00:02:26.430> instrumental<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.960> album

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
the only instrumental on this album

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.140 
the only instrumental on this album
sounding<00:02:28.740> exactly<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:29.580> something<00:02:29.820> Pink

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
sounding exactly like something Pink

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.700 
sounding exactly like something Pink
Floyd<00:02:30.510> would<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:30.960> done<00:02:31.170> with<00:02:31.500> some<00:02:31.620> really

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
Floyd would have done with some really

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.560 
Floyd would have done with some really
epic<00:02:32.160> guitar<00:02:32.250> soloing<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.090> some<00:02:33.270> slow

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
epic guitar soloing and some slow

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
drumming ethereal piano keys the only

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.360 
drumming ethereal piano keys the only
real<00:02:36.330> downside<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.290> track<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.980> it

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
real downside to this track is that it

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.640 
real downside to this track is that it
doesn't<00:02:38.910> really<00:02:39.180> fit<00:02:39.600> in<00:02:39.930> with<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.350> flow<00:02:40.620> of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
doesn't really fit in with the flow of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.110 
doesn't really fit in with the flow of
the<00:02:40.890> rest<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> album<00:02:41.700> which<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.940> pretty

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
the rest of the album which is pretty

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.450 
the rest of the album which is pretty
much<00:02:42.210> just<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.780> very<00:02:43.110> nice<00:02:43.320> mixed<00:02:43.860> bag<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.070> pop

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460
