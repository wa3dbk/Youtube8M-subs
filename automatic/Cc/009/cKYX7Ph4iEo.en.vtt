00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.930
 the big work of this duplex has 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.510
 obviously been to revisit entirely 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.920
 the distribution of spaces but also 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.480
 the circulations 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.740
 so we did not have any 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.270
 this configuration you go 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.590
 recognize a number of 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.000
 metal beams that can you 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.640
 give clues to the fact that we have 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.950
 open partitions and we revisited 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.040
 space we had rather a system to 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.570
 the old limit 19th century division 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.489
 alas we have sought of course 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.870
 it was to get a very good kitchen 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.910
 open to a dining room but who 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.949
 does not look too much like a kitchen for 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.050
 as much while being ultra functional 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.640
 and on which we have for example 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.890
 worked a lot on small 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.120
 details that take tomorrow speed bumps 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.609
 drawers interior fittings 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.359
 worktop plant coating 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.760
 a lot of little things that make 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.149
 precisely the quality of all this 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.149
 apartment 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.350
 a rather sculptural staircase but everything 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.390
 in simplicity that will bring him to 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.400
 dairy is a staircase or by 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.560
 example we worked 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.479
 take tomorrow e 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.549
 inside the partition with a 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.040
 lighting inside the kind of 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.689
 small detail each step is suspended 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.340
 she is hooked on the part 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.720
 porters of the apartment 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.729
 so we have a real impression of 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.619
 lightness and therefore in the concern of the 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.009
 detail one more time we married a 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.439
 raw material like steel that is 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.140
 slightly oxidized with ultra definition 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.820
 smooth ultra finished like for example 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.679
 mirror lakes or things like these 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.110
 another in terms of the distribution of 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.789
 spaces this kitchen she marks the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.179
 second sequence between the room to 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.450
 eat 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.520
 the kitchen island via a door 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.450
 sliding which she will give the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.450
 division between an office of choice as 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.880
 so here you have an office with a 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.560
 computer or a living room in which 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.569
 we can actually be in TV mode 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.890
 since today a screen 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.049
 computer is also a television 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.549
 when you receive friends just 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.739
 simply slide this slider 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.180
 or here again the attention to detail the rail 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.569
 is built inside the fake 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.670
 ceiling 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.200
 taking hand and custom there 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.030
 no handle button that we brought back 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.470
 outside we will find a certain 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.810
 number of amenities that are 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.609
 mixed kitchen or half 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.470
 half offices that are also the 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.970
 composition of the stairs all these 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.500
 facilities supposedly great way all 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.049
 quite natural without giving 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.299
 obligatorily the destination of their 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.829
 functions we did not want to show that 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.069
 it was cooking so it was 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.069
 office 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.010
 he also pushed the particular detail 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.950
 for example in this small salon which in 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.780
 half zain cases just by breaking 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.340
 the big sofa side as we can 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.160
 find a little bit everywhere and to get 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.710
 find on two to six much more 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.190
 light 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.680
 there for the blow of the furniture with 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.180
 instead of a television what you 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.470
 have in my back and between you and me 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.470
 it's still really cool
