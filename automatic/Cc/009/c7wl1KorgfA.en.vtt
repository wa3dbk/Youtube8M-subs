 so winning this prestigious match 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.640

 world cup and preparation the 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.200
 pre-cut period of the world also with 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.340
 the mails the friendly matches so and 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.200
 then it is to resume contact with

 the audience after these strong emotions that 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.620
 we have lived very strong and intense with 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:52.180
 this qualification on November 19th the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.820
 stage will be full so here at the 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.100
 looking to live strong emotions 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.930
 even though the context will not be the 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.640
 marc obviously that list there for 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.800
 the month of March she will be very 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.560
 important as it should be to 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.170
 every game but hey there plus the most 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.420
 important it will be that of the month of 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.149
 may or rather the world of June since 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.310
 the official debt for fifa that's 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.880
 to play a little bit of June for the 23 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.299
 who will represent France at the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.759
 world cup so yes a lot of 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.639
 of excitement a lot of two debates and 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.209
 then it's going to go faster in 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:34.389
 increasing again as and when 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:35.709
 we are getting closer to this competition 

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:37.450
 I'm not here to make 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.520
 surprises the one who makes surprises 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.740
 establish a white and red 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.529
 he has a beard and his name is father 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.060
 Christmas so I have no obligation to 

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:47.409
 to make surprises 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.819
 which does not mean that I'm not going 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.020
 not at last I'm because 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.590
 it's a surprise I'm going to make 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.029
 choices that are going to be definitely 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.979
 complicated they are usually there 

00:01:55.029 --> 00:02:02.619
 a little more if I feel that there is 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.689
 a player who did not come to my team 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.370
 eyes can bring something more 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.740
 to this group 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.660
 I will do it but I have no 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.000
 of obligations neither moral nor sporting 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.760
 to do it we lived something 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.340
 extraordinary 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.260
 November 19th with this qualification 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.390
 the days that preceded also where there 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.180
 had really had a very supportive 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.150
 important from the public 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.879
 this communion at the end of the match was 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.430
 a very strong moment so in order 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.019
 general the Stade de France is very 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.430
 very well filled there it's true of 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.739
 meet the Netherlands the quality 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.349
 and the prestige of this opponent make 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.870
 that the posted even more beautiful 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.840
 but there are a lot of legs and who 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.909
 are waiting like we say ok we live 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.030
 like us and we have a duty there 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.239
 above also to make live and 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.290

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.290
