and here we go this we got the back here
and<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.270> don't<00:01:03.510> actually<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.199> battery

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and so you don't actually use a battery

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.770 
and so you don't actually use a battery
cover<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> back<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.600> like<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
cover this is just the back it's like a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.789 
cover this is just the back it's like a
TPU<00:01:07.229> case<00:01:07.619> say<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.630> rubbery<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.780> case<00:01:10.049> it's

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
TPU case say a rubbery in case it's

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.920 
TPU case say a rubbery in case it's
pretty<00:01:11.040> nice<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.549> fits<00:01:11.820> kind<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.330> snug<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
pretty nice it fits kind of snug it's a

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.520 
pretty nice it fits kind of snug it's a
little<00:01:13.170> loose<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:14.970> horrible<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.570> for

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
little loose it's not horrible but for

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.679 
little loose it's not horrible but for
the<00:01:16.590> price<00:01:16.830> tag<00:01:17.100> 30<00:01:17.670> bucks<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.119> Amazon<00:01:18.540> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the price tag 30 bucks on Amazon you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.100 
the price tag 30 bucks on Amazon you
can't<00:01:18.930> beat<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
can't beat it

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.170 
can't beat it
so<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:21.800> look<00:01:21.980> at<00:01:22.010> the<00:01:22.130> battery<00:01:22.460> itself<00:01:22.910> it's

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
so you look at the battery itself it's

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.170 
so you look at the battery itself it's
quite<00:01:23.450> large

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
quite large

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.640 
quite large
it's<00:01:26.180> about<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.510> size<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.870> three<00:01:27.260> batteries

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
it's about the size of three batteries

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.830 
it's about the size of three batteries
and<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:28.220> is<00:01:28.370> literally<00:01:28.850> larger<00:01:29.600> than<00:01:29.750> the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
and it is literally larger than the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.470 
and it is literally larger than the
three<00:01:30.020> batteries<00:01:30.350> physically<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.460> in<00:01:31.760> the

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
three batteries physically and in the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.020 
three batteries physically and in the
milliamp<00:01:33.100> 7000<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:34.340> it's<00:01:34.490> actually<00:01:35.380> just<00:01:36.380> over

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
milliamp 7000 so it's actually just over

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.360 
milliamp 7000 so it's actually just over
three<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.320> is<00:01:39.320> almost<00:01:39.650> three<00:01:39.980> and<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.130> quarter

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
three and is almost three and a quarter

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.790 
three and is almost three and a quarter
times<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.420> regular<00:01:41.600> size<00:01:41.870> battery<00:01:42.620> in<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
times the regular size battery in the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.090 
times the regular size battery in the
stock<00:01:43.070> as<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:44.000> can<00:01:44.150> see<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.230> stock<00:01:45.560> batteries

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
stock as you can see the stock batteries

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.610 
stock as you can see the stock batteries
right<00:01:46.340> here<00:01:46.580> it's<00:01:46.850> quite<00:01:47.180> thin<00:01:47.510> even<00:01:48.230> compared

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
right here it's quite thin even compared

00:01:48.620 --> 00:02:02.710 
right here it's quite thin even compared
to<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:50.780> TPU<00:01:51.140> case<00:02:01.300> all<00:02:02.300> right<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:02.630> I'm

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
to the the TPU case all right so I'm

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:23.800 
to the the TPU case all right so I'm
gonna<00:02:02.810> go<00:02:03.050> ahead<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.440> turn<00:02:03.590> off<00:02:03.650> my<00:02:03.979> galaxy<00:02:04.490> s3

times<00:03:43.489> okay<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:45.060> battery<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.690> 7,000

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
times okay so this battery is 7,000

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.160 
times okay so this battery is 7,000

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
milliamps the capacity of the hyperion

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.430 
milliamps the capacity of the hyperion
is<00:03:49.800> 4,200<00:03:50.550> milliamps<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.720> actually<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.350> one

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
is 4,200 milliamps this actually is one

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.030 
is 4,200 milliamps this actually is one
millimeter<00:03:53.100> larger<00:03:53.730> than<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.940> hyperion<00:03:54.540> and

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
millimeter larger than the hyperion and

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.410 
millimeter larger than the hyperion and
really<00:03:56.040> in<00:03:56.220> my<00:03:56.459> opinion<00:03:56.820> that's<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.090> hell<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.269> a

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
really in my opinion that's a hell of a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.530 
really in my opinion that's a hell of a
trade-off<00:03:57.690> that's<00:03:58.140> great<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:59.420> love<00:04:00.420> this

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
trade-off that's great I love this

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.259 
trade-off that's great I love this
battery<00:04:00.959> compared<00:04:01.650> with<00:04:01.739> Iberia<00:04:02.160> I'm<00:04:02.640> very

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
battery compared with Iberia I'm very

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.140 
battery compared with Iberia I'm very
satisfied<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:05.400> actually<00:04:05.850> it's<00:04:05.940> only<00:04:06.000> about

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
satisfied and actually it's only about

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.400 
satisfied and actually it's only about
eight<00:04:06.390> dollars<00:04:06.540> for<00:04:06.720> more<00:04:06.900> expensive

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
eight dollars for more expensive

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.350 
eight dollars for more expensive
I<00:04:07.560> think<00:04:08.010> it's<00:04:08.130> 34<00:04:08.519> dollars<00:04:08.819> on<00:04:08.970> Amazon<00:04:09.330> right

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
I think it's 34 dollars on Amazon right

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.800 
I think it's 34 dollars on Amazon right
now<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:10.040> got<00:04:11.040> 430<00:04:11.519> when<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.790> came<00:04:11.940> out<00:04:12.180> but

they've<00:04:12.959> been<00:04:13.050> raising<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.440> price<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.680> lot<00:04:13.980> if

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
probably jump on it now because they've

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.330 
probably jump on it now because they've
been<00:04:17.519> raising<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.910> price<00:04:18.120> like<00:04:18.359> constantly
