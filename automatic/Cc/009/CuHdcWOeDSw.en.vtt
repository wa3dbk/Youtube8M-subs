00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.160
 Know what equipment your everything is 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.540
 you should have had 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.169
 Clothes are clearly there you have to be good 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.730
 ausschauen 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.990
 it is not about speed or 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.990
 anything else but just 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.090
 I would use all his courage now 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.920
 say I'm right , for example 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.179
 hard beats but for beginners so that 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.860
 the softer plasters have a bit 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.390
 better feeling has bonding technically 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.769
 There is not much to say 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.629
 just try a little with the 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.840
 Bust what you bought in the bond 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.610
 get in and look like you are 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.200
 of course, quality must also be felt 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.440
 Be careful that somehow 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.210
 Immediately break or snowboard there 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.320
 You have to stop the binding 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.190
 Look at it that you get it right 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.750
 mounted best I have with +18 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.079
 minus 18 degrees angle 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.460
 that's just if you also switch 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.440
 So you want that you drive backwards so 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.509
 the wrong direction and there size 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.580
 would have to be up to the nose between 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.069
 nose and lip about the size 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.860
 about or nose and chin the biggest 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.229
 it must be about as high and then as 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.000
 You feel very soft boards 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.800
 also is quite good because stiff boards 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.700
 are more like if you are just big 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.700
 kicker would drive 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.179
 Because of the attitude there you have to stop 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:40.170
 You can only look for the first time 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:43.140
 find out by asking for rent and then 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.659
 says a study stop and with the foot 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.969
 with which you 're on the front stop 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.409
 he is then in principle the front 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.630
 So if football now in the left 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.340
 foot would stop then that is called 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.530
 Stop in the right foot 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.939
 mainly as the groove so 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.979
 only with the attitude look that one 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.989
 just pretty much goes to the knee 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.520
 Upper body to keep quite central 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.899
 head just look forward 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.209
 so you can of course look where you are 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.739
 breaks forth you have to know just 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.620
 Just keep the balance as if you were 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.239
 It's like slacklining 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.579
 would put a cord so it has to stop 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.079
 look a little bit like that 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.799
 makes a bit of the edges feel where 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.799
 they are like that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.989
 for beginners it is best if you 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.930
 fully in the grip makes it there so you 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.970
 just always always opposite 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.230
 direction ride does not drive curves 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.290
 because that's a bit at the beginning 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.849
 harder he just back and forth 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.340
 drive so that a bit the feeling 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.690
 of how that is to have a board and 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.670
 but at some point you can just 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.150
 try to drive the curves there must 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.799
 you just just lean in but 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.989
 not directly on the edge but one 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.629
 can slip a bit so that 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:59.230
 you slide down the mountain on the ridge 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:01.239
 so and not that you right the edge 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:08.170
 because you can only do that 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:10.060
 if you drive at full speed so because of 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.940
 helm I would definitely like one 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.890
 It is extremely important to wear a home 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.480
 especially at the beginning so you have to 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.959
 have no fear that uncool 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.680
 is definitely important and can be up 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.680
 be cool anyway
