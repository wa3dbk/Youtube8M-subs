you can have and you just can't get it
out<00:05:15.680> of<00:05:15.770> just<00:05:16.190> gotta<00:05:16.460> have<00:05:16.730> so<00:05:17.420> cheese<00:05:17.720> is<00:05:17.930> not

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
out of just gotta have so cheese is not

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.510 
out of just gotta have so cheese is not
one<00:05:18.350> of<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.500> things<00:05:18.650> I<00:05:18.800> just<00:05:18.830> have<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.370> have

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
one of the things I just have to have

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.370 
one of the things I just have to have
some<00:05:19.820> people<00:05:19.940> can<00:05:20.330> have<00:05:20.540> baloney<00:05:20.900> unless<00:05:21.260> it

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
some people can have baloney unless it

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.470 
some people can have baloney unless it
got<00:05:21.500> cheese<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:21.910> all<00:05:22.910> this<00:05:23.180> other<00:05:23.360> stuff

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
got cheese and all this other stuff

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.090 
got cheese and all this other stuff

unless you got cheese on it

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.430 
unless you got cheese on it
