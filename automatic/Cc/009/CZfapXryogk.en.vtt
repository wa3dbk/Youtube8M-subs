just carry on listening and I'll explain

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.840 
just carry on listening and I'll explain
we<00:00:15.389> need<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.660> know<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> main<00:00:17.190> skills<00:00:17.520> for

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
we need to know so the main skills for

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.980 
we need to know so the main skills for
this<00:00:17.970> build<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.480> archery<00:00:19.340> light<00:00:20.340> armor<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
this build is archery light armor and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.990 
this build is archery light armor and
alchemy<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:23.039> might<00:00:23.189> possibly<00:00:23.400> get<00:00:23.789> one

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
alchemy and we might possibly get one

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
alchemy and we might possibly get one
perk<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.449> smithing<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:24.960> I'll<00:00:25.380> explain<00:00:25.680> why

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
perk in smithing and I'll explain why

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.460 
perk in smithing and I'll explain why
later<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> archery<00:00:27.689> skill<00:00:27.990> allows<00:00:28.289> us

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
later on so the archery skill allows us

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.870 
later on so the archery skill allows us
to<00:00:28.619> use<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.769> crossbows<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.580> their<00:00:29.699> full

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
to use the crossbows at their full

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.179 
to use the crossbows at their full
potential<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> alchemy<00:00:31.590> allows<00:00:31.920> us<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
potential so the alchemy allows us to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.510 
potential so the alchemy allows us to
create<00:00:32.340> poisons<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.660> important<00:00:34.170> because

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
create poisons this is important because

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
create poisons this is important because
with<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> crossbow<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.540> about<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.020> high

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
with the crossbow it's all about a high

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.069 
with the crossbow it's all about a high
damage<00:00:37.680> bolt<00:00:38.190> that's<00:00:39.180> very<00:00:39.480> slow<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.719> reload

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
damage bolt that's very slow to reload

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
damage bolt that's very slow to reload
much<00:00:40.469> slower<00:00:40.710> than<00:00:40.770> bows<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.730> want<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> do

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
much slower than bows so you want to do

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
much slower than bows so you want to do
as<00:00:42.090> much<00:00:42.270> damage<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.719> possible<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.500> bolt

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
as much damage as possible with one bolt

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.400 
as much damage as possible with one bolt
so<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> poison<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.780> make<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
so you have the poison to make it do a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.880 
so you have the poison to make it do a
lot<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.739> damage<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.670> each<00:00:47.820> shot<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
lot more damage with each shot and

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
lot more damage with each shot and
finally<00:00:49.890> light<00:00:50.070> armor<00:00:50.460> allows<00:00:50.910> us<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.270> keep<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
finally light armor allows us to keep a

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.240 
finally light armor allows us to keep a
lot<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.020> stamina<00:00:52.260> than<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.860> were<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> use

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
lot more stamina than if we were to use

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.180 
lot more stamina than if we were to use
heavy<00:00:53.489> armor<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.690> important<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:56.039> when

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
heavy armor this is important for when

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
heavy armor this is important for when
you're<00:00:56.430> zooming<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.510> doing<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> slowing

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you're zooming in and doing the slowing

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.740 
you're zooming in and doing the slowing
down<00:00:58.350> time<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> archery<00:01:00.030> skill<00:01:00.270> ability

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
down time with the archery skill ability

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.810 
down time with the archery skill ability
just<00:01:01.440> gives<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> lot<00:01:02.070> more<00:01:02.100> flexibility

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
just gives you a lot more flexibility

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.649 
just gives you a lot more flexibility
and<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:04.140> lot<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.379> time<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> smithing

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and a lot more time so in the smithing

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.969 
and a lot more time so in the smithing
tree<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.080> might<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> first

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
tree you might want to get the first

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.520 
tree you might want to get the first
perk<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.090> allows<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.750> craft<00:01:10.080> steel

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
perk that allows you to craft steel

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.740 
perk that allows you to craft steel
weapons<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.310> armor<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.479> because

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
weapons and armor and this is because

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.320 
weapons and armor and this is because
you<00:01:12.869> don't<00:01:13.049> get<00:01:13.200> very<00:01:13.560> many<00:01:13.740> steel<00:01:14.549> bolts<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you don't get very many steel bolts that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.149 
you don't get very many steel bolts that
you<00:01:15.450> need<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.840> crossbow<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> best

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you need for the crossbow so the best

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.780 
you need for the crossbow so the best
way<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.530> by<00:01:19.640> crafting<00:01:20.640> them

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
way to get them is by crafting them

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.700 
way to get them is by crafting them
yourself<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.229> by<00:01:22.439> using

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
yourself and you can do that by using

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.969 
yourself and you can do that by using
one<00:01:23.070> stealing<00:01:23.400> got<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.200> one<00:01:25.200> firewood<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
one stealing got and one firewood and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.010 
one stealing got and one firewood and
that<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.310> create<00:01:26.430> ten<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.810> really

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that can create ten so you can really

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
that can create ten so you can really
create<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.320> lot<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.619> steel<00:01:28.799> bolts<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.189> from<00:01:29.640> a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
create a lot of steel bolts just from a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.749 
create a lot of steel bolts just from a
few<00:01:30.060> resources<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.040> perk<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.430> definitely

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
few resources so that perk is definitely

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.270 
few resources so that perk is definitely
worth<00:01:32.850> getting<00:01:33.299> now<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.470> race<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.979> doesn't

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
worth getting now as for race it doesn't

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.920 
worth getting now as for race it doesn't
really<00:01:35.400> matter<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.729> much<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.780> want

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
really matter that much but if you want

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630 
really matter that much but if you want
to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.140> archery<00:01:37.619> skill<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.189> quickly<00:01:38.430> as

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
to get archery skill up as quickly as

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.039 
to get archery skill up as quickly as
possible<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.479> will<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.750> your<00:01:39.869> main

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
possible because it will be your main

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
possible because it will be your main
offensive<00:01:40.560> skill<00:01:40.799> then<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.430> probably<00:01:41.759> want

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
offensive skill then you probably want

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.830

to choose a wood elf

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080 
to choose a wood elf

back<00:02:39.610> effect<00:02:40.240> so<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:42.100> really<00:02:42.400> need<00:02:42.580> this

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
back effect so you really need this

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.420 
back effect so you really need this
because<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.330> reload<00:02:43.690> on<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.470> crossbow<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.250> so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
because the reload on the crossbow is so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.660 
because the reload on the crossbow is so
slow<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:46.380> shoot<00:02:47.380> them<00:02:47.650> they<00:02:48.010> stag<00:02:48.310> out<00:02:48.490> which

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
slow you shoot them they stag out which

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.520 
slow you shoot them they stag out which
gives<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.000> enough<00:02:49.209> time<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.480> reload<00:02:50.020> and<00:02:50.320> then

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
gives you enough time to reload and then

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.190 
gives you enough time to reload and then
shoot<00:02:50.800> again<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:52.300> for<00:02:52.420> light<00:02:52.570> armor<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.080> need

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
shoot again so for light armor you need

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.770 
shoot again so for light armor you need

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
benefit of this as I said before is that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.220 
benefit of this as I said before is that
you<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.610> use<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.060> slow<00:03:13.270> down<00:03:13.510> time<00:03:13.780> ability

for much longer

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.520
