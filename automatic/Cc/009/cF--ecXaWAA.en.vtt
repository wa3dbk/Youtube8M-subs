00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.290

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.970
 direct race to discuss the program 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.200
 this wednesday have joined the quinté 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.550
 unfolds on auzat pronouns and here 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 Following my selection for this 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.730
 competition run under the formula 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.490
 handicap I placed in the lead number three 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 love angels who for his debut in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.460
 the big handicaps did not deserve 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.170
 getting a good second place in 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.150
 the walls of mezaubran wallace a 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.740
 proof of the same invoice on horseback certainly 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.050
 who does not have the experience of big names of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.060
 his rivals but he is called to succeed 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.410
 in such a society, moreover, 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.070
 impeccable watch since its beginnings 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.599
 in competition 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.369
 they depend greatly on yann marie 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.719
 porzier who won this race 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.140
 who needs it was ranked 3rd year 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.820
 latest 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 in my opinion it is a good basis that this 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.780
 number three angels of love I will ask 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 number 1 namely blue majorelle which has 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.690
 finished fifth in the race 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.460
 reference price the guales de mezaubran 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.559
 that day the horse finished well after 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.719
 have long waited and the 05 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.800
 also marquisette who finished 4th 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.079
 of this reference race 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.750
 after constantly galloping in good 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.219
 rank a confirmation and here is expected 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.629
 note that marchioness is performed at 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.670
 like a love game its debut 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.890
 in the handicaps that day the 3 the 1 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.379
 the 5 of their race reference 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.260
 then I pick up number 4 ken ferry 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.880
 who after collecting the good 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.110
 results on the steeple chase fell 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.560
 for his return on the brooms 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.659
 recently 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.610
 although it has not been reviewed since 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.070
 April this issue 4 which fery me 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.380
 seems able to redeem himself the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.430
 number 8 got andino from eric he's going 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.640
 make his debut in handicaps 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 but in dignified very seems to progress the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.400
 serious about his training and ken 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.650
 also a certain mistrust but 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.990
 worth 100 me 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.310
 be wary and dreaded this number 8 which 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.450
 will start however on the racecourse 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.000
 it's a handicap 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.470
 the number 12 the anthracite that leaked 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.950
 just posted some progress including 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.240
 on the compiegne test in principle 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.220
 which also starts at this level of 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.350
 competition on disability 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.640
 mistrust is the number 11 serena 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.410
 yonne who is still looking 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.580
 of a first victory but in my opinion 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.930
 in this lot it's a troublemaker in 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.700
 power it looks pretty good 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.560
 placed on the scale of values ​​and the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.630
 number 10 fiat lux in polish which has 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.970
 certainly a victory to his meter 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.010
 obtained in the races to claim but 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.360
 they seem to me at this weight capable of 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.190
 come spice up the reports of the quinté 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.170
 plus ciphered summary for this quinté in 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.899
 on the board I selected the 3 the wine on the 5th 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.940
 and then the 4 for the sides for the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.490
 places I advise you the 8th the 12th 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.470
 11 and say it following the program at 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.030
 auteuil in the second lesson believes bee 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.350
 ware finds a great opportunity to sign 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.150
 his first victory on the steeple 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.420
 chase a vibrator that just ran 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.070
 in a blacklist and that finds here 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.959
 an opposition a priori in his strings 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.120
 it's a first chance 103 bee ware 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.310
 who finds the opportunity to win 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.840
 in the 6th I like the 601 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.920
 extreme kara who just vain 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.810
 try in the price the barka a 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.730
 group test i if the opposition me 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.680
 to rise is extreme because disappointed true in 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.959
 not fighting for success so much 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.220
 that this horse is undefeated in two 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.110
 exits on the chair steeplechase 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.090
 it is better to give it a wide 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.800
 credit the opposition on the 6th believe the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.060
 gnaque one who owns one of 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.440
 better theoretical chances and of 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.450
 the test but lagunak effect a re-entry 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.680
 and remains to know his behavior for 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.150
 this contact recovery 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.980
 whatever it is the 6 we want 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
 also master matouta who is 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.100
 always presented wisely by 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.750
 donatien on lot of beauregard must 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.730
 also have a place on the podium 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.530
 concerning the 2 matters matches where you 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.820
 a pretty light-skinned mare 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.650
 and that is not really carrier to my 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.560
 opinion is the only downside this says his 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.360
 Courage must compensate 620,603 include 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.360
 two with a base for number one 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.130
 extreme because to concerning the eighth 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.780
 also information about 809 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.010
 a wave 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.240
 I know that we are so confident in the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.100
 clan linders a 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.660
 mare driven by and enders she has 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.120
 already ran at group level aunis in 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.890
 the courses of mlk started victoriously 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.570
 on the steeple-chase on the verge of 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.020
 win for his debut on the steeplechase 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.000
 of auteuil 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.220
 she took a encouraging second 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.570
 place it was April 20 here in my opinion 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.460
 is a first chance she has 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.920
 fight for success at 809 a wave 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.120
 the opposition seems within reach for 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.970
 those targeted at auteuil 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.770
 this wednesday 11 june the second 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.220
 sixth and eighth with three hits 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.440
 of heart of 103 6 in 1 809 three shots 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.720
 of heart also to gingham in meeting 2 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.550
 with the first blood three waltzes 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.260
 julry who has three successes in 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.640
 only five races run is 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.360
 true that the mare will perform a 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.650
 return to school 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.630
 it is also true that it will begin 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.190
 under the saddle but she does not have the 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.930
 gains related to this potential is 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.370
 here she seems able to me well 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.710
 to make English to win from the start 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.410
 in the discipline will be found val 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.380
 sully who does not live in 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.880
 same floor as his rivals of the day the 209 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.100
 scam that must be redeemed quickly 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.570
 disqualified lately at caen seven 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.770
 Muslims who go to lo like that one 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.500
 is said the beak like it he had 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.760
 some games used to converse 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.720
 told me she was horny he 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.090
 was a good right 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.290
 the mare is fit and a priori 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.700
 the opposition in his strings and he 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.720
 would be really disappointing not to 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.240
 have her fight for her that two 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.340
 first places the 209 scam presented 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.110
 by the friendly and city ​​with in the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.390
 sixth sous also advises the 608 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.470
 haruna racing jackets for her 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.440
 in 2014 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.820
 two podiums 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.380
 loved backgammon that deserves ample 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.080
 see his efforts rewarded by a 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.550
 success this from 608 depends on 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.080
 the training of Roman derieux 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.050
 always efficient in his travels 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.100
