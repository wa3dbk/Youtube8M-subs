this<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.519> be<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.700> basis<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.300> making

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
this can be the basis of making

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.170 
this can be the basis of making
different<00:02:46.769> facial<00:02:46.920> expressions<00:02:47.580> for<00:02:47.790> my

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
different facial expressions for my

blocking<00:02:48.450> models<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.370> by<00:02:50.370> making<00:02:50.580> multiple

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
blocking models and by making multiple

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.410 
blocking models and by making multiple
faces<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.540> could<00:02:52.019> probably<00:02:52.470> sell<00:02:53.130> them<00:02:53.420> which

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
faces I could probably sell them which

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.229
