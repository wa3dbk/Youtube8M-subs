hey<00:00:05.100> there<00:00:05.310> I'm<00:00:05.549> Alan<00:00:05.879> Matthews<00:00:06.089> in<00:00:06.540> this

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
hey there I'm Alan Matthews in this

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.049 
hey there I'm Alan Matthews in this
video<00:00:06.990> we're<00:00:07.649> gonna<00:00:07.740> get<00:00:07.950> into<00:00:08.160> using<00:00:08.700> speed

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
video we're gonna get into using speed

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.709 
video we're gonna get into using speed
bursts<00:00:09.510> in<00:00:09.630> our<00:00:10.019> arpeggio<00:00:10.820> practice<00:00:11.820> super

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
bursts in our arpeggio practice super

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.689 
bursts in our arpeggio practice super
fun<00:00:12.929> stuff<00:00:13.259> let's<00:00:14.009> get<00:00:14.190> cracking<00:00:16.369> when<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.520> are

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
fun stuff let's get cracking when we are

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.790 
fun stuff let's get cracking when we are
practicing<00:00:17.940> arpeggios<00:00:21.380> something<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.529> this

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
practicing arpeggios something like this

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.099 
practicing arpeggios something like this
any<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.580> our<00:00:23.699> arpeggio<00:00:24.240> patterns<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.930> you're

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
any of our arpeggio patterns if you're

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.689 
any of our arpeggio patterns if you're
not<00:00:25.260> practicing<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.890> arpeggio<00:00:26.340> patterns

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
not practicing the arpeggio patterns

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.400 
not practicing the arpeggio patterns
look<00:00:26.939> below<00:00:27.240> for<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> link<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.170> go

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
look below for the link and you can go

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.779 
look below for the link and you can go
there<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:28.920> them<00:00:29.099> when<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:29.640> practicing

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
there and get them when we're practicing

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.060 
there and get them when we're practicing
these<00:00:30.330> we're<00:00:30.869> gonna<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> point<00:00:31.830> if

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
these we're gonna get to a point if

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.470 
these we're gonna get to a point if
we're<00:00:32.250> bumping<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> metronome

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
we're bumping it up with the metronome

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.720 
we're bumping it up with the metronome
and<00:00:33.950> getting<00:00:34.950> faster<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.340> faster<00:00:35.430> we're

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and getting faster and faster we're

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.979 
and getting faster and faster we're
gonna<00:00:35.850> get<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> point<00:00:36.420> where<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:36.750> break

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
gonna get to a point where they break

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.229 
gonna get to a point where they break
down<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.890> everything<00:00:38.550> does<00:00:38.760> there<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
down because everything does there is a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.420 
down because everything does there is a
point<00:00:39.570> at<00:00:39.780> which<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.230> all<00:00:40.410> break<00:00:40.829> down<00:00:41.040> speed

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
point at which we all break down speed

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
point at which we all break down speed
wise<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> actually<00:00:43.469> then

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
wise and so the way to actually then

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.279 
wise and so the way to actually then
bump<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.730> next<00:00:44.940> level<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.660> practicing

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
bump up to the next level of practicing

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.819 
bump up to the next level of practicing
these<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.550> use<00:00:48.149> speed<00:00:48.480> bursts<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
these is to use speed bursts and so a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.189 
these is to use speed bursts and so a
very<00:00:50.430> short<00:00:50.969> little<00:00:51.149> bursts<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.690> speed<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
very short little bursts of speed and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.680 
very short little bursts of speed and
then<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> break<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.579> instead<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.120> thought

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
then a break and so instead of a thought

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.729 
then a break and so instead of a thought
or<00:00:54.719> two<00:00:54.809> thought<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.110> dessert<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
or two thought or dessert it's out it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.410 
or two thought or dessert it's out it
instead<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.300> we're

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
instead of all that going on then we're

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.049 
instead of all that going on then we're
just<00:00:57.449> gonna<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.640> do<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> little

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
just gonna go and do it as a little

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.470 
just gonna go and do it as a little
burst<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> might<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.090> just<00:01:03.090> your<00:01:03.329> our

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
burst so it might just be just your our

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.479 
burst so it might just be just your our
pedra<00:01:03.750> I'm<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:03.960> gonna<00:01:04.049> use<00:01:04.229> p<00:01:04.409> IM<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.339> this

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
pedra I'm just gonna use p IM for this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.980 
pedra I'm just gonna use p IM for this
for<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.360> video

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
for this video

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.090 
for this video
so<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:09.000> could<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.479> you're<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.900> gonna<00:01:09.990> go

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.929 

two<00:01:14.100> three<00:01:14.369> four<00:01:14.970> two<00:01:15.750> three<00:01:15.780> four<00:01:16.820> that<00:01:17.820> would

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
two three four two three four that would

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.100 
two three four two three four that would
be<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> speed<00:01:18.390> burst<00:01:18.540> you're<00:01:18.810> doing<00:01:18.990> those

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
be a speed burst you're doing those

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
be a speed burst you're doing those
three<00:01:19.439> notes<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.890> quickly<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.119> that's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
three notes very quickly and then that's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.270 
three notes very quickly and then that's
it

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.700 
it
now<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.689> way<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
now that is one way to do it but it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280 
now that is one way to do it but it
might<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.640> don't<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:27.290> your

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
might be that if you don't have your

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.429 
might be that if you don't have your
arpeggio<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:29.400> well<00:01:29.970> defined<00:01:30.270> yet<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.320> it

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
arpeggio really well defined yet then it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.170 
arpeggio really well defined yet then it
might<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:32.340> all<00:01:32.549> lilting<00:01:33.060> or

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
might be that that's all lilting or

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.300 
might be that that's all lilting or
that's<00:01:33.299> not<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:33.720> comfortable<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:35.040> another

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that's not very comfortable so another

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.870 
that's not very comfortable so another
way<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.729> would<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.560> first

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
way to do it would be to just the first

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
way to do it would be to just the first
two<00:01:38.880> notes<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> then<00:01:39.869> stop<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> third

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
two notes and then stop on the third

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.690 
two notes and then stop on the third
like<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.280> right<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:43.100> now<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.159> still<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
like this right here now I still do the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.880 
like this right here now I still do the
exact<00:01:45.000> same<00:01:45.060> action<00:01:45.479> both<00:01:46.170> fingers<00:01:46.530> came<00:01:46.710> out

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
exact same action both fingers came out

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.230 
exact same action both fingers came out
and<00:01:47.040> planted<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.659> everything

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
and planted and everything

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:58.100 
and planted and everything
but<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.420> at<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.690> point<00:01:56.540> but<00:01:57.540> at<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.810> point

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
but then at that point but at that point

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.510 
but then at that point but at that point
you<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:59.040> make<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.460> where

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
you can actually make it to where

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.630 
you can actually make it to where
instead<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.750> two<00:02:00.870> three<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.370> make<00:02:02.520> it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
instead of one two three you can make it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.150 
instead of one two three you can make it
now<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.690> 31<00:02:04.430> or<00:02:05.960> three<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.110> two<00:02:07.260> or<00:02:07.920> something

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
now to 31 or three one two or something

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.139 
now to 31 or three one two or something
like<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.670> you're<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:08.850> making

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
like that so that you're actually making

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.700 
like that so that you're actually making
the<00:02:09.479> loop<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.929> different<00:02:10.290> way

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
the loop in a different way

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.620 
the loop in a different way
or<00:02:11.580> di<00:02:12.570> MP<00:02:13.430> Pam<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.760> get<00:02:17.970> back<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.450> then

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
or di MP Pam so you get back but then

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.480 
or di MP Pam so you get back but then
you<00:02:18.720> stop<00:02:19.020> because<00:02:19.620> ultimately<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.250> want<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
you stop because ultimately you want to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.480 
you stop because ultimately you want to
be<00:02:20.550> able<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.850> let<00:02:21.540> them<00:02:21.690> just<00:02:21.840> roll<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:26.370> you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
be able to let them just roll but you

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.370 
be able to let them just roll but you
can't<00:02:26.700> do<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.090> if<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.570> can't<00:02:27.780> do<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.020> and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
can't do that if you can't do that and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.350 
can't do that if you can't do that and
so<00:02:28.500> then<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.709> way<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.860> practice<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
so then the way to practice that to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.330 
so then the way to practice that to
where<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.570> can<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:31.170> bump<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.530> speed<00:02:31.860> up<00:02:32.040> is

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
where you can to bump that speed up is

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.940 
where you can to bump that speed up is
to<00:02:32.760> actually<00:02:33.150> give<00:02:33.870> yourself<00:02:34.260> little<00:02:34.470> points

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
to actually give yourself little points

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.130 
to actually give yourself little points
to<00:02:35.250> take<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.490> break<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.120> take<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.330> little<00:02:36.540> rest<00:02:36.840> in

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
to take a break to take a little rest in

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.550 
to take a break to take a little rest in
the<00:02:37.260> middle<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:39.600> get<00:02:40.320> creative

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the middle of that and so get creative

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.820 
the middle of that and so get creative
with<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.180> think<00:02:42.180> how<00:02:43.080> many<00:02:43.350> different<00:02:43.560> ways

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
with this think how many different ways

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.370 
with this think how many different ways
could<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:44.250> figure<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.700> do<00:02:44.850> just<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.209> P<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> M<00:02:45.570> on<00:02:45.840> one

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
could I figure to do just a P I M on one

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.500 
could I figure to do just a P I M on one
chord<00:02:46.740> what<00:02:47.370> how<00:02:47.640> many<00:02:47.790> different<00:02:47.970> rhythms

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
chord what how many different rhythms

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.170 
chord what how many different rhythms
could<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.350> actually<00:02:49.680> come<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.610> with<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.940> do<00:02:51.030> it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
could I actually come up with to do it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.180 
could I actually come up with to do it
one<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.690> a-two<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.200> a-three<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.160> a-four

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
one and a-two and a-three and a-four

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.750 
one and a-two and a-three and a-four
that's<00:02:56.190> one

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
that's one

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.630 
that's one
here's<00:02:57.600> another<00:02:57.720> one<00:03:01.160> it's<00:03:02.160> changing<00:03:02.519> the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
here's another one it's changing the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.699 
here's another one it's changing the
rhythm<00:03:02.790> now<00:03:03.000> right<00:03:03.209> but<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:03.870> making<00:03:04.019> the

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
rhythm now right but it's making the

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.740 
rhythm now right but it's making the
group<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.190> three<00:03:05.459> offset<00:03:06.030> each<00:03:06.180> time<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.660> then

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
group of three offset each time and then

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.150 
group of three offset each time and then
finally<00:03:07.050> one<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.550> first<00:03:11.760> one<00:03:11.910> or

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
finally one and that the first one or

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.710 
finally one and that the first one or
one<00:03:14.160> again<00:03:14.430> 2<00:03:14.820> M<00:03:15.120> 3<00:03:15.330> M<00:03:15.780> 4<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.470> or<00:03:16.709> 1<00:03:17.280> e<00:03:17.310> 2<00:03:17.970> e<00:03:18.380> 4e

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
one again 2 M 3 M 4 and or 1 e 2 e 4e

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.780 
one again 2 M 3 M 4 and or 1 e 2 e 4e
and<00:03:21.720> those<00:03:22.560> are<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.860> difference<00:03:23.250> those<00:03:23.670> are

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and those are the difference those are

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.830 
and those are the difference those are
the<00:03:23.850> three<00:03:24.030> different<00:03:24.060> ones<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.480> can<00:03:24.570> do<00:03:24.720> with

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
the three different ones you can do with

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.240 
the three different ones you can do with
sixteenth<00:03:25.260> notes<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:25.680> also<00:03:25.890> get<00:03:26.130> into

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
sixteenth notes you can also get into

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.800 
sixteenth notes you can also get into
triplets<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.940> play<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:27.390> those<00:03:27.540> as<00:03:27.780> well

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
triplets and play with those as well

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.960 
triplets and play with those as well
just<00:03:28.440> be<00:03:28.560> creative<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.100> poke<00:03:29.430> around<00:03:29.459> and

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
just be creative and poke around and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.670 
just be creative and poke around and
figure<00:03:30.690> something<00:03:31.019> out<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.470> have<00:03:31.650> a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
figure something out that you have a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.530 
figure something out that you have a
hard<00:03:31.950> time<00:03:32.160> doing<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.610> then<00:03:32.910> practicing<00:03:33.420> it

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
hard time doing and then practicing it

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.020 
hard time doing and then practicing it
until<00:03:34.019> you<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:34.290> do<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.769> then<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.700> may<00:03:35.880> or

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
until you can do it and then you may or

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.699 
until you can do it and then you may or
may<00:03:36.120> not<00:03:36.150> ever<00:03:36.330> do<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.870> exercise<00:03:37.110> ever<00:03:37.500> again

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
may not ever do that exercise ever again

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.930 
may not ever do that exercise ever again
but<00:03:37.860> if<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.010> can<00:03:38.130> get<00:03:38.250> into<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.519> habit<00:03:38.640> of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
but if you can get into the habit of

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.229 
but if you can get into the habit of
creating<00:03:39.930> exercises<00:03:40.769> in<00:03:40.980> your<00:03:41.549> practice<00:03:42.030> and

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
creating exercises in your practice and

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.850 
creating exercises in your practice and
just<00:03:42.840> being<00:03:42.989> creative<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.470> doing<00:03:43.650> something

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
just being creative and doing something

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.949 
just being creative and doing something
new<00:03:44.070> then<00:03:44.280> you'll<00:03:44.580> be<00:03:44.730> much<00:03:44.940> more<00:03:45.180> inspired<00:03:45.660> to

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
new then you'll be much more inspired to

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.600 
new then you'll be much more inspired to
practice<00:03:46.500> our<00:03:46.620> page<00:03:46.830> EOS<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.340> practice

also keep moving forward because it's

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.710 
also keep moving forward because it's
very<00:03:56.100> easy<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.580> get<00:03:56.670> caught<00:03:56.940> in<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.269> rut<00:03:57.480> and

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
very easy to get caught in the rut and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.540 
very easy to get caught in the rut and
not<00:03:58.230> even<00:03:58.500> realize<00:03:58.800> that<00:03:59.040> you're<00:03:59.190> there<00:03:59.340> but

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
not even realize that you're there but

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.130 
not even realize that you're there but
then<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.940> way<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.209> you<00:04:00.450> can<00:04:00.569> realize<00:04:00.959> you

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
then the way that you can realize you

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.110 
then the way that you can realize you
are<00:04:01.319> is<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.860> you're<00:04:02.580> just<00:04:02.610> not<00:04:02.819> really

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
are is that you're just not really

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.550 
are is that you're just not really
excited<00:04:03.630> they<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:03.900> seem<00:04:04.050> kind<00:04:04.080> of<00:04:04.290> boring

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
excited they just seem kind of boring
