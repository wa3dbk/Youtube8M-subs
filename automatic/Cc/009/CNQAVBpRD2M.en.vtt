battlefields<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.020> good<00:02:07.140> example<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.649> had<00:02:07.740> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
battlefields a good example if you had a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550 
battlefields a good example if you had a
battlefield<00:02:08.099> server<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:09.270> wouldn't<00:02:09.780> protect

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
battlefield server you wouldn't protect

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.740 
battlefield server you wouldn't protect
that<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.129> premium<00:02:11.610> guys<00:02:11.790> only<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.660> know

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
that just for premium guys only you know

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.460 
that just for premium guys only you know
because<00:02:12.959> you

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
because you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.660 
because you
you'd<00:02:13.560> want<00:02:13.710> in<00:02:13.860> fully<00:02:14.040> populated<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
you'd want in fully populated all the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.460 
you'd want in fully populated all the
time<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.240> instead<00:02:15.600> you'd<00:02:15.780> give<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> premium

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
time so instead you'd give a premium

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.710 
time so instead you'd give a premium
accesses<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.950> fire<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.670> yeah<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.330> know<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.660> just
