Ribbit's<00:00:00.329> and<00:00:00.599> we'll<00:00:00.750> do<00:00:00.900> it<00:00:01.020> on<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.170> back

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:01.730 
Ribbit's and we'll do it on the back

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.840 
Ribbit's and we'll do it on the back
since<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:03.600> is<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.840> project<00:00:04.850> doesn't

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
since this is this is a project doesn't

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.250 
since this is this is a project doesn't
it's<00:00:06.779> not<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.170> critical<00:00:07.519> but<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.900> rivet<00:00:09.900> saver

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
it's not that critical but a rivet saver

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.089 
it's not that critical but a rivet saver
is<00:00:11.099> an<00:00:11.910> industry<00:00:12.480> standard<00:00:12.509> tool<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.860> not

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
is an industry standard tool it's not

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.710 
is an industry standard tool it's not
used<00:00:14.460> very<00:00:14.639> often<00:00:16.190> the<00:00:17.190> only<00:00:17.520> critical<00:00:18.330> thing

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
used very often the only critical thing

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.040 
used very often the only critical thing
you<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.350> remember<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.939> before<00:00:21.570> you

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
you have to remember is that before you

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.509 
you have to remember is that before you
use<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.529> tool<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.580> must<00:00:23.880> set<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.689> up<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.519> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
use this tool you must set it up on the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.620 
use this tool you must set it up on the
metal<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.180> where<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.390> does<00:00:27.599> not<00:00:27.840> touch<00:00:29.630> okay

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
metal to where it does not touch okay

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.359 
metal to where it does not touch okay
you<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.349> martyr<00:00:31.859> metal<00:00:32.189> right

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
you see it's just martyr metal right

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.819 
you see it's just martyr metal right
there<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.600> turn<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.260> collar<00:00:34.500> up

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
there so you have to turn the collar up

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.260 
there so you have to turn the collar up
it<00:00:35.370> has<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.840> close<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.120> surface<00:00:39.120> as

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it has to be as close to the surface as

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.770 
it has to be as close to the surface as
it<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:40.219> without<00:00:41.219> actually<00:00:41.850> touching<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
it can get without actually touching the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.660 
it can get without actually touching the
metal<00:00:42.960> that's<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> only<00:00:44.129> way<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
metal that's the only way it's going to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.529 
metal that's the only way it's going to
effectively<00:00:45.149> work<00:00:46.820> okay<00:00:47.820> right<00:00:48.030> there<00:00:48.300> it's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
effectively work okay right there it's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.680 
effectively work okay right there it's
not<00:00:48.690> touching<00:00:49.789> touching<00:00:50.789> there<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.510> let's<00:00:51.629> go

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
not touching touching there so let's go

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.189 
not touching touching there so let's go
back<00:00:53.629> okay<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.739> go<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.780> it's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
back okay so now we can go here and it's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.000 
back okay so now we can go here and it's
not<00:00:58.379> touching<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.410> if<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.620> wanted<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
not touching so now if you wanted to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.759 
not touching so now if you wanted to
check<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.329> your<00:01:03.510> rivet<00:01:03.750> were<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.500> bit

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
check or if your rivet were a little bit

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.899 
check or if your rivet were a little bit
high

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.940 

you<00:01:09.479> would<00:01:09.600> put<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.990> over<00:01:10.229> top<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.619> your

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you would put this over top of your

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.660 
you would put this over top of your
rivet<00:01:15.049> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.469> saved<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.340> teeny

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
rivet you can see it saved just a teeny

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.480 
rivet you can see it saved just a teeny
bit<00:01:17.850> down<00:01:21.770> okay<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.399> next<00:01:23.429> one

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
bit down okay then the next one

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
bit down okay then the next one
absolutely<00:01:26.490> nothing<00:01:27.329> so<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.899> about<00:01:28.079> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
absolutely nothing so that's about a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.919 
absolutely nothing so that's about a
perfect<00:01:28.859> buck<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.399> one<00:01:29.819> that<00:01:30.599> one<00:01:30.780> was<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
perfect buck on that one that one was a

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.399

clad if we were doing the repair and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.270 
clad if we were doing the repair and
when<00:01:59.879> you<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.479> project<00:02:01.109> you<00:02:01.739> are<00:02:01.920> going

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
when you do your project you are going

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.490 
when you do your project you are going
to<00:02:02.489> treat<00:02:02.849> the<00:02:03.030> metal<00:02:03.359> it's<00:02:03.929> all<00:02:04.170> going<00:02:04.379> to<00:02:04.409> be

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
to treat the metal it's all going to be

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.499 
to treat the metal it's all going to be
free<00:02:05.129> you're<00:02:05.609> going<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.849> drill<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.299> you're

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
free you're going to drill it you're

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
free you're going to drill it you're
going<00:02:06.629> to<00:02:06.689> countersink<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.530> you're<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
going to countersink it you're going to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.759 
going to countersink it you're going to
prime<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.569> when<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.440> stage

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
prime it so when you get to this stage

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.819 
prime it so when you get to this stage
everything<00:02:11.549> is<00:02:11.670> all<00:02:11.819> going<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.829> be

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
everything is all going to be be

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.509 
everything is all going to be be
prepared<00:02:14.780> but<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.410> show<00:02:16.680> how<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.160> put

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
prepared but this is to show how to put

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.259 
prepared but this is to show how to put
rivets<00:02:17.849> in<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.359> that's<00:02:19.019> about<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.280> we<00:02:21.060> have

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
rivets in and that's about it so we have

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.860 
rivets in and that's about it so we have
two<00:02:22.310> countersunk<00:02:23.310> 80<00:02:23.670> rivets<00:02:24.239> two
