00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.230
 Hello everyone today is 4 am 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:15.059
 the next flush zero 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:18.119
 look at how the grain has already happened 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.300
 roots appeared east so today 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.300
 in the evening this grain can be laid 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 trays 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.740
 grain evenly germinates even that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.950
 I'll be at the bottom 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.000
 winter usually germinates much 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.600
 more effective when closer in the air 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.600
 shouldn't have 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.070
 but again as I said 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.810
 need to grow grain bed 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.810
 so that was all the same shadow 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.180
 But in general, that and everything again we lay and 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.570
 leave until the evening see you later 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.570
 good luck
