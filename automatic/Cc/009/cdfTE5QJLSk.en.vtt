00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
though this video is really going to

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.070 
though this video is really going to
show<00:02:57.010> really<00:02:57.970> only<00:02:58.150> going<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.450> show<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:58.870> area

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
show really only going to show this area

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.949 
show really only going to show this area
there's<00:03:02.080> really<00:03:02.650> five<00:03:03.959> portions<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:06.959> so

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
there's really five portions to it so

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.559 
there's really five portions to it so

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
the maps are huge and in each portion

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.600 
the maps are huge and in each portion
portion<00:03:11.080> is<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.769> know<00:03:11.860> it's<00:03:12.100> not<00:03:12.280> close

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
portion is you know it's not close

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.670 
portion is you know it's not close
quarters<00:03:13.120> although<00:03:13.930> there<00:03:14.110> are<00:03:14.230> some<00:03:14.440> close

quarters although there are some close

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.170 
quarters although there are some close
quarters<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.099> mean<00:03:15.310> once<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:15.760> get<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.030> those

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
quarters I mean once you get in those

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.509 
quarters I mean once you get in those
bunkers<00:03:16.569> you've<00:03:17.530> got<00:03:17.709> your<00:03:17.830> close<00:03:18.069> quarter

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
bunkers you've got your close quarter

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.690 
bunkers you've got your close quarter
combat<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:20.319> have<00:03:20.470> shotguns<00:03:21.010> if<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.400> want<00:03:21.580> to

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
combat you have shotguns if you want to

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.150 
combat you have shotguns if you want to
you<00:03:22.330> want<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.599> really<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.620> that's<00:03:23.830> where<00:03:24.130> you

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
you want to really and that's where you

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.130 
you want to really and that's where you
excel<00:03:24.670> then<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.299> know<00:03:25.390> you<00:03:25.450> stay<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:25.900> close

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
excel then you know you stay in close

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.520 
excel then you know you stay in close
quarters<00:03:26.560> but<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.670> actually<00:03:28.480> like<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.110> open

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
quarters but I actually like the open

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.940 
quarters but I actually like the open
area<00:03:30.130> combat<00:03:31.230> there's<00:03:32.230> there's<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.739> lot<00:03:32.920> of

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
area combat there's there's a lot of

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.599 
area combat there's there's a lot of
sniping<00:03:33.489> involved<00:03:35.310> even<00:03:36.310> though<00:03:36.430> I'm<00:03:36.579> not

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
sniping involved even though I'm not

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.310
