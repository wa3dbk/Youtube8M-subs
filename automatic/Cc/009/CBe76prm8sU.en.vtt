00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.800 
so this is our robot arm this is our
training<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.520> go<00:02:02.670> through<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:03.330> our

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
training that we go through with our

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.530 
training that we go through with our
monkeys<00:02:04.260> as<00:02:04.620> they<00:02:05.100> go<00:02:05.250> through<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.820> try<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
monkeys as they go through and try to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.820 
monkeys as they go through and try to
learn<00:02:06.840> how<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:07.080> use<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.560> robot<00:02:09.290> so<00:02:10.290> they're

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
learn how to use this robot so they're

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.430 
learn how to use this robot so they're
using<00:02:11.220> brain<00:02:12.180> signals<00:02:12.630> so<00:02:12.810> signals<00:02:13.260> from

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
using brain signals so signals from

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220 
using brain signals so signals from
their<00:02:13.650> motor<00:02:13.890> cortex<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:15.050> pull<00:02:16.050> out<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
their motor cortex that we pull out of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.890 
their motor cortex that we pull out of
wires<00:02:16.980> into<00:02:17.370> our<00:02:17.490> system<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.120> our<00:02:18.390> computers

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
wires into our system and our computers

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.950 
wires into our system and our computers
then<00:02:19.370> decode<00:02:20.370> what<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.690> monkey

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
then decode what it is that the monkey

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.920 
then decode what it is that the monkey
is<00:02:22.020> intending<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.590> do<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.660> drive<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
is intending to do and drive the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.990 
is intending to do and drive the

backward and around through space the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.449 
backward and around through space the
monkeys<00:02:31.170> have<00:02:31.320> brain<00:02:31.590> control<00:02:31.980> over<00:02:32.310> this

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
monkeys have brain control over this

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.420 
monkeys have brain control over this
robotic<00:02:32.790> arm<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.500> move<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.650> forward<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.250> grab

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
robotic arm to move it forward and grab

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.949 
robotic arm to move it forward and grab
a<00:02:35.459> piece<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.820> fruit<00:02:35.970> as<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.300> presented<00:02:36.750> and

a piece of fruit as is presented and

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.210 
a piece of fruit as is presented and
then<00:02:37.080> bring<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.260> back<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.530> their<00:02:37.770> mouth<00:02:37.950> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
then bring it back to their mouth to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.540 
then bring it back to their mouth to
feed<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.150> self<00:02:41.959> incredible<00:02:42.959> as<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.110> may<00:02:43.260> seem

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
feed them self incredible as it may seem

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.040 
feed them self incredible as it may seem
these<00:02:44.550> monkeys<00:02:45.120> learn<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.600> feed<00:02:45.810> themselves

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
these monkeys learn to feed themselves

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.830 
these monkeys learn to feed themselves
with<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.830> robot<00:02:47.250> arm<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.090> being<00:02:48.390> directly

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
controlled by their brains as if it was

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.380 
controlled by their brains as if it was
simply<00:02:52.140> part<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.620> them<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.209> a
