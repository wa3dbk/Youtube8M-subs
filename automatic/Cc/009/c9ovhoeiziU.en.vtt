00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 builders of the change and welcome to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.020
 another case necessarily in 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.620
 karlsruhe offensively and holy shit her 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.900
 see it already 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.230
 I have many cases there so I think so 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.710
 to have and they all come from you 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.800
 What's extreme is that we two 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 European royal class and 1x was 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:31.949
 Therefore lamp shoe I can then from 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.040
 an interface and cs cuba 4.2 and cs 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.079
 then from the eu that is just before 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 So just before I started 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.770
 have sent that to me and now 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.870
 almost to 1 percent to 362 winter 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.899
 offensive cases two mens sprint cases 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:55.110
 and 25 roadster cases holy shit 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:59.430
 that's a big big one 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.600
 commitment is not and is relatively sharp 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.580
 By the way, I'll just bring now 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.330
 Six cases open because otherwise 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.619
 will go much too long and me yes me 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.119
 I want to save on the 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.530
 that was not infinite 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.490
 I've got so much money right now 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.229
 money from that at six o'clock 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.960
 and there would be the existing expectant 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.509
 I would say we take it first 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.000
 that huntsman web encase her curious 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.579
 write everything that comes out 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.280
 Yes , he does not advertise in yellow 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.070
 brought 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.409
 games disappointed but hey do what 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.650
 but of course there is a valmet 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.880
 one class to the same people would be so because 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.090
 yes again I could the bowl 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.610
 buy and have since so far what packed 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.200
 so i somehow i could 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.939
 swear the city ​​only two but me 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.210
 I have bought rich again and I 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.299
 do not have a third spring weather case 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.290
 which is why I have five powers left 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.689
 will stop next time I am 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.060
 somehow get it finick then again 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.009
 I have to open that before 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.140
 Buy circuit again when I say 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.100
 we have ok with that 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.670
 oh yes how cool would that be if I'm in life 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.050
 house would get 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.720
 I 'll say that's it 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:28.670
 unrealistic but you do not know 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:43.330
 you never know it galina gabi exactly that 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:43.330
 what I wanted so well the next case 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.290
 okay, the bad I think so 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.300
 not as I will, I think I 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:05.920
 believe it would be quite happy but 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:12.130
 There were two more kids then 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:17.980
 Let's have a bounty I have 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:20.380
 I also I have to rap in front of case 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.480
 opening looked on extremely much 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:34.150
 luck has stayed great has gotten like 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:37.500
 should I give money but also may and 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.500
 no fucking negev 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.520
 Something is from the last kettle 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:04:05.090
 good things come out really good 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:04:07.069
 is that it is probably due to that 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.950
 every case is the worst case 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:16.519
 By the way, I had there I am 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.690

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.070
