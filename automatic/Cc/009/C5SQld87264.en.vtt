at<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> ipad<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.720> texture<00:01:10.470> actually<00:01:11.040> feels

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
at the ipad the texture actually feels

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.060 
at the ipad the texture actually feels
very<00:01:11.640> smooth<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.900> cutouts<00:01:13.110> are<00:01:13.530> almost

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
very smooth and the cutouts are almost

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.820 
very smooth and the cutouts are almost
perfect<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.750> only<00:01:15.900> trouble<00:01:16.290> i<00:01:16.439> had<00:01:16.590> was

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
perfect and the only trouble i had was

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
perfect and the only trouble i had was
just<00:01:17.040> installing<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> sides<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.210> curves<00:01:18.479> are

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
just installing the sides the curves are

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.810 
just installing the sides the curves are
actually<00:01:19.439> angled<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> position<00:01:20.400> that's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
actually angled at a position that's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.480 
actually angled at a position that's
pretty<00:01:21.150> tough<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.630> let<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> stick<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.280> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
pretty tough to let it stick so this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.850 
pretty tough to let it stick so this
