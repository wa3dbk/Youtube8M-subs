00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
makeshift fixed pet makeshift this right

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.120 
makeshift fixed pet makeshift this right
here<00:04:15.250> broke<00:04:16.209> on<00:04:16.539> it<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.019> part<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.500> closes<00:04:17.950> it

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
here broke on it the part that closes it

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.370 
here broke on it the part that closes it
and<00:04:18.340> without<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:19.060> being<00:04:19.209> closed<00:04:19.630> it<00:04:19.840> actually

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
and without it being closed it actually

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.870 
and without it being closed it actually
doesn't<00:04:20.650> turn<00:04:21.010> on<00:04:21.039> because<00:04:21.519> there's<00:04:21.700> like<00:04:21.820> a

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
doesn't turn on because there's like a

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.909 
doesn't turn on because there's like a
button<00:04:22.330> that's<00:04:22.870> pressed<00:04:23.289> so<00:04:23.620> we<00:04:23.710> stuck

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
button that's pressed so we stuck

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.290 
button that's pressed so we stuck
something<00:04:24.160> where<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.520> buttons<00:04:24.850> supposed<00:04:25.180> to

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
something where the buttons supposed to

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.960 
something where the buttons supposed to
be<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:25.660> it<00:04:26.110> works<00:04:26.380> but<00:04:27.190> it's<00:04:27.550> like<00:04:27.789> a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
be and it works but it's like a

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.860 
be and it works but it's like a
makeshift<00:04:28.750> hardcore<00:04:29.740> ghetto<00:04:30.039> type<00:04:30.370> of<00:04:30.550> thing

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
makeshift hardcore ghetto type of thing

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.779 
makeshift hardcore ghetto type of thing
so<00:04:31.870> i'll<00:04:32.289> have<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.650> take<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.010> out<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.460> take<00:04:33.639> out

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
so i'll have to take it out to take out
