00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello how about how are you welcome to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.690
 another video of my channel and this time I'm going 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.110
 to start doing some blogs like here 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.429
 in this corner of my room and little to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.830
 little will I decorate if he is anxious 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.870
 but I'm going to go here doing blog 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.850
 about mx tell me issues in the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.980
 comments give maximum support in me 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
 like to share the video with friends and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.210
 a vital tweet to follow this series 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.369
 and above all the most important thing is that I 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.310
 propose jce themes every week to 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.740
 talk the next week this week 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.140
 I have decided to talk about the pictures of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.360
 bmx the different measures that is according to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.149
 your size is one of the questions that most 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.910
 you do me and I think it can help 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.100
 a lot of people with just one video to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.930
 that you can go asking also in 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.690
 other videos but I think doing 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 I'm going to reach a lot more people 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.620
 before I start with the video I want to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.840
 explain two things the first thing that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.960
 inches of the box here you have my 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.050
 first box of mx 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.199
 the space between this tube this 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.560
 tube and this be between this is the space 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.300
 what is there is like a television that says 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.770
 for example a 20-inch TV 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.409
 is the hot space the 4 sticks of 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.930
 the screen and here would be the space 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.270
 picture triangle customer the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.460
 second thing I want to say is that 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.330
 you have to be careful with the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.810
 pictures if you have 14 15 years because if 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.429
 just started you are going to resist you are going to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.590
 make them resist pictures 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.820
 because you are not going to ride strong and you are not going 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.979
 to grow maybe you're left 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.369
 small so I can recommend them 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.070
 that you are not going to look for a very 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.470
 small very handsome to you if not yet 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.869
 you have given the spurt and finally that 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.130
 I had forgotten if you are from street 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.130
 normally street 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.469
 we extended to have a smaller box 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.409
 I know because to write they say 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.270
 that if you do tricks of the turn it costs 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.250
 less the smaller the table 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.539
 but you do not have to carry a picture either 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.250
 super small because if it is not very 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.940
 however annoying as in pairs and 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.489
 trap gives you that boost you do not need a 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.110
 So small box and you can afford 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.630
 the luxury of carrying a bigger one than 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.209
 for many things it is more comfortable so 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.420
 We started with the measures for the 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.840
 children who are less than 10 years old and who 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.930
 they live about a meter 10 or less than a 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.690
 metro 10am in I recommend paintings of 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.900
 12 inches and it's ideal for them 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.060
 then for children who do 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.910
 been a meter thirty I recommend 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.340
 16 inch pictures the interests 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.400
 ride me and it does not give me is more than a meter 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.489
 50 and ideally for us it would be a 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.680
 18 inch box for people who 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.870
 it is already more than 50 meters 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.629
 a box that is 20 inches in 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.689
 meters 50 plus or minus to sixty meters 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:01.510
 height for those who do more than subway 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:04.870
 sixty meters sixty minus seventy 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.230
 Ideally, tables would already be 20.5 20.6 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.739
 I think it's the ideal meter measure 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.010
 seventy to eighty meters 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.040
 the best would already be a box between 20 75 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.049
 inches and finally for my people 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.040
 It is very high that it is already more than one meter 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.099
 eighty the ideal would be a box 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.349
 approximately 21 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.359
 21.25 already depending on whether you're tall or 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.400
 very high and here's the video today 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.560
 I hope you enjoyed sharing it 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.900
 with your friends who will continue with 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.419
 bmx triple and do not know what size of frame 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.459
 It would be ideal so I give a little 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.959
 life above all give you a lot of support 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.430
