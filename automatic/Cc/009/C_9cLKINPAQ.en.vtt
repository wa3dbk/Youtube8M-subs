00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.800
 and well presents champions we have 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.900
 been dead with a visual word and also 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.599
 skills that is thinking well 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.860
 pour a paradise image but this time 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.449
 and it still comes back with a more 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.279
 terrifying and leaves that face behind 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.720
 ball that you currently have and 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.760
 course also the glitter cans that 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.890
 so much characterized it now session 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.390
 It has an authentic undead style and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.369
 it is like when you get up by 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.500
 the mornings looking for something to eat 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.239
 But the style is less and 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.309
 that I am a traitor has no skills 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.050
 that many will like your passive now 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.370
 he relives it as a drop only with all 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.440
 life but it was diminishing 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.090
 vertiginously in return they still have 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.890
 a lot of attack speed and a lot of theft 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.930
 of life and additional attack depending on 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.430
 the maximum life of the enemy his skill 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.350
 as a base that is responsible for two 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.899
 seconds your ax and drop a hit on 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.280
 a pretty high range if the load lasts 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.070
 at least a second stuns the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.510
 enemies and throws them into the air the w 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.070
 was created the only skill that we 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.350
 changed since it does exactly the same 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.289
 that now creates a shield that can be 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.820
 exploited to inflict damage to the s that 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.590
 if it still makes a roar in the form of 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.909
 exclusion that will impact a champion 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.009
 enemy does it 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.719
 the armor considerably if the 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.789
 roar hits monsters the enemy what 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.439
 will push pretty far and apply the 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.299
 same effects as the champion and for 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.250
 finalizing the ultimate is pretty cool 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.289
 since action runs intensely towards 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.450
 one direction and it will be unstoppable for 8 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.130
 seconds the address can be modified 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.439
 slightly if the sides to avoid 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.849
 unwanted collisions are your end 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.500
 race when hitting enemies or 

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.770
 good with a wall and inflicting damage 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.780
 crazy and also to the ones if crazy 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.700
 It is worth mentioning that the more flight 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.740
 take greater will be the effects of your 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.599
 collision as a final note I would like 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.369
 comment that this does not work does not seem 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:44.810
 fit all the lanes without 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.950
 However, there is a finger ring in 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.780
 the role of the jungle since its 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.450
 skills make me clean the jungle 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.670
 in a monstrous way and in that as everything 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.829
 a wild bull so if this new 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.659
 stamp will be a great jungle you who 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.129
 think about this business they like to leave me 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.299
 your opinions in the comments do not 

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.920
 forget that you the channel for more 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.450

 robben master and see you until the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.009

 yes
