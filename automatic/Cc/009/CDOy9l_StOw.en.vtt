 bavarian fans are now sitting us the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.859
 thumb press, saying that would be 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.080
 It would have been really great 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.859

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.450
 because that's why that's important 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.850
 thumbs through the thumb for the bavaria 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.350
 that you do not get a gate because heynckes 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.329
 has the shock himself says the front is 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.129
 always something with us that means with greens 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.180
 to zero at home and that's the best 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.250
 starting position 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.730
 so and now the best starting position 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.579
 for us person evening is half 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.460
 crate beer three bags of chips or is it 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.190
 the festivals from austria it is so we 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.350
 but I know well against the game 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.210
 Do not do anything but we want it if 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.379
 We then eat chips or clips then 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 We know that heap 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.450
 shit is in there too 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.490
 trans fat in it is the earth that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.170
 fat in there knows everything in there and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.750
 I thought you had to do something 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.130
 do something else and what tastes good 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.080
 because one wants to so evening a 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.000
 enjoyment enjoy and stupid by a 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.920
 coincidence 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.630
 and now I see an increase 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.850
 at lidl cashewkern and down there 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.270
 natural cashew kernels natural 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.990
 200 grams 1 euro 170 people in mine 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.250
 opinion to start and then I have 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.079
 I thought there must be something out of it 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.909
 can tinker and what is delicious 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.220
 what are you fit to me as well 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.570
 tastes like chips replenishing lips well 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.399
 just do not have the disadvantages with the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.200
 trans fat and so on and so forth 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.509
 and that there actually is 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.380
 nothing inside for the tip except fat salt 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.630
 and carbohydrates, but that's me 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.729
 thought if we are already fat and salt 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.020
 carbohydrates then feed biggs and 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.250
 dunks and with power and that's why 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.429
 I think about it and I have it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.689
 already built the first few 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.329

 you have everything in such a way 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.150
 natural nut is in it and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.430
 In addition, you still have to decide 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.159
 taste and now very important for 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.549

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:42.230
