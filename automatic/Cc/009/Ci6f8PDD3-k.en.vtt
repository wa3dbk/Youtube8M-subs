00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.670
 little friend, let's just teach how to work 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.070
 this pretty flower in organza can 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.680
 make also in satin ribbon the ribbon 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.150
 fails the tape that you want and you 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.640
 let's teach how to make these 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.279
 small decorative pins that can 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.670
 use to decorate this or any 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:31.420
 another other accessory are very easy to 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:36.010
 elaborate we are going to use 8 strips of 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.600
 tape 4 centimeters wide and 8 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.430
 centimeters long 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.100
 when they have cut eight 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:48.180
 you're going to bend the tips 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.969
 in this way then turn towards the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.969
 center should be this figurine 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.990
 here we organize that we keep the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.990
 tips 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:05.120
 well joined all sides when the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.810
 so you are going to double this 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.960
 tip towards the middle 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.049
 how is organza ribbon is a little bit 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.860
 complicated to work here you go 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:23.980
 to seal with the heat of the candle or the 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:28.350
 lighter and they will use needle and thread 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.350
 they're going to start sewing 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.149
 to all 8 petals to form 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.149
 our flower 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:42.640
 they are going to happen this way here already 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:46.140
 we already have all the petals advanced 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.830
 let's join the flower 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.320
 and this flower is very easy very simple 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.660
 if you want, you can make one of 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.670
 less petals place it on top so that 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:02.180
 the accessory that gives several layers 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.220
 We already give you the idea 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.220
 they develop creativity here already 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.610
 we cut the thread we organize our 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.610
 little flower 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.560
 in the back we're going to put him 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.070
 the inmate to be able to then place the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.070
 center 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.530
 and so it will be for you to organize 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.640
 the petals are going to be the little flower 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.640
 thus 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.269
 you can put any accessory on 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.000
 center one button whatever it is here 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.209
 we have this tiny flower that we have 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.190
 already elaborated in a previous video that 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.580
 we are going to place you can place 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.640
 any other button doll by itself 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.940
 micro does not apply what you want 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.940
 here we have 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.420
 flowers and it's finished now let's go 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.470
 to teach how to make the pins 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.350
 they are going to get flexible wire comes 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.720
 in different golden silver colors 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:25.050
 well in aluminum color and in this 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.840
 pink copper color the color that you 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.880
 want are flexible wires for 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.520
 crafts and you ask for it with that 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:39.320
 name we're going to use a spheroid to 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.320
 can start rolling 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.990
 and put together what is 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.170
 If that little apply, you do it to 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.000
 the measure that you want here already 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.050
 we roll up 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.930
 three times we cut with a wire goes 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.990
 to stay this way they will open it if 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.380
 you want as you want to leave the 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.380
 churros quito 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.070
 here we go 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.580
 to apply silicone 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.600
 to be able to enter it in the center of 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.600
 the flower 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.130
 there it is staying and you can place a 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.140
 miniature little miniature that you 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.460
 can make with centimeter tape 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.140
 you can use appliques already purchased 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.000
 here we have a little flower that already 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.780

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.050
 of the little flower 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.050
 we stick it 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.020
 let it dry 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.550
