00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
example of what I've already done but

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.260 
example of what I've already done but
let<00:00:14.370> me<00:00:15.590> do<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> fresh<00:00:19.160> fresh<00:00:20.160> gluing<00:00:20.670> here<00:00:20.939> for

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
let me do a fresh fresh gluing here for

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.820 
let me do a fresh fresh gluing here for
you<00:00:21.680> so<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.890> basic<00:00:23.250> idea<00:00:23.630> is<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.650> put

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
you so the basic idea is that you put

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.240 
you so the basic idea is that you put
your<00:00:26.039> CA<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.849> need<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.990> attach<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.680> piece

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
your CA I need to attach this piece

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.330 
your CA I need to attach this piece
first<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.240> give<00:00:31.109> me<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> second<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.800> may<00:00:32.040> cut<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
first so give me a second I may cut the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.889 
first so give me a second I may cut the
video<00:00:32.730> depending<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.300> how<00:00:33.450> long<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.960> takes

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
video depending on how long this takes

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.310 
video depending on how long this takes
one<00:00:36.899> thing<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> don't<00:00:37.469> want<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:39.320> get

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
this piece which I've already done to a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.870 
this piece which I've already done to a
large<00:01:33.390> degree<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.430> were<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.640> really

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
large degree so there were some really

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.020 
large degree so there were some really
bad<00:01:36.210> horrible<00:01:36.570> seams<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.829> all<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.820> did

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
bad horrible seams in here so all I did

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.690 
bad horrible seams in here so all I did
was<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> glue<00:01:40.079> beated<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.159> into<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
was take the glue beated it into the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.840 
was take the glue beated it into the
scene<00:01:42.350> put<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> baking<00:01:43.829> soda<00:01:44.070> over<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.549> filed

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
scene put the baking soda over it filed

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
scene put the baking soda over it filed
it<00:01:45.060> down<00:01:45.299> put<00:01:45.720> some<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.170> until<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> filled

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
it down put some more in until it filled

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.389 
it down put some more in until it filled
up<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.409> this<00:01:49.409> definitely<00:01:49.829> feels<00:01:50.130> pretty

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
up and this definitely feels pretty

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.010 
up and this definitely feels pretty
smooth<00:01:50.700> I'll<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.240> know<00:01:51.420> when<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> primer

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
smooth I'll really know when the primer

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.670 
smooth I'll really know when the primer
goes<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> threw<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.320> over<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
goes on and then I threw it all over the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
goes on and then I threw it all over the
place<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> inside<00:01:56.670> tear<00:01:57.000> around<00:01:57.329> every

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
place on the inside tear around every

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.889 
place on the inside tear around every
single<00:01:57.810> seam<00:01:58.490> that's<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.719> can

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
single seam that's going on you can

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.260 
single seam that's going on you can
definitely<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.710> too<00:02:02.040> big<00:02:02.729> result

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
definitely see it too big result

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.710 
definitely see it too big result
see<00:02:05.270> where<00:02:06.170> is<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.290> good<00:02:06.500> angle<00:02:07.360> right<00:02:08.360> there<00:02:08.600> in

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
see where is a good angle right there in

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.490 
see where is a good angle right there in
the<00:02:08.810> middle<00:02:09.050> maybe<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:11.600> front<00:02:11.870> panel<00:02:12.110> looked

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
the middle maybe this front panel looked

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.830 
the middle maybe this front panel looked
really<00:02:12.860> weak<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:14.209> blobbed<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.720> all

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
really weak so I just blobbed it all

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.750 
really weak so I just blobbed it all
over<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> place<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.630> poured<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.810> down<00:02:18.760> over

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
over the place and poured it down over

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.170 
over the place and poured it down over
here<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.390> wall<00:02:21.310> if<00:02:22.310> it's<00:02:22.550> going<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.850> show

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.449 

this<00:02:26.180> was<00:02:26.420> where<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.660> cracked<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.709> resin<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.430> I

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
this was where I cracked the resin so I

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.490 
this was where I cracked the resin so I
put<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.880> bunch<00:02:29.120> down<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.780> inside<00:02:30.140> there

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
put a bunch down on the inside there

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.410 
put a bunch down on the inside there
just<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.310> beef<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:31.700> up<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.610> just<00:02:34.970> generally

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
just to beef it up and just generally

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.059 
just to beef it up and just generally
smeared<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.870> all<00:02:35.959> over<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.410> place<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:36.920> this

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
smeared it all over the place so this

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.830 
smeared it all over the place so this
thing<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.459> rock-hard<00:02:37.730> that's<00:02:38.269> not<00:02:38.510> going

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
thing is rock-hard that's not going

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.650 
thing is rock-hard that's not going
anywhere<00:02:39.280> which<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.580> way<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.819> needs<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.150> be

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
anywhere which is the way it needs to be

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.570 
anywhere which is the way it needs to be
I<00:02:41.690> imagine<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.470> downside<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.250> you'll

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
I imagine the downside is that you'll

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.070 
I imagine the downside is that you'll
never<00:02:43.790> be<00:02:44.000> able<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.269> pull<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.569> parts<00:02:44.840> apart

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
never be able to pull the parts apart

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.259 
never be able to pull the parts apart
again<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:48.290> one<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.459> things<00:02:49.640> I'll<00:02:49.819> be<00:02:49.850> doing

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
again so one of the things I'll be doing

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.600 
again so one of the things I'll be doing
with<00:02:50.420> this<00:02:50.630> kit<00:02:50.870> is<00:02:51.110> once<00:02:51.350> I<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.920> set<00:02:52.190> in

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
with this kit is once I get this set in

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.509 
with this kit is once I get this set in
I'll<00:02:52.720> beat<00:02:53.720> glue<00:02:54.050> all<00:02:54.260> around<00:02:54.470> this<00:02:55.100> works

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
I'll beat glue all around this works

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.640 
I'll beat glue all around this works
with<00:02:55.819> regular<00:02:56.690> CA<00:02:57.350> or<00:02:57.769> gel<00:02:59.319> what's<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.530> other

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
with regular CA or gel what's the other

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.979 
with regular CA or gel what's the other
phrase<00:03:01.580> for<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:01.970> stuff<00:03:02.299> gap-filling

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
phrase for this stuff gap-filling

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.059 
phrase for this stuff gap-filling
probably<00:03:03.920> superglue<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:06.019> either<00:03:06.500> way<00:03:06.799> it

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
probably superglue so either way it

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.220 
probably superglue so either way it
works<00:03:07.310> out<00:03:07.549> great<00:03:07.760> I'm<00:03:08.150> just<00:03:08.209> not<00:03:08.690> quite<00:03:08.900> ready

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
works out great I'm just not quite ready

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.620 
works out great I'm just not quite ready
to<00:03:09.350> glue<00:03:10.130> this<00:03:10.340> piece<00:03:10.640> in<00:03:10.880> place<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.540> don't

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
to glue this piece in place so I don't

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.270 
to glue this piece in place so I don't
want<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.049> do<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.290> for<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.620> right<00:03:12.650> now<00:03:12.829> on<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
want to do it for you right now on the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.300 
want to do it for you right now on the
camera<00:03:13.720> but<00:03:14.720> well<00:03:15.410> let<00:03:15.620> me<00:03:15.650> turn<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.010> camera

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
camera but well let me turn the camera

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.490 
camera but well let me turn the camera
off<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.489> I'll<00:03:16.790> think<00:03:17.000> about<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.570> I'll

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
off and I'll think about it and I'll

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.620 
off and I'll think about it and I'll
turn<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:18.980> back<00:03:19.130> on<00:03:19.340> in<00:03:19.519> a<00:03:19.609> minute<00:03:22.239> all<00:03:23.239> right<00:03:23.390> so

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
turn it back on in a minute all right so

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.810 
turn it back on in a minute all right so
I<00:03:23.660> glued<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.109> bottom<00:03:24.410> in<00:03:24.560> here<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.980> just<00:03:25.519> packed

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
I glued the bottom in here I just packed

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.800 
I glued the bottom in here I just packed
it<00:03:26.030> with<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.209> couple<00:03:26.660> drops<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.350> regular<00:03:28.250> CA<00:03:28.810> but

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
it with a couple drops of regular CA but

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.599 
it with a couple drops of regular CA but
there<00:03:30.049> are<00:03:30.140> some<00:03:30.410> gaps<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:32.859> and<00:03:33.859> bead<00:03:34.130> some<00:03:34.489> of

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
there are some gaps so and bead some of

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.530 
there are some gaps so and bead some of
this<00:03:34.700> around<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.269> corners<00:03:36.940> or<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:37.970> edges

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
this around the corners or the edges

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:59.600 
this around the corners or the edges
rather

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.119 

all<00:04:00.610> right<00:04:04.200> they<00:04:05.200> got<00:04:05.379> a<00:04:05.410> nice<00:04:05.590> little<00:04:05.799> bead

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
all right they got a nice little bead

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:28.670 
all right they got a nice little bead
all<00:04:06.370> around<00:04:15.120> just<00:04:17.250> swish<00:04:18.250> this<00:04:18.489> around<00:04:18.850> here

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.650 

and<00:04:29.680> let's<00:04:29.889> see<00:04:30.130> if<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.400> picks<00:04:30.610> up<00:04:30.910> on<00:04:31.120> camera

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
and let's see if that picks up on camera

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.340 
and let's see if that picks up on camera
maybe<00:04:34.660> maybe<00:04:35.080> not<00:04:35.639> but<00:04:39.510> yeah<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:40.870> smearing

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
maybe maybe not but yeah so smearing

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.600 
maybe maybe not but yeah so smearing
that<00:04:41.380> around<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:42.010> just<00:04:43.050> how<00:04:44.160> kind<00:04:45.160> of<00:04:45.220> got<00:04:45.400> some

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that around I just how kind of got some

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.810 
that around I just how kind of got some
hot<00:04:45.820> going<00:04:46.210> on<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.450> finger<00:04:46.750> here<00:04:47.099> so<00:04:48.099> let's

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
hot going on the finger here so let's

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.050 
hot going on the finger here so let's
take<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:50.410> spoon<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:51.190> I<00:04:53.789> should<00:04:54.789> have<00:04:54.880> done

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
take the spoon and I should have done

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.250 
take the spoon and I should have done
this<00:04:55.270> first<00:04:57.240> since<00:04:58.240> it's<00:04:58.389> gel<00:04:58.750> it's<00:04:58.990> easily

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
this first since it's gel it's easily

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:09.460 
this first since it's gel it's easily
smeared

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.450 

and<00:05:10.470> we'll<00:05:10.680> put<00:05:10.920> a<00:05:10.950> little<00:05:11.190> more<00:05:11.400> back<00:05:11.610> in

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
and we'll put a little more back in

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:25.970 
and we'll put a little more back in
swish<00:05:14.460> that<00:05:14.730> around<00:05:14.760> again<00:05:24.710> doing<00:05:25.710> this<00:05:25.830> a<00:05:25.890> few

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
swish that around again doing this a few

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.220 
swish that around again doing this a few
times<00:05:26.190> this<00:05:26.940> will<00:05:27.150> build<00:05:27.330> up<00:05:27.570> a<00:05:27.780> really<00:05:28.170> nice

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
times this will build up a really nice

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.220 
times this will build up a really nice
seal<00:05:31.230> and<00:05:32.210> there's<00:05:33.210> nothing<00:05:33.720> short<00:05:33.990> of<00:05:34.140> a

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
seal and there's nothing short of a

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.760 
seal and there's nothing short of a
hammer<00:05:34.470> that's<00:05:34.770> going<00:05:34.950> to<00:05:35.010> get<00:05:35.160> that<00:05:35.310> loose<00:05:36.770> so

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
hammer that's going to get that loose so

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.290 
hammer that's going to get that loose so
again<00:05:37.980> be<00:05:38.220> careful<00:05:38.610> about<00:05:38.760> getting<00:05:38.820> it<00:05:39.210> on

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
again be careful about getting it on

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.210 
again be careful about getting it on
your<00:05:39.450> fingers<00:05:39.810> this<00:05:40.260> is<00:05:40.470> really<00:05:40.830> hot<00:05:41.010> right

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
your fingers this is really hot right

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.930 
your fingers this is really hot right
now<00:05:41.490> it<00:05:42.030> cools<00:05:42.330> kind<00:05:42.750> of<00:05:42.870> fast<00:05:43.110> but<00:05:43.530> not<00:05:44.130> fast

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
now it cools kind of fast but not fast

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.940 
now it cools kind of fast but not fast
enough<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.840> get<00:05:46.230> rid<00:05:46.380> of<00:05:46.500> any<00:05:46.620> pain<00:05:48.830> so<00:05:49.830> with

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
enough to get rid of any pain so with

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.200 
enough to get rid of any pain so with
the<00:05:50.040> baking<00:05:50.400> soda<00:05:50.430> in<00:05:50.850> here

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
the baking soda in here

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.740 
the baking soda in here
rock<00:05:52.140> hard<00:05:52.970> that's<00:05:53.970> not<00:05:54.240> going<00:05:54.420> to<00:05:54.480> pull<00:05:54.660> apart

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
rock hard that's not going to pull apart

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.960 
rock hard that's not going to pull apart
whatsoever<00:05:57.650> and<00:05:58.650> again<00:05:58.890> doing<00:05:59.610> it<00:05:59.730> on<00:05:59.820> the

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
whatsoever and again doing it on the

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.460 
whatsoever and again doing it on the
outside<00:06:00.330> you<00:06:00.510> can<00:06:00.660> definitely<00:06:00.810> get<00:06:01.170> a<00:06:01.230> nice

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
outside you can definitely get a nice
