about flying the classic edge 540 now

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.110 
about flying the classic edge 540 now
you<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.260> three<00:02:37.560> ways<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.799> do<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.459> because

you have three ways to do it and because
they're<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:39.600> from<00:02:39.780> great<00:02:39.989> planes<00:02:40.109> you<00:02:40.799> can't

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
they're all from great planes you can't

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.900 
they're all from great planes you can't
go<00:02:41.250> wrong<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:41.579> any<00:02:41.639> of<00:02:42.000> them

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
go wrong with any of them
