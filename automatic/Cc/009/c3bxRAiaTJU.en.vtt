 in your project window

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.720
 she finishes 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.670

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.330
 end of the movie 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.060
 but if the movie is larger than the song 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.600
 you can drag one with another song for the efficiency of your 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.050
 project 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.400
