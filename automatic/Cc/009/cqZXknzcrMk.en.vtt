00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.910
 kamilla for miguel praia by sitev e 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.890
 for all others but at the time 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.750
 they watch the before death and they go 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.519
 excuse me and also several others 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.040
 people in Brazil for not yet 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.920
 to know the incredible society very well 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.230
 which is Manaus or at least not until 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.820
 people read this true masterpiece of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.320
 Brazilian literature 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.320
 two brothers from milton hatoum 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.400
 Look, this is it. I'm in London. 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.890
 It's like this in Paris and this last one I 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.949
 in lisboa and maybe you 're even 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.050
 thinking damn not very traveled but is 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.170
 only printed and traveled would be 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.220
 had gone to exotic places 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.260
 Real strangers, I just went to 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.879
 very normal places, not because it looks 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.409
 once I heard of a place 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.530
 called bizarre is amazon and it seems that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.409
 has a city ​​within that state is 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.080
 mana manaus talk anything like this 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.479
 is a city in the middle of the forest thing 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.400
 more crazy and it seems that there are two rivers 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.500
 so it is that are so there is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.420
 black and brown they meet to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 a line so crazy thing these 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 Supervision places so never visited 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.110
 My god, it does not look like anyone will think 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.640
 I'm serious and before you come. 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.710
 here scold me in the comments 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.800
 I was being ironic you put 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.810
 here an ironic ironic red sign 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.430
 ironic but in fact I just did this 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.590
 joking because the first feeling 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.270
 that I had when I read two brothers and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.890
 were the various feelings I had 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.620
 I'll talk about it soon but the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.020
 first I had was the feeling of 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.600
 Shame Shame Shame on me 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 same shame because I realized that I 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640
 I know a lot more, I feel much. 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.360
 nearest cities like new york 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.700
 london los angeles tokyo sydney in 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.350
 in countries where people in the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.800
 certainly know very little about the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.819
 Brazil that I know about the 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.769
 amazon 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.500
 look how ridiculous when milton hatoum 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.870
 describes the urban effervescence of 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.849
 manaus five because we have 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.860
 to think that there is only one forest when 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.870
 in fact a super-developed city 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.540
 when he speaks of urban effervescence 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.569
 of the heartbeat when he quotes the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.640
 name of trees fruit bugs 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.700
 finally, when he speaks of the culture of 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.240
 manaus of Amazonian culture I felt 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.950
 almost a gringa from my own country 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.650
 I've never heard of anything about it. 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.600
 is that we here in the southeast and notice that 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.030
 I 'm not talking about everyone else. 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.310
 I 'm sure I 'm talking about myself. 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.340
 we often take a stand 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.740
 very arrogant towards others 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.690
 brazil states mainly 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.340
 northern states of the northeast 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.380
 I, for example, know people who have already 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.260
 went on safari in Africa but never saw 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.420
 the world's largest forest than the forest 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.950
 Amazon with their own eyes 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.010
 It seems that we care more 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.630
 from the outside, people twist the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.930
 nose for our own riches 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.210
 including literature are 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.250
 subject that debates it a little in that 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.040
 video because we only read the books 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.720
 gringos if you have not seen it worth giving 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.000
 A little glance and you know what else I 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.250
 I felt ashamed of myself 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.500
 feel a huge pride of milton atom 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.380
 With you, you are my relative, my 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.870
 friend for being a Brazilian writer 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.940
 writer who managed to 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.680
 to overcome the worst of all prejudices 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.230
 that the prejudice that comes from the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.030
 brazilians in the southern Brazilians as 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.850
 I and he got it being 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.530
 spectacular being extremely talented 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.310
 if you still do not know milton 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.180
 Ratton is 62 years old and only five books 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.430
 published 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.740
 but is already considered one of the largest 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.120
 Brazilian writers undoubtedly 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.100
 My opinion, he is the greatest writer. 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.840
 Brazilian and I'm sure that 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.940
 will still be studied by our 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.740
 children and our grandchildren at school as 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.100
 a great national writer so much that 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.160
 His work is phenomenal that he was once 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.580
 translated into several languages ​​and 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.290
 books leaked 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.090
 so much that his work is phenomenal than 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.240
 it has already been translated into several languages 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.040
 and now in their books and meetings 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.940
 are being adapted for the cinema and 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.940
 to the tv 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.930
 moreover, the ten-chapter miniseries of 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.940
 I put on the book two brothers is already 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.740
 recorded and I think the forecast of 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.740
 debut is october 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.060
 have to read before in a single problem is 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.220
 that the actor who will make the 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.009
 protagonists of the story the two brothers 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.870
 twins is the reymond because not nothing 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.180
 against him, you 're welcome. 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.669
 But it reminds me too much of that. 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.530
 atrocity that the globe did with a 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.330
 classic of literature from Pernambuco to 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.130
 the new street 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.940
 have transformed into a new finish line 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.319
 happy 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.880
 if you want to understand better what I am 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.400
 This review is the subjective opinion of an individual contributor and not of the company. 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.750
 It has nothing to do with the miniseries. 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.639
 stolen loves 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.620
 so look at the globe see if it will not do 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.360
 the same thing with two brothers air be 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.460
 faithful to the book because it's too good 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.050
 for you to play but enough to talk about 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.509
 I'm going to end up giving a spoiler and 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.280
 let's go straight to the synopsis two brothers 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.349
 tells the story of two twin brothers 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.250
 descendants of Lebanese born in 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.159
 manaus 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.720
 their name is the sea and the guilt and the people 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.940
 with their story from childhood through 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.400
 adult life at the beginning seems to 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.110
 that story of the two twins who are 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.159
 equal but opposite faces of 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.419
 personality 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.639
 Who knows a little of the Bible? 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.889
 will also recognize the history of the error 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.840
 and of the josh that is in the book of Genesis 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.250
 who are twin brothers who are rivals to 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.830
 Mom likes more than one has more 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.570
 privileges that others dispute for our 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.849
 ax of assis was also inspired 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.979
 in this biblical story to write the 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.440
 story of the twin brothers pedro paulo 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.969
 who are also rivals if they hate each other 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.550
 the same woman thing and such 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:01.070
 two brothers is not built in 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.599
 cliches, on the contrary, it is 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.550
 an extremely original story 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:08.180
 surrounding is a family drama. 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.030
 which in many passages is extremely 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.509
 cruel then if you've ever seen a novel that 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.310
 has the gm the good versus the gm love forgets 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.810
 there is no such difference 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.690
 two brothers tells the story of two 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:24.139
 extremely real humans 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:27.080
 convincing tocantins and who are taken 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.990
 through life a trajectory of hatred and 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.729
 resentment that you certainly do not 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.349
 will remain indifferent 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:38.000
 I do not know you but in my family. 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:41.120
 has cases of eseu and jacó pedro paulo and 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.110
 Covered May then this book touched me 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.230
 I played twice already in this 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.240
 River two days is a book that you can not 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.700
 letting go and knowing just who 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.440
 It made me want to reread two brothers. 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.970
 just a gringa was mine 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.100
 french teacher 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.170
 She's from France. She was reading two brothers. 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.610
 and she kept telling me so much that she 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.410
 I was finding a good book. 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.480
 exciting but she had a lot of 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.540
 difficulty in understanding this because 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.270
 text of two brothers is full of rhythm and 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.970
 full of poetry full of those words 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.670
 that only those who are Brazilian will 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.760
 fully understand what they mean 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:21.690
 I just as we are privileged 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.430
 in terms of literature and if you
