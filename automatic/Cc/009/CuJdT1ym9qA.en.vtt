other<00:00:19.340> Tommy<00:00:20.369> all<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.510> super<00:00:21.949> waitress

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
other Tommy all this is super waitress

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.920 
other Tommy all this is super waitress
I'm<00:00:23.100> guessing<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:24.019> third<00:00:25.019> part<00:00:25.350> number<00:00:25.800> de<00:00:26.930> la

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
I'm guessing a third part number de la

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.759 
I'm guessing a third part number de la
ciudad<00:00:28.710> en<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.480> non-zero<00:00:30.480> digit<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.990> also

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
ciudad en a non-zero digit so also

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.340 
ciudad en a non-zero digit so also
assembly<00:00:32.279> suppose<00:00:33.090> ended<00:00:33.690> there

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
assembly suppose ended there

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.889 
assembly suppose ended there
I'm<00:00:34.860> saying<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.340> will<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.899> artistic

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I'm saying that there will be artistic

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.959 
I'm saying that there will be artistic
relatives<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.469> some<00:00:37.730> values<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
relatives for some values the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.130 
relatives for some values the
combinations<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.219> very<00:00:45.140> short

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
combinations so this is a very short

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.400 
combinations so this is a very short
connect<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.489> answer<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.800> suppose

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
connect what the answer in here suppose

because I is true that spelling take two

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.660 
because I is true that spelling take two
words<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:19.030> then<00:02:20.030> we<00:02:20.690> simplify<00:02:21.230> this<00:02:21.650> all<00:02:21.920> so

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
words and then we simplify this all so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.870 
words and then we simplify this all so
we<00:02:22.910> get<00:02:23.120> 1<00:02:23.450> 3<00:02:23.600> -<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.910> we<00:02:25.910> try<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.540> by<00:02:27.200> virgin<00:02:27.880> we

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
we get 1 3 - if we try this by virgin we

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.270 
we get 1 3 - if we try this by virgin we
have<00:02:29.090> six<00:02:29.450> possibilities<00:02:30.050> because<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.100> have

because 2 D people have to me and
because<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:22.310> remember<00:03:23.000> we<00:03:23.150> have<00:03:23.299> to<00:03:23.420> make<00:03:23.630> so

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
because to remember we have to make so

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.160 
because to remember we have to make so
we<00:03:24.320> considered<00:03:24.950> two<00:03:25.160> ones<00:03:25.430> as<00:03:25.900> per<00:03:26.900> this

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
we considered two ones as per this

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.500 
we considered two ones as per this
shortcut<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:29.350> after<00:03:30.350> computing<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.190> all<00:03:31.510> we

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
shortcut and after computing this all we

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.310 
shortcut and after computing this all we
act<00:03:32.750> we<00:03:32.989> three<00:03:33.230> zero<00:03:33.560> try<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.459> also

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
act we three zero try this also

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.280 
act we three zero try this also
biologically<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.920> if<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:38.000> get<00:03:38.269> any<00:03:38.540> error<00:03:38.900> or
