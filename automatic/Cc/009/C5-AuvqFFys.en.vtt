00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
heat can blow the whole blender up and

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.970 
heat can blow the whole blender up and
believe<00:04:29.750> me<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.930> have<00:04:29.990> learned<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.950> hard

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
believe me I have learned this the hard

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.130 
believe me I have learned this the hard
way<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.090> two<00:04:32.270> tips<00:04:32.570> that<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.810> would<00:04:32.900> give

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
way so the two tips that I would give

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.200 
way so the two tips that I would give
you<00:04:33.260> is<00:04:33.290> number<00:04:33.620> one<00:04:33.770> never<00:04:34.430> fill<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.060> blender

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
you is number one never fill the blender

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.950 
you is number one never fill the blender
more<00:04:35.660> than<00:04:35.810> halfway<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.530> number<00:04:37.460> two<00:04:37.880> I<00:04:38.300> like

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
more than halfway and number two I like

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.530 
more than halfway and number two I like
to<00:04:39.170> leave<00:04:39.320> just<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.920> littlest<00:04:40.400> pocket<00:04:40.970> of<00:04:41.120> air

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
to leave just the littlest pocket of air

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.600 
to leave just the littlest pocket of air
right<00:04:42.380> at<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.620> top<00:04:42.800> of<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:43.040> blender<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.550> then

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
right at the top of the blender and then

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.860 
right at the top of the blender and then
what<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.240> do<00:04:44.390> spout<00:04:45.350> facing<00:04:45.920> away<00:04:46.040> from<00:04:46.160> me<00:04:46.370> I

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
what I do spout facing away from me I

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.620 
what I do spout facing away from me I
take<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:47.900> towel<00:04:48.170> and<00:04:48.530> I<00:04:48.950> just<00:04:49.250> hold<00:04:50.180> it<00:04:50.390> tightly

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
take a towel and I just hold it tightly

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.720 
take a towel and I just hold it tightly
over<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:51.140> top<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:51.560> then<00:04:51.980> when<00:04:52.160> I<00:04:52.190> turn<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:52.610> on

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
over the top and then when I turn it on

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.330 
over the top and then when I turn it on
if<00:04:53.030> that<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.900> pressure<00:04:54.170> needs<00:04:54.440> to<00:04:54.560> blow<00:04:54.920> the

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
if that the pressure needs to blow the

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.500 
if that the pressure needs to blow the
air<00:04:55.520> can<00:04:55.730> get<00:04:55.820> out<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.180> whole<00:04:56.330> thing

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
air can get out and the whole thing

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.570 
air can get out and the whole thing
doesn't<00:04:56.780> explode<00:04:57.140> and<00:04:57.440> if<00:04:57.920> it<00:04:58.040> decides<00:04:58.370> to

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
doesn't explode and if it decides to

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.280 
doesn't explode and if it decides to
spit<00:04:58.790> up<00:04:58.820> a<00:04:59.000> little<00:04:59.180> at<00:04:59.480> least<00:04:59.780> it's<00:04:59.960> going<00:05:00.110> in

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
spit up a little at least it's going in

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.380 
spit up a little at least it's going in
the<00:05:00.350> opposite<00:05:00.710> direction<00:05:01.060> I'm<00:05:02.060> going<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.270> turn

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
the opposite direction I'm going to turn

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
the opposite direction I'm going to turn
this<00:05:02.510> on<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.840> give<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.050> quick<00:05:03.230> whirl<00:05:08.410> giving

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
this on and give it a quick whirl giving

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.050
