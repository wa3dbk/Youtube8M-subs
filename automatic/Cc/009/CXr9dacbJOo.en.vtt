the you know like not being allowed to

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.749 
the you know like not being allowed to
do<00:00:04.680> what<00:00:04.859> we<00:00:04.950> want<00:00:05.129> it<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.279> take<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.580> idea

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
do what we want it you take this idea

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.610 
do what we want it you take this idea
and<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.359> idea<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.750> may<00:00:06.870> be<00:00:06.930> combined<00:00:07.410> them

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
and that idea you may be combined them

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.500 
and that idea you may be combined them
they<00:00:07.740> get<00:00:07.890> some<00:00:08.070> mutant<00:00:08.490> offspring<00:00:08.730> it's

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
they get some mutant offspring it's

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.340 
they get some mutant offspring it's
illness<00:00:10.070> so<00:00:11.720> you<00:00:12.720> get<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:12.990> idea<00:00:13.140> that

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
illness so you get this idea that

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.110
