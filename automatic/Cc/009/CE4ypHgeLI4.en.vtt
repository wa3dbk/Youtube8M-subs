00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.650
 - I will not be able to discover that you want to revolutionize 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.379
 the game setting 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.859
 in the first person is the same 1 to 0 nor dead 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.400
 much more than this is done by the same problem a true 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:30.119
 three prostitutes of pedophilia who were tired of killing Nazis in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.310
 decisive games world war ii 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.450
 I already knew 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.570
 now this change should come up the clique than expected 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.280
 one hundred percent 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.370
 contemporary boaventura by the big city starring but and oscar 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.960
 apparently do not have 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.050
 a lot of love to life 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.170
 because it jumps from building to building as if the fact 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.670
 weighed possible fall was not to make a turn of the year 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.630
 the game for a change behind a very different gameplay being that you play in 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.390
 first person and the main actions are around moving around the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.560
 scenery in several different forms norman several different shapes said 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.630
 to go through the obstacles you must 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.060
 run to jump higher of the climb climbed up the wall at the best 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.250
 Tehran style 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.930
 turn somersaults and even walk on the tightrope of one of the buildings frau 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.950
 the intention of the game was to give a real freedom the player 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.260
 and not make it recorded because there is only one series that had 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.920
 in front of you 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.940
 the combat mode there are also many other ways of fighting others 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.730
 are present herein as for example 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.450
 the popular to give a support in the chest of the political punches and kicks normal and 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.580
 also with the referee 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.210
 The main color to disarm the villains pick up your sex toys 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 and all this without losing the effect 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.750
 since I played almost sports 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.290
 could not miss the health 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.080
 using playstation control space motion sensors 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.220
 having to balance the fate from side to side without prestige 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.620
 in the actions take off and mess up from a shake in the control group think of 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.249
 crisis the occupation 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:27.519
 something that may go unnoticed by the most used but it is something 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.359
 to take off your hat is the fact that you look down 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.629
 and see your foot 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.859
 of your complex 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.260
 notice the first-person games you do when you look down 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.939
 or simply philanthropic works suffocate 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.069
 this title is not one that you take control of your friend's hand from 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.359
 already leave playing 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.459
 Bethlehem town of buttons and stock used pastore high enough 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.269
 so that the ciro learns all the ways and possibilities of locomotion 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.929
 and skills that will be the protagonist of poverty 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:06.229
 tattooed 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.919
 that's why
