00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.010 
this bit of the actual heart here
because<00:02:23.720> that's<00:02:23.840> going<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.260> be<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.530> neck<00:02:26.020> just

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
on top if you want to use a little bit

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.449 
on top if you want to use a little bit
of<00:02:39.140> water<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.680> works<00:02:39.890> too

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
of water that works too

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.280 
of water that works too
if<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:41.030> just<00:02:41.240> put<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:41.600> there<00:02:42.050> you

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
if you can just put it on there you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.490 
if you can just put it on there you
should<00:02:42.500> also<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:42.950> stick<00:02:43.310> just<00:02:43.520> like<00:02:43.670> that

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
should also just stick just like that

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.380 
should also just stick just like that

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
see the petal tip I'm just going to cut

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.660 
see the petal tip I'm just going to cut
out<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:02.180> petal<00:03:02.660> shape<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:05.380> then<00:03:06.380> as<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:07.310> logo

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
is slightly bigger on one side I'm just

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.600 
is slightly bigger on one side I'm just
going<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:10.970> place<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.600> tip<00:03:11.840> over<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.459> give

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
going to place the tip over just to give

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.460 
going to place the tip over just to give
it<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.820> little<00:03:13.970> bit<00:03:14.209> more<00:03:14.480> length<00:03:14.720> on<00:03:15.019> one<00:03:15.200> side

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
it a little bit more length on one side

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.600 
it a little bit more length on one side
and<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:16.760> go<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.450> pull<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.870> off<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.320> that

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
and just go and pull it off like that

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.240 
and just go and pull it off like that
so<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:19.730> next<00:03:19.970> step<00:03:20.269> for<00:03:20.300> it<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.739> apply<00:03:22.130> a

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
so the next step for it is to apply a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.240 
so the next step for it is to apply a
little<00:03:22.880> bit<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.750> luster<00:03:24.200> dust<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:25.160> if

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
little bit of the luster dust and if

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.949 
little bit of the luster dust and if
you've<00:03:25.430> worked<00:03:25.549> with<00:03:25.700> luster<00:03:26.120> dust<00:03:26.299> you'll

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
you've worked with luster dust you'll

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.780 
you've worked with luster dust you'll
know<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.380> little<00:03:27.560> bit<00:03:27.860> goes<00:03:28.070> a<00:03:28.100> far<00:03:28.400> goes<00:03:28.760> a

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
know that a little bit goes a far goes a

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.509 
know that a little bit goes a far goes a
long<00:03:29.090> way<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:29.630> I'm<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:30.410> brushing<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.980> on<00:03:33.519> very

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
long way so I'm just brushing it on very

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.509 
long way so I'm just brushing it on very
gently<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:36.049> I'm<00:03:36.170> just<00:03:36.380> wanting<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.799> give<00:03:36.980> the

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
gently and I'm just wanting to give the

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.400 
gently and I'm just wanting to give the
logo<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.880> little<00:03:38.209> bit<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.510> Sheen<00:03:38.840> you

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
logo a little bit of Sheen you

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.140 
logo a little bit of Sheen you
definitely<00:03:39.860> don't<00:03:40.040> have<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.489> do<00:03:40.610> this<00:03:40.820> step

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
definitely don't have to do this step

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.180 
definitely don't have to do this step
but<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.810> just<00:03:41.959> adds<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.380> little<00:03:42.530> bit<00:03:42.650> more<00:03:42.799> of<00:03:43.130> a

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
but it just adds a little bit more of a

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.680 
but it just adds a little bit more of a
metallic<00:03:43.519> look<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.090> it

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.009 

the<00:03:47.690> final<00:03:48.049> step<00:03:48.290> here<00:03:48.560> with<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:49.400> logo<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.360> to

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
the final step here with the logo is to

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.100 
the final step here with the logo is to
switch<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.560> very<00:03:51.920> fine<00:03:52.370> tipped<00:03:53.299> brush<00:03:53.720> and

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
switch to a very fine tipped brush and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.830 
switch to a very fine tipped brush and
I'm<00:03:54.680> going<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.040> just<00:03:55.250> dip<00:03:55.549> it<00:03:55.730> into<00:03:55.970> my<00:03:56.480> black

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
I'm going to just dip it into my black

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.350 
I'm going to just dip it into my black
gel<00:03:57.260> paste<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:58.040> I'm<00:03:58.820> just<00:03:59.030> going<00:03:59.269> to
