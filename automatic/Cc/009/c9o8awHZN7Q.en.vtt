00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.409 
peas and lentils so you tell them a
starch<00:03:48.040> based<00:03:48.310> diet<00:03:48.519> that's<00:03:48.669> what<00:03:48.819> they<00:03:48.940> edd

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
starch based diet that's what they edd

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.610 
starch based diet that's what they edd
most<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:50.019> them<00:03:50.139> once<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:50.349> get<00:03:50.470> people

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
most of them once you get people

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.620 
most of them once you get people
convinced<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.430> that<00:03:51.970> their<00:03:52.120> diet<00:03:52.389> is

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
convinced to that that their diet is

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.409 
convinced to that that their diet is
starch<00:03:53.290> they<00:03:53.650> are<00:03:53.889> star<00:03:54.250> cheaters<00:03:54.669> another

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
starch they are star cheaters another

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.909 
starch they are star cheaters another
way<00:03:55.540> of<00:03:55.660> thinking<00:03:55.959> about<00:03:56.109> is<00:03:56.230> they<00:03:56.380> are<00:03:56.500> starch

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
way of thinking about is they are starch

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.400 
way of thinking about is they are starch
of<00:03:56.980> ores<00:03:57.510> just<00:03:58.510> like<00:03:58.660> cats<00:03:58.870> are<00:03:59.049> carnivores

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
of ores just like cats are carnivores

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.460 
of ores just like cats are carnivores
and<00:04:00.000> horses<00:04:01.000> are<00:04:01.090> herbivores<00:04:01.630> people<00:04:02.380> are

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and horses are herbivores people are

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.199 
and horses are herbivores people are
starch<00:04:02.739> of<00:04:02.919> ores<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.790> if<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:03.940> get<00:04:04.060> that

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
starch of ores so if you get that

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.059 
starch of ores so if you get that
concept<00:04:04.630> about<00:04:04.840> starch<00:04:05.200> across<00:04:05.530> than<00:04:05.829> they<00:04:05.950> do

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
concept about starch across than they do

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.190 
concept about starch across than they do
really<00:04:06.280> well<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.819> course<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.630> idea<00:04:07.959> that

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
really well and of course the idea that

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.110 
really well and of course the idea that
you<00:04:08.349> never<00:04:08.650> have<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:08.980> be<00:04:09.099> hungry<00:04:09.280> is<00:04:09.579> very<00:04:09.910> very

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
you never have to be hungry is very very

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.720 
you never have to be hungry is very very
important<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:11.010> it's<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.099> relief<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.430> people

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
important and it's a relief for people

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.839 
important and it's a relief for people
it<00:04:12.910> sets<00:04:13.180> them<00:04:13.359> free<00:04:13.389> to<00:04:14.349> get<00:04:14.560> this<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:15.669> right

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
it sets them free to get this the right

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.279 
it sets them free to get this the right
kind<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.060> food<00:04:16.269> in<00:04:16.419> them<00:04:16.570> they<00:04:16.690> get<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.870> sense<00:04:17.139> of

so fat I mean you have to think about

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.969 
so fat I mean you have to think about
things<00:04:52.150> in<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.449> total<00:04:52.660> perspective<00:04:52.979> you're

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
things in the total perspective you're

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.530 
things in the total perspective you're
suffering<00:04:54.520> you're<00:04:54.639> paying<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:55.090> huge

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
suffering you're paying a huge

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.320 
suffering you're paying a huge
consequence<00:04:56.290> right<00:04:56.560> now<00:04:56.800> as<00:04:57.669> a<00:04:57.729> consequence

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
consequence right now as a consequence

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.560 
consequence right now as a consequence
of<00:04:58.570> incorrect<00:04:59.530> information<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.570> unhealthy

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
of incorrect information and unhealthy

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.930 
of incorrect information and unhealthy
practices<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.800> what<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.040> ask<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.520> do<00:05:03.610> is<00:05:03.729> put

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
practices so what I ask you to do is put

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.090 
practices so what I ask you to do is put
it<00:05:04.030> in<00:05:04.120> perspective<00:05:04.320> think<00:05:05.320> about<00:05:05.560> the

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
it in perspective think about the

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.890 
it in perspective think about the
overall<00:05:06.580> impact<00:05:07.270> it<00:05:07.450> has<00:05:07.570> on<00:05:07.600> your<00:05:07.840> life

overall impact it has on your life

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.230 
overall impact it has on your life
you'll<00:05:08.229> find<00:05:08.560> this<00:05:09.130> kind<00:05:09.310> of<00:05:09.400> dietary<00:05:09.820> change

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
you'll find this kind of dietary change

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.150 
you'll find this kind of dietary change
is<00:05:10.419> really<00:05:10.630> nothing<00:05:10.840> at<00:05:11.110> all<00:05:11.290> you<00:05:11.889> give<00:05:12.040> up

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
is really nothing at all you give up

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.830 
is really nothing at all you give up
nothing<00:05:12.370> but<00:05:12.550> bad<00:05:12.820> health<00:05:13.120> and<00:05:13.360> being
