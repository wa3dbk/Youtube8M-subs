00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.769
 hello everyone I find 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.170
 today for a new video so 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.910
 we continue the videos on on the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.740
 thematic of achieving our goals 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.539
 for this year 2014 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.920
 so we're already elected will be the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.869
 fifth step so like I you 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.990
 had said it in the previous step 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.070
 today we will talk together about 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.369
 tips for trying to hold a 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.779
 healthy diet so I did a 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.250
 listing of both every 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.520
 little hints tips i can you 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.890
 give 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.050
 and bah listen we'll start all of 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.700
 suite so that marks a very thing 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.950
 important is when you do your 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 church races with you it takes to 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.309
 any price you have a list on 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.600
 on you to do your shopping otherwise 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.789
 you will take everything 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.289
 what are you going for in the iron rio 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.340
 by radius could have taken a little bit 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.260
 all you find this is 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.850
 really something not to do and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.860
 when you do the shopping do the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.960
 races full belly never go there 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.789
 empty stomach because there as soon as we have 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.020
 hungry we really want to resume 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.250
 everything that goes on is like that 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.320
 you are going to buy bad things 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.030
 and besides if you have children 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.770
 who are a little bit capricious who have 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.200
 tendency to tell you moment in chelsea where 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.310
 dad buy that I want cakes 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 legs and if I want that you have 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.119
 badly resisted because it becomes 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.439
 really tiring bah I invite you 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.390
 very strongly to let your children 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.770
 at home as much as you can 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.119
 do not take shopping with you 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.040
 otherwise you will buy things that you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.330
 regret buying when you 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.920
 start to want to take care 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.600
 of your diet you need everything 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.820
 price or go around all your 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
 cupboards and to ensure really 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.360
 delete anything that is not good for 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.329
 your diet especially if you have 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.400
 tend to be a little weak 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.720
 like me and cracked on food 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.090
 which are not necessarily very good for 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.560
 you if if you want to do 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 attention really try not to have 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 of elements that fear what to empty 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.299
 your closets and or so put a man 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.920
 in a cupboard under c is you close 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.110
 welcome to give you the key to 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.479
 someone and you will open that up 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.149
 later another very important tip 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.380
 it's when the moment comes to make a 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.140
 meal actually you have to do 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.880
 the meal before you get hungry if you 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.740
 wait to be hungry and ben you go 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.860
 tend to do something 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.050
 quick simple and not necessarily st so 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.140
 you will fall back on sure of 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.790
 all prepared or on things not 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.170
 very good for health so I you 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.250
 really really invites to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.819
 make your meals before the end 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.350
 prevail 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.450
 it is also very good to plan 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.209
 easy quick menus easy to prepare 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.860
 at the advanced you make yourself a little 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.010
 list already it's really very important 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.599
 this to note different menus on a 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.280
 sheet with small recipes or 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.230
 things like that and like that you try 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.610
 to have menus that are easy as 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.569
 you can do like that on the go 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.220
 when you do not have time to do 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.590
 the kitchen you go back in 2010 and 2 of 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.700
 work or so when in the evening you 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.170
 come back a little late and you have not 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.299
 really a lot of time to do the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.620
 kitchen so try to predict 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.720
 recipes that are simple and that are 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.130
 healthy does the trick on the internet I am 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.079
 sure you will find very recipes 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.250
 nice to do so do not hesitate to 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.959
 make simple little recipes like 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.329
 that and keep her under the elbow 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.010
 oh how important it is also for 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.829
 keep a healthy diet and 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.319
 balanced over time to vary your 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.200
 meal really tried to have menus 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.239
 the most varied possible to have 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.430
 varied fruit vegetables to have some 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.200
 varied cereals do not always eat 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.600
 the same thing it's nice that you binge 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.310
 it'll get you tired and then and then a 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.440
 given moment will you get tired and 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.489
 it will be over you will want to take 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.160
 care of your diet 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.710
 so really tried to 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.330
 at most vary the foods vary 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.820
 the types of cooking is time consuming in 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.750
 warm weather of the sweet of the sweet salty 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:41.320
 sweet salty made of cooked half cooked 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.180
 believed was really trying to make your 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.740
 your plates is the most colorful 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.680
 possible and more difference possible 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.480
 from one meal to another so it comes to 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.860
 a next tip that is not 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.570
 really a trick but it's rather or 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.800
 really a habit to take I 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.310
 would say is to learn to love 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.350
 to cook 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.550
 so in the beginning if it's really something 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.440
 thing you do not like doing that is 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.420
 be difficult to get started but 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.120
 try cooking and more and more 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.040
 to finally learn to like that 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.540
 it's like sport it's in these times 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.000
 by making you end up loving that and 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.040
 the kitchen is the same and when we like 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.330
 cooking is here to try 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.550
 to innovate have made more recipes 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.170
 in more interesting and then bah you 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.640
 go you will enjoy 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.170
 eat healthy and it will be a second 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.210
 nature and you will make good 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.590
 little dishes that are that if you do not 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.780
 not a lot of recipe ideas 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.490
 really give yourself a moment in the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.350
 week or once a month where you 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.730
 are you going to increase your 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.200
 recipe directory you go 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.610
 poking a little bit on the internet there is 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.410
 full full of recipes 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.760
 I have a recipe chain myself 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.960
 will put the info bar link as 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.400
 usually if you want to go 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.060
 see these are some of the recipes 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.130
 vegetarian 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.200
 so if you are not truth nothing 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.000
 vegetarian if you are omnivorous's had 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.470
 a classic diet you want 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.500
 from time to time to make recipes 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.960
 I spread yen since being vegan to 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.240
 are necessarily a lot more help for 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.250
 health much less fat so that 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.840
 can be very nice of your at a 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.090
 new food in your 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.680
 new approach to eating healthy and 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.510
 then for those who are already vegan 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.610
 feel free to poke around on the internet it 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.820
 there are plenty of nice recipes and that 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.740
 will help you to eat varied and then to 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.290
 to be two of the good cooks 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.120
 if you have children if you have a 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.650
 husband at home or a woman at the 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.390
 home who have bad habits 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.040
 it is necessary at all costs 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.930
 you're trying to re-educate them so 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.850
 really tried to sensitize them to 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.130
 your healthy diet and to 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.330
 healthy eating in general since 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.040
 it's really something that you 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.550
 will preserve healthy longer 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.730
 possible so sensitized raise awareness 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.180
 the the episode to this cause so that they 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.740
 more easily want to 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.030
 eat healthy and do not rush on 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.640
 things that are bad for their 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.110
 health and so that it will help you they are 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.090
 less tempted to eat bad 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.530
 things in front of you and then will understand 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.960
 a little bit more why do you do 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.370
 what are you doing and what is it on 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.080
 long term that these are good 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.090
 accustomed to new good habits to 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.610
 take us women it's true we 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.830
 tends to be very very sensitive to 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.290
 a stage diet because we 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.260
 is sensitive to our silhouette in good standing 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.240
 General 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.250
 maintain a good figure while 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.260
 that men they often have one 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.060
 little bit there do it we'll say but 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.110
 on the other hand, the field of health is 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.620
 something that sensitizes them a 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.590
 little more 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.730
 so if you have one to a husband who or a 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:26.000
 brother who eats who really eats 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.730
 any price you re-educate him and for 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.780
 do that if it's not enough for him 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.520
 say it's not good for health have 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.020
 wanted to send to do a blood test 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.480
 and when he goes to see that his record 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.040
 blood is not terrible that he has 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.360
 cholesterol while still young 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.300
 less young 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.890
 maybe that will motivate me to do 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.930
 a little bit more attention to what they 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.090
 eat and finally I'll finish with my 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.100
 last trick that's here again is 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.990
 a habit to take it's these are the 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.190
 deviations so to make fun of time 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.020
 in time I find it's something 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.120
 totally human thing of 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.410
 totally indispensable is important to 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.850
 our psychic balance 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.350
 so make time fun 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.410
 time I really absolutely nothing 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.420
 against that and I'm pronounced even but 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.740
 on the other hand is reasonably reasonable so 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.120
 I will not go into details I 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.890
 just say to be honest with 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.140
 you and you are pleased 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:13.580
 but without too much excesses here I hope 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.870
 that this little video you liked 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.030

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.090
 we will talk about cosmetic care a 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.700
 little bit to help you reach 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.990

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.900
 complicated since you know my 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.310
 opinion on it but I still 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.390
