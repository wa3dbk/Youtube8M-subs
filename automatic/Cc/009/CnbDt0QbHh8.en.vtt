here<00:03:27.640> usually<00:03:28.640> it'll<00:03:28.850> be<00:03:29.060> up<00:03:29.330> on<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.630> second

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
here usually it'll be up on this second

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.710

it to be too consistent it's kind of out

it to be too consistent it's kind of out
of<00:06:20.340> my<00:06:20.430> way<00:06:20.610> so<00:06:20.669> I<00:06:20.820> don't<00:06:20.880> usually<00:06:21.500> wrap<00:06:22.500> around

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
of my way so I don't usually wrap around

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.839 
of my way so I don't usually wrap around
there<00:06:23.099> I<00:06:23.310> usually<00:06:23.789> find<00:06:24.240> it<00:06:24.479> down<00:06:25.139> here<00:06:25.849> right

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
there I usually find it down here right

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:29.810 
there I usually find it down here right
around<00:06:27.030> here<00:06:27.479> pretty<00:06:28.020> common<00:06:28.949> and<00:06:29.220> then<00:06:29.550> up

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
around here pretty common and then up

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.450 
around here pretty common and then up
here<00:06:30.330> in<00:06:30.539> this<00:06:30.690> upper<00:06:30.960> area<00:06:31.380> so<00:06:31.949> make<00:06:32.220> sure<00:06:32.250> you

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
here in this upper area so make sure you

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.040 
here in this upper area so make sure you
kind<00:06:32.610> of<00:06:32.729> go<00:06:32.849> all<00:06:33.090> the<00:06:33.270> way<00:06:33.300> up<00:06:33.479> until<00:06:33.630> you<00:06:33.780> see

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
kind of go all the way up until you see

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.010 
kind of go all the way up until you see
the<00:06:34.169> entire<00:06:34.409> map<00:06:35.210> so<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.240> think<00:06:36.539> what<00:06:36.720> would<00:06:36.870> we

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
the entire map so I think what would we

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.230 
the entire map so I think what would we
find<00:06:37.050> we<00:06:37.380> found<00:06:37.530> four<00:06:37.949> goblins<00:06:38.430> I'm<00:06:38.909> gonna<00:06:39.120> go

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
find we found four goblins I'm gonna go

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.790 
find we found four goblins I'm gonna go
ahead<00:06:39.360> and<00:06:39.510> just<00:06:39.690> clear<00:06:39.960> this<00:06:40.139> last<00:06:40.380> area

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
ahead and just clear this last area

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.379 
ahead and just clear this last area
again<00:06:41.159> this<00:06:41.639> area<00:06:41.940> you<00:06:42.030> kind<00:06:42.180> of<00:06:42.240> have<00:06:42.360> to

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
again this area you kind of have to

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.260 
again this area you kind of have to
min/max<00:06:42.900> your<00:06:43.169> time<00:06:43.520> this<00:06:44.520> area<00:06:44.909> doesn't<00:06:45.090> do

beasts doesn't happen to be super common
with<00:06:47.190> spawning<00:06:47.490> goblins<00:06:48.050> it's<00:06:49.050> not<00:06:49.199> too<00:06:49.500> bad

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
with spawning goblins it's not too bad

with spawning goblins it's not too bad
if<00:06:50.639> I'm<00:06:50.820> super<00:06:51.030> bored<00:06:51.180> I'll<00:06:51.659> go<00:06:52.320> ahead<00:06:52.440> and

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
if I'm super bored I'll go ahead and

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.020 
if I'm super bored I'll go ahead and
look<00:06:52.830> through<00:06:52.889> this<00:06:53.130> whole<00:06:53.400> area<00:06:53.669> the

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
look through this whole area the

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.200 
look through this whole area the
downside<00:06:54.840> to<00:06:54.960> looking<00:06:55.259> down<00:06:55.409> here<00:06:55.830> is<00:06:56.210> you

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
downside to looking down here is you

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.700 
downside to looking down here is you
usually<00:06:57.360> have<00:06:57.659> to<00:06:57.810> kill<00:06:57.990> some<00:06:58.199> stuff<00:06:58.229> to<00:06:58.620> have

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
usually have to kill some stuff to have

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.689 
usually have to kill some stuff to have
a<00:06:58.770> safe<00:06:59.250> portal<00:06:59.639> out<00:06:59.789> so<00:07:01.400> there's<00:07:02.400> usually

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 
a safe portal out so there's usually

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:06.170 
a safe portal out so there's usually
just<00:07:03.150> a<00:07:03.659> dense<00:07:04.620> amount<00:07:04.949> of<00:07:05.070> monsters<00:07:05.250> I'm<00:07:05.849> not

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
just a dense amount of monsters I'm not

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.550 
just a dense amount of monsters I'm not
finding<00:07:06.419> anything<00:07:06.720> all<00:07:07.020> right<00:07:07.139> so<00:07:07.289> we<00:07:07.380> do<00:07:07.470> have

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
finding anything all right so we do have

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.680 
finding anything all right so we do have
a<00:07:07.680> safe<00:07:07.830> area<00:07:08.130> to<00:07:08.340> portal<00:07:09.060> out<00:07:09.180> there's<00:07:09.509> also

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
a safe area to portal out there's also

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.330 
a safe area to portal out there's also
some<00:07:10.020> shoulders<00:07:10.440> that<00:07:10.620> you<00:07:10.710> can<00:07:10.889> get<00:07:11.099> to<00:07:11.310> a

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
some shoulders that you can get to a

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.240 
some shoulders that you can get to a
safety<00:07:11.789> portal<00:07:12.060> to<00:07:12.240> home<00:07:12.509> but<00:07:13.440> yeah<00:07:14.070> I<00:07:14.099> think

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 
safety portal to home but yeah I think

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.620 
safety portal to home but yeah I think
that's<00:07:14.520> it<00:07:14.729> if<00:07:14.880> you<00:07:14.970> guys<00:07:15.060> have<00:07:15.210> any<00:07:15.330> questions

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
that's it if you guys have any questions
