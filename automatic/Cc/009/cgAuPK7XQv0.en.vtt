trick another trick i would suggest

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.760 
trick another trick i would suggest
learning<00:00:59.940> first<00:01:00.180> would<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.420> front<00:01:00.780> blunt<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
learning first would be front blunt that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.590 
learning first would be front blunt that
way<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.129> kind<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.460> copy<00:01:02.730> exactly<00:01:03.210> how<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
way you can kind of copy exactly how you

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.830 
way you can kind of copy exactly how you
do<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> regular<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.739> then<00:01:05.220> do<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> switch<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
do it regular and then do it switch I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.600 
do it regular and then do it switch I
think<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> makes<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> easiest<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.520> know

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610

think that makes it the easiest you know
and<00:01:08.909> learning<00:01:09.299> switch<00:01:09.689> tricks<00:01:10.049> alright<00:01:10.680> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and learning switch tricks alright so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.920 
and learning switch tricks alright so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
on the front blunt like this instead of

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.940 
on the front blunt like this instead of
more<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.710> this

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
more like this when it's like this

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.890 
more like this when it's like this
that's<00:01:32.250> style<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.240> that's<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.630> we're<00:01:33.750> going

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that's style and that's what we're going

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.160 
that's style and that's what we're going

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
for in this day

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.140 
for in this day
this<00:01:35.799> is<00:01:35.950> another<00:01:36.159> trick<00:01:36.520> where<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:36.759> suggest

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
this is another trick where I suggest

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.850 
this is another trick where I suggest
taking<00:01:37.509> at<00:01:37.600> least<00:01:37.810> two<00:01:38.080> or<00:01:38.200> three<00:01:38.259> pushes<00:01:38.740> you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
taking at least two or three pushes you

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.740 
taking at least two or three pushes you
want<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.250> go<00:01:39.340> fast<00:01:39.610> at<00:01:39.939> it<00:01:39.970> because<00:01:40.210> you<00:01:40.479> need

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
want to go fast at it because you need

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.530 
want to go fast at it because you need
to<00:01:40.900> have<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.080> power<00:01:41.530> slide<00:01:42.340> through<00:01:42.700> it<00:01:42.820> it's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
to have that power slide through it it's

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.969 
to have that power slide through it it's
a<00:01:43.630> once<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.899> have<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.049> good<00:01:44.200> rate<00:01:44.380> of<00:01:44.500> speed<00:01:44.770> and

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
a once you have a good rate of speed and

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.370 
a once you have a good rate of speed and
you<00:01:45.490> get<00:01:45.640> close<00:01:45.880> enough<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.420> ledge<00:01:46.630> you're

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
you get close enough to the ledge you're

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.899 
you get close enough to the ledge you're
going<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.560> get<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:47.710> nice<00:01:48.040> snap<00:01:48.460> out<00:01:48.729> of<00:01:48.759> your

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
going to get a nice snap out of your

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.820 
going to get a nice snap out of your
