00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.349 

so<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.429> to<00:00:56.460> start<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.820> brushing<00:00:57.239> out

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
so I'm going to start with brushing out

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.270 
so I'm going to start with brushing out
my<00:00:57.390> eyebrows<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> fill<00:00:59.190> them

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
my eyebrows I'm not going to fill them

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
my eyebrows I'm not going to fill them
in<00:00:59.399> because<00:01:00.030> average<00:01:00.210> brows<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.899> always

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
in because average brows are always

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.920 
in because average brows are always
super<00:01:01.679> light<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:02.250> natural<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:02.969> mine

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
super light and really natural and mine

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.859 
super light and really natural and mine
are<00:01:04.290> kind<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> same<00:01:05.580> shader<00:01:05.939> tears<00:01:06.270> now<00:01:06.509> so

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
are kind of the same shader tears now so

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.300 
are kind of the same shader tears now so
I'm<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.200> going<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> fill<00:01:07.590> them<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.009> think

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
I'm not going to fill them in I think

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.219 
I'm not going to fill them in I think
they're<00:01:08.729> quite<00:01:08.939> full<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.540> their<00:01:09.750> own<00:01:09.869> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
they're quite full on their own so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
they're quite full on their own so
that's<00:01:10.500> all<00:01:10.799> good<00:01:10.979> then<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.270> to

not<00:01:36.750> only<00:01:36.930> am<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.200> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.410> use<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> water

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
not only am I going to use on the water

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.740 
not only am I going to use on the water
lines<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.670> instead<00:01:38.910> of<00:01:38.970> using<00:01:39.210> black<00:01:39.540> eye

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
lines but instead of using black eye

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.420 
lines but instead of using black eye
shadow<00:01:39.810> I'm<00:01:40.170> actually<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.620> use<00:01:40.890> smudged

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
shadow I'm actually going to use smudged

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.780 
shadow I'm actually going to use smudged
out<00:01:41.720> smolder<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.260> create<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.280> dark

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
out smolder to create the really dark

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
out smolder to create the really dark
smoky<00:01:45.360> effects<00:01:45.660> because<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.200> honestly<00:01:46.560> think

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
smoky effects because I honestly think

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
smoky effects because I honestly think
that<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.190> what<00:01:47.400> Apple's<00:01:48.000> make<00:01:48.150> passage

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
that that is what Apple's make passage

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
that that is what Apple's make passage
does<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.590> looks<00:01:49.830> really<00:01:50.100> accurate<00:01:50.580> so<00:01:50.760> that

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
does so it looks really accurate so that

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.850 
does so it looks really accurate so that
is<00:01:51.060> what<00:01:51.150> I'm<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.540> today<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:51.960> first

the fullness of the lower lashes end

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.620 
the fullness of the lower lashes end

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
because in the video she has really

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.719 
because in the video she has really
clear<00:02:06.960> water<00:02:07.259> lines<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.130> inner<00:02:08.310> corners

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
clear water lines in the inner corners

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.430 
clear water lines in the inner corners
and<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.690> tightline<00:02:09.899> at<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.259> top

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
and I'm going to tightline at the top

and I'm going to tightline at the top
again<00:02:10.800> leave<00:02:11.190> about<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.760> same<00:02:11.940> amount<00:02:12.060> of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
again leave about the same amount of

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.840 
again leave about the same amount of
space

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.170 

then<00:02:20.420> because<00:02:20.780> mold<00:02:21.050> is<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.770> kind<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.640> creamy

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
then because mold is so kind of creamy

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.240

mascara<00:04:27.770> and<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.970> reason<00:04:29.210> I'm<00:04:29.270> using<00:04:29.300> this<00:04:29.600> is

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
mascara and the reason I'm using this is

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.510 
mascara and the reason I'm using this is
because<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.140> has<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.290> really<00:04:30.620> fine<00:04:30.890> brush<00:04:31.220> and

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
because it has a really fine brush and

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.910 
because it has a really fine brush and
you'll<00:04:31.670> see<00:04:31.850> why<00:04:32.090> in<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.300> minute<00:04:32.390> so<00:04:33.350> I'm<00:04:33.620> going

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
you'll see why in a minute so I'm going

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.460 
you'll see why in a minute so I'm going
to<00:04:33.950> apply<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.660> upper<00:04:36.020> lashes<00:04:36.200> to

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
to apply that to the upper lashes to

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.050 
to apply that to the upper lashes to
kind<00:04:36.680> of<00:04:36.740> cement<00:04:37.040> it<00:04:37.160> all<00:04:37.280> together<00:04:37.430> but

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
kind of cement it all together but

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.000 
kind of cement it all together but
really<00:04:38.450> really<00:04:38.750> focus<00:04:39.140> on<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.410> outer<00:04:39.650> lashes

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
really really focus on the outer lashes

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.800 
really really focus on the outer lashes
because<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.490> outer<00:04:40.730> revivals<00:04:41.390> eyes<00:04:41.510> are

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
because the outer revivals eyes are

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
because the outer revivals eyes are
really<00:04:42.320> bold

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.830 

and<00:04:48.460> then<00:04:48.610> for<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.819> lower<00:04:48.970> lashes<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.599> thin

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
and then for the lower lashes the thin

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.839 
and then for the lower lashes the thin
brush<00:04:50.020> comes<00:04:50.319> in<00:04:50.470> handy<00:04:50.650> because<00:04:51.580> again<00:04:51.819> she

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
brush comes in handy because again she

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:53.219 
brush comes in handy because again she
doesn't<00:04:52.240> really<00:04:52.360> have<00:04:52.449> much<00:04:52.750> makeup<00:04:52.960> in<00:04:53.139> the
