00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.370 

all<00:00:02.159> right<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.669> lot<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.449> math<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.929> all<00:00:04.140> about

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
all right a lot of math is all about

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.829 
all right a lot of math is all about
patterns<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.460> identifying<00:00:06.270> patterns<00:00:06.450> and

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
patterns and identifying patterns and

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.600 
patterns and identifying patterns and
using<00:00:07.259> patterns<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.859> make<00:00:07.950> things<00:00:08.220> easier<00:00:08.580> for

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
using patterns to make things easier for

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.820 
using patterns to make things easier for
us<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:10.200> we're<00:00:10.500> gonna<00:00:10.620> talk<00:00:10.769> about

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
us and so we're gonna talk about

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.999 
us and so we're gonna talk about
sequences<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.700> series<00:00:12.259> so<00:00:13.259> suppose<00:00:13.860> you've

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
sequences and series so suppose you've

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.420 
sequences and series so suppose you've
been<00:00:14.070> offered<00:00:14.400> two<00:00:14.549> summer<00:00:14.759> jobs<00:00:15.560> one<00:00:16.560> where

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
been offered two summer jobs one where

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.689 
been offered two summer jobs one where
you<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.869> paid<00:00:19.050> $70<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> first<00:00:20.070> day<00:00:20.250> 71

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
you have get paid $70 the first day 71

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.210 
you have get paid $70 the first day 71
the<00:00:20.910> next<00:00:21.240> 72<00:00:21.750> 73<00:00:22.289> you're<00:00:22.650> getting<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.010> raise

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the next 72 73 you're getting a raise

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.349 
the next 72 73 you're getting a raise
every<00:00:23.609> single<00:00:24.330> day<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:27.060> sort<00:00:27.300> of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
every single day and so you can sort of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.530 
every single day and so you can sort of
notice<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> pattern<00:00:28.230> where<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.160> start<00:00:32.540> you

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
notice the pattern where you start you

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:51.670 
notice the pattern where you start you
start<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:34.020> 70<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:40.399> increase<00:00:43.820> by<00:00:45.140> $1<00:00:47.420> per<00:00:48.420> day

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.939 

suppose<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.890> was<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> dollar<00:00:53.250> sign<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.199> then

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
suppose that was a dollar sign and then

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.290 
suppose that was a dollar sign and then
the<00:00:56.100> next<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.449> start<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:59.520> whatever

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the next one is you start and whatever

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.470 
the next one is you start and whatever
day<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.859> set<00:01:02.550> day<00:01:02.789> 2<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.059> get

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
day it is this is one set day 2 you get

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.580 
day it is this is one set day 2 you get
4<00:01:03.809> cents<00:01:04.739> day<00:01:05.010> 3<00:01:05.339> at<00:01:05.640> 9:10<00:01:06.180> stay<00:01:06.510> 4<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:07.049> 16

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
4 cents day 3 at 9:10 stay 4 you get 16

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.020 
4 cents day 3 at 9:10 stay 4 you get 16
cents<00:01:08.270> compared<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> option<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.439> looks

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
cents compared to option a this looks

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.450 
cents compared to option a this looks
pretty<00:01:12.030> sad<00:01:12.740> walking<00:01:13.740> away<00:01:14.010> from<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.340> whole

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
pretty sad walking away from a whole

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.480 
pretty sad walking away from a whole
day's<00:01:14.640> work<00:01:15.110> just<00:01:16.110> making<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> penny<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.340> we're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
day's work just making a penny but we're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.399 
day's work just making a penny but we're
gonna<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.850> later<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.990> would<00:01:19.259> actually

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
gonna see later that this would actually

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.300 
gonna see later that this would actually
be<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.790> pretty<00:01:20.939> sweet<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> end<00:01:22.290> but<00:01:23.100> so

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
be really pretty sweet in the end but so

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
be really pretty sweet in the end but so
you<00:01:23.369> start<00:01:23.909> at<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:25.850> 1<00:01:26.850> cent<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:27.780> think

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
you start at that 1 cent but then think

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.490 
you start at that 1 cent but then think
of<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> as<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.430> 1<00:01:29.820> squared<00:01:30.270> 2<00:01:31.200> squared<00:01:33.500> 3

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
of it as this is 1 squared 2 squared 3

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.179 
of it as this is 1 squared 2 squared 3
squared<00:01:35.060> 4<00:01:36.060> squared<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> start

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
squared 4 squared so you have to start

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.760 
squared 4 squared so you have to start
noticing<00:01:38.640> 1<00:01:39.180> 4<00:01:39.479> 9<00:01:39.509> 16<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.590> recognize

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
noticing 1 4 9 16 you have to recognize

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.880 
noticing 1 4 9 16 you have to recognize
those<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.990> pattern<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
those as the the pattern so it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:59.360 
those as the the pattern so it's
whatever<00:01:44.520> day<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:46.880> number<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.030> day<00:01:51.860> squared

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:07.160 

/<00:02:02.430> 100<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:05.680> we're<00:02:06.070> getting<00:02:06.160> it<00:02:06.430> -<00:02:06.550> pennies

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
/ 100 because we're getting it - pennies

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.080 
/ 100 because we're getting it - pennies
so<00:02:08.170> one<00:02:08.680> thing<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.040> can<00:02:09.190> do<00:02:09.340> with<00:02:09.490> sequences

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
so one thing you can do with sequences

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.860 
so one thing you can do with sequences
is<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.540> can<00:02:10.690> graph<00:02:10.960> them<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.420> if<00:02:13.690> we

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
is that you can graph them and so if we

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.460 
is that you can graph them and so if we
started<00:02:14.320> that<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.770> we<00:02:15.250> made<00:02:15.430> our<00:02:15.700> our<00:02:16.360> n<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
started that and we made our our n the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.930 
started that and we made our our n the
number<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.800> term<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:18.820> have<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.270> this<00:02:19.450> side<00:02:19.720> 1<00:02:20.320> 2

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
number of term we have on this side 1 2

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.100 
number of term we have on this side 1 2
3<00:02:21.940> 4<00:02:22.840> 5<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.860> we<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:25.270> dollars<00:02:25.690> made

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
3 4 5 and we can have the dollars made

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.240 
3 4 5 and we can have the dollars made
on<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.940> side<00:02:28.210> so<00:02:28.930> suppose<00:02:29.320> this<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:30.120> 70<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
on this side so suppose this is 70 the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.440 
on this side so suppose this is 70 the
first<00:02:33.550> term<00:02:35.040> term<00:02:36.040> 1<00:02:36.310> 2<00:02:37.030> 3<00:02:37.630> 4<00:02:38.410> 5<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:40.000> suppose

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
first term term 1 2 3 4 5 and suppose

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:53.600 
first term term 1 2 3 4 5 and suppose
this<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.780> 75<00:02:41.350> up<00:02:41.530> here<00:02:41.770> yet<00:02:44.040> 71<00:02:45.040> 72<00:02:45.750> 73<00:02:47.459> 74<00:02:52.230> and

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
this is 75 up here yet 71 72 73 74 and

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.520 
this is 75 up here yet 71 72 73 74 and
so<00:02:54.610> we<00:02:55.510> don't<00:02:55.660> connect<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.140> with<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.290> line

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
so we don't connect it with a line

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.180 
so we don't connect it with a line
because<00:02:56.950> there's<00:02:57.820> nothing<00:02:58.090> in<00:02:58.390> between

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
because there's nothing in between

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.830 
because there's nothing in between
sequences<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.340> series<00:03:00.519> sequences<00:03:01.360> deal<00:03:01.630> with

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
sequences and series sequences deal with

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.050 
sequences and series sequences deal with
just<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.290> integers<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.670> that's<00:03:03.850> why<00:03:03.970> we

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
just the integers and so that's why we

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.350 
just the integers and so that's why we
want<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.239> leave<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.450> as<00:03:05.730> they<00:03:06.730> can<00:03:06.910> also<00:03:07.060> look

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
want to leave it as they can also look

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.940 
want to leave it as they can also look
like<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.570> curve<00:03:07.930> though<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:08.590> that's<00:03:08.739> what<00:03:08.920> I

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
like a curve though and so that's what I

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.190 
like a curve though and so that's what I
wanted<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.430> represent<00:03:09.700> here<00:03:10.330> 2<00:03:10.840> 3<00:03:11.080> 4<00:03:12.010> 5<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:16.360> so

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
wanted to represent here 2 3 4 5 and so

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.770 
wanted to represent here 2 3 4 5 and so
let's<00:03:17.410> make<00:03:19.170> 0.16

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.400 

let's<00:03:26.500> make<00:03:26.740> that<00:03:30.330> divide<00:03:31.330> into<00:03:31.510> thirds<00:03:31.810> point

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
let's make that divide into thirds point

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.100 
let's make that divide into thirds point
zero<00:03:32.650> five<00:03:33.930> point<00:03:34.930> ten<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.380> point<00:03:36.130> one<00:03:36.280> five

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
zero five point ten and point one five

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.150 
zero five point ten and point one five
so<00:03:38.250> first<00:03:39.250> term<00:03:39.490> down<00:03:39.910> here<00:03:40.270> one<00:03:40.750> cent<00:03:41.050> then<00:03:42.010> we

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
so first term down here one cent then we

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.960 
so first term down here one cent then we
have<00:03:42.310> four<00:03:42.520> cents<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:44.440> then<00:03:44.620> we<00:03:44.740> have<00:03:44.980> nine

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
have four cents and then we have nine

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.750 
have four cents and then we have nine
cents<00:03:52.380> 1625<00:03:53.380> is<00:03:53.590> going<00:03:53.740> to<00:03:53.800> be<00:03:53.920> way<00:03:54.100> up<00:03:54.250> here<00:03:54.490> so

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
cents 1625 is going to be way up here so

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.000 
cents 1625 is going to be way up here so
you<00:03:54.820> see<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.480> it's<00:03:55.660> got<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.320> parabola<00:03:56.650> shape

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
you see that it's got the parabola shape

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.380 
you see that it's got the parabola shape
to<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.250> because<00:03:57.580> it's<00:03:57.760> being<00:03:57.970> squared<00:04:00.390> another

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
to it because it's being squared another

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.570 
to it because it's being squared another
way<00:04:01.570> we<00:04:01.750> can<00:04:01.870> represent<00:04:02.190> sequences<00:04:03.190> is<00:04:03.400> by

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
way we can represent sequences is by

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.670 
way we can represent sequences is by
using<00:04:04.030> an<00:04:04.300> end<00:04:04.480> term<00:04:04.870> so<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.470> we<00:04:05.800> don't<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:08.590> we

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
using an end term so that we don't so we

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.500 
using an end term so that we don't so we
can<00:04:08.709> just<00:04:08.920> plug<00:04:09.100> in<00:04:09.310> five<00:04:09.610> and<00:04:10.030> find<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.330> fifth

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
can just plug in five and find the fifth

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.270 
can just plug in five and find the fifth
term<00:04:10.690> or<00:04:10.900> we<00:04:10.989> can<00:04:11.110> plug<00:04:11.290> in<00:04:11.440> 10<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:11.950> find<00:04:12.160> the

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
term or we can plug in 10 and find the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.300 
term or we can plug in 10 and find the
10th<00:04:12.520> term<00:04:13.170> so<00:04:14.170> we're<00:04:14.709> gonna<00:04:14.800> write<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.040> rule

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
10th term so we're gonna write a rule

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.940 
10th term so we're gonna write a rule
and<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:16.359> what<00:04:16.540> we<00:04:16.660> noticed<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.230> that<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.829> other

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
and so what we noticed is that the other

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.770 
and so what we noticed is that the other
one<00:04:18.130> started<00:04:18.609> at<00:04:18.760> 70<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:20.760> then<00:04:21.760> we<00:04:21.910> added<00:04:22.510> one

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
one started at 70 and then we added one

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.730 
one started at 70 and then we added one
each<00:04:22.930> time<00:04:23.260> so<00:04:23.500> it's<00:04:23.650> kind<00:04:23.980> of<00:04:24.100> like<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.900> line

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
each time so it's kind of like a line

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.450 
each time so it's kind of like a line
right<00:04:27.180> where<00:04:28.180> this<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.260> y-intercept<00:04:30.070> back

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
right where this is the y-intercept back

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.750 
right where this is the y-intercept back
here<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:32.700> think<00:04:33.700> of<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:33.970> as<00:04:34.150> really<00:04:35.370> if<00:04:36.370> we

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
here and so think of it as really if we

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
here and so think of it as really if we
did<00:04:36.940> 70<00:04:37.600> plus<00:04:37.990> whatever<00:04:38.770> n<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.450> we'd<00:04:40.450> be<00:04:40.600> one

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
did 70 plus whatever n is we'd be one

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.219 
did 70 plus whatever n is we'd be one
too<00:04:40.960> high<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:46.180> we<00:04:46.300> actually<00:04:46.540> want<00:04:46.900> to<00:04:47.050> do

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
too high and so we actually want to do

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.450 
too high and so we actually want to do
69<00:04:48.030> plus<00:04:49.030> whatever<00:04:49.450> term<00:04:49.960> we<00:04:50.140> have<00:04:50.350> 69<00:04:50.890> plus<00:04:51.220> n

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
69 plus whatever term we have 69 plus n

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.200 
69 plus whatever term we have 69 plus n
so<00:04:52.150> we're<00:04:52.270> gonna<00:04:52.360> use<00:04:52.630> this<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:53.220> sub<00:04:54.220> n<00:04:54.520> to

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
so we're gonna use this a sub n to

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.140 
so we're gonna use this a sub n to
represent<00:04:55.690> our<00:04:55.930> nth<00:04:56.169> term<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:57.100> all<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:57.820> is<00:04:57.940> is

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
represent our nth term and all it is is

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.100 
represent our nth term and all it is is
notation<00:04:58.780> for<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.169> and<00:04:59.410> so<00:05:00.310> if<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.610> plug<00:05:00.820> in<00:05:00.850> 1

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
notation for it and so if you plug in 1

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.800 
notation for it and so if you plug in 1
you<00:05:02.110> get<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.380> first<00:05:02.590> term<00:05:02.860> so<00:05:03.190> 69<00:05:03.729> plus<00:05:04.030> 1<00:05:04.330> is

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
you get the first term so 69 plus 1 is

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.750 
you get the first term so 69 plus 1 is
70<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:06.510> then<00:05:07.590> no<00:05:08.590> if<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.040> want<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.430> think<00:05:09.640> of

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
70 and then no if you want to think of

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.340 
70 and then no if you want to think of
this<00:05:09.970> is<00:05:10.180> one<00:05:10.450> end<00:05:10.720> we're<00:05:10.930> going<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.110> call

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
this is one end we're going to call

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.740 
this is one end we're going to call
these<00:05:11.530> arithmetic<00:05:12.310> sequences<00:05:12.880> I'm<00:05:13.540> going<00:05:13.690> to

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
these arithmetic sequences I'm going to

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.120 
these arithmetic sequences I'm going to
talk<00:05:13.840> more<00:05:13.870> in<00:05:14.169> depth<00:05:14.440> about<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:14.860> in<00:05:15.010> the

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
talk more in depth about that in the

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.040 
talk more in depth about that in the
next<00:05:15.250> one<00:05:16.560> but<00:05:17.560> this<00:05:17.710> is<00:05:17.770> our<00:05:18.040> nth<00:05:18.280> term

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
next one but this is our nth term

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.070 
next one but this is our nth term
equation<00:05:20.580> option<00:05:21.580> B<00:05:21.850> remember<00:05:22.510> how<00:05:22.750> we<00:05:22.810> talked

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
equation option B remember how we talked

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.980 
equation option B remember how we talked
about<00:05:23.229> how<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:25.000> was<00:05:26.100> 1<00:05:27.100> squared<00:05:27.790> 2<00:05:28.210> squared<00:05:28.240> 3

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
about how it was 1 squared 2 squared 3

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.130 
about how it was 1 squared 2 squared 3
squared<00:05:29.020> 4<00:05:29.650> squared<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:30.419> so<00:05:31.419> that's<00:05:31.870> whatever

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
squared 4 squared and so that's whatever

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.910 
squared 4 squared and so that's whatever
term<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.740> are<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:34.090> whatever<00:05:34.390> n<00:05:34.630> is<00:05:35.190> squared

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
term you are so whatever n is squared

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.710 
term you are so whatever n is squared
and<00:05:38.010> then<00:05:38.160> divided<00:05:38.850> by<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:38.970> hundred<00:05:39.360> as<00:05:39.450> well<00:05:39.630> he

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
and then divided by a hundred as well he

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.760 
and then divided by a hundred as well he
said<00:05:39.930> or<00:05:40.380> times<00:05:41.100> 100<00:05:41.760> and<00:05:41.970> so<00:05:42.960> our<00:05:43.170> a7<00:05:43.620> term

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
said or times 100 and so our a7 term

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.540 
said or times 100 and so our a7 term
isn't<00:05:46.770> weird<00:05:47.460> over<00:05:47.730> 100<00:05:48.320> so<00:05:49.320> a<00:05:49.350> sequence<00:05:49.650> all

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
isn't weird over 100 so a sequence all

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:59.660 
isn't weird over 100 so a sequence all
sequences<00:05:51.540> is<00:05:51.810> a<00:05:51.840> pattern<00:05:52.350> of<00:05:52.500> numbers<00:05:58.670> and

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
sequences is a pattern of numbers and

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.160 
sequences is a pattern of numbers and
each<00:06:00.650> number<00:06:01.650> is<00:06:02.130> called<00:06:02.340> a<00:06:02.520> term<00:06:02.850> and<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:03.990> can

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
each number is called a term and you can

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.450 
each number is called a term and you can
use<00:06:04.790> notation<00:06:05.790> like<00:06:05.970> a<00:06:06.270> sub<00:06:06.750> one<00:06:07.020> to<00:06:07.980> represent

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
use notation like a sub one to represent

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.480 
use notation like a sub one to represent
the<00:06:08.550> first<00:06:08.790> term<00:06:09.060> a<00:06:09.300> sub<00:06:09.900> two<00:06:10.650> to<00:06:11.040> represent

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
the first term a sub two to represent

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.670 
the first term a sub two to represent
the<00:06:11.610> second<00:06:11.970> term<00:06:12.150> or<00:06:12.420> a<00:06:12.660> sub<00:06:12.990> n<00:06:13.290> to<00:06:13.650> represent

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
the second term or a sub n to represent

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.860 
the second term or a sub n to represent
the<00:06:14.250> nth<00:06:14.430> term<00:06:16.460> sequences<00:06:17.460> can<00:06:17.730> end<00:06:18.000> meaning

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
the nth term sequences can end meaning

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.430 
the nth term sequences can end meaning
that<00:06:19.140> are<00:06:19.200> finite<00:06:23.630> or<00:06:24.630> they<00:06:25.230> could<00:06:25.350> be

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
that are finite or they could be

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.760 
that are finite or they could be
infinite<00:06:25.860> meaning<00:06:26.310> they<00:06:26.520> don't<00:06:26.640> have<00:06:26.760> an<00:06:27.000> end

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
infinite meaning they don't have an end

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.770 
infinite meaning they don't have an end
nothing<00:06:28.770> new<00:06:28.920> there<00:06:29.160> and<00:06:30.090> we<00:06:30.180> can<00:06:30.300> also<00:06:30.450> have<00:06:30.750> a

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
nothing new there and we can also have a

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.910 
nothing new there and we can also have a
series<00:06:31.190> where<00:06:32.190> we<00:06:32.370> add<00:06:35.360> adding<00:06:36.360> a<00:06:36.480> sequence

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
series where we add adding a sequence

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
series where we add adding a sequence
and<00:06:38.330> so<00:06:39.330> for<00:06:39.630> example<00:06:39.720> if<00:06:40.080> we<00:06:40.230> added<00:06:40.470> up<00:06:40.770> all<00:06:41.490> of

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
and so for example if we added up all of

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.030 
and so for example if we added up all of
those<00:06:42.150> options<00:06:42.810> all<00:06:43.110> of<00:06:43.140> those<00:06:43.410> numbers<00:06:43.830> we

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
those options all of those numbers we

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.700 
those options all of those numbers we
were<00:06:44.190> having<00:06:44.550> in<00:06:44.670> the<00:06:44.760> other<00:06:44.880> one<00:06:45.060> so<00:06:45.300> 70<00:06:45.900> plus

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
were having in the other one so 70 plus

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.220 
were having in the other one so 70 plus
71<00:06:47.370> so<00:06:47.700> the<00:06:47.910> sum<00:06:48.120> of<00:06:48.150> the<00:06:48.330> first<00:06:48.570> two<00:06:48.810> days<00:06:48.990> of

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
71 so the sum of the first two days of

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.350 
71 so the sum of the first two days of
our<00:06:49.350> work<00:06:49.560> plus<00:06:50.550> 73<00:06:51.210> and<00:06:51.390> so<00:06:52.140> on<00:06:52.880> so<00:06:53.880> if<00:06:54.150> we

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
our work plus 73 and so on so if we

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.570 
our work plus 73 and so on so if we
stopped<00:06:54.600> working<00:06:54.990> after<00:06:55.140> 40<00:06:55.590> days<00:06:55.620> that<00:06:56.430> would

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
stopped working after 40 days that would

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.180 
stopped working after 40 days that would
be<00:06:56.670> a<00:06:56.700> finite<00:06:57.180> sequence<00:06:58.140> or<00:06:58.620> if<00:06:58.890> we<00:06:59.010> never

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
be a finite sequence or if we never

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.060 
be a finite sequence or if we never
stopped<00:06:59.550> working<00:07:00.020> that<00:07:01.020> would<00:07:01.110> be<00:07:01.410> an

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.070 
stopped working that would be an

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.770 
stopped working that would be an
infinite<00:07:02.730> sequence<00:07:03.800> so<00:07:04.800> a<00:07:05.070> series<00:07:05.940> can<00:07:06.750> be

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
infinite sequence so a series can be

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.870 
infinite sequence so a series can be
represented<00:07:09.800> with<00:07:10.800> this<00:07:10.980> notation<00:07:11.640> called

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
represented with this notation called

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.110 
represented with this notation called
Sigma<00:07:12.450> notation<00:07:12.600> and<00:07:13.880> that's<00:07:14.880> what<00:07:15.030> we're

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
Sigma notation and that's what we're

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.930 
Sigma notation and that's what we're
going<00:07:15.270> to<00:07:15.300> talk<00:07:15.450> about<00:07:15.600> next
