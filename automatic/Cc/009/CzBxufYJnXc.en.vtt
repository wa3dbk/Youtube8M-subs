00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.000
 I told you about it earlier 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.860
 more and more parents are refusing to 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.200
 place their child in the hands of 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.790
 national education he creates purely 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.460
 and simply independent schools 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.320
 so there are in France more than 500 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.940
 establishments of this type there is a 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.590
 minimal program to respect of course 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.850
 but a lot of the content is 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.600
 free as methods 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.550
 learning 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.380
 what are the benefits and the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.359
 disadvantages of this type of education 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.769
 how to create your own school the answer 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:38.300
 with this investigation dorothÃ©e cochin en 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:40.040
 class like every morning virginia 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.570
 bring his two daughters to school the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.190
 students are all settled they do not 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.700
 miss all the mistress and there 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.219
 surprise 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.010
 we find virginia and yes I am 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.160
 Mom is also mistress like all 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.199
 the other mistresses here 6 years ago 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.360
 a handful of moms decided to create 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.010
 their own school really doubted to 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.449
 women who in the class and I'm the 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.600
 trait on the classes of this and there I 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.059
 so am the mistress 200 and mom of 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.770
 gold jean baptist today it exists 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.380
 more than 500 non-contracted establishments 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.909
 like this one a phenomenon that explodes 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.680
 each year thirty schools 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.990
 independence is born on the initiative 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.430
 of parents but created his school 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.350
 is not easy 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.000
 choice of premises training 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.509
 teachers or management of 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.549
 daily 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.110
 meeting with his parents who have 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.170
 decided to open their own 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.119
 educational establishment 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.770
 if virginie decided to go after 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.930
 his approach is for a very good reason 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.890
 simple to see his child returned from 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.970
 crying school wailing miserably or 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.799
 so it's not easy to pick up 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.060
 all bases on Wednesdays on Saturdays 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.570
 Sunday when all holidays 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.670
 school 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.799
 so between two difficulties we chose 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.690
 to create our school to offer this 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.860
 that we think is best for our 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.630
 children 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.130
 this training teacher has so 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.500
 decided to return to the benches of 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.820
 the school as a tutor but 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.220
 to open your establishment 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.210
 it was necessary to find a local it is a 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.220
 old restaurant that has been converted by 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.659
 our owner so it's him who 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.060
 made us all his classes in 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.310
 according to what was asked him a 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.200
 former restaurant that she rents 4500 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.209
 euros per month and to develop it 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.709
 virginia to fend for itself in particular 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.250
 recovering everything she could 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:22.630
 this is my office called aquarium 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.140
 it is the old office of the caf criteria 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.370
 the time 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.989
 so there was all the cabinets 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.870
 electric it's still a weapon in 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.450
 africa and maintenance and a cabinet 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.000
 for the record here so everything is 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.739
 recovered everything is reinvested and that's 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.269
 the old parking lot of the restaurant that serves 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.810
 today's playground 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.090
 another particularity the refectory here he 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.010
 is no self-service and returns to 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.460
 made by them will appoint to balanced meals 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.560
 so maybe others 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.580
 I will continue things that are less 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.520
 appreciated by children 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.930
 this is tailor-made 1 custom made 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.880
 still has a cost for the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.860
 surveillance of this refectory virginia 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.840
 request 2 euros per day and per family 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.130
 but the most important in a school 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.840
 it's teaching 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.640
 if the program is imposed by 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:15.450
 national education methods 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:17.040
 learning are free virginia 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.350
 does not apply the global method but 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.700
 if life before reading 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.880
 children learn each letter 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.740
 likened to a gesture and a so are the 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.410
 method inspired by pedagogy 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.870
 jean-thierry using a gesture for 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.760
 a sound and willows associate for the 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.230
 syllables of the still-have done 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.270
 words and we discover that the words have 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.710
 a sense one to enjoy this 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.600
 teaching parents spend 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.180
 every month 200 euros per student 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.770
 and it works here everything would read and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.550
 write to their sixth entry against 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.560
 only 70% in the audience a 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.900
 independence that seduces more and more 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.180
 of parents today jean-luc comes 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.580
 see anne president of the association 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.650
 create his school sir enter this father 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.670
 of seven boys wants to create him a 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.130
 middle School 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.660
 the story of this college project it's in 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.140
 did a handful of parents who were 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.380
 a little 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.480
 alarmed by the declining level around 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.310
 we tested ourselves for some 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.160
 of us the public college next door where 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.680
 private colleges and we were aghast 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.680
 to see there level the lack of coherence 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.300
 lessons but be careful 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.170
 an independent institution is not 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.900
 an easy task 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.160
 there are rules to respect all the 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.560
 world can create a school provided 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.470
 to be serious about meeting the standards 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.630
 so much of the teacher's qualification 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.010
 and directors and also to have some 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.140
 adapted premises in accordance with standards 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.720
 security at the high school level it's 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:46.550
 asked the director to have a license 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.870
 + 5 years teaching experience 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.060
 while in the primary it suffices 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.320
 to have his bachelor jean-luc hope 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.500
 reopen your establishment 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.870
 the next year primary college but 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.670
 as smooth and laurence and frederic two 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.570
 old teachers come all 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.940
 just to create one 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.680
 here she teaches the same subjects 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.900
 than elsewhere but the numbers are 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.160
 much smaller in this course of 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.890
 mathematics for example 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.010
 sophie does not leave any student aside 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.720
 that allows us to really during a 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.210
 workout like this one 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.770
 to be really listened to needs 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.170
 specific to each student 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.450
 we will be able to progress at their own pace 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.580
 follow a student who will go faster 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.730
 come back with a student who meet 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.160
 difficulties in this chapter or 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.280
 or that part of the program that's 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.910
 treated and made like that much of the 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.680
 tailored 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.270
 a real revolution for these 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.580
 teenagers rather used to classes 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.960
 of the 30 students in a class of 4 that 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.910
 I 'm assured that teacher who completely 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.230
 different a class of thirty 30 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.640
 seats according konÃ© our teacher 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.040
 he also knows our way of 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.800
 work it makes slave and that just 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.280
 a place of three four or even 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.170
 two it just allows you to 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.390
 participate and interested at the end 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.340
 another particularity of this school 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.380
 every week laurence one of the two 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.310
 to distribute a sheet of 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.060
 route to each student 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.410
 BenoÃ®t bien this week no power 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.540
 to go on a quiet vacation and 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.880
 recover your computer 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.870
 we also no there are small 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.430
 things to look at each other 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.620
 people caught up in place of 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.600
 third this week so that's 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.580
 really a follow-up that requires a real 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.410
 teacher investment because he 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.060
 do you still have something 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.740
 to say and then do it very 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.930
 individual is not about putting our 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.090
 collective remarks in this high school the 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.040
 registration fee of 6000 euros per year 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.830
 it's very expensive but on average in this 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.660
 type of institution more than 90% of 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.490
 students get their bachelor's degree 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.110
 and it's way better than the last 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.430
 national success rate at 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.760
 Bachelor's degree which was slightly 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.470
 less than 70 7% 100% mag that's 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.640
 finished for today thanks to the 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.260
 writing and teams 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.760
 techniques thanks to you for being with 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.990
 we wish you a very good 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.990
 evening on m6 to tomorrow
