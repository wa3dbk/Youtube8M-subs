00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.840 
do is take the wheel if the off of
course<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.070> then<00:00:20.279> you're<00:00:20.460> down<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
course and then you're down to the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.820 
course and then you're down to the
caliper<00:00:21.270> if<00:00:21.840> two<00:00:22.080> bolts<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.439> hold<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
caliper if two bolts that hold the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.030 
caliper if two bolts that hold the
caliper<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:25.640> take<00:00:26.640> them<00:00:26.849> off<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.210> back

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
caliper on take them off in the back

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.750 
caliper on take them off in the back
and<00:00:29.190> then<00:00:29.310> your<00:00:29.430> caliper<00:00:29.850> to<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.240> slide<00:00:30.540> out

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
and then your caliper to just slide out

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.510 
and then your caliper to just slide out
let<00:00:32.760> it<00:00:32.790> sit<00:00:33.170> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.380> top<00:00:34.620> try<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> let<00:00:35.370> it

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
let it sit on the top try not to let it

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.430 
let it sit on the top try not to let it
dangle<00:00:35.730> yeah<00:00:36.210> well<00:00:36.420> you're<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:37.110> ruin<00:00:37.320> your

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
dangle yeah well you're don't ruin your

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.750 
dangle yeah well you're don't ruin your
brake<00:00:37.710> line<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.600> brake<00:00:40.010> pads<00:00:41.010> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
brake line and then your brake pads to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.460 
brake line and then your brake pads to
ditch<00:00:41.940> them<00:00:42.180> right<00:00:42.360> off

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470

rotors look like they're all scratched
and<00:00:54.140> scarred<00:00:54.440> up<00:00:54.650> they<00:00:55.280> may<00:00:55.520> have<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:55.880> be

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
and scarred up they may have to be

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.270 
and scarred up they may have to be
either<00:00:56.330> replaced<00:00:56.840> or<00:00:57.050> resurfaced<00:00:57.620> if<00:00:58.160> you

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
either replaced or resurfaced if you

take them to your local art store they

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.540 
take them to your local art store they
should<00:01:00.230> be<00:01:00.380> able<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.650> tell<00:01:00.860> you<00:01:01.010> what<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.370> can

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
should be able to tell you what you can

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.540 
should be able to tell you what you can
do<00:01:05.410> okay<00:01:06.410> if<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.650> have<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.860> replace<00:01:07.130> your

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
do okay if you have to replace your

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.430 
do okay if you have to replace your
rotor<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:08.090> bracket<00:01:08.690> will<00:01:08.720> have<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.140> come<00:01:09.290> off

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
rotor this bracket will have to come off

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.500 
rotor this bracket will have to come off
there's<00:01:09.710> two<00:01:09.890> bolts<00:01:10.100> on<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.460> back<00:01:10.640> you<00:01:11.480> just

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
there's two bolts on the back you just

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.190 
there's two bolts on the back you just
take<00:01:11.840> those<00:01:11.960> bolts<00:01:12.380> off

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.200 

and<00:01:15.439> this<00:01:15.590> bracket<00:01:16.040> will<00:01:16.159> just<00:01:16.340> slip<00:01:16.580> off<00:01:16.820> and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
and this bracket will just slip off and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.990 
and this bracket will just slip off and
then<00:01:17.990> your<00:01:18.140> rotor<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:18.650> able<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.310> just<00:01:19.729> slide

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
then your rotor is able to just slide

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.570 
then your rotor is able to just slide
off<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:21.380> can<00:01:21.530> either<00:01:21.680> get<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:21.920> brand<00:01:22.189> new<00:01:22.250> rotor

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
off you can either get a brand new rotor

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.100 
off you can either get a brand new rotor
or<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:23.030> can<00:01:23.210> take<00:01:23.360> your<00:01:23.420> rotor<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.990> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
or you can take your rotor to the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.070 
or you can take your rotor to the
machine<00:01:24.409> shop<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:24.710> have<00:01:25.070> them<00:01:25.100> resurface<00:01:26.080> and

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
machine shop and have them resurface and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.510 
machine shop and have them resurface and
then<00:01:27.170> put<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.470> back<00:01:27.500> on

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:46.190 

and<00:01:31.729> then<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.000> bracket<00:01:32.360> back<00:01:32.540> on

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:56.810 

right<00:01:47.200> in<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.380> bracket

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.469 

just<00:01:57.480> among<00:01:57.780> acalypha<00:01:58.490> has<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.729> go<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.090> now<00:02:00.330> we

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
just among acalypha has to go in now we

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.180 
just among acalypha has to go in now we
have<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:01.080> tool<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.620> this<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.040> can

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
have this little tool like this you can

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.030 
have this little tool like this you can
use<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.460> c-clamp<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.440> have<00:02:04.620> to<00:02:04.800> press

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
use the c-clamp you just have to press

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.359 
use the c-clamp you just have to press
this<00:02:05.370> caliper<00:02:05.850> back<00:02:06.180> in

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.160 

if<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.819> apply<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.119> brake<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.720> fiscally

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
if you apply the brake that fiscally

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.680 
if you apply the brake that fiscally
gets<00:02:11.349> pushed<00:02:11.650> out<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.270> push<00:02:13.540> it

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
gets pushed out so you have to push it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.449 
gets pushed out so you have to push it
back<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.410> I'm<00:02:14.560> gonna<00:02:14.739> get<00:02:15.010> over<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.340> new

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
back in so I'm gonna get over the new

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.240 
back in so I'm gonna get over the new
brake<00:02:15.700> pads<00:02:16.560> show<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.620> how<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.830> push<00:02:18.099> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
brake pads show you how to push the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.760 
brake pads show you how to push the
piston<00:02:18.459> back<00:02:18.849> in<00:02:19.090> take<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.930> originals<00:02:20.500> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
piston back in take the originals the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.160 
piston back in take the originals the
old<00:02:21.250> pad<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.819> you're<00:02:21.970> replacing<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.810> put<00:02:23.080> it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
old pad that you're replacing and put it

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.930 
old pad that you're replacing and put it
back<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.770> caliper<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.790> have

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
back in the caliper so you have

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.080 
back in the caliper so you have
something<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.450> push<00:02:25.660> against<00:02:26.790> now<00:02:27.790> use<00:02:28.060> a

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
something to push against now use a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.120 
something to push against now use a
c-clamp

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.510 

this<00:02:35.430> squeezed<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.060> piston<00:02:36.540> back<00:02:36.720> in

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:57.170 

this<00:02:39.880> way<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.150> go<00:02:40.390> back<00:02:40.600> in<00:02:40.810> straight
