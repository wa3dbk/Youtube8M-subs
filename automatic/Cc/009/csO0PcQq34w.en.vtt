00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
really scented up this this area here so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.270 
really scented up this this area here so
I<00:01:49.160> want<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.729> get<00:01:49.790> this<00:01:49.970> trap<00:01:50.270> reset<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.280> so

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
I want to get this trap reset and so

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.650 
I want to get this trap reset and so
basically<00:01:53.000> all<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.920> was<00:01:55.130> was<00:01:57.160> their<00:01:58.160> hole<00:01:59.500> and

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
basically all it was was their hole and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.150 
basically all it was was their hole and
we<00:02:02.660> didn't<00:02:02.990> use<00:02:03.110> any<00:02:03.140> dieting<00:02:03.800> because<00:02:03.950> I

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
we didn't use any dieting because I

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.370 
we didn't use any dieting because I
figured<00:02:04.490> they'd<00:02:04.610> be<00:02:04.640> coming<00:02:05.000> from<00:02:05.929> up<00:02:06.110> here

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
figured they'd be coming from up here

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.050 
figured they'd be coming from up here
and<00:02:06.649> I<00:02:07.690> like<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.840> have<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:10.580> trap<00:02:10.880> set<00:02:11.240> this<00:02:11.480> way

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and I like to have the trap set this way

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.610 
and I like to have the trap set this way
that<00:02:14.060> way<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:15.710> closes<00:02:15.920> on<00:02:17.020> their<00:02:18.020> foot<00:02:18.319> not

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
that way it closes on their foot not

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.910 
that way it closes on their foot not
over<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.750> if<00:02:20.930> they<00:02:21.080> stepped<00:02:21.380> on<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.740> this

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
over it so if they stepped on it this

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.480 
over it so if they stepped on it this
way<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.900> jaw<00:02:24.260> couldn't<00:02:24.860> hit<00:02:25.010> their<00:02:25.220> foot

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
way the jaw couldn't hit their foot

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.309 
way the jaw couldn't hit their foot
whereas<00:02:25.970> if<00:02:26.240> they<00:02:26.390> stepped<00:02:26.660> on<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.050> way

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
whereas if they stepped on it this way

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.450 
whereas if they stepped on it this way
they<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.400> get<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.550> good<00:02:28.700> catch<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.240> them<00:02:29.390> so

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
they just get a good catch on them so

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.280 
they just get a good catch on them so
alright<00:02:31.460> I<00:02:31.610> can't<00:02:31.910> make<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.270> tape<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.990> isn't

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
