00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.690
 good morning to all users at frank 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.450
 flourished for us and with us we wanted 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.670
 ask a question in the booklet of 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.680
 coffee plant from the air conditioners 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.949
 how much this new booklet is in force 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:24.019
 but the repeating plant is in effect since 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:26.960
 1st June 2014 and the decree of 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.509
 10 February 2014 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.070
 how often should it be followed e 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.380
 the maintenance of the boiler 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.910
 the mutation of the last boiler ii 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.550
 decree must be followed every year e 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.260
 however according to what is written 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.490
 also from the manufacturer that can be won 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.910
 through an attempt 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.910
 the same as we have and even second 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.060
 this indicated by hand of the heart 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.980
 then 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 on average emmanuel eto'o the life 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.640
 integration of this technology such as 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.400
 qualifications must have the technicians for 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.710
 perform boiler maintenance 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.350
 let's talk about heating so let's see 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.420
 applications and qualifications for 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.650
 example 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.740
 and this type of business of 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.970
 maintenance research and modification 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.759
 plant 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.729
 in reality it is not just one but they are 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.290
 different talking about heating then 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.200
 in a spirit of the boiler 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.270
 the technician of having three types of 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.780
 qualification according to the decree that in 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.280
 series a and 37 08 the period my serve 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.159
 claims lot to the one he replaced 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.820
 the old woman in c 46 90 and that 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.149
 represented in seven positive dominated 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.190
 of the letter the letter g where 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.569
 assigned for each technician his own 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.190
 specializations 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.140
 then there are techniques that have one 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.319
 there are only technicians who have them 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.600
 all of them in this area 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.060
 boilers the technician must at least three of 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.850
 these points 3 and do not suffer an oven 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.659
 institutes are these times listed 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.080
 in our chamber of commerce where 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.149
 we have three points that are indicated 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.180
 which are the necessary ones e 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.480
 indispensable for being able to perform 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.390
 correct maintenance I read in front of 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.170
 you then concern the new spirit of the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.939
 point b point c the point is therefore a 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.939
 technician to perform a correct one 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:30.489
 not action, and these must have the norm 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.010
 three questions because in the context of a 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.590
 boiler have to do with all three 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.829
 the types of plant then letter 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.079
 pines covers plants from 22 visible 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.780
 antennas the electronic installations that 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.739
 this area is indeed present 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.769
 always in an electronic card 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.169
 within your campaign 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.060
 letter c heating system e 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:55.299
 air conditioning in a specific way 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.209
 this voice of the land is for all 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.370
 parts that are the cases of plants for the 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.639
 distribution gas optimizations 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.919
 any kind and even including hours 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.379
 of evacuations of the products of 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.930
 combustion and mind reaction then you do 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.629
 attention to the technician for comes at 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.730
 your direction that has all three 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.919
 specializations and authorizations 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.739
 necessary to our state 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.979
 so we can advise our people 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.109
 users to ask just so 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.819
 explicit if the technical center the 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.780
 technician owns these authorizations 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.510
 no the customer has the obligation to ask 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.000
 if a technician who is performing does not 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.910
 have these certifications 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.670
 dimensions because it is important that it is 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.820
 so it is not that for the simple fact that 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.440
 a company that is on the market is not 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.360
 having said that then it will come rule with 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.370
 all the regulations or that anyway 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.440
 techniques and at our admiration 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.430
 have the relevant specifications 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.730
 certifications and if a 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.500
 technician a center we do not say 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.420
 authorized therefore not with these 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.790
 qualifications and verification of the 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.100
 then problems with a dish that 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.120
 the consequences are then the law 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.820
 provides for the law 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.530
 surely that's what you take that nothing 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.040
 when they call technician made first 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.130
 function should make sure this 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.260
 have the necessary specialization not 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.780
 can do in advance 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.820
 by telephone the operator is up to standard 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.470
 the request of the appointment and can 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.729
 do also directly to the technician on 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.220
 same place that must prove 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.690
 through all this document that 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.550
 She must always carry 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.960
 if he enabled or not then the 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.120
 liability, however, remains the responsibility 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.419
 of the user therefore of the conductor because 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.220
 let us remember well that the conductor 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.750
 therefore it is not necessarily the 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.850
 owner can only be 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.800
 simply a tenant and 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.229
 plant manager 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.690
 boiler heating and no more 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.000
 which occurs does not hurt an accident 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.160
 but any problem with this 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.320
 implant is the conductor who answers it 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.479
 always so much is true that in the case in which 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.289
 the mutation is not done there is a 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.850
 control by the institution in the case 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.280
 of the various regions may change 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.040
 however right 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.690
 these controls are responsible 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.380
 as long as the conductor repeats it is a 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.120
 technical 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.639
 we say that it intervenes at home 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.800
 at an office we tell you to check 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:33.340
 an installation must be secured on 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.160
 accidents if this surely is every 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.770
 technician must be one obviously 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.330
 hired regularly by the company that 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.520
 we have therefore called different 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.280
 montecchio wide-angle payroll e 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.780
 to start we say specializations that 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.990
 we have homes we have just 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.460
 said but also what is important is that 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.830
 he made sure of this type 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.330
 of interventions within ours 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.580
 company we have different figures 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.510
 professionals embrace different 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.550
 sectors 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.000
 each of which is insured 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.669
 equally precisely inail for the 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.970
 type of work that goes to perform the 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:13.090
 our technician who works on 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.210
 boilers with specific insurance e 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.630
 targeted is that type of intervention the 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:22.000
 our technician that we put on the front 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.950
 for electrical systems of another type 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.960
 insurance that covers that kind of 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.140
 risk besides of course one 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.720
 training there is a law 81 of the watch 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.340
 just a decree for the security of the 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.890
 workers in the places of 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.320
 job that to be joined also to 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.990
 this other situation then a technician 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.460
 to have that training for how much 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.440
 it concerns 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.710
 courses and virtual courses inside 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.229
 company but also with third parties 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.860
 plus the insurance of the hills of pop 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:56.050
 in case of accidents for whoever had it 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.150
 need maintenance as it is 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.690
 can contact italy ready 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.639

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:17.380
 I repeat 800 13 58 53 even for one 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:20.020
 simple question the request of 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:23.009
 information thanks frank my greeting to
