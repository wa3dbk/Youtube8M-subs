00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:31.457
A world created without borders to become more

00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:36.105
Peoples, colors and flags: peace signs

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:41.780
The dream of a world without barriers, 
with people who bring about

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:50.833
beauty, poetry, hope and joy

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:00.370
beauty, poetry, hope and joy

00:01:01.214 --> 00:01:05.393
But I see much contradiction,
so many people and so much loneliness

00:01:05.393 --> 00:01:09.669
Some with so much and others with just "nos"

00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:17.120
In human pain lies God's pain 
He calls us to belong to him always more 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.218
And I'm a pilgrim, 
I'm always in company

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:29.623
And I'm a pilgrim 
gathering more people now I go,

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:37.081
One soul, one voice
"Nations" await us

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:43.390
Called by Christ to penetrate into time

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:48.210
Turning shadow into light, breeze into wind

00:01:48.213 --> 00:01:53.580
Moving the wheel of life in a new direction
To seek magis

00:01:53.576 --> 00:02:02.910
Surrender, commitment, forgiveness, love and service

00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:12.460
Surrender, commitment, forgiveness, love and service

00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:17.490
Europeans and Americans, 
Asians and Africans

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.200
From islands and oceans

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:29.390
For a recreated world
All people are called

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.150
And I'm a pilgrim, 
I'm always in company

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:41.490
And I'm a pilgrim, 
gathering more people now I go

00:02:41.488 --> 00:02:46.480
One soul, one voice
"Nations" await us

00:02:46.484 --> 00:02:50.950
And I'm a pilgrim, 
I'm always in company

00:02:50.947 --> 00:02:58.080
And I'm a pilgrim, 
gathering more people now I go

00:02:58.075 --> 00:03:03.160
One soul, one voice
"Nations" await us

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.960
I will be more,
Magis i am

00:03:07.963 --> 00:03:12.620
I will be more,
Magis i am

00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:17.300
I will be more,
Magis i am

00:03:17.855 --> 00:03:25.970
I will be more,
Magis i am

00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:43.730
(I will be more,
Magis i am)
