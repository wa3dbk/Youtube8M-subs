00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
90 so that we can start to you know in

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.590

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the next couple of weeks or so with our

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.410 
the next couple of weeks or so with our
game<00:00:54.840> start<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.410> look<00:00:55.530> more<00:00:55.859> at<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.239> shape<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
game start to look more at the shape of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.729 
game start to look more at the shape of
the<00:00:57.449> team<00:00:57.690> rather<00:00:57.899> than<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> physical<00:00:58.289> side

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the team rather than the physical side

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.009 
the team rather than the physical side
it's<00:00:59.339> fascinating<00:00:59.699> what<00:00:59.879> shall<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.719> step

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
it's fascinating what shall you do step

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.259 
it's fascinating what shall you do step
up<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:01.649> bit<00:01:01.920> each<00:01:02.070> time<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.179> you

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
up a little bit each time and like you

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.700 
up a little bit each time and like you
said<00:01:03.449> you'd<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.750> looking<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.199> 90<00:01:04.530> minutes

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
said you'd be looking for 90 minutes

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.940 
said you'd be looking for 90 minutes
from<00:01:05.190> maybe<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:05.880> or<00:01:06.030> two<00:01:06.060> oh<00:01:06.450> eight<00:01:07.410> yard

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
from maybe one or two oh eight yard

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.160 
from maybe one or two oh eight yard
possibly<00:01:08.760> i<00:01:08.790> mean<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.120> difficulty<00:01:10.050> is<00:01:10.140> that

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
possibly i mean the difficulty is that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.450 
possibly i mean the difficulty is that
the<00:01:10.410> game<00:01:10.590> comes<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.040> bit<00:01:11.280> quicker

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the game comes a little bit quicker

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.990 
the game comes a little bit quicker
because<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.150> got<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:13.350> Far<00:01:13.620> East<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
because we got the Far East we have to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.460 
because we got the Far East we have to
make<00:01:15.150> sure<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.600> accelerate<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
make sure that we accelerate all the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.710 
make sure that we accelerate all the
physical<00:01:16.620> stuff<00:01:17.030> whilst<00:01:18.030> we're<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.330> Austria

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
normally take maybe 20 days because we

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.470 
normally take maybe 20 days because we
got<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.190> Far<00:01:23.400> East<00:01:23.580> we've<00:01:23.700> got<00:01:23.880> 12<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.360> we've

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
got the Far East we've got 12 so we've

got<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.660> get<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> physical<00:01:25.170> side<00:01:25.380> into<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.830> so

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
got to get the physical side into it so

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.060 
got to get the physical side into it so
you<00:01:27.870> know<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.080> many<00:01:28.170> ways<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.620> game<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.920> Friday
