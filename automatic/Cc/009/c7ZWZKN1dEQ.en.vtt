00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 that you have to turn around for a tournament of course 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.589
 Success is a certain experience 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.650
 one needs personality one needs 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.840
 Of course, players also need to say that 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.839
 We have leadership qualities and you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.449
 of course also needs young dynamic 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.770
 players who may also be in the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.449
 Last months in the viewpoint 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.070
 Of course they also played one 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.930
 bring a little fresh blood 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.570
 and that's why we have the choice 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.450
 hit proves seven months faith 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.820
 I hurt altogether he has since 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.390
 september actually only 280 in total 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.430
 played minutes and therefore I was 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 Just think that maybe he 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.640
 Unable to do so 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 conditions at this tournament 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.879
 maybe physically too 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.590
 we are already convinced that we are 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.620
 get them there too 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.719
 bring and I believe personality 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.960
 and experience that's just too 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:04.040
 indispensable attributes for a wm and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.020
 That's why I am with sami khedira 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.020
 entered this calculated risk 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.310
 We said that has a total 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 played and was very consistent season 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.080
 even with us was 212 with it 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.210
 every time he joined us 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.799
 also in the workouts 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.630
 leave an excellent impression 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.950
 That's why our decision is up 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.979
 These three goalkeepers liked 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.390
 the miro is also known that he 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.630
 especially at the tournaments always 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.990
 somehow can achieve a good shape 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.299
 he thinks he too has faith in me too 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.570
 at least in the league this year 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.930
 and in the European competition in the cup 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.290
 at least one 25 games completed it 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.759
 not so little last was injured 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.619
 but the mirror knows his body very much 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.970
 very good and we can see that too 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.920
 convinced that he is the team in 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.329
 whichever form this one 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.329
 tournament can help too
