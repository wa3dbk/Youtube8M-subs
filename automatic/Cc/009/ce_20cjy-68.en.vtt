00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Well, it has them all and everyone 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.680
 I present you so my name is 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.240
 arthur i'm going to make videos on 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.780
 youtube so that's going to be my fact my 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.059
 first video 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.370
 so I 'm going to talk about graffiti 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.520
 so I'm talking to you about my material so 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:24.869
 initially it was design basics hp 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.189
 so there is some who says who is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.550
 preferable to take criteriums 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.960
 I did not give my opinion but I 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.440
 never high school of criteriums and pencil 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.399
 it suits me it's very right and then 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.540
 we can saplings but quite easily 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.200
 we can gones and easily without 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.200
 wise of traces 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 this is going to lend to a day we have it 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.190
 so see we make a line that makes a 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.280
 relating finer certainly yes for 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.649
 details and the better you see look at that 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.899
 leave a trace so here is month 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.940
 after do as you want but you 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.519
 can the criterium cantor or pencil 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.450
 gray me I prefer a keyboard like that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.060
 So here we are afterwards to close 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.320
 contours I use a 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.360
 felt like that peak m so that's 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.720
 a big size of a big thickness 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.000
 after I dissociate felt end of March all 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.679
 like that to throw at darty kneaded any 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.429
 banal so it is to be is a lot 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:35.509
 finer otherwise I use most often 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:40.340
 an inch case you see like that so 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.679
 it's taxes this case that is 0.7 mm yes 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.810
 it's a trace too here 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.020
 but it's happening here at the paint see 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.429
 so it's like it's like you 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.740
 prefer this letter better like that 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.920
 may be worse for some so 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.390
 afterwards to cover them I also use 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.789
 good so his markers like that one 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.759
 who come from the traces is so 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.610
 sealed felt with a filter tip which 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.130
 does very good it's not super fine 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.599
 but that's enough and a beveled tip 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.320
 who is being much bigger 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:22.519
 for fills so here's so 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:25.549
 I have a rage a rose a father gerry a 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.859
 black or a light blue another club 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.959
 French 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.390
 a darker blue on board so I have 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.190
 a lot 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.530
 that's what I was looking for that is 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.120
 the keys 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:43.579
 so I like it is it's our 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.989
 principle yes excuse me so it's even 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.120
 principle so with a beveled tip 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.709
 and a fine point 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.930
 after that it's about the same color 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.940
 but hey it's everyone's taste finally 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.450
 here I like rauzan marker a blender 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.560
 so here it is it serves canton but 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.940
 several colors 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.800
 she is so stingy I made a gradient 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.440
 blue 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.400
 I take two bruises a little bit of 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.030
 dark blue here I put some blue 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:18.220
 clear you see the impasse on it and I 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.840
 take my blender and play and throw in 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.060
 the color like that it looks like it 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:28.140
 makes a uniform color that made itself 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:34.050
 degrades this is our pink a blue 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.820
 brown beige jeans reverse a rape is 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:43.870
 a rape 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:59.500
 Brossard tired we were nine LÃ¤nder 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:04:01.600
 prevents a glass a rape is reverse and 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:09.489
 So here are the showers we saw day 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:12.400
 aulas who carmine color a pink a stream 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.950
 recent green and orange 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.140
 I wanted to try as we had 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.109
 talked about the marker I pass line styles 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.590
 on know these same principles too 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:29.880
 a film tip and 2.2 bevels so 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:32.350
 I have a black a yellow a glass a gray 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.640
 a red and a blue I will put you 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.960
 numbers the meanings the 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.500
 description if you are interested 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.320
 see you know the men but that's it 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.150
 so that's all useful case so it's 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.150
 for alcohol fires 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.770
 here and after I also use skins 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.570
 this cape 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.520
 so as I had who like you 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.590
 use the small and sheer curtains and the 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.110
 small size little jules governs our 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.230
 size which is a light blue in a thousand 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:10.070
 crystal you see it does not do that there 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.680
 do not do a lot of colors here 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.550
 so postcard because after I have more 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.180
 big black jig in this size there 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:23.540
 in the style of the red of the yellow of the green 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.610
 clear you dark green of pink and 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.130
 the silvery you see I pushed towards the 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:32.260
 peace after a bronze tip so I have to 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.700
 black of yellow of blue of green of red 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:40.000
 and I showed you a lease of the mine 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:43.610
 so that's due to him being born 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.620
 so see that's 9 know to draw big 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.540
 and after we can also and rents do 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:53.180
 of the smallest dream that's so see 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.460
 after I just went to show you 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.230
 some small drawings so I do not 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.480
 do not consider it a point of the 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.640
 graffiti so that's a drawing that in 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.990
 model that I tried copying on 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.340
 youtube videos in the contest 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.420
 from the matricon I do not know if you 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.040
 know but if you know 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.220
 finally I will put you the link in the 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.500
 description this is a drawing I did 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.350
 on me with laayoune paper have 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.750
 sent do not know I have not the same 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.460
 if the keyboard is the hardest 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.449
 and that's it and then it's earned its 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.529
 point of view 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:31.129
 I did it over two months ago so 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:33.050
 here with things like that you 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.819
 see it serves copied on the alphabet of 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.800
 makli we see that it's my all 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.360
 first drawings 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.909
 this is my first my first graph 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.990
 we saw I think I have a 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:46.879
 little changed after you judge the 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.389
 so that's a trick if you have 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:51.979
 well liked down put a little green thumb 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.419
 and if you ever really have 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.319
