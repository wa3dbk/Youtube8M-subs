00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 now we'll see the test that sheila sing 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.240
 did with the range rover I'm going with 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.240
 exchange nine marches 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 the range rover evoque is a car that already 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.269
 was born ahead of his time in what 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.939
 refers to design technology and this 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.160
 history repeats itself with the unprecedented exchange 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.160
 of nine marches recently launched in Brazil 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.190
 something really unheard of for a vehicle 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.860
 approved for walking on the streets 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.070
 according to the automaker evoke with nine 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.590
 marches can be up to 11% more 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.930
 efficiency in gasoline consumption during 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 our test drive computer 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:58.449
 board scored an average of 11.6 kilometers 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.730
 between the urban and road circuit a 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.820
 very interesting brand for the hubs that 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.880
 weighs more than a ton and a half other 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.430
 updates of range 2014 range 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.090
 rover evoque are the new mirrors 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.410
 rearview mirrors that have been redesigned 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.780
 introduction of new color options 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.780
 external finishes 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:29.369
 18-19 and 20 alloy wheels 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:36.869
 with new design and culture is 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:39.659
 car on the team has two on 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.060
 technology and comfort the new and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.579
 I'm going to win the vectoring torque that 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.950
 distributes the torque independently 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.289
 in each wheel, which provides greater 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.319
 stability mainly for 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:55.110
 high speed cornering situations 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.539
 driving aids were 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.479
 further developed with the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:04.110
 introduction of features such as 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.869
 example the park exists to complete the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.209
 already exists the park assist that assists 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.950
 in goal maneuvers without the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.650
 driver interference 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.970
 the new perpendicular watch system 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.489
 also allows the performance of maneuvers 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.549
 without a 90 degree seat and the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:31.140
 adaptive cruise control o acc 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:33.660
 I ended up actually watching 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.590
 comfortable with the driver who also 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.730
 gives us more security 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.190
 for example here on the highway fernÃ£o days 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.190
 where speed also went well 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.049
 the front car by chance braked and 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.040
 cursing will also be having a 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.799
 security nor the author quite 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.450
 comfortable without anything for it because it is 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.340
 a medium speed radar system 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.129
 of the front car 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.470
 there the vagina number car back to 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.140
 accelerate and Portuguese will also come back 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.959
 to feed today while respecting 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.240
 the programmed speed in this case 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.810
 run 10 kilometers per hour 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.510
 What does this mean for comfort? 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.209
 imagine a crazy trip you have to 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.420
 stay braked considering Tuesday 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.860
 now we are on an urban stretch 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.400
 where the goal is to test one of 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.010
 news that make up the evoque 2014 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.000
 among the various devices that have 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.599
 this car 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.130
 the novelty of this car update I 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.890
 echo system that through a button ne 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.989
 you do not have to trigger it automatically 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.430
 When we stop the car, it turns off 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:56.400
 the engine that the goal of leaving 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.450
 fuel economy and is obviously 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.819
 reduction of pollutants 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.750
 there is good to note that it is the turn off 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.750
 engine or air conditioner stays on 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.550
 available in piu piu and dynamic versions 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.940
 and prestige the range rover 2014 line and 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:28.300
 book equipped with 2.0 - liter turbo 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.660
 with 240 horsepower 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.060
 the models cost from 192 thousand and 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.200
 nine hundred reais and reach 277 thousand 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.050
 nine hundred and reais 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.590
 land rover always careful with your 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:47.380
 tests drives provided this time 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.940
 to know the update of our 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:55.930
 rover and book different urban stretches 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.670
 road with curves more 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:05.680
 sinuous dual track roads 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:08.170
 single track roads and also a 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.990
 Field experience is very nice. 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.750
 because in this way we can 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.630
 perform a more complete job, right? 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.460
 really testing all systems of the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.290
 car that are many ne 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.700
 It's difficult to even explain to you. 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:29.620
 viewer but really worth it 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.210
 a test drive and it's worth really all 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.680
 which costs you because technology 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.340
 comfort and sophistication 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:44.780
 everything that integrates this car really 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:44.780
 each real invested in it 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:58.169
 as far as the off-road the evoke 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.919
 2014 has inherited some of its 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.919
 older brothers 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:09.000
 it is impressive behavior off 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.220
 e-book road to vocation and technology 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.979
 to face off-road sections 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.979
 came from sports models and involves 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:19.440
 all legitimized by the Dna da land 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.440
 with integral traction controlled by the 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.720
 system terrain respons responsiveness of luxury is 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.000
 able to face stretches with high degree 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.130
 difficulties in the system are 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.710
 programs that support the 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:36.030
 driver facing different types of 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.080
 tread like slippery slate and 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.620
 asphalt 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.780
 the selection can be manual or automatic 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.240
 in each of these situations the 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.180
 central computer changes parameter 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.550
 engine and suspension to adapt them 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.250
 the ground to be faced and can even 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.550
 even over obstacles such as water 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.770
 up to 50 centimeters in height is 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.500
 really this guy is all this is 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.710
 It's hard to talk about them without mentioning so many 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.590
 predicates and honestly if I could 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.849
 was one of those that would 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.849
 garage of my house
