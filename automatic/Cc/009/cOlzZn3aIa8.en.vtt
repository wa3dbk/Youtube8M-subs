water proof technology baked into this
so<00:00:27.779> they<00:00:27.900> argue<00:00:28.170> Emile<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> bit<00:00:28.500> warmer<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:28.859> the

summer<00:00:29.429> months<00:00:29.789> keep<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.630> mind<00:00:30.869> there<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
summer months keep that in mind there is
