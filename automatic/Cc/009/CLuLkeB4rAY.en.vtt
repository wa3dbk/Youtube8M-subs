the 650b from the road that's where we

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.310 
the 650b from the road that's where we
started<00:00:27.279> out<00:00:27.460> with<00:00:28.170> B<00:00:29.170> tubulars<00:00:29.710> in<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:31.320> back

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320

wheels<00:00:32.680> eyes<00:00:33.480> seem<00:00:34.480> to<00:00:34.690> work<00:00:34.930> very<00:00:35.410> well<00:00:35.800> but

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
wheels eyes seem to work very well but

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.060 
wheels eyes seem to work very well but
then<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:37.150> kind<00:00:37.540> of<00:00:37.629> went<00:00:37.960> away<00:00:38.170> for<00:00:38.409> a<00:00:38.650> couple<00:00:38.830> of

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
then I kind of went away for a couple of

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.070 
then I kind of went away for a couple of
years<00:00:39.159> because<00:00:39.729> once<00:00:39.970> we<00:00:40.120> started<00:00:40.629> to<00:00:40.809> produce

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
years because once we started to produce

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.170 
years because once we started to produce
proper<00:00:41.799> rims<00:00:42.699> for<00:00:43.119> tubulars<00:00:43.659> we<00:00:43.989> went<00:00:44.229> to<00:00:45.180> 26

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
proper rims for tubulars we went to 26

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.440 
proper rims for tubulars we went to 26
inch<00:00:46.449> which<00:00:46.780> was<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.790> standard<00:00:49.269> bank

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
inch which was the standard bank

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.110 
inch which was the standard bank
but<00:00:52.450> it<00:00:52.570> was<00:00:52.750> pretty<00:00:53.020> funny<00:00:53.350> when<00:00:53.830> I<00:00:54.870> told<00:00:55.870> Tom

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
but it was pretty funny when I told Tom

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.080 
but it was pretty funny when I told Tom
Richie<00:00:58.120> about<00:00:58.690> tubulars<00:00:59.620> and<00:01:00.010> how<00:01:00.190> well<00:01:00.790> they

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
Richie about tubulars and how well they

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.270 
Richie about tubulars and how well they
ride<00:01:01.390> and<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:03.430> explained<00:01:04.000> him<00:01:04.210> what<00:01:04.449> we<00:01:04.600> did<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
ride and I explained him what we did and

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.510 
ride and I explained him what we did and
then<00:01:06.990> Tom<00:01:08.670> immediately<00:01:09.670> said<00:01:10.450> well<00:01:11.160> it's<00:01:12.160> not

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
then Tom immediately said well it's not

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.210 
then Tom immediately said well it's not
it's<00:01:13.030> not<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.510> tubulars<00:01:14.080> that<00:01:14.440> that<00:01:14.860> feel

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
it's not the tubulars that that feel

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.220 
it's not the tubulars that that feel
fast<00:01:15.730> it's<00:01:16.240> because<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:16.930> right<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.610> right

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
fast it's because you right you right

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.290 
fast it's because you right you right
the<00:01:20.230> best<00:01:20.800> or<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.520> proper<00:01:22.030> wheel<00:01:22.240> size

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
the best or the proper wheel size

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.020 
the best or the proper wheel size
because<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.600> wheels<00:01:25.840> we<00:01:26.410> are<00:01:26.619> all<00:01:27.100> riding

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
because the wheels we are all riding

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.280 
because the wheels we are all riding
they're<00:01:28.570> too<00:01:28.840> small<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:30.750> he<00:01:31.750> explained

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
they're too small and and he explained

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.890 
they're too small and and he explained
it<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.920> story<00:01:33.310> how<00:01:34.000> this<00:01:34.330> all<00:01:34.630> came

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
it and the story how this all came

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.980 
it and the story how this all came
together<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:36.460> way<00:01:36.790> back<00:01:37.180> I<00:01:37.450> mean<00:01:37.600> if<00:01:37.810> the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
together way way back I mean if the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.670 
together way way back I mean if the
reason<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:38.619> if<00:01:39.130> there<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.520> father<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.680> 27.5

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
reason for if there is a father of 27.5

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.840 
reason for if there is a father of 27.5
or<00:01:42.010> 650b<00:01:42.790> then<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:44.380> go<00:01:44.619> much<00:01:45.190> further<00:01:45.460> back

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
or 650b then you go much further back

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:54.050 
or 650b then you go much further back
than<00:01:46.110> than<00:01:47.110> by<00:01:47.530> my<00:01:48.340> time<00:01:51.330> there<00:01:52.330> was<00:01:52.600> a

liked

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.180 
liked
and<00:02:29.890> this<00:02:30.890> professor<00:02:31.520> he<00:02:31.940> brought<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:33.230> set<00:02:34.010> of

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and this professor he brought a set of

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.680 
and this professor he brought a set of
wheels<00:02:34.489> which<00:02:35.300> worked<00:02:36.069> 27.5<00:02:37.069> 650b<00:02:37.970> some

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
wheels which worked 27.5 650b some

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.850 
wheels which worked 27.5 650b some
French<00:02:39.050> aluminum<00:02:39.770> rims<00:02:40.060> had<00:02:41.080> tumbled<00:02:42.080> up<00:02:42.560> and

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
French aluminum rims had tumbled up and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.090 
French aluminum rims had tumbled up and
he<00:02:42.980> built<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.489> frame<00:02:43.790> for<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.450> with<00:02:45.020> a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
he built the frame for it with a

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.170 
he built the frame for it with a
straight<00:02:46.100> forward<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.730> everything<00:02:49.180> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
straight forward and everything the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.720 
straight forward and everything the
difference<00:02:50.720> was<00:02:50.989> that<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:52.010> tire<00:02:52.280> stay

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
difference was that the tire stay

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.110 
difference was that the tire stay
mounted<00:02:52.970> were<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:54.530> bit<00:02:55.069> more<00:02:55.340> closer<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:56.090> a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
mounted were a bit more closer to a

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.640 
mounted were a bit more closer to a
cyclocross<00:02:56.840> size<00:02:57.680> than<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.459> mountain<00:02:58.849> bike

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
cyclocross size than to mountain bike
