00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
your team being fasting team in the

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.470 
your team being fasting team in the
Maple<00:02:09.929> Leafs<00:02:10.220> well<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> think<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.670> lute<00:02:12.120> Mae

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
Maple Leafs well I think the lute Mae

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.789 
Maple Leafs well I think the lute Mae
beliefs<00:02:12.780> are<00:02:12.900> real<00:02:13.049> quick<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.410> think<00:02:13.590> they<00:02:13.680> got

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
beliefs are real quick I think they got

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.259 
beliefs are real quick I think they got
four<00:02:14.069> real<00:02:14.340> good<00:02:14.519> lines<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.910> think<00:02:15.090> they<00:02:15.150> got

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
four real good lines I think they got

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.759 
four real good lines I think they got
lots<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.720> speed<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:15.989> think<00:02:16.260> they're<00:02:16.379> real<00:02:16.560> hard

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
lots of speed I think they're real hard

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.039 
lots of speed I think they're real hard
to<00:02:16.890> handle<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:18.239> know<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.629> hope<00:02:18.840> we're

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
to handle so you know I hope we're

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.960 
to handle so you know I hope we're
similar<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.860> way<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.370> Toronto<00:02:20.849> is

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
similar that way but I know Toronto is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.059 
similar that way but I know Toronto is
every<00:02:21.840> games<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.170> tough<00:02:22.379> game<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:22.650> when<00:02:22.950> you're

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
every games a tough game but when you're

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.009 
every games a tough game but when you're
playing<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.400> team<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:23.849> got<00:02:24.019> somewhat

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
playing a team that got somewhat

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.289 
playing a team that got somewhat
humiliated<00:02:25.709> at<00:02:25.829> home<00:02:26.010> does<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.459> potentially

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
humiliated at home does that potentially

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.110 
humiliated at home does that potentially
make<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.079> a<00:02:28.140> tougher<00:02:28.470> game<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:29.000> little<00:02:30.000> bit

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
make for a tougher game a little bit

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.520 
make for a tougher game a little bit
well<00:02:30.329> what<00:02:30.480> makes<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.840> tough<00:02:31.019> is<00:02:31.170> there<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.349> good

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
well what makes it tough is there a good

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.720 
well what makes it tough is there a good
team<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.129> know<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.519> at<00:02:32.640> the
