00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
is something that I really did one in

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.120 
is something that I really did one in
Just<00:02:21.600> Cause<00:02:21.780> 2<00:02:22.050> we<00:02:22.200> kind<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.620> did<00:02:22.740> have<00:02:22.950> it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
Just Cause 2 we kind of did have it

we're<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.520> rebel<00:02:24.000> would<00:02:24.210> kinda<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.780> guess

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
we're a rebel would kinda I guess

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.880
