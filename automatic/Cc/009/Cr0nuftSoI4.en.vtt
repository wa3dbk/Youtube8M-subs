00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
needed to have a flexible system that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.600 
needed to have a flexible system that

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
lights from the venue itself we looked

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.010 
lights from the venue itself we looked
around<00:00:46.579> for<00:00:46.820> a<00:00:46.940> mixer<00:00:47.390> that<00:00:47.420> would<00:00:47.720> have<00:00:47.870> the

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
around for a mixer that would have the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.840 
around for a mixer that would have the
flexibility<00:00:48.590> to<00:00:48.680> do<00:00:48.980> everything<00:00:49.219> we<00:00:49.430> needed

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
flexibility to do everything we needed

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.229 
flexibility to do everything we needed
but<00:00:50.300> also<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:50.960> program<00:00:51.410> ability<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.579> minimize

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
but also the program ability to minimize

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.229 
but also the program ability to minimize
the<00:00:53.690> amount<00:00:54.200> of<00:00:54.380> set-up<00:00:54.980> time<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.820> obvious

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
the amount of set-up time the obvious

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.810 
the amount of set-up time the obvious
choice<00:00:56.510> was<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.899> Mackie<00:00:57.050> DL<00:00:57.379> 1608<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.340> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
choice was the Mackie DL 1608 and the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.580 
choice was the Mackie DL 1608 and the
reason<00:00:59.120> was<00:00:59.300> that<00:00:59.329> it<00:00:59.540> gave<00:00:59.719> us<00:00:59.899> enough<00:01:00.170> inputs

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
reason was that it gave us enough inputs

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.560 
reason was that it gave us enough inputs
and<00:01:00.890> a<00:01:01.070> flexibility<00:01:01.730> with<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.239> built-in

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
and a flexibility with the built-in

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.210 
and a flexibility with the built-in
sound<00:01:02.870> effects<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:03.500> on<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:03.890> we<00:01:04.070> could

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
sound effects and so on that we could

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.859 
sound effects and so on that we could
cover<00:01:04.460> all<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:05.000> inputs<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:05.509> we<00:01:05.690> needed

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
cover all of the inputs that we needed

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.900 
cover all of the inputs that we needed
to<00:01:06.050> have<00:01:06.110> onstage<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.039> so<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.820> our

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
to have onstage and so that our

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.520 
to have onstage and so that our
front-of-house<00:01:08.450> mixer<00:01:08.930> could<00:01:09.140> be<00:01:09.229> anywhere

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
front-of-house mixer could be anywhere

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.469 
front-of-house mixer could be anywhere
in<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.710> house<00:01:09.890> for<00:01:10.880> most<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.270> shine
