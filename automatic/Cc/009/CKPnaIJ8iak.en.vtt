00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
hair like I do it is hard to blend um

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
hair like I do it is hard to blend um
full<00:02:02.850> straight<00:02:03.299> extensions<00:02:03.869> especially<00:02:04.380> just

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
full straight extensions especially just

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.530 
full straight extensions especially just
because<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.880> blunt<00:02:06.210> layer

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
because it's going like a blunt layer

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.139 
because it's going like a blunt layer
now<00:02:07.200> what<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.469> did<00:02:07.829> was<00:02:08.160> went<00:02:08.399> ahead<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.910> did

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
now what I did was went ahead and I did

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.770 
now what I did was went ahead and I did
cut<00:02:09.420> them<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> main<00:02:10.590> layers<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.480> looks<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
cut them and main layers so it looks a

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.760 
cut them and main layers so it looks a
lot<00:02:12.959> more<00:02:13.020> natural

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
lot more natural

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.430 
lot more natural
and<00:02:13.860> having<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.870> full<00:02:15.870> straight

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
and having just like this full straight

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.960 
and having just like this full straight
on<00:02:16.650> like<00:02:16.680> hair<00:02:17.340> like<00:02:17.580> he<00:02:17.670> would<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:17.880> been

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
on like hair like he would have been

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.570 
on like hair like he would have been
just<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.330> straight<00:02:18.540> on<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.710> decided<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
just like straight on but I decided to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.880 
just like straight on but I decided to
add<00:02:20.760> some<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.390> layers<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.410> things<00:02:22.830> like

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
add some like layers and things like

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.970 
add some like layers and things like
that<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.190> rarely<00:02:23.640> ever<00:02:24.260> wear<00:02:25.260> Mike<00:02:25.470> simkins

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
that I rarely ever wear Mike simkins

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.340 
that I rarely ever wear Mike simkins
straight<00:02:26.400> because<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.330> me<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.110> lot

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
straight because for me it's a lot

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.640 
straight because for me it's a lot
harder<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.770> blend<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.400> extensions<00:02:30.030> into<00:02:30.660> full

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
harder to blend the extensions into full

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.930 
harder to blend the extensions into full
straight<00:02:31.980> hair<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.340> should<00:02:32.490> wear<00:02:32.580> my<00:02:32.700> hair

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
straight hair so I should wear my hair

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.990 
straight hair so I should wear my hair
is<00:02:33.030> only<00:02:33.210> about<00:02:33.480> two<00:02:33.780> here<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:35.370> has<00:02:35.760> layers

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
is only about two here and it has layers

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.270 
is only about two here and it has layers
that<00:02:36.390> are<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.990> know<00:02:37.110> different<00:02:37.530> lengths<00:02:38.070> up

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
that are you know different lengths up

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
that are you know different lengths up
here<00:02:38.610> up<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.120> extensions<00:02:39.720> um<00:02:40.850> so<00:02:41.850> yeah<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.240> think

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
here up in extensions um so yeah I think

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.360 
here up in extensions um so yeah I think
in<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.020> future<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.350> will<00:02:43.560> start<00:02:43.950> getting<00:02:44.070> back

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
in the future I will start getting back

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.670 
in the future I will start getting back
into<00:02:44.670> glue-in<00:02:45.330> extensions<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.140> maybe<00:02:46.290> talk<00:02:46.650> a

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
into glue-in extensions and maybe talk a

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.990 
into glue-in extensions and maybe talk a
little<00:02:46.860> bit<00:02:47.040> about<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.640> for<00:02:47.850> now

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
little bit about that but for now

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.970 
little bit about that but for now
clip-in<00:02:48.660> extensions<00:02:49.020> are<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.380> easiest<00:02:49.710> form

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
clip-in extensions are the easiest form

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.760 
clip-in extensions are the easiest form
for<00:02:50.400> me<00:02:50.630> because<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:52.020> get<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> lot<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.440> headaches

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
for me because I get a lot of headaches

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.000 
for me because I get a lot of headaches
when<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.310> am<00:02:53.870> wear<00:02:54.870> extensions<00:02:55.200> for<00:02:55.560> too<00:02:55.830> long

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
when I am wear extensions for too long

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.680
