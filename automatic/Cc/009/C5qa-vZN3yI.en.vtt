00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.249 
you the layout it's gonna be a pretty
quick<00:00:22.189> video<00:00:22.779> and<00:00:23.779> i'll<00:00:23.900> go<00:00:24.050> ahead<00:00:24.080> and

quick video and i'll go ahead and
explain<00:00:24.770> how<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.279> build<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:25.910> in<00:00:26.150> such<00:00:26.360> a<00:00:26.390> way

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
explain how to build it in such a way

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
explain how to build it in such a way
that<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:27.439> use<00:00:27.860> up<00:00:28.039> as<00:00:28.220> much<00:00:28.250> as<00:00:28.430> you<00:00:28.669> can<00:00:28.910> and

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
that you use up as much as you can and

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.889 
that you use up as much as you can and
get<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.710> best<00:00:30.860> out<00:00:31.070> of<00:00:31.099> your<00:00:31.279> production<00:00:32.090> now

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899

one<00:00:33.110> thing<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:33.469> might<00:00:33.590> notice<00:00:33.649> is<00:00:34.070> that<00:00:34.130> the

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
one thing you might notice is that the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.220 
one thing you might notice is that the
freights<00:00:34.880> probably<00:00:35.270> very<00:00:35.510> low<00:00:35.750> right<00:00:35.960> here

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
freights probably very low right here

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.350 
freights probably very low right here
the<00:00:36.860> reason<00:00:37.160> being<00:00:37.190> is<00:00:37.489> that<00:00:37.700> you're<00:00:38.149> going<00:00:38.270> to

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
the reason being is that you're going to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.530 
the reason being is that you're going to
want<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.719> have<00:00:38.899> a<00:00:39.320> port<00:00:39.950> set<00:00:40.160> up<00:00:40.280> here<00:00:41.149> as<00:00:41.329> soon

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
want to have a port set up here as soon

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.350 
want to have a port set up here as soon
as<00:00:41.690> possible<00:00:42.200> right<00:00:42.680> now<00:00:42.739> I've<00:00:42.950> only<00:00:43.100> got

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
as possible right now I've only got

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.720 
as possible right now I've only got
25,000<00:00:44.360> people<00:00:44.750> in<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.170> city<00:00:45.350> I<00:00:45.559> need<00:00:46.010> 50,000

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
25,000 people in the city I need 50,000

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.310 
25,000 people in the city I need 50,000
instead<00:00:46.940> of<00:00:47.030> poor<00:00:47.359> and<00:00:47.539> get<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.809> freight<00:00:48.079> so

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
instead of poor and get the freight so

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.840 
instead of poor and get the freight so
then<00:00:48.499> i'll<00:00:48.589> be<00:00:48.710> going<00:00:49.010> right<00:00:49.339> there<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:49.820> that

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
then i'll be going right there and that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.290 
then i'll be going right there and that
will<00:00:50.690> increase<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.230> freight<00:00:51.499> in<00:00:51.649> this<00:00:51.769> area

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
will increase the freight in this area

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.180 
will increase the freight in this area
the<00:00:53.300> other<00:00:53.420> option<00:00:53.839> would<00:00:53.960> be<00:00:54.019> to<00:00:54.140> drag<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:54.920> road

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
the other option would be to drag a road

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.549 
the other option would be to drag a road
from<00:00:55.460> here<00:00:55.820> all<00:00:55.999> the<00:00:56.059> way<00:00:56.659> over<00:00:56.960> but<00:00:57.230> it<00:00:57.320> really

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
from here all the way over but it really

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.579 
from here all the way over but it really
wouldn't<00:00:57.890> increase<00:00:58.129> it<00:00:58.429> that<00:00:58.640> much<00:00:59.350> so<00:01:00.350> let's

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
wouldn't increase it that much so let's

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.220 
wouldn't increase it that much so let's
take<00:01:00.859> a<00:01:00.920> look<00:01:01.249> I<00:01:01.609> there's<00:01:02.269> oil<00:01:02.659> all<00:01:02.899> over<00:01:02.929> the

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
take a look I there's oil all over the

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.290 
take a look I there's oil all over the
place<00:01:03.440> here<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.920> see<00:01:04.519> that<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.820> go<00:01:04.970> over<00:01:05.180> the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
place here to see that you go over the

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.180 
place here to see that you go over the
right<00:01:05.449> side<00:01:05.479> here<00:01:05.870> to<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.110> resources<00:01:06.620> tab<00:01:06.950> and

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
right side here to the resources tab and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.130 
right side here to the resources tab and
then<00:01:07.880> at<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.090> very<00:01:08.300> top<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:08.810> select

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
then at the very top you select

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.640 
then at the very top you select
oil-producing<00:01:09.740> areas<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:12.080> that'll<00:01:12.440> show<00:01:12.620> you

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
oil-producing areas and that'll show you

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.420 
oil-producing areas and that'll show you
kind<00:01:13.159> of<00:01:13.220> white<00:01:14.260> layout<00:01:15.260> of<00:01:15.530> where<00:01:16.130> all<00:01:16.250> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
kind of white layout of where all the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.890 
kind of white layout of where all the
oil<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:16.790> as<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.030> can<00:01:17.090> see<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:17.420> place<00:01:17.750> is

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
oil is as you can see this place is

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.039 
oil is as you can see this place is
pretty<00:01:18.020> much<00:01:18.229> covered<00:01:18.619> in<00:01:18.740> oil<00:01:19.540> so<00:01:20.540> let<00:01:20.780> me<00:01:20.899> go

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
pretty much covered in oil so let me go

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.510 
pretty much covered in oil so let me go
ahead<00:01:21.079> and<00:01:22.960> I'll<00:01:23.960> just<00:01:24.170> show<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.380> using<00:01:25.250> this

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
ahead and I'll just show you using this

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.590 
ahead and I'll just show you using this
corner<00:01:25.939> down<00:01:26.119> here<00:01:26.149> just<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:26.869> continue

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
corner down here just to continue

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.630 
corner down here just to continue
a<00:01:28.659> bit<00:01:30.119> how<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.229> build<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.560> use<00:01:33.100> this<00:01:33.280> up<00:01:33.490> as

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
a bit how to build and use this up as

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.160 
a bit how to build and use this up as
much<00:01:33.820> as<00:01:33.880> possible<00:01:34.030> so<00:01:34.720> you<00:01:34.780> can<00:01:34.840> see<00:01:35.020> there's

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
much as possible so you can see there's

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.050 
much as possible so you can see there's
no<00:01:35.320> white<00:01:35.530> areas<00:01:35.860> down<00:01:36.009> here<00:01:36.400> only<00:01:36.700> because

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
no white areas down here only because

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.090 
no white areas down here only because
it's<00:01:37.540> all<00:01:37.659> taken<00:01:37.990> up<00:01:38.080> by<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.229> oil<00:01:38.590> factory<00:01:38.950> so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
it's all taken up by the oil factory so

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.399 
it's all taken up by the oil factory so
the<00:01:39.190> idea<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.580> use<00:01:40.000> up<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.869> entire<00:01:41.140> amount

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
the idea is to use up the entire amount

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:51.360 
the idea is to use up the entire amount
here

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.950 

just<00:01:52.000> go<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.680> utilities<00:01:53.680> fuel<00:01:54.960> extraction

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
just go to utilities fuel extraction

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.680 
just go to utilities fuel extraction
goods<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.740> then<00:01:57.610> before<00:01:57.940> connecting<00:01:58.450> you

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
goods and then before connecting you

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.080 
goods and then before connecting you
just<00:01:58.840> want<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:58.990> draw<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.320> road<00:01:59.880> make<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.030> as

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
just want to draw the road make it as

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.570 
just want to draw the road make it as
small<00:02:01.390> as<00:02:01.600> possible<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.890> should<00:02:03.220> be<00:02:03.250> about<00:02:03.400> a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
small as possible it should be about a

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.420 
small as possible it should be about a
good<00:02:03.760> size<00:02:03.970> here<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.570> then<00:02:05.410> you'll<00:02:05.560> get<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.950> one

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
good size here and then you'll get a one

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.710 
good size here and then you'll get a one
hundred<00:02:06.700> percent<00:02:06.730> up<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:07.120> the<00:02:07.180> top<00:02:07.420> right

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
hundred percent up in the top right

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.080 
hundred percent up in the top right
there<00:02:07.900> with<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.140> zoning<00:02:08.560> sighs<00:02:09.090> just

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
there with the zoning sighs just

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.050 
there with the zoning sighs just
finished<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.540> off<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.980> there<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.070> go<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:13.030> I

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
finished that off and there you go so I

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.030 
finished that off and there you go so I
like<00:02:13.210> to<00:02:13.240> build<00:02:13.540> all<00:02:13.720> these<00:02:13.870> before<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.560> place

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
like to build all these before I place

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.280 
like to build all these before I place
the<00:02:15.250> roads<00:02:15.490> just<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.660> can<00:02:16.810> get<00:02:17.080> all<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
the roads just so I can get all the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.980 
the roads just so I can get all the
usage<00:02:17.890> they<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.220> out<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.430> them

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.050 

trying<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.010> really<00:02:25.160> fit<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.760> there<00:02:27.910> just<00:02:28.910> so

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
trying to really fit it in there just so

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.440 
trying to really fit it in there just so
it's<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.300> hundred<00:02:29.630> percent

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.809 

now<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:35.109> don't<00:02:35.409> want<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.680> do<00:02:35.769> this<00:02:35.920> too<00:02:36.579> much

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
now you don't want to do this too much

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.970 
now you don't want to do this too much
really<00:02:37.269> rapidly<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.349> reason<00:02:38.620> being<00:02:38.739> that<00:02:38.829> it

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
really rapidly the reason being that it

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.589 
really rapidly the reason being that it
does<00:02:39.159> cost<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.609> lot<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.790> money<00:02:39.879> just<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.329> start

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
does cost a lot of money just to start

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.970 
does cost a lot of money just to start
these<00:02:40.749> up<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.049> your<00:02:41.200> main<00:02:41.379> have<00:02:41.650> enough<00:02:41.799> money

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
these up and your main have enough money

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.489 
these up and your main have enough money
to<00:02:42.219> build<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.819> roads<00:02:43.030> now<00:02:43.569> obviously<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.319> can

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:44.499 
to build the roads now obviously you can

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.860 
to build the roads now obviously you can
see<00:02:44.650> up<00:02:44.769> here<00:02:44.799> I<00:02:45.280> do<00:02:45.579> have<00:02:45.819> plenty<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.180> cash<00:02:46.450> to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
see up here I do have plenty of cash to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.839 
see up here I do have plenty of cash to
build<00:02:47.139> the<00:02:47.379> roads<00:02:47.590> connecting<00:02:48.340> only<00:02:48.639> because

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
build the roads connecting only because

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.759 
build the roads connecting only because
I've<00:02:48.969> already<00:02:49.150> got<00:02:49.389> filled<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.290> tokens

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
I've already got filled and the tokens

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.589 
I've already got filled and the tokens
are<00:02:50.889> selling<00:02:51.310> already<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.849> extraction<00:02:55.389> field

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
are selling already the extraction field

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.770 
are selling already the extraction field
sorry<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.459> now<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.849> have<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.269> do<00:02:58.389> is<00:02:58.510> go<00:02:58.719> ahead

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
sorry so now you have to do is go ahead

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.050 
sorry so now you have to do is go ahead
and<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.230> pull<00:02:59.859> up<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.069> road<00:03:02.159> and<00:03:03.159> connect<00:03:03.999> it

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
and just pull up a road and connect it

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.980 
and just pull up a road and connect it
to<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.359> main<00:03:04.540> road

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.920 

now<00:03:11.620> when<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.280> comes<00:03:12.310> here<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:12.940> want<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.300> try

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
now when it comes here you want to try

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.990 
now when it comes here you want to try
and<00:03:14.020> connect<00:03:14.200> them<00:03:14.410> together<00:03:15.400> as<00:03:15.790> much<00:03:15.940> as

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
and connect them together as much as

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.240 
and connect them together as much as
possible<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.780> reason<00:03:16.810> being<00:03:17.200> is<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.440> you

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
possible the reason being is that you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.250 
possible the reason being is that you
want<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.490> have<00:03:18.880> as<00:03:19.030> few<00:03:19.270> stops<00:03:19.600> on<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.020> road

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
want to have as few stops on this road

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.400 
want to have as few stops on this road
as<00:03:20.380> possible<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:22.540> other<00:03:22.660> option<00:03:23.020> is<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.140> try

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
as possible the other option is to try

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.020 
as possible the other option is to try
and<00:03:23.440> create<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.770> circle<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.280> some<00:03:24.490> sort<00:03:24.730> and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
and create a circle of some sort and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.060 
and create a circle of some sort and
connect<00:03:25.510> them<00:03:25.600> all<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.840> one<00:03:25.960> and<00:03:26.140> then<00:03:26.260> just

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
connect them all to one and then just

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.000 
connect them all to one and then just
drag<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.430> all<00:03:27.700> up<00:03:27.910> here<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:29.500> as<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.770> can<00:03:29.860> see

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
drag it all up here but as you can see

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.040 
drag it all up here but as you can see
just<00:03:30.040> doing<00:03:30.490> it<00:03:30.580> that<00:03:30.790> way<00:03:31.020> we<00:03:32.020> now<00:03:32.260> have

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
just doing it that way we now have

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.450 
just doing it that way we now have
almost<00:03:35.050> complete<00:03:35.440> usage<00:03:35.800> of<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.100> bottom

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
almost complete usage of this bottom

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.700 
almost complete usage of this bottom
area<00:03:36.610> down<00:03:36.850> here<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.450> so<00:03:38.320> you<00:03:38.380> just<00:03:38.500> keep

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
area down here and so you just keep

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.200 
area down here and so you just keep
doing<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.130> in<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.400> fashion<00:03:39.700> where<00:03:40.150> you

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
doing that in that fashion where you

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.780 
doing that in that fashion where you
start<00:03:40.540> off<00:03:40.630> in<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.870> bottom<00:03:41.020> corner<00:03:41.410> of

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
start off in the bottom corner of

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:50.130 
start off in the bottom corner of
wherever<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:42.910> is<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.620> drag<00:03:45.300> drag<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:50.020> then

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
wherever it is and drag drag so then

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.590 
wherever it is and drag drag so then
you've<00:03:50.260> got<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> hundred<00:03:50.620> percent<00:03:50.770> usage<00:03:51.040> and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
you've got a hundred percent usage and

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.820 
you've got a hundred percent usage and
you<00:03:52.600> don't<00:03:52.750> have<00:03:52.840> any<00:03:52.990> small<00:03:53.200> area<00:03:53.470> see<00:03:53.650> what

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
you don't have any small area see what

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.500 
you don't have any small area see what
could<00:03:53.980> happen<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:54.550> if<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:55.090> don't<00:03:55.300> use

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
could happen is if that you don't use

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.930 
could happen is if that you don't use
this<00:03:55.660> method<00:03:55.900> if<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.650> just<00:03:56.860> say<00:03:57.070> well<00:03:57.790> you

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
this method if you just say well you

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.060 
this method if you just say well you
want<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.150> go<00:03:58.240> here<00:04:01.710> then<00:04:02.710> you're<00:04:02.890> gonna<00:04:02.980> have

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
want to go here then you're gonna have

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.680 
want to go here then you're gonna have
spots<00:04:03.490> like<00:04:03.640> this<00:04:03.760> where<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.090> just<00:04:04.390> can't

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
spots like this where you just can't

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.830 
spots like this where you just can't
build<00:04:05.050> I<00:04:05.760> can't<00:04:06.760> do<00:04:06.910> anything<00:04:07.030> in<00:04:07.360> this<00:04:07.450> area

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
build I can't do anything in this area

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.540 
build I can't do anything in this area
because<00:04:08.770> it's<00:04:09.040> just<00:04:09.340> way<00:04:09.490> too<00:04:09.550> small<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:12.400> then

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
because it's just way too small so then

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.680 
because it's just way too small so then
it's<00:04:12.730> just<00:04:12.820> wasted<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.790> also<00:04:15.790> because

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
it's just wasted so you also because

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.039 
it's just wasted so you also because
they<00:04:16.840> all<00:04:16.989> overlap<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:19.030> can<00:04:19.180> see<00:04:19.359> here<00:04:19.600> like

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
they all overlap you can see here like

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.010 
they all overlap you can see here like
that<00:04:20.170> takes<00:04:20.470> up<00:04:20.590> a<00:04:20.680> lot<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:20.890> space<00:04:21.840> if<00:04:22.840> you

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
that takes up a lot of space if you

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.140 
that takes up a lot of space if you
start<00:04:23.260> down<00:04:23.470> here<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:24.430> takes<00:04:24.580> up<00:04:24.790> much<00:04:24.940> less

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
start down here it takes up much less

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.430 
start down here it takes up much less
space<00:04:25.390> because<00:04:25.690> it's<00:04:25.840> just<00:04:25.870> going<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.170> cut<00:04:26.350> it

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
space because it's just going to cut it

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.130 
space because it's just going to cut it
off<00:04:26.560> here<00:04:27.070> instead<00:04:27.760> of<00:04:27.910> taking<00:04:28.450> all<00:04:28.600> this<00:04:28.750> area

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
off here instead of taking all this area

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.060 
off here instead of taking all this area
over<00:04:29.440> here<00:04:29.470> as<00:04:29.830> well<00:04:30.010> so<00:04:30.970> this<00:04:31.180> can<00:04:31.390> be<00:04:31.450> in<00:04:31.690> this

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
over here as well so this can be in this

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.620 
over here as well so this can be in this
circle<00:04:33.070> it's<00:04:33.310> kind<00:04:33.550> of<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.760> you're<00:04:34.030> building

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
circle it's kind of like you're building

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.410 
circle it's kind of like you're building
them<00:04:34.720> as<00:04:34.840> close<00:04:35.110> together<00:04:35.320> as<00:04:35.530> possible<00:04:36.420> but

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
them as close together as possible but

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.250 
them as close together as possible but
that's<00:04:37.660> it<00:04:37.840> for<00:04:38.110> this<00:04:38.320> how<00:04:39.070> to<00:04:39.130> build<00:04:39.460> your<00:04:39.550> oil

extraction fields tutorial once you hit
50,000<00:04:44.110> people<00:04:44.260> you<00:04:44.890> can<00:04:45.130> build<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.760> refinery

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
50,000 people you can build the refinery

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.830 
50,000 people you can build the refinery
which<00:04:47.080> increases<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:47.860> oil<00:04:48.670> production<00:04:49.030> so<00:04:49.720> as

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
which increases the oil production so as

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.000 
which increases the oil production so as
you<00:04:49.960> can<00:04:50.020> see<00:04:50.170> here<00:04:50.350> just<00:04:50.560> building<00:04:50.860> those

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
you can see here just building those

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.629 
you can see here just building those
fields<00:04:51.460> there

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
fields there

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.350 
fields there
you<00:04:53.240> already<00:04:53.599> have<00:04:54.639> seven<00:04:55.639> fields<00:04:55.879> opens<00:04:56.180> and

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
you already have seven fields opens and

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.399 
you already have seven fields opens and
feel<00:04:56.659> is<00:04:56.870> really<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.439> key<00:04:57.879> to<00:04:59.020> making<00:05:00.020> a<00:05:00.229> lot

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
feel is really the key to making a lot

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.170 
feel is really the key to making a lot
of<00:05:00.439> money<00:05:00.680> in<00:05:00.830> this<00:05:00.949> game<00:05:03.310> just<00:05:04.310> having<00:05:04.909> a<00:05:04.969> few

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
of money in this game just having a few

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.110 
of money in this game just having a few
fields<00:05:05.599> that<00:05:05.749> you're<00:05:06.139> getting<00:05:06.490> 39,000<00:05:07.490> per

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
fields that you're getting 39,000 per

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.959 
fields that you're getting 39,000 per
cycle<00:05:08.979> so<00:05:09.979> you're<00:05:10.249> making<00:05:10.370> quite<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.729> bit<00:05:10.909> of

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:10.969 
cycle so you're making quite a bit of

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:12.249 
cycle so you're making quite a bit of
money<00:05:10.999> just<00:05:11.180> from<00:05:11.449> those<00:05:11.659> few<00:05:11.930> fields

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
money just from those few fields

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.589 
money just from those few fields
obviously<00:05:12.949> once<00:05:13.159> you<00:05:13.279> have<00:05:13.430> them<00:05:13.669> filled<00:05:14.449> with
