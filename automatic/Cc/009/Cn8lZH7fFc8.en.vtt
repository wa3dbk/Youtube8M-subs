00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.540
 alpe lusia also school tracks 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.340
 so we talk about the profession 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.040
 of the ski instructor and we do it with 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 stefano griot the ski instructor today 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.870
 stefano is a kind of true 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.270
 escort in the territory we could 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.360
 define it this way because you communicate the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.670
 techniques but also the environment if in 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.010
 primis always try to communicate the 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 technique and certainly infuse 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.160
 ski safety to our customers e 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.160
 to try to explain a moment later 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.500
 landscape is also how it behaves to 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.450
 snow yes because so many teach us 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.840
 mountain writers like rigoni stern 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.640
 for example, there are many types of snow 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.250
 yes the snow is never the same since 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.830
 falls from the sky when it leans in 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.640
 earth continues to change is always in 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.310
 change 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.729
 we can imagine it as a carpet that 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.800
 go down and along the slope of the 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.979
 mountain and always in motion and change 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.619
 always with respect to temperature e 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.450
 to humidity I stefano at this point you 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.610
 I would also ask for advice, see that 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.580
 my skiing needs some 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.250
 correction with just a few mirai 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.619
 any advice but advice first 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.490
 of all is to be relaxed in the 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.500
 skiing without being tense we succeed in 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.990
 the best way to express our 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.360
 technical and physical skills and how it goes 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.729
 set the curve then the curve yes 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.860
 sfross initially uses force 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.290
 of gravity through the movement of 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.740
 our body favors the strength of 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.890
 severity 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.330
 keeping our body always ahead 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.190
 we can't ski well when the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.200
 our body is perpendicular to the slope 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.550
 therefore we must always be projected 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.920
 towards the front 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.490
 in the second part of the curve we must 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.640
 load downhill skiing or outdoor skiing 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.160
 for those who prefer ten trying not to 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.990
 lower our body does not lower it 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.510
 towards the ground then you are very 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:42.950
 engaged in preparing children 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.739
 here you really learn the art 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.040
 yes teach children how to ski 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.900
 just the right method to learn to 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.340
 do this job well because a 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.010
 child is not like talking to one 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.260
 adult person who understands everything well 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.140
 the one who explains to him the child learns 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.959
 at 90 percent for imitation then 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.590
 you have to be very smart to understand 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.959
 the child in front of him and show him 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.630
 how is it in a very way 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.709
 simple without using big words that you don't 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.560
 they are of no use 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.870
 not for nothing some children in the courses 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.910
 foreign collectives who do not understand 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.010
 what you say and do not talk learn to 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.590
 skiing like Italian children because the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.560
 child all his motor patterns are 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.380
 new he learns everything in little 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.970
 time while an adult already has 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.920
 all his motor patterns are already 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.920
 all the facts so you need to be there 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.720
 another type of work is a little more like it 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.940
 can say set an adult person 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.060
 we say that it is more difficult than it is like 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.060
 a child
