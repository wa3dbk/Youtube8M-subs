00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.519
 hi i am vic and welcome once 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:17.580
 more to my channel today I bring you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.520
 a video of outfits but with a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.680
 tap or something different I do not know if 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.570
 you are subscribed to my channel from 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.250
 last year you will know that in summer 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.109
 imparted the entire study as his 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.830
 perception to obstruction to 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.769
 obstruction 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.380
 I'm like that super obsessed with 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.010
 the crop tops or short shirts and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.020
 skirts 8 you are highways ted or larguito si 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.840
 so then when winter came with 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 so much snow and then it will not go to the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.030
 street with choré then I put on like 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.129
 to think in ways that can 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.170
 keep using but make it like a 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.879
 little bit more suitable for the season 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.680
 that it becomes an outfit like that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.879
 There would be myth and warm but still 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.309
 with the product 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.989
 I know there are some people who do not 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.239
 like how to use the products 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.339
 alone I like how to combine it with 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.940
 other garments on top or maybe 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.160
 depending 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.310
 occasion they want the outfit to look at a 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.680
 little bit like that more discreet and formal and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.150
 not so casual so in this video that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.030
 I will be sharing three ideas of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.310
 how to transform crop tops or shirts 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.980
 cortitas in an outfit a bit like 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.440
 that more discreet or more warm and so 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:30.960
 then I hope this video like it like that 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.790
 let's start as you can see me 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.250
 I chose a crotto color black and manga 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.990
 long back has a super opening 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.780
 beautiful that makes the back look 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.820
 very pretty but is very low cut to 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.980
 this season of the year so I decided 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.620
 add this corset I think that yes 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.390
 they call that will cover my tummy but that 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.460
 still it will let you notice the neckline 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.680
 nice from behind I feel that in this way 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.870
 the ofi looks more discreet if 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.720
 we want for a more formalistic occasion 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.450
 and so apart that covers our slices 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.710
 and it also gives us a little more curves to 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.710
 who does not love that 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.770
 and I decided to use these high - heeled boots 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.300
 that are super comfortable and that end 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.300
 complete this first outfit 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.890
 Y 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.530
 yes 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.750
 for the second idea he decided to use this 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.490
 denim jacket that does not have sleeves like that 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.650
 which is perfect because the tapes croc 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.630
 long sleeve covers the entire back and 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
 I feel that the measure remains if it is used with 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.190
 high way state jeans because that way 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.020
 it will not be too long or too short and 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.700
 the good thing about these jean jackets is 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.770
 that can be left open or 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.370
 buttoning them is how you feel 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.370
 more comfortable 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.400
 and I decided to put on these black boots 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.470
 high heels since the gym is high 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.180
 way to be like that they do not cut my legs so much 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.180
 and I look so short 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.410
 3 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.840
 in this third and final idea I'm going to 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.640
 use a flannel shirt any 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.650
 type of these shirts are super good 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.690
 with the products they make the outfit 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.810
 look super casual and can use it 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.070
 placed or tied to the waist and it 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.260
 will look just as good 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.240
 This is a city ​​that I love the most 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.550
 since I like to be casual because 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.740
 It is more comfortable and to give it a little more 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.680
 of style to the outfit decides to add a 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.850
 beanie but this is already optional 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.770
 obviously at the time of leaving I have to 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.970
 wear a coat but I wanted to show you 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.970
 only the outfits 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.430
 and I ended up putting on these brown boots 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.080
 to give a little more color to everything 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.610
 since I am using many colors 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.610
 dark and we finished 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.519
 no no no 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.930
 this has been everything but very many 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.209
 thank you poor think but they liked it 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.890
 has helped them has served them or 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.930
 simply in the wheat of the video or 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.310
 legacy that some idea of ​​inspiration 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.540
 whatever is 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.390
 remember that everyone has 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.580
 different tastes its different style its 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.799
 different view of what is fashion and 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.660
 so if you want another video from another out 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.580
 fit just record one for my channel 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.019
 English, which is exactly what I am 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.209
 put right now but if you want to see the 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.620
 full fit side and thus wide that 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.239
 those of vueling do not forget that 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.799
 I have to go and they urged that for both 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.780
