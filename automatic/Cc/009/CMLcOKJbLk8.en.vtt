I'm<00:01:07.720> almost<00:01:08.229> on<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.619> fence<00:01:08.920> as<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.220> whether

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
I'm almost on the fence as to whether

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.660 
I'm almost on the fence as to whether
that's<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.819> picture<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.179> Megatron<00:01:10.869> but<00:01:11.740> it's<00:01:12.550> a

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
that's a picture of Megatron but it's a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.730 
that's a picture of Megatron but it's a
nice<00:01:12.819> read<00:01:13.179> nonetheless<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:14.110> then<00:01:14.350> we've<00:01:14.530> got

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
nice read nonetheless and then we've got

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.999 
nice read nonetheless and then we've got
the<00:01:14.920> bold<00:01:15.759> transformers<00:01:16.750> over<00:01:17.020> over<00:01:17.440> top<00:01:17.679> with

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
the bold transformers over over top with

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.480 
the bold transformers over over top with
the<00:01:18.250> Autobot<00:01:18.759> symbol<00:01:19.149> at<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.270> top<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.950> also

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
the Autobot symbol at the top I also

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.190 
the Autobot symbol at the top I also
wanted<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.759> point<00:01:22.000> out<00:01:22.119> that<00:01:22.149> this<00:01:22.479> is<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:22.750> level

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
wanted to point out that this is a level

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.960 
wanted to point out that this is a level
3<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.509> second<00:01:26.110> hardest<00:01:26.970> conversion

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
3 so is the second hardest conversion

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.399 
3 so is the second hardest conversion
fact<00:01:28.600> they<00:01:29.080> call<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.619> an<00:01:29.770> advanced<00:01:30.399> conversion

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
fact they call it an advanced conversion

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.469 
fact they call it an advanced conversion
will<00:01:32.409> I<00:01:32.530> be<00:01:32.679> able<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:32.890> transform<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.549> guy<00:01:33.759> who

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
will I be able to transform this guy who

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.460 
will I be able to transform this guy who
knows

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
knows

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.139

breakaway I'm not too sure if breakaways
in<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.340> movie<00:01:54.610> but<00:01:54.789> I'm<00:01:54.910> almost<00:01:55.539> 98%<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.830> I

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
in the movie but I'm almost 98% and I

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
say almost 98% 100% I'm sure that

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.430 
say almost 98% 100% I'm sure that
sideswipe<00:02:00.910> is<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.330> fact<00:02:01.599> in<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.959> movie<00:02:02.289> I

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
sideswipe is in fact in the movie I

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.609 
sideswipe is in fact in the movie I
didn't<00:02:03.340> pick<00:02:03.519> this<00:02:03.670> guy<00:02:03.910> up<00:02:04.229> when<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.259> picked<00:02:05.530> up

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
didn't pick this guy up when I picked up

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.529 
didn't pick this guy up when I picked up
the<00:02:05.679> bumblebee<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:06.610> unfortunate<00:02:07.390> however

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
the bumblebee it's unfortunate however

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.080 
the bumblebee it's unfortunate however
the<00:02:07.959> fact<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.560> figures<00:02:09.340> themselves<00:02:09.550> at

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
the fact that the figures themselves at

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.270 
the fact that the figures themselves at
least<00:02:10.119> in<00:02:10.509> Canada<00:02:10.810> where<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.319> went<00:02:11.709> these

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
least in Canada where I went these

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.630 
least in Canada where I went these
figures<00:02:12.700> were<00:02:12.819> going<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:13.150> about<00:02:13.269> 14<00:02:13.870> almost

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
figures were going for about 14 almost

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.850 
figures were going for about 14 almost
$15<00:02:15.640> which<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.390> thought<00:02:16.780> was<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.019> bit<00:02:17.230> high<00:02:17.500> for

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
$15 which I thought was a bit high for

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.339 
$15 which I thought was a bit high for
the<00:02:17.920> figures<00:02:18.250> themselves<00:02:18.569> but<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:20.260> know

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
the figures themselves but you know

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.979 
the figures themselves but you know
people<00:02:20.709> were<00:02:20.830> buying<00:02:21.129> them<00:02:21.659> so<00:02:22.659> there<00:02:22.870> you

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
people were buying them so there you

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.589 
people were buying them so there you
have<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.200> packaging<00:02:23.739> on<00:02:23.860> bumblebee<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.640> know<00:02:25.480> I

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
have the packaging on bumblebee I know I

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.509 
have the packaging on bumblebee I know I
said<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.930> wouldn't<00:02:26.170> never<00:02:26.709> do<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> revenge<00:02:27.430> of

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
said I wouldn't never do a revenge of

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.420 
said I wouldn't never do a revenge of
the<00:02:27.580> Fallen<00:02:28.000> review<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.470> we'll<00:02:30.099> see<00:02:30.280> how

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the Fallen review so we'll see how

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.000 
the Fallen review so we'll see how
things<00:02:30.700> go<00:02:30.879> and<00:02:31.200> maybe<00:02:32.200> things<00:02:32.560> go<00:02:32.739> well<00:02:32.980> this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
things go and maybe things go well this

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.030 
things go and maybe things go well this
will<00:02:33.430> be<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.670> first<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.120> many<00:02:34.300> reviews<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.709> we

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
will be the first of many reviews so we

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.800 
will be the first of many reviews so we
will<00:02:36.370> open<00:02:36.640> up<00:02:36.760> bumblebee<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.450> we<00:02:37.540> will<00:02:37.690> have

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
will open up bumblebee and we will have

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.470 
will open up bumblebee and we will have
a<00:02:37.840> closer<00:02:38.080> look<00:02:38.319> at<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.370> figure<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.120> here<00:02:40.360> we

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
a closer look at the figure and here we

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.780 
a closer look at the figure and here we
have<00:02:40.599> bumblebee<00:02:41.109> now<00:02:41.439> that<00:02:41.620> he's<00:02:42.209> transformed

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
have bumblebee now that he's transformed

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.149 
have bumblebee now that he's transformed
and<00:02:43.909> when<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.540> say<00:02:44.870> transformed<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.769> use<00:02:45.950> that

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
and when I say transformed I use that

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.369 
and when I say transformed I use that
term<00:02:46.400> very<00:02:46.430> loosely<00:02:46.819> as<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:48.019> can<00:02:48.170> see<00:02:48.349> I

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
term very loosely as you can see I

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.580 
term very loosely as you can see I
didn't<00:02:48.709> quite<00:02:49.010> get<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.370> doors<00:02:50.230> set<00:02:51.230> into

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
didn't quite get the doors set into

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.940 
didn't quite get the doors set into
place<00:02:52.420> but<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.480> quickly<00:02:53.870> transformed<00:02:54.709> him<00:02:54.860> into

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
place but I quickly transformed him into

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.470 
place but I quickly transformed him into
car<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.790> could<00:02:55.970> show<00:02:56.299> you<00:02:56.329> the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
car just so I could show you the

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.589 
car just so I could show you the
transformation<00:02:57.049> back<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.799> robot<00:02:58.250> as<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.450> can

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
transformation back to robot as you can

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.600 
transformation back to robot as you can
see<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.959> car<00:03:00.829> rolls<00:03:01.099> quite<00:03:01.730> well<00:03:02.200> despite<00:03:03.200> my

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
see the car rolls quite well despite my

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.940 
see the car rolls quite well despite my
butchering<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.730> putting<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.120> guy<00:03:05.360> into

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
butchering of putting this guy into

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.059 
butchering of putting this guy into
transformation<00:03:06.950> mode<00:03:07.599> as<00:03:08.599> you<00:03:09.500> can<00:03:09.650> see<00:03:09.829> it's

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
transformation mode as you can see it's

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.759 
transformation mode as you can see it's
a<00:03:11.470> onine<00:03:12.470> Camaro<00:03:13.450> which<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.720> was<00:03:15.049> like<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.470> I

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
a onine Camaro which I was like and I

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.199 
a onine Camaro which I was like and I
was<00:03:16.640> like<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.239> model<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.319> car<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:19.519> guess<00:03:19.940> now

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
was like the model of car I guess now

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.990 
was like the model of car I guess now
that<00:03:20.239> it's<00:03:21.019> an<00:03:21.349> actual<00:03:21.859> production<00:03:22.099> car<00:03:22.670> not<00:03:22.970> a

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
that it's an actual production car not a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.470 
that it's an actual production car not a
concept<00:03:23.599> car<00:03:23.930> were<00:03:24.709> maybe<00:03:24.889> gonna<00:03:25.099> see<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:26.090> car

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
concept car were maybe gonna see the car

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.030 
concept car were maybe gonna see the car
itself<00:03:26.870> in<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.200> movie<00:03:27.470> get<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.680> little<00:03:27.950> more

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
itself in the movie get a little more

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.960 
itself in the movie get a little more
banged<00:03:28.370> up<00:03:29.530> for<00:03:30.530> many<00:03:30.739> of<00:03:30.859> us<00:03:30.980> for<00:03:31.579> for<00:03:31.879> those

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
banged up for many of us for for those

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.990 
banged up for many of us for for those
that<00:03:32.180> know<00:03:33.010> they<00:03:34.010> were<00:03:34.069> very<00:03:34.190> uptight<00:03:34.819> about

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
that know they were very uptight about

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.149 
that know they were very uptight about
having<00:03:35.510> anything<00:03:35.870> happened<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.680> initial

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
having anything happened to the initial

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.170 
having anything happened to the initial
car<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.760> first<00:03:38.000> movie<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.940> like<00:03:41.090> I

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
car in the first movie and so like I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.149 
car in the first movie and so like I
said<00:03:41.359> now<00:03:41.599> that<00:03:41.780> it's<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.109> production<00:03:42.590> car<00:03:42.889> and

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
said now that it's a production car and

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.430 
said now that it's a production car and
it's<00:03:43.579> in<00:03:43.700> production<00:03:43.909> it<00:03:44.750> will<00:03:44.959> see<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.230> little

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
it's in production it will see a little

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.819 
it's in production it will see a little
more<00:03:45.739> damage<00:03:46.370> done<00:03:46.579> to<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.030> vehicle<00:03:47.389> itself

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
more damage done to the vehicle itself

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.949 
more damage done to the vehicle itself
in<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:49.310> way<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.549> transformation<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:50.900> do

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
in the way of transformation and I do

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.740 
in the way of transformation and I do
apologize<00:03:51.549> like<00:03:52.549> I<00:03:52.609> said<00:03:52.940> I<00:03:52.970> don't<00:03:53.120> usually<00:03:53.419> do

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
apologize like I said I don't usually do

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.780 
apologize like I said I don't usually do
transformer<00:03:54.440> reviews<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.340> only<00:03:55.459> reason

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
transformer reviews and the only reason

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.339 
transformer reviews and the only reason
why<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.359> I<00:03:57.230> like<00:03:57.919> to<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:59.329> know<00:03:59.359> I<00:03:59.480> like<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.139> play

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
why is I like to you know I like to play

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.020 
why is I like to you know I like to play
around<00:04:00.470> with<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.829> transformer<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.699> you<00:04:01.940> know

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
around with a transformer and you know

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.939 
around with a transformer and you know
take<00:04:02.239> my<00:04:02.389> time<00:04:02.599> transforming<00:04:03.290> them<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:03.799> do

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
take my time transforming them to do

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.490 
take my time transforming them to do
them<00:04:04.069> on<00:04:04.190> camera<00:04:04.760> however<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:05.510> just<00:04:06.290> know<00:04:06.379> I'm

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
them on camera however I just know I'm

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.409 
them on camera however I just know I'm
gonna<00:04:06.620> screw<00:04:06.949> up<00:04:07.040> something<00:04:07.280> but<00:04:07.699> let's<00:04:08.269> see

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
gonna screw up something but let's see

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.229 
gonna screw up something but let's see
if<00:04:08.449> we<00:04:08.569> can<00:04:08.690> do<00:04:08.750> this<00:04:08.870> together<00:04:09.049> here<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:10.430> think

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
if we can do this together here I think

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.120 
if we can do this together here I think
we'll<00:04:11.540> just<00:04:11.720> bring<00:04:12.290> out<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.620> doors<00:04:13.609> like<00:04:14.120> so

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
we'll just bring out the doors like so

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.339 
we'll just bring out the doors like so
from<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:16.250> point<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:16.820> can<00:04:16.970> actually

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
from that point you can actually

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.770 
from that point you can actually
separate<00:04:18.349> the<00:04:18.820> back<00:04:19.820> end<00:04:20.090> of<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.329> car<00:04:20.539> like

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
separate the back end of the car like

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.100 
separate the back end of the car like
that<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:22.240> have<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.389> like<00:04:23.570> that

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
that and have it like that

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.529 
that and have it like that
and<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:24.590> can<00:04:24.740> see<00:04:24.949> his<00:04:25.130> his<00:04:25.460> pulse<00:04:25.849> cannon<00:04:26.389> or

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
and you can see his his pulse cannon or

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.320 
and you can see his his pulse cannon or
his<00:04:26.630> arm<00:04:27.139> cannon<00:04:27.650> there<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.010> then<00:04:28.940> from<00:04:29.180> there

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
his arm cannon there and then from there

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.980 
his arm cannon there and then from there
we<00:04:29.449> just<00:04:29.479> separate<00:04:30.050> out<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.349> legs<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
we just separate out the legs the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.279 
we just separate out the legs the
windshields<00:04:33.740> are<00:04:34.180> on<00:04:35.180> Springs<00:04:35.690> which<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:36.080> nice

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
windshields are on Springs which is nice

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.870 
windshields are on Springs which is nice
because<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.680> originally<00:04:37.430> thought<00:04:37.460> when<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:37.789> was

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
because I originally thought when I was

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.879 
because I originally thought when I was
transforming<00:04:38.510> him<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.810> broke<00:04:39.169> it<00:04:39.380> but

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
transforming him that I broke it but

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.330 
transforming him that I broke it but
nope<00:04:40.669> that<00:04:41.090> was<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:41.449> the<00:04:41.659> case<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.340> from

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
nope that was not the case and from

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.000 
nope that was not the case and from
there<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:44.270> know<00:04:45.169> he's<00:04:45.289> got<00:04:45.440> an<00:04:45.530> auto<00:04:45.710> more

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
there I know he's got an auto more

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.219 
there I know he's got an auto more
feature<00:04:46.370> I<00:04:46.729> think<00:04:47.300> he<00:04:47.360> just<00:04:47.539> bring<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.930> legs

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
feature I think he just bring the legs

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.990 
feature I think he just bring the legs
down<00:04:48.349> yeah<00:04:48.949> you<00:04:49.099> bring<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.400> legs<00:04:49.580> down<00:04:49.669> like

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
down yeah you bring the legs down like

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.709 
down yeah you bring the legs down like
that<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.570> then<00:04:51.169> you've<00:04:51.440> got<00:04:51.620> his<00:04:51.770> feet<00:04:52.219> just

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:52.719 
that and then you've got his feet just

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.650 
that and then you've got his feet just
around<00:04:53.719> the<00:04:53.900> other<00:04:53.990> side<00:04:54.110> here<00:04:54.590> and

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
around the other side here and

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.410 
around the other side here and
bring<00:04:56.110> down<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.530> foot<00:04:57.280> like<00:04:57.460> that<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.910> that

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
bring down the foot like that and that

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.680 
bring down the foot like that and that
whole<00:04:58.660> part<00:04:59.610> Auto<00:05:00.610> morphs<00:05:01.330> or<00:05:01.420> Auto

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
whole part Auto morphs or Auto

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.330 
whole part Auto morphs or Auto
transforms<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:03.120> from<00:05:04.120> there<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:05.160> think<00:05:06.160> it's

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
transforms and from there I think it's

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.750 
transforms and from there I think it's
just<00:05:06.460> a<00:05:06.610> case<00:05:06.820> of<00:05:06.880> bringing<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.230> arms<00:05:09.130> out

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
just a case of bringing the arms out

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.270 
just a case of bringing the arms out
now<00:05:09.880> that<00:05:10.000> you've<00:05:10.120> separated<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.870> roof<00:05:11.280> bring

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
now that you've separated the roof bring

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.230 
now that you've separated the roof bring
the<00:05:12.400> arms<00:05:12.670> out<00:05:12.790> like<00:05:13.000> that<00:05:14.790> and<00:05:15.790> bring<00:05:16.120> the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
the arms out like that and bring the

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.120 
the arms out like that and bring the
tires<00:05:16.510> out<00:05:17.010> and<00:05:18.150> bring<00:05:19.150> those<00:05:19.300> forward<00:05:20.130> and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
tires out and bring those forward and

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.000 
tires out and bring those forward and
you<00:05:21.250> can<00:05:21.280> see<00:05:21.550> his<00:05:21.670> head<00:05:21.940> down<00:05:22.120> below<00:05:22.510> there

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
you can see his head down below there

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.050 
you can see his head down below there
and<00:05:25.170> his<00:05:26.170> arm<00:05:26.470> stuck<00:05:26.860> that's<00:05:27.100> why<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.850> just

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
and his arm stuck that's why you just

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.000 
and his arm stuck that's why you just
bring<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.390> arms<00:05:28.630> out<00:05:28.780> like<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:30.030> and<00:05:31.710> then<00:05:32.710> we

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
bring the arms out like that and then we

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.300 
bring the arms out like that and then we
just<00:05:33.460> drop<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.510> hood<00:05:35.050> part<00:05:35.440> here<00:05:35.830> if<00:05:35.980> I<00:05:36.100> can

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
just drop the hood part here if I can

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.490 
just drop the hood part here if I can
get<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.640> head<00:05:36.850> clear<00:05:39.810> this<00:05:40.810> is<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.020> first

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
get the head clear this is the first

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.620 
get the head clear this is the first
time<00:05:41.800> I've<00:05:42.010> this<00:05:42.340> is<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.030> first<00:05:43.270> time<00:05:43.480> I've

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
time I've this is the first time I've

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.290 
time I've this is the first time I've
transformed<00:05:44.230> him<00:05:44.640> from<00:05:45.640> transforming

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
transformed him from transforming

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.780 
transformed him from transforming
originally<00:05:46.870> in<00:05:46.990> car<00:05:47.290> mode<00:05:47.530> so<00:05:47.830> I<00:05:47.860> do<00:05:48.130> apologize

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
originally in car mode so I do apologize

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.910 
originally in car mode so I do apologize
if<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:49.240> don't<00:05:49.480> do<00:05:49.660> this<00:05:49.840> quite<00:05:50.230> right<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.710> first

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
if I don't do this quite right the first

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.160 
if I don't do this quite right the first
time<00:05:51.040> and<00:05:51.700> I<00:05:52.270> believe<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.630> just<00:05:52.810> bring<00:05:53.020> these

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
time and I believe you just bring these

00:05:53.170 --> 00:06:00.270 
time and I believe you just bring these
wheels<00:05:53.890> forward<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:56.040> I<00:05:59.100> think<00:06:00.100> you<00:06:00.250> just

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
wheels forward and I think you just

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.200 
wheels forward and I think you just
bring<00:06:00.700> these<00:06:00.940> up<00:06:01.440> that's<00:06:02.440> not<00:06:02.590> right<00:06:03.210> bring

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
bring these up that's not right bring

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.650 
bring these up that's not right bring
these<00:06:04.390> up<00:06:05.880> and<00:06:06.900> like<00:06:07.900> there<00:06:08.320> there<00:06:08.800> we<00:06:08.860> go<00:06:09.660> and

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
these up and like there there we go and

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.360 
these up and like there there we go and
I<00:06:10.840> think<00:06:11.080> that's<00:06:11.230> about<00:06:11.350> it<00:06:11.680> I<00:06:11.710> mean<00:06:12.040> then<00:06:12.220> you

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
I think that's about it I mean then you

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.940 
I think that's about it I mean then you
go<00:06:12.520> just<00:06:12.820> adjust<00:06:13.350> little<00:06:14.350> parts<00:06:14.650> here<00:06:14.919> and

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
go just adjust little parts here and

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:24.600 
go just adjust little parts here and
there<00:06:15.250> on<00:06:15.490> them<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:19.410> all<00:06:20.410> right<00:06:23.220> like<00:06:24.220> I<00:06:24.340> said

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
there on them and all right like I said

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.540 
there on them and all right like I said
normally<00:06:24.820> I<00:06:25.330> transform<00:06:26.190> transformers<00:06:27.190> Justin

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
normally I transform transformers Justin

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.480 
normally I transform transformers Justin
you<00:06:28.240> know<00:06:28.330> just<00:06:28.660> you<00:06:29.020> know<00:06:29.050> if<00:06:29.320> I'm<00:06:29.490> watching

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
you know just you know if I'm watching

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.370 
you know just you know if I'm watching
TV<00:06:30.640> or<00:06:31.000> something<00:06:31.210> like<00:06:31.360> that<00:06:31.510> but<00:06:32.290> to

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
TV or something like that but to

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.110 
TV or something like that but to
actually<00:06:32.500> do<00:06:32.740> it<00:06:32.860> on<00:06:32.919> camera<00:06:33.310> you<00:06:33.760> know<00:06:33.880> you're

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
actually do it on camera you know you're

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.670 
actually do it on camera you know you're
you're<00:06:34.660> paranoid<00:06:35.080> about<00:06:35.260> getting<00:06:35.410> the

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
you're paranoid about getting the

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.680 
you're paranoid about getting the
transferrin<00:06:36.210> transformation<00:06:37.210> right<00:06:37.450> and

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
transferrin transformation right and

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.820 
transferrin transformation right and
everything<00:06:37.990> else<00:06:38.169> so<00:06:40.200> but<00:06:41.200> I<00:06:41.230> think<00:06:41.470> that's<00:06:41.620> I

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
everything else so but I think that's I

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.740 
everything else so but I think that's I
think<00:06:42.010> that's<00:06:42.250> right<00:06:42.520> and<00:06:42.790> then<00:06:43.210> fold<00:06:43.570> back

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750 
think that's right and then fold back

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.080 
think that's right and then fold back
the<00:06:44.700> pull<00:06:45.700> back<00:06:45.850> the<00:06:46.090> doors<00:06:46.120> there<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:48.090> there

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
the pull back the doors there and there

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.950 
the pull back the doors there and there
you<00:06:49.270> have<00:06:49.530> bumblebee<00:06:51.180> with<00:06:52.180> his<00:06:52.360> arm<00:06:52.540> cannon

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
you have bumblebee with his arm cannon

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.570 
you have bumblebee with his arm cannon
there<00:06:53.520> which<00:06:54.520> is<00:06:54.669> nice<00:06:54.820> arm<00:06:55.630> cannon<00:06:56.050> rotates

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
there which is nice arm cannon rotates

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.570 
there which is nice arm cannon rotates
he<00:06:57.580> does<00:06:57.790> come<00:06:58.030> with<00:06:58.150> a<00:06:58.210> missile<00:06:58.660> that<00:06:58.840> you<00:06:59.350> can

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
he does come with a missile that you can

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.170 
he does come with a missile that you can
lock<00:07:00.580> into<00:07:00.820> place<00:07:01.060> like<00:07:01.600> that<00:07:01.919> and<00:07:02.940> he<00:07:03.940> can

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
lock into place like that and he can

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.920 
lock into place like that and he can
fire<00:07:04.539> I<00:07:04.900> won't<00:07:05.320> do<00:07:05.410> that<00:07:05.470> right<00:07:05.800> now<00:07:06.930> overall

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
fire I won't do that right now overall

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.600 
fire I won't do that right now overall
it's<00:07:08.200> not<00:07:08.260> a<00:07:08.350> bad<00:07:08.560> figure<00:07:08.950> now

but I'll just put that aside for the
time<00:07:26.530> being

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
time being

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.909
