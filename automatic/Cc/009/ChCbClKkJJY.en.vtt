Gary Fong here and I'm going to show you

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.910 
Gary Fong here and I'm going to show you
the<00:00:02.520> difference<00:00:02.850> between<00:00:02.909> an<00:00:03.389> umbrella<00:00:03.920> and

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
the difference between an umbrella and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.490 
the difference between an umbrella and
light<00:00:05.580> sphere<00:00:05.759> for<00:00:06.330> shooting<00:00:06.690> indoors<00:00:06.990> now<00:00:07.230> on

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
light sphere for shooting indoors now on

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.350 
light sphere for shooting indoors now on
I've<00:00:07.919> got<00:00:08.160> basically<00:00:08.400> what<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> have<00:00:09.059> here<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.330> a

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
I've got basically what I have here is a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.410 
I've got basically what I have here is a
cannon<00:00:09.960> flash<00:00:10.740> on<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.219> little<00:00:11.759> remote<00:00:12.120> trigger

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
cannon flash on a little remote trigger

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.589 
cannon flash on a little remote trigger
and<00:00:13.580> here's<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:14.790> thing<00:00:14.940> about<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> umbrella

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
and here's one thing about the umbrella

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.240 
and here's one thing about the umbrella
now<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.900> umbrella<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.410> basically<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.920> bounce

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
now the umbrella is basically a bounce

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.040 
now the umbrella is basically a bounce
back<00:00:17.550> kind<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.850> situation<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.720> I'm<00:00:18.779> show<00:00:18.990> you

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
back kind of situation and I'm show you

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.990 
back kind of situation and I'm show you
the<00:00:19.230> lighting<00:00:19.529> comparison<00:00:20.250> between<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.789> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the lighting comparison between this and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.900 
the lighting comparison between this and
the<00:00:21.060> umbrella<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.220> what<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> explain

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
the umbrella and what I like to explain

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.019 
the umbrella and what I like to explain
is<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:25.109> umbrella<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.710> really<00:00:26.640> kind<00:00:26.939> of

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
is that the umbrella is really kind of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
is that the umbrella is really kind of
not<00:00:27.539> only<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> cumbersome<00:00:28.439> kind<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.859> thing

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
not only as a cumbersome kind of a thing

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.589 
not only as a cumbersome kind of a thing
to<00:00:29.250> take<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.640> wedding<00:00:29.970> assignment<00:00:30.539> or

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to take on a wedding assignment or

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.330 
to take on a wedding assignment or
whatever<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> slightest<00:00:32.160> puff

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
whatever but just the slightest puff

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.740 
whatever but just the slightest puff
will<00:00:32.520> win<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.850> it'll<00:00:33.030> blow<00:00:33.149> over

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
will win and it'll blow over

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.139 
will win and it'll blow over
and<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.680> I've<00:00:34.800> stopped<00:00:35.070> using<00:00:35.280> them<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.030> I'll

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and so I've stopped using them and I'll

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.760 
and so I've stopped using them and I'll
show<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.420> why<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:36.930> first<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.440> course<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
show you why but first of course the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.930 
show you why but first of course the
most<00:00:37.890> important<00:00:38.309> thing<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.520> let's<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
most important thing is let's get the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.160 
most important thing is let's get the
best<00:00:39.149> light<00:00:39.329> quality<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.840> I'm<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
best light quality so I'm going to do a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.979 
best light quality so I'm going to do a
comparison<00:00:40.559> between<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.670> umbrella<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
comparison between the umbrella and the

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.110 
comparison between the umbrella and the
light<00:00:43.170> sphere<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.829> you'll<00:00:44.550> notice<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.969> it's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
light sphere and you'll notice that it's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.490 
light sphere and you'll notice that it's
really<00:00:45.450> dark<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:48.050> not<00:00:49.050> getting<00:00:49.350> any

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
really dark here so not getting any

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
really dark here so not getting any
ambient<00:00:50.010> light<00:00:50.190> now<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> figure<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.180> what<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
ambient light now to figure out what the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
ambient light now to figure out what the
exposure<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.230> anything<00:00:52.710> when<00:00:52.829> you're

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
exposure is on anything when you're

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.250 
exposure is on anything when you're
using<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.340> manual<00:00:53.610> flash<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> want<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
using a manual flash because you want to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
using a manual flash because you want to
use<00:00:55.320> manual<00:00:55.890> when<00:00:56.280> you're<00:00:56.399> using<00:00:56.579> these<00:00:56.820> kind

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
use manual when you're using these kind

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.060 
use manual when you're using these kind
of<00:00:57.149> lights<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.629> lot<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.440> times<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.800> help<00:00:58.980> you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
of lights a lot of times to help you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.459 
of lights a lot of times to help you
with<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> creativity<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:00:59.940> mix<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
with a creativity you can mix the the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.709 
with a creativity you can mix the the
flash<00:01:01.890> versus<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.520> available<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
flash versus be available and the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.359 
flash versus be available and the
quickest<00:01:04.019> way<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> get<00:01:04.470> an<00:01:04.619> exposure<00:01:04.979> without

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
quickest way to get an exposure without

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
quickest way to get an exposure without
having<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> use<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> light<00:01:06.119> meter<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.630> basically

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
having to use a light meter is basically

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
having to use a light meter is basically
take<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:08.010> lightsphere<00:01:08.820> collapsible<00:01:08.909> dome

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
take your lightsphere collapsible dome

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
take your lightsphere collapsible dome
put<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.530> over<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.860> lens<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.310> take<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.090> shot

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
put it over your lens and take one shot

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.800 
put it over your lens and take one shot
from<00:01:14.270> into<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.299> umbrella<00:01:15.979> umbrella<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.820> what

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
from into the umbrella umbrella and what

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.950 
from into the umbrella umbrella and what
will<00:01:18.930> happen<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.409> it'll<00:01:20.159> show<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.720> kind<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
will happen is it'll show you kind of a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080 
will happen is it'll show you kind of a
grey<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.400> want<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> go<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> your

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
grey thing you want to go to your

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.170 
grey thing you want to go to your
histogram<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.250> look<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> histogram<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
histogram and look at the histogram and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
histogram and look at the histogram and
see<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.409> histogram<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> middle

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
see if your histogram is in the middle

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.520 
see if your histogram is in the middle
if<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> middle<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.259> correct

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
if it's in the middle you have a correct

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.200 
if it's in the middle you have a correct
exposure<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:33.000> so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
exposure and that's what I have here so

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.569 
exposure and that's what I have here so
that<00:01:33.509> tells<00:01:33.810> me<00:01:33.960> really<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.070> super<00:01:35.250> quick

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that tells me really really super quick

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.219 
that tells me really really super quick
without<00:01:35.820> without<00:01:36.420> having<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.960> meter

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
without without having to have a meter

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.460 
without without having to have a meter
how<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> get<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> accurate<00:01:38.520> exposure<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.780> I'm

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
how to get the accurate exposure now I'm

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.569 
how to get the accurate exposure now I'm
going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> go<00:01:40.860> ahead<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:42.020> do<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> quick<00:01:43.259> image

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
going to go ahead and do a quick image

00:01:43.579 --> 00:02:14.260 
going to go ahead and do a quick image

instead<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> umbrella<00:02:23.820> we<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.180> this

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
instead of the umbrella we have this

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.530 
instead of the umbrella we have this
light<00:02:24.990> sphere<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.790> got<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.090> dome<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
light sphere and it's got the dome and

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.150 
light sphere and it's got the dome and
I've<00:02:27.690> got<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.050> dome<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.590> I'm<00:02:28.680> pointing<00:02:29.070> it

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
I've got the dome on and I'm pointing it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.770 
I've got the dome on and I'm pointing it
directly<00:02:29.430> at<00:02:29.760> Union<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.570> going<00:02:30.720> to

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
directly at Union what this is going to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.140 
directly at Union what this is going to
do<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.350> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> give<00:02:31.770> us<00:02:31.800> some<00:02:32.160> more

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
do is this is going to give us some more

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.690 
do is this is going to give us some more
of<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.560> rather<00:02:34.560> than<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.830> spill<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.190> going<00:02:35.610> all

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
of a rather than a spill like going all

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.949 
of a rather than a spill like going all
around<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.180> going<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.360> give<00:02:36.480> us<00:02:36.570> more<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.870> a

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
around it's going to give us more of a

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.540 
around it's going to give us more of a
focus<00:02:37.320> light<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.740> we<00:02:37.890> would<00:02:38.040> expect<00:02:38.370> with

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
focus light like we would expect with

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.480 
focus light like we would expect with
the<00:02:38.640> umbrella<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.020> much<00:02:40.230> smaller<00:02:40.560> size

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
the umbrella but in a much smaller size

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.530 
the umbrella but in a much smaller size
okay

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.210 

okay<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.349> this<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.220> difference<00:02:50.580> between

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
okay so this is the difference between

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:02.220 
okay so this is the difference between
the<00:02:53.220> two

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.710
