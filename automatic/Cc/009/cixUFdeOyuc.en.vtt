00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
yes i was just because it was completely

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.030 
yes i was just because it was completely
different<00:02:24.630> from<00:02:24.930> everything<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.830> had<00:02:25.980> ever

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040

this training correctly but just getting

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.050 
this training correctly but just getting
the<00:03:06.960> basic<00:03:07.320> idea<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.250> worked<00:03:08.460> into<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.030> now

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
the basic idea as I worked into and now

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.210 
the basic idea as I worked into and now
feel<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:09.690> I'm<00:03:09.870> doing<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.260> properly<00:03:10.440> Ryan

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220

every<00:03:11.670> single<00:03:12.000> time<00:03:12.180> I'm<00:03:12.480> doing<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.840> right

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
every single time I'm doing it right

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.780 
every single time I'm doing it right
because<00:03:13.170> before<00:03:13.620> I'd<00:03:13.920> sometimes<00:03:14.280> test

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
because before I'd sometimes test

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.460 
because before I'd sometimes test
something<00:03:15.030> but<00:03:15.330> not<00:03:15.450> listen<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.960> test<00:03:16.290> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
something but not listen to the test and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.310

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
I've become more one sided with this

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
ladders yeah yeah I see that I see that

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.600 
ladders yeah yeah I see that I see that
in<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.760> organ<00:04:12.180> all<00:04:12.360> right<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.490> other

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
in you organ all right so to the other

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.580 
in you organ all right so to the other
people<00:04:14.910> who<00:04:15.000> are<00:04:15.030> skeptical<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.630> this<00:04:15.780> right

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
people who are skeptical of this right

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.010 
people who are skeptical of this right
what<00:04:17.280> would<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.489> tell<00:04:17.640> them<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.910> just<00:04:18.720> give<00:04:18.900> it

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
what would you tell them I just give it

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.449 
what would you tell them I just give it
a<00:04:19.050> try<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.350> mean<00:04:19.650> that's<00:04:19.739> all<00:04:19.920> you<00:04:19.950> have<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.340> do

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
a try I mean that's all you have to do

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.240 
a try I mean that's all you have to do
if<00:04:20.900> put<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.170> test<00:04:22.410> if<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.770> doesn't<00:04:23.100> work

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
if put it to the test if it doesn't work

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.800 
if put it to the test if it doesn't work
out<00:04:23.430> then<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.970> can<00:04:24.120> go<00:04:24.240> back<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.450> what<00:04:24.690> you're

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
out then you can go back to what you're

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.420 
out then you can go back to what you're
doing<00:04:24.870> but<00:04:25.200> if<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.470> does<00:04:25.650> work<00:04:25.800> out<00:04:26.010> just<00:04:26.190> look

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
doing but if it does work out just look

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.920 
doing but if it does work out just look
at<00:04:26.580> what<00:04:26.760> it's<00:04:26.880> going<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.060> mean<00:04:27.120> for<00:04:27.540> your

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
at what it's going to mean for your

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.780 
at what it's going to mean for your
workouts<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.530> for<00:04:28.800> what<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.250> does<00:04:29.400> for<00:04:29.640> you

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
right so so where do you where do you

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.960 
right so so where do you where do you
predict<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.370> going<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.580> go<00:04:32.670> for<00:04:32.880> you

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
predict this is going to go for you

in every workout what the hell does that

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.690 
in every workout what the hell does that
mean<00:04:38.930> well<00:04:39.930> I'm<00:04:40.350> planning<00:04:41.160> on<00:04:41.220> being<00:04:41.430> when<00:04:41.610> the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
mean well I'm planning on being when the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.520 
mean well I'm planning on being when the
strongest<00:04:42.060> people<00:04:42.270> alive<00:04:42.660> I'm<00:04:43.020> that<00:04:43.350> may

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
strongest people alive I'm that may

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.060 
strongest people alive I'm that may
sound<00:04:44.090> ballsy<00:04:45.090> or<00:04:45.330> brash<00:04:45.570> but<00:04:45.930> that's<00:04:46.650> my<00:04:46.830> goal

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
sound ballsy or brash but that's my goal

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.430 
sound ballsy or brash but that's my goal
and<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.670> think<00:04:47.970> with<00:04:48.330> this<00:04:48.510> protocol<00:04:48.990> get<00:04:49.260> there

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
and I think with this protocol get there

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.800 
and I think with this protocol get there
even<00:04:49.530> faster<00:04:50.040> badass<00:04:50.730> Chloe<00:04:51.210> thank<00:04:51.570> you<00:04:51.660> very
