00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
advantage here so instead of using going

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.700 
advantage here so instead of using going
like<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.690> just<00:01:36.840> use<00:01:37.050> one<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.410> go<00:01:37.500> down

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
like this you just use one and go down

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.639 
like this you just use one and go down
like<00:01:37.800> that<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.160> it<00:01:38.820> will<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.929> see<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.530> that's

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
like that and it will just see so that's

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.190 
like that and it will just see so that's
that<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.880> three<00:01:42.149> virtual<00:01:42.660> fingers

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that is like like three virtual fingers

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.309 
that is like like three virtual fingers
on<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.440> screen<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> tap<00:01:44.759> now<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:47.640> will

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
on the screen so if you tap now it will

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.320 
on the screen so if you tap now it will
ill<00:01:49.319> say<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.800> been<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.399> tap<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.819> once<00:01:51.000> with

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
ill say it's been your tap it once with

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.809 
ill say it's been your tap it once with
one<00:01:51.539> finger<00:01:52.099> but<00:01:53.099> it's<00:01:53.280> actually<00:01:53.399> tapping

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
one finger but it's actually tapping

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.240 
one finger but it's actually tapping
with<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.410> three<00:01:55.649> fingers<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
with with the three fingers on the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.359 
with with the three fingers on the
screen<00:01:56.369> now<00:01:57.319> so<00:01:58.319> you<00:01:58.380> cover<00:01:58.800> much<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.880> screen

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
screen now so you cover much more screen

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.499 
screen now so you cover much more screen
and<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.459> can<00:02:02.550> just<00:02:02.700> go<00:02:02.819> around<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.179> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and you can just go around like this and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.320 
and you can just go around like this and
I<00:02:04.050> think<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.349> can<00:02:04.500> also<00:02:04.649> scroll<00:02:05.160> yet<00:02:05.489> I<00:02:05.700> don't

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
I think you can also scroll yet I don't

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.979 
I think you can also scroll yet I don't
think<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:06.599> can<00:02:06.720> do<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.929> with<00:02:07.020> five<00:02:07.229> fingers

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
think you can do it with five fingers

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.050 
think you can do it with five fingers
but<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.349> go<00:02:10.649> around<00:02:10.970> haven't<00:02:11.970> let

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
but you can just go around haven't let

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.339 
but you can just go around haven't let
us<00:02:12.150> get<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:13.069> lot<00:02:14.069> point<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.700> lot<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.270> points

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.720
