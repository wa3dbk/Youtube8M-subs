00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
now I when it began this video I

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.320 
now I when it began this video I
actually<00:04:33.340> was<00:04:34.340> trying<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.729> show<00:04:34.970> something

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
actually was trying to show something

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.120 
actually was trying to show something
different<00:04:35.479> it's<00:04:36.199> actually<00:04:36.500> not<00:04:36.590> even<00:04:36.800> doing

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
different it's actually not even doing

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.760 
different it's actually not even doing
what<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.430> was<00:04:37.639> initially<00:04:37.910> expecting<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.020> so

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
what I was initially expecting it to so

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.640 
what I was initially expecting it to so
I<00:04:40.210> guess<00:04:41.210> this<00:04:41.389> is<00:04:41.449> like<00:04:41.600> an<00:04:41.810> extra<00:04:42.199> problem

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
I guess this is like an extra problem

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.159 
I guess this is like an extra problem
I'm<00:04:42.740> having<00:04:42.889> with<00:04:43.100> this<00:04:43.400> one<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:43.610> don't<00:04:43.940> know

initially<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:03.229> problem<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:03.650> was<00:05:03.740> having<00:05:03.889> with

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
initially the problem I was having with

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.180 
initially the problem I was having with
this<00:05:04.479> was<00:05:05.479> I<00:05:05.780> would<00:05:05.960> turn<00:05:06.110> it<00:05:06.139> on<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:06.710> it<00:05:07.099> would

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
this was I would turn it on and it would

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.760 
this was I would turn it on and it would
be<00:05:07.340> blue<00:05:07.639> red<00:05:08.090> whatever<00:05:08.690> you<00:05:08.990> know<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.289> is<00:05:09.440> and

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
be blue red whatever you know it is and

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.219 
be blue red whatever you know it is and
then<00:05:10.340> after<00:05:10.669> about<00:05:10.729> a<00:05:10.849> minute<00:05:11.060> or<00:05:11.300> so<00:05:11.539> I<00:05:11.840> just

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
then after about a minute or so I just

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.740 
then after about a minute or so I just
shut<00:05:12.680> off<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:13.160> light<00:05:13.669> would<00:05:13.880> just<00:05:14.060> not<00:05:14.360> be<00:05:14.389> on

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
shut off the light would just not be on

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
when that light may be used down the

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.120 
when that light may be used down the
road<00:05:48.470> which<00:05:49.190> is<00:05:49.220> kind<00:05:49.520> of<00:05:49.580> why<00:05:49.699> I<00:05:50.889> don't<00:05:51.889> like

I'm<00:05:57.500> just<00:05:57.560> uh<00:05:57.949> heads-up<00:05:58.909> I<00:05:59.090> guess<00:05:59.270> you<00:05:59.389> could

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
I'm just uh heads-up I guess you could

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.860

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:12.769 
because I actually bought this prior to

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:16.269 
because I actually bought this prior to
