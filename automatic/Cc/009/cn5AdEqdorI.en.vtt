00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.430 
so I think I loved it like that much
more<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.640> then<00:01:47.060> like<00:01:47.240> what<00:01:47.750> Amy<00:01:47.900> said<00:01:48.020> like

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
more and then like what Amy said like

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.230 
more and then like what Amy said like
what<00:01:48.770> happened<00:01:49.190> like<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.850> couldn't<00:01:50.180> even

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
what happened like you couldn't even

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.120 
what happened like you couldn't even
tell<00:01:50.510> because<00:01:50.690> she<00:01:50.870> bounced<00:01:51.080> back<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:51.350> fast

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
tell because she bounced back so fast

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.910 
tell because she bounced back so fast
and<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:53.150> lot<00:01:53.660> of<00:01:53.930> people<00:01:54.200> don't<00:01:54.470> know<00:01:54.710> what<00:01:54.830> to

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
and a lot of people don't know what to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.130 
and a lot of people don't know what to
do<00:01:55.010> in<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.130> situation<00:01:55.310> they<00:01:55.790> panic<00:01:56.210> but<00:01:56.420> I<00:01:56.660> feel

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
do in a situation they panic but I feel

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.570 
do in a situation they panic but I feel
like<00:01:57.230> it's<00:01:57.380> just<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.560> performers<00:01:58.070> instinct<00:01:58.490> and

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
like it's just a performers instinct and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.340 
like it's just a performers instinct and
a<00:01:58.640> true<00:01:59.240> dancers<00:01:59.600> instant<00:01:59.930> to<00:01:59.990> just<00:02:00.170> keep

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
a true dancers instant to just keep

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.469 
a true dancers instant to just keep
going<00:02:00.710> no<00:02:00.800> matter<00:02:00.830> what<00:02:01.280> like<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:02.060> slip<00:02:02.330> up

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
the chemistry that works I think we

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.750 
the chemistry that works I think we
generally<00:02:26.600> feed<00:02:26.840> off<00:02:26.989> each<00:02:27.020> other<00:02:27.350> like<00:02:27.800> when

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
generally feed off each other like when

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.030 
generally feed off each other like when
when<00:02:29.060> one<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.330> us<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.690> upset<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.470> other<00:02:30.709> really

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
when one of us is upset the other really

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.220 
when one of us is upset the other really
does<00:02:31.220> feel<00:02:31.459> upset<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.060> like<00:02:32.209> we<00:02:32.330> know<00:02:32.600> when<00:02:33.110> we

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
does feel upset so like we know when we

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.810 
does feel upset so like we know when we
put<00:02:33.380> ourselves<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.830> good<00:02:33.950> moods<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:34.430> we<00:02:34.640> can

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
put ourselves in good moods like we can

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.800 
put ourselves in good moods like we can
really<00:02:35.090> show<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.989> chemistry<00:02:36.410> on<00:02:36.590> stage

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
really show that the chemistry on stage

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.120 
really show that the chemistry on stage

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.460 
and then vice versa we're really really
pumped<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.550> ready<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.820> go<00:02:41.000> we<00:02:41.480> like<00:02:41.690> like<00:02:42.260> in

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
we feed off each other I think we both

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.650 
we feed off each other I think we both
have<00:02:49.100> like<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.280> lot<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.549> energy<00:02:49.910> when<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.480> comes
