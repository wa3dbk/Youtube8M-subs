00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 let's watch a third episode of psv 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.080
 I try to transform this series 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.269
 him fall from two old computers 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.610
 make a budget gaming copy with 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.530
 a budget of 105 euros but they now 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.340
 picture and I see you from the other 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.900
 computer 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 the motherboard and processor at the table and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.020
 I do this because they peeled that 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.689
 we made the other one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.519
 processes and motherboard are not working properly 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.160
 for example, we got 10 fps 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.529
 on striving we knew in advance 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.970
 of course already on a dual-core with one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.099
 lower clock speed 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.280
 is better than a single core with one 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.540
 higher clock speed but especially gaming 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.110
 we did not see such a big difference 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.420
 arrive 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.010
 in the background you see how i do everything 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.960
 transferring is from the old one 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.399
 cupboard to the new one 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.930
 and cleaning the processor and 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.420
 processor cooler also the ram memory 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.250
 we have to get in and the cables out 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
 power supply must be reconnected to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.590
 the motherboard 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.590
 the same applies to the video card 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.190
 this image is ready and what windows 7 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.260
 like graphics card drivers on 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.590
 it all seemed well installed 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.510
 to work 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.130
 after which there is a few games on it 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.130
 principle and have tried it out 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.810
 in the next episode we will take a look 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.770
 to the benchmarks and other results 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.770
 until then
