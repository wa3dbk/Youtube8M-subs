00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 same joke on April 1 before after 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.779

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.939
 Many English youtube I realized that 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.980
 this is real and this is not the movie that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.740
 iron horse comes out of the studio 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.780

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 in which take part producer who 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.590
 worked warner brothers and let's 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.480
 we honor the parish subsidy will 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.730
 made by such and such guys 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.190
 the game comes Freddie phaseber pizza 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.100
 a darker version of chucky cheese where the group 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.100
 animatronics sings songs in the afternoon however 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.920
 at night she goes to kill 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.860
 the task of the game is to survive while you are closed and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.640
 in a small room knowing what's outside 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.460
 go terrible and crazy cars that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.229
 can jump on you any second 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.260
 further some smith said we want 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.270
 work with scott to do it 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.610
 incredible exciting and weird 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 lovely movie and that's what he said himself 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.250
 caftan story true will be released as 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.640
 film and she will be talking about big 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.860
 and unexplored yet the storyline of this 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.409
 horror which many people you can 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.509
 talk and people can refer to it 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.759
 the film is currently the writers 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.829
 tra-ta-ta is done by some guys 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.380
 Here it seems that the guys who are engaged 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.570
 this film created an adaptation of the book 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.400
 Stephen Kinga she seems to me that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.530
 filming stephen king and somehow 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.729
 Allah would give me so we can 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.040
 believe that the movie will come out 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.140
 really awesome now let's just 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.299
 let's discuss Scott said it would be 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.460
 telling some story which 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.220
 not yet learned perhaps she just 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.250

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.649

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.050
 we still donâ€™t even know how 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.840
 what was really going on there 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.000
 we build theories they are probably true but 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.010
 maybe and no wonder what 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.390
 happened to a man who was bitten 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.340
 on a bite 87 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.590
 after all, he was still alive as the background told us 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.560
 guy and what did he really go 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.210
 the guard or how or maybe this us 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.810
 the movie will tell about push appeared 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.120

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.320

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.420

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.440
 killings before fnaf1 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.440

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.360
 getting children to the back room but all 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.210

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.910

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.820

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.280
