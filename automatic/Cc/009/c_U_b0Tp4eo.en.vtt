00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.309 
politicians are meant to be there for
the<00:02:16.080> people<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:17.220> know<00:02:17.340> serve<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.660> people<00:02:18.990> and

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
the people you know serve the people and

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.190 
the people you know serve the people and
I<00:02:19.650> think<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.100> if<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.940> really<00:02:21.270> made<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.690> scan

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
I think that if you really made a scan

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.860 
I think that if you really made a scan
of<00:02:22.230> their<00:02:22.560> brain<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.850> would<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.750> know

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
of their brain it would be like you know

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.450 
of their brain it would be like you know
50%<00:02:25.350> sex<00:02:26.780> 45%<00:02:27.780> power<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.500> don't<00:02:28.890> know<00:02:29.069> but<00:02:29.250> it

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
50% sex 45% power I don't know but it

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.990 
50% sex 45% power I don't know but it
would<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.760> like<00:02:29.790> Oh<00:02:30.240> point<00:02:30.720> zero<00:02:31.170> zero<00:02:31.530> zero

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
would be like Oh point zero zero zero

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.940 
would be like Oh point zero zero zero
something<00:02:33.530> caring<00:02:34.530> about<00:02:34.620> public

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
something caring about public

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.640 
something caring about public
yes<00:02:36.520> it's<00:02:37.240> really<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:38.170> would<00:02:38.319> be<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.470> very

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
yes it's really it would be a very

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.790 
yes it's really it would be a very
discouraging<00:02:39.400> scam
