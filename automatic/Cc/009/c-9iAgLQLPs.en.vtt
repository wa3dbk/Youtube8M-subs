00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.249 
with 1/2 PSI increments I've had the
guys<00:01:38.759> tell<00:01:39.119> me<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.420> right<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.749> the<00:01:39.869> snow<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
guys tell me that right in the snow and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.440 
guys tell me that right in the snow and
ice<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.590> Minnesota<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.429> fat<00:01:41.640> bikes<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
ice in Minnesota on the fat bikes that a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.239 
ice in Minnesota on the fat bikes that a
half<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.170> PSI<00:01:43.469> makes<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.069> tremendous
