00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
is amazing I'm bought it with my own

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.750 
is amazing I'm bought it with my own
protection<00:05:55.410> just<00:05:55.919> because<00:05:56.220> I<00:05:56.280> feel<00:05:56.310> like<00:05:56.580> you

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
protection just because I feel like you

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.820 
protection just because I feel like you
can<00:05:56.940> never<00:05:56.970> have<00:05:57.360> enough<00:05:57.600> protection<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:58.350> but

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
can never have enough protection and but

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.310 
can never have enough protection and but
I<00:05:58.860> do<00:05:58.950> use<00:05:59.610> both<00:06:00.030> of<00:06:00.180> these<00:06:00.300> together<00:06:00.540> so<00:06:01.290> I

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
I do use both of these together so I

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.020 
I do use both of these together so I
guess<00:06:01.440> I<00:06:01.919> don't<00:06:02.190> really<00:06:02.430> need<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.669> work

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
guess I don't really need that work

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.290 
guess I don't really need that work
still<00:06:03.360> and<00:06:03.570> I<00:06:04.440> like<00:06:04.890> it<00:06:05.100> says<00:06:05.490> and<00:06:08.030> says<00:06:09.030> to<00:06:09.180> put

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
still and I like it says and says to put

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.750 
still and I like it says and says to put
on<00:06:09.530> towel-dried<00:06:10.530> hair<00:06:10.530> or<00:06:11.280> dry<00:06:11.490> hair<00:06:11.580> or

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
on towel-dried hair or dry hair or

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.030 
on towel-dried hair or dry hair or
whatever<00:06:12.060> I<00:06:12.419> prefer<00:06:12.900> to<00:06:12.960> focus<00:06:13.110> on<00:06:13.350> dry<00:06:13.620> hair<00:06:13.650> I

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
whatever I prefer to focus on dry hair I

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.370 
whatever I prefer to focus on dry hair I
feel<00:06:14.400> that<00:06:14.430> after<00:06:14.669> you<00:06:15.150> dried<00:06:15.690> it<00:06:16.020> straight

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
feel that after you dried it straight

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.140 
feel that after you dried it straight
into<00:06:16.500> whether<00:06:16.770> put<00:06:17.070> this<00:06:17.190> on<00:06:17.400> and<00:06:17.580> it<00:06:17.940> just

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
into whether put this on and it just

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.020 
into whether put this on and it just
really<00:06:18.300> gives<00:06:18.570> it<00:06:18.630> that<00:06:18.690> extra<00:06:18.930> level<00:06:19.440> and

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
really gives it that extra level and

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.920 
really gives it that extra level and
obviously<00:06:21.030> if<00:06:21.180> you<00:06:21.270> straighten<00:06:21.539> with<00:06:21.720> really

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
obviously if you straighten with really

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.000 
obviously if you straighten with really
good<00:06:22.020> straighteners<00:06:22.380> they<00:06:22.500> will<00:06:22.680> get<00:06:22.770> rid<00:06:22.950> of

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
good straighteners they will get rid of

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.380 
good straighteners they will get rid of
the<00:06:23.130> majority<00:06:23.580> of<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.700> frizz<00:06:23.910> but<00:06:24.090> I<00:06:24.150> find

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
the majority of the frizz but I find

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.700 
the majority of the frizz but I find
that<00:06:24.510> this<00:06:24.630> just<00:06:24.900> gives<00:06:25.080> just

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
that this just gives just

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.190 
that this just gives just
take<00:06:25.860> this<00:06:26.790> takes<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.360> to<00:06:27.420> the<00:06:27.510> next<00:06:27.630> level<00:06:27.900> and

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
take this takes it to the next level and

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.350 
take this takes it to the next level and
look<00:06:28.800> up<00:06:28.890> it's<00:06:29.040> a<00:06:29.130> bit<00:06:29.280> I<00:06:29.490> do<00:06:29.760> find<00:06:30.150> that<00:06:30.210> it

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
look up it's a bit I do find that it

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.640 
look up it's a bit I do find that it
works<00:06:30.510> that<00:06:30.690> are<00:06:30.720> with<00:06:30.870> straight<00:06:31.140> hair<00:06:31.170> and

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
works that are with straight hair and

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.140 
works that are with straight hair and
like<00:06:32.430> if<00:06:32.580> you're<00:06:32.700> straightening<00:06:32.910> where<00:06:33.120> I

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
like if you're straightening where I

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.390 
like if you're straightening where I
find<00:06:33.480> that<00:06:33.600> you<00:06:33.690> comb<00:06:34.110> your<00:06:34.140> hair<00:06:34.410> it<00:06:35.100> doesn't

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
find that you comb your hair it doesn't

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.850 
find that you comb your hair it doesn't
really<00:06:35.460> have<00:06:35.670> much<00:06:35.700> of<00:06:35.940> an<00:06:36.180> effect<00:06:36.270> and<00:06:37.020> and<00:06:37.650> I

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
really have much of an effect and and I

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.040 
really have much of an effect and and I
think<00:06:37.890> it<00:06:38.160> kind<00:06:38.340> of<00:06:38.370> works<00:06:38.610> against<00:06:39.000> Kyle<00:06:39.240> so<00:06:40.020> I

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
think it kind of works against Kyle so I

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.720 
think it kind of works against Kyle so I
probably<00:06:40.770> use<00:06:41.100> this<00:06:41.220> more<00:06:41.490> or<00:06:41.610> less

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
probably use this more or less

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.130 
probably use this more or less
straighten<00:06:42.210> my<00:06:42.330> hair<00:06:42.510> because<00:06:42.630> I<00:06:42.720> feel<00:06:42.960> it

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140 
straighten my hair because I feel it

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.140 
straighten my hair because I feel it
works<00:06:43.410> better<00:06:43.650> and<00:06:44.250> but<00:06:44.520> absolutely<00:06:44.910> love<00:06:45.120> it

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
works better and but absolutely love it

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.210 
works better and but absolutely love it
for<00:06:45.390> that<00:06:45.420> I'm<00:06:46.290> together<00:06:46.680> at<00:06:46.800> the<00:06:46.920> end<00:06:46.950> of<00:06:47.100> the

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
video and it's not really intact as such
