00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
doing this with my hand because I can

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940

you'll<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.770> through<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.800> rid<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
you'll just go through and get rid of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.790 
you'll just go through and get rid of
all<00:00:50.340> those<00:00:50.520> birds<00:00:54.320> after<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> burrs<00:00:55.620> are

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.590 
all those birds after the burrs are
removed<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> make<00:00:56.640> sure<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.420> your

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
removed you want to make sure that your

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.510 
removed you want to make sure that your
surface<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.260> free<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:58.890> dust<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.430> debris

surface is free of all dust and debris

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.610 
surface is free of all dust and debris
because<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> will<00:01:00.300> build<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.960> make<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
because that will build up and make the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.310 
because that will build up and make the
stain<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> little<00:01:02.670> tacky<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.989> we're<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
stain a little tacky then we're going to

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.050

take our paint brush and go ahead and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.670 
take our paint brush and go ahead and
dip<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> stain<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> make

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
dip it in the stain you want to make

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.960 
dip it in the stain you want to make
sure<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.220> don't<00:01:08.340> submerge<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.939> entire

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
