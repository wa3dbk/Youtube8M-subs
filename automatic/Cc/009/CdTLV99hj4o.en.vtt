00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.940 
old design and everything you can see it
just<00:02:57.239> kind<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.540> barely<00:02:58.079> pushes<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.620> up<00:02:58.769> if<00:02:58.920> you

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
just kind of barely pushes it up if you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.580 
just kind of barely pushes it up if you
move<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.310> slow<00:02:59.630> sometimes<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.290> move<00:03:01.440> it

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
move it slow sometimes if you move it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
move it slow sometimes if you move it
fast<00:03:01.829> it'll<00:03:02.519> work<00:03:03.390> better<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.860> idea<00:03:05.250> is

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
fast it'll work better but the idea is

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.880 
fast it'll work better but the idea is
for<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.660> go<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:08.329> it<00:03:09.329> just<00:03:09.890> usually

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
for it to go like that it just usually

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.890 
for it to go like that it just usually
doesn't<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:14.000> both<00:03:15.000> sides<00:03:15.299> are<00:03:15.510> supposed<00:03:15.870> to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
doesn't and both sides are supposed to

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.930 
doesn't and both sides are supposed to
do<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.170> same<00:03:16.380> thing<00:03:19.489> I'll<00:03:20.489> show<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.080 

and<00:03:31.960> this<00:03:32.230> is<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.500> back<00:03:32.710> of<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.070> not<00:03:33.790> really

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
and this is the back of it not really

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.160 
and this is the back of it not really

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
even though the finished line design

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.210 
even though the finished line design
doesn't<00:03:48.490> really<00:03:48.820> work<00:03:49.630> all<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:49.990> well<00:03:50.220> it's
