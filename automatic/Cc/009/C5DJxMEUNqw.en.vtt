00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.069 
out there to win everyone's playing for
themselves<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.450> quite<00:01:51.689> rare<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.960> find

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
themselves which is quite rare to find

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.139 
themselves which is quite rare to find
to<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.439> honest<00:01:52.680> no<00:01:52.799> club<00:01:53.100> when<00:01:53.670> players<00:01:53.909> play

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
to be honest no club when players play

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.880 
to be honest no club when players play
for<00:01:54.360> each<00:01:54.420> other<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.409> play<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.770> himself

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
for each other and not play for himself

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.220 
for each other and not play for himself
so<00:01:56.340> definitely<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.540> really<00:01:58.020> well-run

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
so definitely it's really well-run

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.190 
so definitely it's really well-run
is<00:01:59.680> it<00:02:00.070> difficult<00:02:00.310> though<00:02:00.820> coming<00:02:01.150> into<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.630> new

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
is it difficult though coming into a new

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.310 
is it difficult though coming into a new
team<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.880> yourself<00:02:04.270> midway<00:02:04.990> through<00:02:05.020> a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
team for yourself midway through a

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.780 
team for yourself midway through a
season<00:02:05.940> yeah<00:02:06.940> I<00:02:06.970> mean<00:02:07.390> for<00:02:07.870> any<00:02:07.990> player<00:02:08.230> it<00:02:08.440> is

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320
