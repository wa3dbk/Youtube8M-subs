00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.500
 area ceasefire agreement on

 east of Ukraine violate the separatists 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.609
 so and the Ukrainian security forces 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.150
 such is the price of the Minsk agreement in such 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.180
 conditions 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.420

 do not violate this agreement 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.939
 they are allowed to open fire only for 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.890
 self defense 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.960
 but they did it exclusively in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.120
 cases when Russian forces led 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.180
 lengthy shelling including shelling 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.500
 civilians and when i put in the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.270
 hands free lance 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.590
 this is leaking and volunteers 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.969
 could you clarify which 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.809
 volunteers you keep in mind 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.670
 in the east of Ukraine are fighting and volunteers 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.160
 not he gives console but not on Ukrainian 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.260
 there is only a regular army side 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.350
 regular military units and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.969
 national guard 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.159
 what are you doing now to 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.659
 soften the situation make peace in your 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.580
 the country has achieved since it was obtained 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.799
 It is not only about Ukraine This is a global 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 the challenge and the threat of the whole of Europe than above 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.700
 security level in Ukraine is higher 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 he is in the whole of Europe 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.049
 after all what happens we are all faced with 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.479
 the danger of terrorism even many of those 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.670
 who is fighting against the forces of atoms in Donetsk and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.130
 Lugansk have been trained in different 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.290
 parts of the world in Chechnya for example it 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 extremely dangerous what can we do 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 what do we do i go back to 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.619
 Minsk Agreement 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.259
 this is the only solution on which 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.170
 There are fingerprints of Russia therefore 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.250
 we call on the Russian Federation 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.189
 implement this agreement 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.590
 if they start doing it we can 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.500
 pave the way for a real de escalation and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.340
 the real world because the world is what you need 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.409
 Ukraine and the whole of Europe diz 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.310
 contemplate will display and will this 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.950
 space 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.490
 up to hundreds of battles and Ukraine available view 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.070
 fuer 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.110
 during a visit to berlin to interview 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.429
 German TV you said this 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.170
 I quote a phrase 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.180
 Russian military aggression against 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.829
 Ukraine is an encroachment on the world 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.379
 order is encroachment on 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.329
 European security we are all good with 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.519
 You remember the Soviet invasion as in 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.799
 Ukraine so including in Germany 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.780
 do you need to understand this so that you already 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:29.280
 compare the situation in your country with 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:34.079
 world war two here you are in mb 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.239
 socket a happy gf3 dc ken we bolvar 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.120
 remember the Soviet occupation of Ukraine 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.669
 Poland Hungary Hungary Czechoslovakia 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.549
 Germany and the Baltic countries which had 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:47.269
 place after the second world war she 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.040
 lasted long enough today 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.659
 Russia decided to occupy the Crimea 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.819
 occupy the east of Ukraine the pain of their own 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.219
 your decided to occupy it is not acceptable 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.280
 it is a violation of international law 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:04.349
 that's what i wanted to say russia nobody 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.659
 gave the right to violate international 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.639
 Nobody gave the laws of Russia 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.889
 seize territory another 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.479
 an independent country like it did 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.260
 Soviet Union after World War II 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:17.419
 of war 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.010
 like conscience bit of odessa kenworth 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.109
 let's talk about economic 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.459
 challenges what are you doing to get 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.790
 money needed to overcome 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.769
 crisis i mean reform we hear 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.659
 many words of such a program 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.609
 December government program 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.220
 but what are you doing in practice to 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.629
 embody these reforms in the life of corruption 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.180
 still rolls over 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.340
 real change we don't see you 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.319
 trying to convince the European Union that 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.329
 did enough to get these 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.479
 money take india fe new is not observed 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.189
 in shaking from mana you are on the walls in fbi 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.799
 because we already had a number of very 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.840
 painful reforms I would start with a package 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.329
 austerity measures government froze 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.030
 expenses fired 10 percent 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.849
 government officials and government employees 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.199
 imposed new taxes on industrial and 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.019
 financial magnates 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:09.109
 it is extremely important because it is a question 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.519
 equity in taxation 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.479
 state eliminated corruption in 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.239
 gas sector 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.219
 giving up mediators giving up 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.650
 from company services doubtful 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:21.430
 reputation now the deal is 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.070
 directly between the Ukrainian state 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.639
 Companies and German companies and Ukraine 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.210
 Company Institute and how you are struggling with 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.000
 corruption juice and ganga yandex.ua 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.669
 and found and typing attacks of the bicycle 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.889
 I repeat we set a number of goals 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.210
 which should be dealt with especially in 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.729
 energy sector 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.270
 there are first successes on macroeconomic 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.789
 level 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.100
 but on the micro levels there is still 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.289
 work and work we took 5 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.360
 extremely tough laws against 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.389
 corruption including the creation 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.490
 the anti-corruption bureau the president should 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.039
 assign it a new chapter 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.690
 now senior government officials 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.669
 and the deputies will have to live under 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.880
 direct control of voters 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.979
 they are required to publish on the Internet 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.020
 declarations of their income and expenses so 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.419
 that part of the anti-corruption measures is already 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.620
 does it all work 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:21.400
 takes time but work continues 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:25.150
 number of antique slave singers of ben and 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.940
 i'll be an kids and textile tops food 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.010
 inbis your ukrainian citizens 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.830
 voters say that money is in the country 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.570
 many but they are concentrated in say hand 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.500
 so 4 or 5 people 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.500
 people need to deal with this before 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.650
 of the explosion and you crawled to them that's why we 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.599
 introduced new taxes for the super rich they 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.270
 from this not happy the problem is 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.099
 that many of them have significant hands 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.620
 media resources they can control 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:55.780
 information in this country therefore 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.169
 the government is under constant 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.270
 pressure when we started fighting so 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.250
 called conversion and 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.919
 structures that helped super 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.860
 rich tax evasion just 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.150
 it was better not to turn on the TV 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.220
 TV stations under their control right there 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.610
 hit the government with acute 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:20.620
 criticism but we chose the right path to you 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:25.870
 poses he promised us fast tycoon 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.870
 these companies bat thousand driveway 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.280
 Sochi in Ukraine is a new 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.670
 antimonopoly committee 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.500
 one of his tasks is checking the results 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.960
 privatization over the past 20 years but 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.150
 information is not his work is not it easier 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.760
 openly say we intend to start 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:50.180
 privatization revision over the last two 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:51.080
 decades in the ravine rug consider all 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.200
 i'll needles 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.450
 we are ready to reconsider all illegal 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.840
 deals but always take into account that many 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.390
 want to 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.280
 redistribution of property so it was in 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.410
 Ukrainian history 10 years ago so 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.480
 I intend to act strictly within 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:07.910
 the law that is, together with the prosecutor's office 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:12.200
 with independent courts that are still 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:14.210
 to create you guess just 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.310
 curls office like a man and create and 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.110
 papas rides users of his and independent 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.690
 george is only that that way of the build 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.400
 this is another problem of our country we 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.560
 together with the president we want to create 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.780
 independent judiciary which 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.900
 will be governed by laws only 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.820
 they phone right we want and already 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.610
 investigating all illegal activities 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.890
 for example the government arrested 1 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.630
 billion 300 million dollars which 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.230
 were on the accounts of the former president 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.480
 Yanukovych and his closest associates

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.410
