show<00:00:00.989> you<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.079> little<00:00:01.170> bit<00:00:01.319> today<00:00:01.410> about<00:00:01.500> how<00:00:01.740> do

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
show you a little bit today about how do

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.579 
show you a little bit today about how do
we<00:00:02.280> size<00:00:02.520> players<00:00:03.030> up<00:00:03.300> for<00:00:03.449> baseball<00:00:03.780> bats<00:00:04.049> and

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
we size players up for baseball bats and

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.260 
we size players up for baseball bats and
it'll<00:00:05.130> more<00:00:05.370> about<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.580> technology<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.089> bats

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
it'll more about the technology of bats

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.820 
it'll more about the technology of bats
there's<00:00:06.450> so<00:00:06.629> many<00:00:06.779> bats<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.319> market<00:00:07.710> right

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
there's so many bats on the market right

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.270 
there's so many bats on the market right
now

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
now

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.860 
now
it's<00:00:08.639> hard<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.849> know<00:00:09.000> which<00:00:09.179> way<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.420> go<00:00:09.540> what's

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
it's hard to know which way to go what's

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.089 
it's hard to know which way to go what's
the<00:00:09.960> right<00:00:10.110> one<00:00:10.260> for<00:00:10.290> your<00:00:10.530> player<00:00:10.740> which<00:00:10.980> is

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
the right one for your player which is

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.890 
the right one for your player which is
the<00:00:11.219> wrong<00:00:11.400> one<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:11.639> your<00:00:11.910> player<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.780> we're

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
the wrong one for your player so we're

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.820 
the wrong one for your player so we're
going<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> go<00:00:13.139> through<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> little<00:00:13.530> bit<00:00:13.710> today

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
going to go through a little bit today

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.400 
going to go through a little bit today
here<00:00:14.269> discuss<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.450> technology<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.230> couple

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
here discuss the technology in a couple

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
it's not just a matter of what color

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.499 
it's not just a matter of what color
they<00:05:52.470> like<00:05:52.699> it's<00:05:53.699> it's<00:05:53.849> how<00:05:53.940> much<00:05:54.150> strength

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
they like it's it's how much strength

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.990 
they like it's it's how much strength
they<00:05:54.629> have<00:05:54.660> we<00:05:55.080> have<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.470> test<00:05:55.889> with<00:05:56.099> bats<00:05:56.370> where

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
they have we have a test with bats where

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.059 
they have we have a test with bats where
we<00:05:57.090> test<00:05:57.360> their<00:05:57.539> strength<00:05:57.810> and<00:05:58.289> one<00:05:58.919> of<00:05:59.009> the

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
we test their strength and one of the

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.879 
we test their strength and one of the
rules<00:05:59.250> of<00:05:59.370> thumb<00:05:59.430> is<00:05:59.789> if<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.210> player<00:06:00.560> can<00:06:01.560> hold<00:06:01.800> a

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
rules of thumb is if a player can hold a

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.779 
rules of thumb is if a player can hold a
bat<00:06:02.240> out<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.509> the<00:06:03.629> side<00:06:04.610> parallel<00:06:05.610> to<00:06:05.699> the

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
bat out to the side parallel to the

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.180 
bat out to the side parallel to the
ground<00:06:05.909> for<00:06:06.180> 30<00:06:06.360> seconds<00:06:06.919> then<00:06:07.919> that's

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
ground for 30 seconds then that's

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.589 
ground for 30 seconds then that's
probably<00:06:08.400> about<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:08.819> right<00:06:08.849> weight<00:06:09.210> if<00:06:09.449> they

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
probably about the right weight if they

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.809 
probably about the right weight if they
get<00:06:09.810> any<00:06:09.960> kind<00:06:10.169> of<00:06:10.229> handshake<00:06:10.530> or<00:06:11.280> a<00:06:11.340> barrel

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
get any kind of handshake or a barrel

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.089 
get any kind of handshake or a barrel
droop<00:06:12.090> then<00:06:12.870> it's<00:06:13.020> probably<00:06:13.379> too<00:06:13.650> heavy<00:06:13.860> of<00:06:13.949> a

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
droop then it's probably too heavy of a

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.309 
droop then it's probably too heavy of a
bat<00:06:14.310> so<00:06:14.909> that's<00:06:15.060> one<00:06:15.419> of<00:06:15.479> the<00:06:15.569> first<00:06:15.720> tests<00:06:16.050> we

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
bat so that's one of the first tests we

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.589 
bat so that's one of the first tests we
have<00:06:16.500> for<00:06:16.770> the<00:06:16.830> kids<00:06:16.979> on<00:06:17.220> bats<00:06:17.520> and<00:06:18.060> from<00:06:18.389> there

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
have for the kids on bats and from there

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.719 
have for the kids on bats and from there
we<00:06:19.289> go<00:06:19.440> and<00:06:19.770> take<00:06:19.830> them<00:06:19.979> into<00:06:20.069> the<00:06:20.220> cage<00:06:20.400> and<00:06:20.669> we

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
we go and take them into the cage and we

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.730 
we go and take them into the cage and we
actually<00:06:20.880> have<00:06:21.120> them<00:06:21.210> hit<00:06:21.509> falls<00:06:22.289> off<00:06:22.560> the

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
actually have them hit falls off the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.589 
actually have them hit falls off the
team<00:06:22.919> and<00:06:23.490> we're<00:06:23.639> checking<00:06:23.819> their<00:06:24.120> bat<00:06:24.300> speed

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
team and we're checking their bat speed

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.110 
team and we're checking their bat speed
seeing<00:06:25.440> how<00:06:25.560> fast<00:06:25.770> they<00:06:26.009> are<00:06:26.130> if<00:06:26.220> they<00:06:26.340> respond

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
seeing how fast they are if they respond

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.360 
seeing how fast they are if they respond
to<00:06:27.210> it<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:28.349> worst<00:06:28.560> thing<00:06:28.770> you<00:06:28.860> can<00:06:28.949> do<00:06:29.069> is<00:06:29.220> get

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
to it the worst thing you can do is get

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.309 
to it the worst thing you can do is get
too<00:06:29.639> big<00:06:29.819> of<00:06:29.940> a<00:06:30.000> bat<00:06:30.180> into<00:06:30.449> your<00:06:30.630> kids<00:06:30.810> hands

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 
too big of a bat into your kids hands

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.300 
too big of a bat into your kids hands
that<00:06:31.889> will<00:06:32.039> cause<00:06:32.490> bad<00:06:33.620> mechanics<00:06:34.620> bad

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
that will cause bad mechanics bad

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.089 
that will cause bad mechanics bad
foundation<00:06:35.550> form<00:06:36.180> I<00:06:36.960> see<00:06:37.349> that<00:06:37.500> a<00:06:37.530> lot<00:06:37.590> with

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
foundation form I see that a lot with

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909 
lot more time to get those little bugs
