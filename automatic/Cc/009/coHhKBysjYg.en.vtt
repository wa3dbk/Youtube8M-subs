00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
around in circles trying to figure out

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.710 
around in circles trying to figure out
where<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.260> go<00:00:19.760> in<00:00:20.760> my<00:00:20.970> original<00:00:21.210> file<00:00:21.689> i

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
where to go in my original file i

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.759 
where to go in my original file i
actually<00:00:22.260> did<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.100> without<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.420> map<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.470> flash

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
actually did this without a map or flash

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.429 
actually did this without a map or flash
or<00:00:26.160> anything<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.939> i<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.779> kind<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.990> ran<00:00:28.230> around

or anything so i just kind of ran around

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.019 
or anything so i just kind of ran around
and<00:00:28.769> slide<00:00:29.039> shuts<00:00:29.279> figure<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.760> what<00:00:29.939> was

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and slide shuts figure out what was

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.130 
and slide shuts figure out what was
going<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.640> also<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.030> cave<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.600> believe

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
special so he is basically very

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.270 
special so he is basically very
formulaic<00:00:57.920> dungeon<00:00:58.920> has<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:02.100> can

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
formulaic dungeon has to go up you can

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.280 
formulaic dungeon has to go up you can
go<00:01:02.430> left<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:04.010> and<00:01:05.510> yeah<00:01:06.510> basically<00:01:06.750> just

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
go left to right and yeah basically just

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
go left to right and yeah basically just
head<00:01:07.560> over<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.010> over<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.369> over<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.700> over<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
head over and over and over and over and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.149 
head over and over and over and over and
over<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.600> throws<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> couple<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> rocks

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
over and throws in a couple of rocks

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.780 
over and throws in a couple of rocks
master<00:01:11.670> ox<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:12.030> two<00:01:13.130> there<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.369> couple<00:01:14.610> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
master ox or two there are a couple of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.679 
master ox or two there are a couple of
double<00:01:15.119> battle<00:01:15.479> things<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.030> but<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
double battle things in this but I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.600 
double battle things in this but I
believe<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.500> make<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.460> into

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
believe you can make them all into

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.149 
believe you can make them all into
single<00:01:21.000> battles<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.540> talk<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.930> them<00:01:22.159> but

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
single battles if you talk to them but

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.190 
single battles if you talk to them but
it's<00:01:23.430> useful<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.299> after<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.689> trainer's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
it's useful to go after the trainer's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's useful to go after the trainer's
after<00:01:25.650> you've<00:01:25.770> met<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.119> girl

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
after you've met up with the little girl

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
after you've met up with the little girl
in<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.840> because<00:01:28.290> she'll<00:01:28.740> heal<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
in the back because she'll heal you

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.170 
in the back because she'll heal you
completely<00:01:30.119> after<00:01:31.079> each<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> battles<00:01:32.180> so

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
completely after each of the battles so

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.200 
completely after each of the battles so
I<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.290> could<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.710> already<00:01:34.860> gone<00:01:35.340> for

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
I think I could have already gone for

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.590 
I think I could have already gone for
one<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> trainer<00:01:37.590> battles<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.600> didn't

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
one of the trainer battles but I didn't

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.969 
one of the trainer battles but I didn't
wanna<00:01:41.329> yeah<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.659> basically<00:01:42.990> did<00:01:43.259> generic

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
wanna yeah this is basically did generic

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.450 
wanna yeah this is basically did generic

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
course sigh there's probably Geodude I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.340 
course sigh there's probably Geodude I
don't<00:01:53.610> clearly<00:01:54.090> recall<00:01:54.540> nor<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.079> wish<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.759> I

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
don't clearly recall nor do I wish to I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.490 
don't clearly recall nor do I wish to I
probably<00:01:58.350> won't<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.860> doing<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.869> gibble<00:02:00.869> area

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
probably won't be doing the gibble area

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.010 
probably won't be doing the gibble area
of<00:02:01.740> wayward<00:02:02.130> cave<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.610> any<00:02:02.759> point<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.270> don't

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
of wayward cave at any point I don't

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.569 
of wayward cave at any point I don't
think<00:02:04.229> there<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.380> any<00:02:04.439> trainers<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.310> so

think there are any trainers in there so

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.530 
think there are any trainers in there so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
it'd be useless for me to go in

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.410 
it'd be useless for me to go in
and<00:02:09.690> yeah<00:02:10.690> more<00:02:11.080> wild<00:02:11.530> bells<00:02:12.090> if<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.240> head<00:02:13.390> down
