00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Red Bull Local Hero is a stimulus for me to develop and perform tricks better than yesterday. 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.300
We didn't have parks beforehand and I was using each opportunity to learn new tricks and jump higher than before.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Today I am prepared to do another trick if one is not successful and not worrying about repeating.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:38.000
I was performing only at 70% of my best because I was a bit nervous. I also have really strong riders in my quarter and I knew that I had to perform better. 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.100
The feeling you get when you're in the final is very exciting and you have no room for mistakes.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:02:04.000
He did very stable and basic things. Skateboarding contests are very technically difficult, and you can't fall. You need to create more tricks and stable ones at that. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I was voting for Maxim because he impressed me. I can see the progress he's made every year and he really deserves first place.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:55.000
Red Bull Local Hero is very important to me. You wait for a year and you really need to fight for first place. Contests give you new experiences and new crazy things to learn. 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:11.500
He did tricks which are not common for Kazakhstani riders. He used the fanbox and took first place.
