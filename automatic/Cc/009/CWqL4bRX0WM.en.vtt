00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.980 

I<00:00:11.280> think<00:00:12.280> the<00:00:12.639> UK's<00:00:12.969> is<00:00:13.480> different<00:00:13.930> from

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
I think the UK's is different from

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.190 
I think the UK's is different from
whether<00:00:14.379> it's<00:00:14.559> music<00:00:14.820> fashion<00:00:15.820> our<00:00:16.200> film

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
whether it's music fashion our film

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.290 
whether it's music fashion our film
whatever<00:00:17.800> it<00:00:18.040> is<00:00:18.160> and<00:00:18.460> I<00:00:18.490> think<00:00:18.730> part<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.180> the

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
whatever it is and I think part of the

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.490 
whatever it is and I think part of the
reason<00:00:19.330> is<00:00:19.720> because<00:00:19.750> we've<00:00:20.170> got<00:00:20.320> such

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
reason is because we've got such

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.540 
reason is because we've got such
brilliant<00:00:20.890> youth<00:00:21.070> culture<00:00:21.580> here<00:00:21.820> that<00:00:23.550> relies

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
brilliant youth culture here that relies

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.090 
brilliant youth culture here that relies
upon<00:00:24.910> culture<00:00:25.779> I<00:00:26.020> mean<00:00:26.260> whether<00:00:26.590> it's<00:00:26.680> street

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
upon culture I mean whether it's street

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.599 
upon culture I mean whether it's street
fashion<00:00:27.460> whether<00:00:28.300> it's<00:00:28.510> indie<00:00:28.900> music<00:00:29.140> I<00:00:29.800> think

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
fashion whether it's indie music I think

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.670 
fashion whether it's indie music I think
if<00:00:30.880> I<00:00:31.090> think<00:00:31.330> it's<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.689> youth<00:00:31.900> that<00:00:32.320> really

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
if I think it's the youth that really

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.590 
if I think it's the youth that really
push<00:00:33.100> things<00:00:33.309> and<00:00:33.670> push<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.120> beginning<00:00:34.480> of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
push things and push the beginning of

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.270 
push things and push the beginning of
culture<00:00:35.050> in<00:00:35.170> this<00:00:35.290> country<00:00:35.350> and<00:00:35.860> always<00:00:35.980> have

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
culture in this country and always have

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.340 
culture in this country and always have
done<00:00:36.489> I<00:00:36.699> think<00:00:36.970> that<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.210> general<00:00:37.390> public<00:00:38.110> is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
done I think that the general public is

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.770 
done I think that the general public is
much<00:00:38.650> more<00:00:38.710> aware<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.309> how<00:00:40.180> important<00:00:40.690> the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
much more aware of how important the

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.740 
much more aware of how important the
creative<00:00:41.200> industries<00:00:41.770> are<00:00:41.950> here<00:00:42.750> from

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
creative industries are here from

that's<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.530> whole<00:02:11.650> completely<00:02:12.220> regenerated

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
that's a whole completely regenerated

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.210 
that's a whole completely regenerated
area<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.350> always<00:02:14.500> always<00:02:14.860> say

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
area and and you always always say

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.460

wherever artists go regeneration follows

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.800 
wherever artists go regeneration follows
and<00:02:17.709> commerce<00:02:18.129> follows<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.879> I<00:02:19.209> think<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.660> if

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
and commerce follows and I think that if

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.730 
and commerce follows and I think that if
I<00:02:20.050> was<00:02:20.920> someone

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740

where the artists were and I'd follow

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.440 
where the artists were and I'd follow
them<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:37.490> arts<00:02:37.790> shouldn't<00:02:38.090> be<00:02:38.210> for<00:02:38.390> the
