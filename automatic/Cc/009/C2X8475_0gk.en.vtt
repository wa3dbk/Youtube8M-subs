00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
two weeks is a really long time to wait

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.460 
two weeks is a really long time to wait
to<00:02:39.130> go<00:02:39.220> up<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.430> size<00:02:39.459> but<00:02:40.030> some<00:02:40.959> people<00:02:41.230> do<00:02:41.349> it

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
to go up a size but some people do it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.590 
to go up a size but some people do it
longer<00:02:41.709> some<00:02:42.250> people<00:02:42.550> stretch<00:02:43.060> every<00:02:43.420> few

longer some people stretch every few

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.699 
longer some people stretch every few
months<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.500> two<00:02:45.220> weeks<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.700> minimum<00:02:46.030> and

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709

then if you're trying to go up to a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.699 
then if you're trying to go up to a
really<00:02:57.970> big<00:02:58.150> size<00:02:58.420> which<00:02:58.750> I'm<00:02:58.930> not<00:02:59.110> but<00:02:59.170> if<00:02:59.530> you

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
would just look awful it would probably

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.380 
would just look awful it would probably
rip<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.480> get<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> blowout<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:07.000> anything

in<00:03:51.730> both<00:03:51.940> holes<00:03:52.290> hopefully<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.440> two<00:03:53.590> weeks<00:03:53.769> I

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
in both holes hopefully in two weeks I

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.680 
in both holes hopefully in two weeks I
will<00:03:53.950> be<00:03:54.069> going<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.549> a<00:03:54.579> zero<00:03:54.940> that's<00:03:55.209> my<00:03:55.420> goal

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.349 
will be going to a zero that's my goal
size<00:03:55.989> so<00:03:56.560> this<00:03:57.489> might<00:03:57.730> be<00:03:57.940> one<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.239> last

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
size so this might be one of the last

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.240 
size so this might be one of the last
