00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 Hello everybody and I know that everything can be 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.480
 of you don't know this new games except 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.750
 came out so the first movie sims 4 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.850
 gameplay I decided that many of you can 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.560
 be not watching video game news and can 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.560
 don't be understood in English and so 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.640
 I decided to make a movie for the fourth 700 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.920
 so this is how you cass tonic 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.040
 people in sims 4 that are no longer thin 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.120
 no option sliders you just can 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.820
 how to make your own heroes from plasticine 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.120
 so that you can grab your ass 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.559
 pulling back and pulling his legs from behind 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.600
 it turns out much more 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.969
 your personalized sims ii and you 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.920
 can you do any you want 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.070
 and look even in small 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.059
 details then we can sculpt the nose any you 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.670
 you want as well as you can 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.150
 sculpt your whole face here lips customize 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.659
 behind the eyes and basically these 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.680
 little details never sliders 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.810
 offered yes and here it is very 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.450
 cool I think the function and you too 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.409
 you can choose how your sims move 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.810
 means and choose their own voice so in 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.560
 principle customization in the fourth sims 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.020
 They will do well, and super-duper 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.869
 also the structure of houses will be much 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.210
 much easier and more likely 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.220
 more interesting so you can just 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.829
 insert here one of your room and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.530
 pull any shape you want 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.740
 and then add rooms again choose 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.140
 shape and I do not know of course for me it 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.290
 a little bit 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.500
 too easy but see you can 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.570
 move even rooms with all the furniture 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.460
 what I think is cool so the principle is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.200
 you no longer have walls in your room 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.960
 and customization is much, much more 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.860
 easier so what can you do 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.620
 I don't know my house is much easier and 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.470
 see what a beautiful house in such a living 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.640
 any sim right let's also 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.640
 look into the gameplay itself see three 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.930
 players sofya ali &amp; andre 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.780
 so we 'll show you how they are with each other 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.300
 friend communicates but because 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.690
 new family does not add emotion 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.450
 see means sophia and ali communicate each 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.620
 with a friend and they bears unhappy because 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.780
 that in the hall he is confident and that means 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.180
 that you will be a big plus sign and that means 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.690
 the attitude is better off as he 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.720
 confident and it gives a new meaning 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.930
 here's a function as you see here 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.569
 two more hearts communicate with each of them 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.870
 it means there is a emotion which 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.680
 of course decide the fate of your Sims as 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.590
 You see here Andrea is bored and since 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.070
 he wants to win too 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:17.170
 mean love sophia and he decided to play 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:20.530
 music but music is very very sad 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:25.680
 as you can see this sad music affects 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:30.400
 other sims and ali became sad and 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.900
 so he went home to his room again 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.650
 lest he do anything stupid and andre 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.350
 now he feels fine and 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.510
 Sophia means the best relationship because 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:49.060
 they are both in a good mood or well 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.579
 thinks he needs to do something in 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.360
 cheer yourself up because he 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:57.200
 will make 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:03.150
 he will play with i will doll 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:07.470
 yes so that he struck 1 and Andrei means 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.590
 began to shut up the dumb things he became angry 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.300
 as you can see and sophia don't want anything 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.630
 communicate with him as you can see these emotions 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.160
 affect the attitude of the sims well and now 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.980
 Andrew went to beat a pear and it is a hole 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.760
 dance new emotions mean a little bit 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.680
 less he is big just evil 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.010
 and this is how you see it all 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.750
 dynamics who were yours on stage 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.200
 is your communication with others 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:42.660
 hearts meanwhile he sophia iole 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:46.710
 communicate means and de cecco if he 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:50.250
 flirts and sophia also responds well and 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.310
 here it is not their relationship here too 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:58.820
 affects furniture how to see there girl on 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:04.860
 rocket and here's this picture on gives them this 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:08.340
 virtual atmosphere and so ali 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:13.350
 suggested sofia take a ride on his 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:16.250
 rocket and what you see that or very 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:20.660
 Satisfied because Sofia agreed 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.660
 go see his rocket 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:32.219
 and as you will see there is 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:36.129
 say goodbye to all fourth there is a rocket and 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:38.679
 as you can see their relationship is awesome 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:43.719
 turned out because Sophie and liked 

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:47.139
 rocket ali so here it is a little bit 704 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:51.669
 I certainly hope that this is not all that 74 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:55.149
 offers but I hope it will 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:58.080
 so much more so now i want 

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:58.080
 just say 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:05.199
 your thoughts about sims 4 on this video 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:09.490
 Of course I know that this is only 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.240
 start just a little bit of what they are 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.619
 offer 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.779
 but I immediately have a couple of questions 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:20.819
 that interest me so first 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:25.029
 stage real graphics seriously 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:28.499
 it looks like they didn't apologize much like 3 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:33.490
 sims boom is the same in principle and 

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:36.789
 that's it of course with this i'm afraid of course i 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:40.259
 I hope that maybe they will improve 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:45.069
 schedule because i don't see much 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:48.519
 mean big change well I hope 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:52.179
 that this will change and second I hope that 

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:55.449
 it is a spirit more than just emotions 

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:57.189
 just of course this emotion is cool 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.079
 the thing that they add because now 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:02.649
 it's not like you just talk 

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:05.019
 Sima method add a plus sign is 

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:07.269
 talking on the right topic now 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:09.490
 you have emotions and does not affect not 

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:12.550
 only you to have a good relationship 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.129
 make it necessary that your simpson did 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.330
 right things we now have to be in 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:18.789
 right 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.250
 in the right emotions what happened 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.069
 something there or you were friends or you 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.199
 were lovers or there family and this 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.849
 cool i hope they add 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:30.400
 much, much more of course now 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:32.979
 of course thats just one video and that's how 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.090
 not the whole game so i hope that 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:40.449
 will be much more but if that's them 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:43.349
 Ace itself means a big card that they have 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:48.159
 there is a new 7 10 slightly distinguish 

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:51.789
