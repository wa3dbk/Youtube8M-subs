00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
quick now basically the reason for

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.890 
quick now basically the reason for
people<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.640> source<00:02:21.970> off<00:02:22.180> their<00:02:22.360> sneakers<00:02:22.600> is

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
people to source off their sneakers is

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.290 
people to source off their sneakers is
because<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.470> old<00:02:23.680> midsole<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.430> them<00:02:24.700> starts

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
because the old midsole on them starts

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.930 
because the old midsole on them starts
to<00:02:25.360> deteriorate<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.350> crumble<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.700> you

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
to deteriorate and crumble and it you

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.280 
to deteriorate and crumble and it you
know<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.060> can't<00:02:28.360> wear<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.630> shoes<00:02:28.840> anymore

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
know you can't wear the shoes anymore

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.150 
know you can't wear the shoes anymore
because<00:02:29.440> they're<00:02:29.710> just<00:02:29.770> going<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.980> keep

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
because they're just going to keep

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.700
