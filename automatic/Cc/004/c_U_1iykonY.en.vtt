00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
rifle and what is quite possibly the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.339

think<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.240> weapon<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.870> MSBs<00:00:16.590> because

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
think this weapon is the MSBs because

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.099 
think this weapon is the MSBs because
this<00:00:17.250> weapon<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.760> overpowered<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.750> terms<00:00:18.960> of

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
this weapon is overpowered in terms of

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.019 
this weapon is overpowered in terms of
getting<00:00:19.350> killed<00:00:19.619> by<00:00:19.890> but<00:00:20.670> when<00:00:20.910> you're

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
getting killed by but when you're

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.580 
getting killed by but when you're
actually<00:00:21.180> using<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.810> weapon<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.380> burst

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
actually using the weapon the burst

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.349 
actually using the weapon the burst
delay<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.220> long<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:23.880> hard<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> be

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
delay is so long that it's hard to be

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.720 
delay is so long that it's hard to be
entirely<00:00:24.750> successful<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.740> nope<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.550> gun

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
entirely successful with nope this gun

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.980 
entirely successful with nope this gun
is<00:00:26.849> not<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.269> MSBs

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
is not the MSBs

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.589 
is not the MSBs
it<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.320> actually<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> ak-12<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.179> gun<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
it is actually the ak-12 and this gun is

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.240 
it is actually the ak-12 and this gun is
an<00:00:30.750> absolute<00:00:31.500> monster

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
slower than most assault rifles now the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.550 
slower than most assault rifles now the
ak-12<00:01:28.740> fires<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.610> around<00:01:30.080> 690<00:01:31.080> rounds<00:01:31.410> per

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
minute and this is rather slow but that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.240 
minute and this is rather slow but that
is<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> glorious<00:01:34.410> thing<00:01:34.650> about<00:01:34.830> this<00:01:35.010> weapon

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
is the glorious thing about this weapon

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
it works so unbelievably well this

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.010 
it works so unbelievably well this
weapons<00:01:38.460> 3<00:01:38.670> shot<00:01:38.880> kill<00:01:38.910> range<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.570> longer<00:01:39.869> than

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
weapons 3 shot kill range is longer than

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.330 
weapons 3 shot kill range is longer than
most<00:01:40.110> weapons<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> we'll<00:01:40.830> cover<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.160> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
most weapons and we'll cover that in a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.219 
most weapons and we'll cover that in a
second<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.270> means<00:01:42.540> even<00:01:42.990> with<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
second but this means even with the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.780 
second but this means even with the
slower<00:01:43.440> fire<00:01:43.740> rate<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.220> weapon<00:01:44.520> kills

slower fire rate this weapon kills

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.609 
slower fire rate this weapon kills
faster<00:01:45.270> than<00:01:45.420> most<00:01:45.600> weapons<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> longer

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619

faster than most weapons at a longer
range<00:01:46.830> also<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> realize<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.119> 690

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
range also you have to realize that 690

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.630 
range also you have to realize that 690
isn't<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.350> far<00:01:49.650> below<00:01:49.830> average<00:01:50.160> and<00:01:50.550> if

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
isn't that far below average and if

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.830 
isn't that far below average and if
you're<00:01:50.760> prepared<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.150> gunfights<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.750> will

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you're prepared for gunfights you will

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.990 
you're prepared for gunfights you will
have<00:01:51.960> no<00:01:52.200> problem<00:01:52.650> competing<00:01:53.100> at<00:01:53.220> close<00:01:53.430> range

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000

it's<00:02:35.670> benefited<00:02:36.239> more<00:02:36.360> than<00:02:36.570> most<00:02:36.720> weapons

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
it's benefited more than most weapons

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.710 
it's benefited more than most weapons

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.879 
anything like the mw3 ACR but you'll
have<00:03:06.330> no<00:03:06.630> trouble<00:03:06.690> picking<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.410> enemies<00:03:07.739> from
