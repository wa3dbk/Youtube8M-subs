OK and then ok again now when we reboot
the<00:01:59.909> system<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.899> now

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the system which I'm going to do now

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.469 
the system which I'm going to do now
you'll<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.490> will<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.790> log<00:02:02.969> straight<00:02:03.270> in

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you'll see it will just log straight in

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.600 
you'll see it will just log straight in
but<00:02:03.689> our<00:02:03.750> password<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.500> still<00:02:04.799> intact<00:02:05.310> which

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
but our password is still intact which

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.370 
but our password is still intact which
means<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.210> still<00:02:06.299> protected<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.229> this

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
means it's still protected so this

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:17.860 
means it's still protected so this
restart<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.739> let<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.039> log<00:02:11.250> on

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.130 

and<00:02:18.080> there<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.800> have<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:18.980> straight<00:02:19.400> back<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:21.110> a

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
and there we have it straight back to a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.350 
and there we have it straight back to a
metro<00:02:21.650> user<00:02:21.920> interface<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:22.910> back<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.269> the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
metro user interface and in back to the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.570 
metro user interface and in back to the
desktop<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:23.989> that's<00:02:24.379> how<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.590> basically<00:02:24.920> sell

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
desktop so that's how you basically sell

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.210 
desktop so that's how you basically sell
your<00:02:26.360> windows<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.930> automatically<00:02:27.680> log<00:02:28.010> on

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
your windows to automatically log on

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.490 
your windows to automatically log on
without<00:02:28.580> typing<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.269> your<00:02:29.420> password<00:02:29.500> it's

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
without typing in your password it's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.229 
without typing in your password it's
