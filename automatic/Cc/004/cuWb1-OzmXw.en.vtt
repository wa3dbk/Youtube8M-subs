00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
here and West does not get anything

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.020 
here and West does not get anything
going<00:05:34.289> unfortunately<00:05:35.130> lose<00:05:35.370> yards<00:05:35.699> on<00:05:35.820> both

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
going unfortunately lose yards on both

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.460 
going unfortunately lose yards on both
plays<00:05:36.270> now<00:05:36.479> son<00:05:36.720> it's<00:05:36.840> third<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:37.080> goal<00:05:37.260> to<00:05:37.440> a

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
plays now son it's third and goal to a

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.680 
plays now son it's third and goal to a
ery<00:05:37.800> so<00:05:38.280> we<00:05:38.370> call<00:05:38.490> a<00:05:38.520> screen<00:05:38.789> play<00:05:39.240> at<00:05:39.449> all<00:05:39.479> and

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
ery so we call a screen play at all and

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.360 
ery so we call a screen play at all and
it<00:05:39.750> doesn't<00:05:39.870> get<00:05:40.080> picked<00:05:40.110> off<00:05:40.560> and<00:05:40.919> we<00:05:41.070> hit<00:05:41.220> the

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
it doesn't get picked off and we hit the

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.010 
it doesn't get picked off and we hit the
spin<00:05:41.760> move<00:05:41.970> with<00:05:42.150> don't<00:05:42.360> ask<00:05:42.780> me<00:05:42.930> how<00:05:42.990> to

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
spin move with don't ask me how to

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.600 
spin move with don't ask me how to
pronounce<00:05:43.289> his<00:05:43.500> name<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:44.039> we<00:05:44.310> get<00:05:44.580> a

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
pronounce his name and we get a

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.300 
pronounce his name and we get a
touchdown<00:05:45.030> out<00:05:45.539> of<00:05:45.659> that<00:05:45.840> so<00:05:46.409> I<00:05:46.680> like<00:05:47.039> the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
touchdown out of that so I like the

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
touchdown out of that so I like the
screen<00:05:47.550> pass<00:05:47.669> probably<00:05:48.000> wasn't<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.270> best

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
screen pass probably wasn't the best

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.719 
screen pass probably wasn't the best
call<00:05:48.720> there<00:05:48.990> but<00:05:49.409> we<00:05:49.530> made<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.130> spin<00:05:50.370> move<00:05:50.550> and

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
call there but we made the spin move and

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.600 
call there but we made the spin move and
we<00:05:51.180> made<00:05:51.330> it<00:05:51.419> work<00:05:51.570> now<00:05:52.169> we're<00:05:52.440> up<00:05:52.560> 14<00:05:53.280> in<00:05:53.460> this

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
we made it work now we're up 14 in this

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.240 
we made it work now we're up 14 in this
game<00:05:53.849> up<00:05:54.060> 14<00:05:54.570> I<00:05:54.810> mean<00:05:55.470> like<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:55.740> said<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:56.099> two

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
game up 14 I mean like I said the two

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.770 
game up 14 I mean like I said the two
touchdowns<00:05:56.639> we<00:05:56.759> gave<00:05:56.970> up<00:05:57.000> ruffle<00:05:57.509> blown

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
touchdowns we gave up ruffle blown

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.689 
touchdowns we gave up ruffle blown
coverages<00:05:58.320> but<00:05:58.620> it's<00:05:59.009> hard<00:05:59.220> to<00:05:59.280> recover<00:05:59.490> from

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
coverages but it's hard to recover from

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.760 
coverages but it's hard to recover from
that<00:05:59.789> sometimes<00:06:00.570> I<00:06:00.840> mean<00:06:01.050> if<00:06:01.110> this<00:06:01.289> was<00:06:01.440> a<00:06:01.470> mutt

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
that sometimes I mean if this was a mutt

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.560 
that sometimes I mean if this was a mutt
game<00:06:01.979> I<00:06:02.220> don't<00:06:02.639> know<00:06:02.699> we<00:06:02.820> were<00:06:02.970> recovery<00:06:03.419> from

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
game I don't know we were recovery from

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.490 
game I don't know we were recovery from
it<00:06:03.720> since<00:06:03.870> it<00:06:03.960> would<00:06:04.050> be<00:06:04.110> three<00:06:04.289> minute

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
it since it would be three minute

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.600 
it since it would be three minute
quarters<00:06:04.800> but<00:06:04.919> since<00:06:05.130> these<00:06:05.280> games<00:06:05.490> are

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
quarters but since these games are

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.610 
quarters but since these games are
pretty<00:06:05.789> long<00:06:05.940> six<00:06:06.300> minute<00:06:06.539> quarters<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.500> know

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
pretty long six minute quarters you know

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.990 
pretty long six minute quarters you know
we<00:06:07.770> had<00:06:07.889> plenty<00:06:08.070> of<00:06:08.190> time<00:06:08.310> to<00:06:08.460> I'm<00:06:08.820> virtually

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
lot of clock on his drive so we know

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:19.249 
lot of clock on his drive so we know
that<00:06:18.810> much

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
that much

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:20.719 
that much
if<00:06:19.320> he<00:06:19.710> wants<00:06:19.889> to<00:06:19.919> kill<00:06:20.099> clock<00:06:20.280> that's<00:06:20.460> fine<00:06:20.699> a

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
if he wants to kill clock that's fine a

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.310 
if he wants to kill clock that's fine a
14-point<00:06:21.449> game<00:06:21.539> cuz<00:06:21.870> it<00:06:21.960> looks<00:06:21.990> like<00:06:22.199> he's

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
14-point game cuz it looks like he's
