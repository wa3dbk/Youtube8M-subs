serving<00:02:03.360> which<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.720> great<00:02:04.729> I'm<00:02:05.729> gonna<00:02:05.910> also

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
serving which is great I'm gonna also

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.630 
serving which is great I'm gonna also
add<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> tablespoon<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.290> organic<00:02:07.770> raw<00:02:08.310> chia

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
energy boost in the morning and they

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.940 
energy boost in the morning and they
taste<00:02:12.510> awesome<00:02:12.720> okay<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.560> next<00:02:13.740> I'm<00:02:13.890> just

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950

getting<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> little<00:02:14.340> bit<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.640> almond<00:02:14.880> milk<00:02:14.910> to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
getting a little bit of almond milk to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.610 
getting a little bit of almond milk to
the<00:02:15.330> mix<00:02:15.560> about<00:02:16.560> 1/4<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.730> cup<00:02:18.260> ok<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.320> it's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the mix about 1/4 of a cup ok so it's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.080 
the mix about 1/4 of a cup ok so it's
done<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.250> now<00:02:20.370> I'm<00:02:20.459> just<00:02:20.580> gonna<00:02:20.670> add<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
done so now I'm just gonna add that to

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.850 
done so now I'm just gonna add that to
my<00:02:21.300> mix<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.110> should<00:02:22.320> make<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.500> taste<00:02:22.740> a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860

done but if you'd like to add a little
bit<00:02:28.200> more<00:02:28.470> protein<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:29.070> could<00:02:29.190> always<00:02:29.310> add<00:02:29.519> a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
bit more protein you could always add a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.340 
bit more protein you could always add a
scoop<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.000> your<00:02:30.060> favorite<00:02:30.450> protein<00:02:30.840> shake<00:02:31.140> I

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
it has about 25 grams of protein in the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.530 
it has about 25 grams of protein in the
serving<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.160> probably<00:02:38.640> take<00:02:38.820> half<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.480> and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
serving I probably take half of this and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.390 
serving I probably take half of this and
put<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.290> there<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.739> then<00:02:41.070> you'll<00:02:41.190> end<00:02:41.340> up

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
put that in there and then you'll end up

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.320 
put that in there and then you'll end up
splitting<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.880> into<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.209> two<00:02:42.360> pain

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.090
