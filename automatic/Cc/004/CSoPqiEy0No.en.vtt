wing<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.269> out<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.510> little<00:02:15.840> bit<00:02:16.019> on<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.380> ends

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.600 

and<00:02:27.569> then<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.019> create<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.439> way<00:02:28.620> you're<00:02:29.430> just

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
and then to create the way you're just

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.100 
and then to create the way you're just
going<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:30.299> want<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.689> look<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:30.870> it's

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
going to you want it to look like it's

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.530 
going to you want it to look like it's
coming<00:02:31.200> from<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.769> bottom<00:02:32.159> up<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.360> bottom

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
coming from the bottom up in the bottom

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.420 
coming from the bottom up in the bottom
lash<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.230> just<00:02:34.470> kind<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.739> flick<00:02:35.780> gently

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
lash so you just kind of flick gently

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.619 
lash so you just kind of flick gently
and<00:02:38.430> line<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.790> back<00:02:39.090> up<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> top<00:02:44.629> I'm

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
and line it back up with the top I'm

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.119 
and line it back up with the top I'm
going<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.870> connect<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:48.799> so<00:02:49.799> there's<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
going to connect it so there's the

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.429 
going to connect it so there's the
winged<00:02:50.370> eyeliner<00:02:50.609> and<00:02:51.450> now<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.079> step<00:02:52.290> is

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
winged eyeliner and now this step is

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.349 
winged eyeliner and now this step is
optional<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:53.069> I<00:02:53.400> think<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:54.150> fun

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
optional but I think it's really fun

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.910 
optional but I think it's really fun
