00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.049
 that's the reason it didn't happen 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.049
 my girlfriend 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.460
 this summer 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.810
 I do not want that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.340
 that has already been announced because I thought we won 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.980
 with five more games to play, the farmer's brother died unexpectedly 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.090
 what do you find on staff 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 during the evening 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.850
 we also did a round before that followed 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.110
 actually the best 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.570
 the best man in the field 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.400
 2 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.490
 within a few weeks the management will be back on the finishing line 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.380
 well i hope the incident were stolen 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.380
 what little has been done to act 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.520
 a 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.060
 People who prefer to tell something also 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.590
 I thought at that time no hotels with a number see 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.780
 not what we do not have to pay the police are investigating they get anyway 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.270
 to do with it 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.150
 can resist 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.420
 I just didn't really think you were a turbine bunch 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.600
 it is just a shame that at the beginning of the summer a press meeting city like 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.580
 only it is known that is really not that it is not but never mind 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.590
 you shouldn't have it but I'll tell you where 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.590
 also in Amsterdam 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.170
 we are heavy 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.340
 in a response 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.130
 don't win x in the bedroom 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.210
 of a baby 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.910
 talk to the message 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.170
 gerard is full of fun jokes about that 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.180
 i'm pregnant hospital 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.729
 I'm afraid yes 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.080
 come on 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.670
 how do you determine the turning point 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.579
 you can eat you a seed and if mum and dad haven't officially been handed over 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.000
 the first year but then you have to do something for Miami 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.289
 not you haven't 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.559
 nekema 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.969
 does anyone know that his duties are being taken up? 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.819
 no contraceptives at all 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.030
 i thought to be familiar with gerard 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.550
 and best for us middle burden of all said competition 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:33.599
 listeners 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.410
 then you get these things from that 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.289
 first you have to see what we are going to do now 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:40.679
 among the dead was a child's will 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.329
 not that I still have that 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.889
 drink another child if you lower something like that 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:49.859
 from school 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:50.809
 then 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:54.529
 yes no I am not doing so well anymore than we are not used to 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.529
 are he dr 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.889
 received the euro 

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:12.089
 give that record in a row the first episode 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:13.709
 the relief 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.979
 of course 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.019
 no that's for what 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.019
 2 admire goodbye 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.529
 because of it too 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:24.809
 they had 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:25.919
 the project
