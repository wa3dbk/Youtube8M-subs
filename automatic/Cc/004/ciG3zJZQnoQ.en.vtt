00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.250 
that work on tomorrow's technology today
a<00:00:28.470> few<00:00:29.340> years<00:00:29.550> ago<00:00:29.699> they<00:00:30.029> developed<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> EXO<00:00:30.929> 3

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
a few years ago they developed the EXO 3

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.130 
a few years ago they developed the EXO 3
technology<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.940> excel<00:00:33.270> 3<00:00:33.480> technology

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
technology and the excel 3 technology

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.280 
technology and the excel 3 technology
has<00:00:34.530> two<00:00:34.860> main<00:00:35.300> advantages<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.989> first

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
has two main advantages the first

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.470 
has two main advantages the first
advantage<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:38.010> allows<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.969> sweet<00:00:39.210> spot

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
advantage is allows the sweet spot

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.889 
advantage is allows the sweet spot
expansion<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.890> grow<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.790> 57<00:00:42.390> percent<00:00:42.809> in

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
expansion to grow up to 57 percent in

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.380 
expansion to grow up to 57 percent in
our<00:00:43.050> rackets<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.610> second<00:00:45.000> main<00:00:45.120> feature

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
our rackets and the second main feature

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
our rackets and the second main feature
is<00:00:45.780> allows<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.410> racquets<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.070> more

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
is allows the racquets to be more

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.330 
is allows the racquets to be more
aerodynamic<00:00:47.520> I'd<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.809> show<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:50.129> new

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
aerodynamic I'd like to show you the new

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.299 
aerodynamic I'd like to show you the new
2012<00:00:51.149> line<00:00:51.480> now<00:00:51.770> starting<00:00:52.770> with<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> rebel

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
2012 line now starting with the rebel

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.189 
2012 line now starting with the rebel
series<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.420> go<00:00:54.539> through<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> specs

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
series and we can go through the specs

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.010 
series and we can go through the specs
on<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> racket<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.820> first<00:00:57.090> racket<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
on the racket the first racket is the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.790 
on the racket the first racket is the
rebel<00:00:58.289> 95<00:00:58.940> it's<00:00:59.940> 95<00:01:00.480> square<00:01:00.840> inches<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.620> has

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
rebel 95 it's 95 square inches that has

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.009 
rebel 95 it's 95 square inches that has
excellent<00:01:02.340> technology<00:01:02.809> throughout<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
excellent technology throughout the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.260 
excellent technology throughout the
frame<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.309> said<00:01:05.369> allows<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.000> string

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
frame and like I said allows the string

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
frame and like I said allows the string
freedom<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> move<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> sweet<00:01:07.770> spot<00:01:08.040> grows

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
freedom to move so the sweet spot grows

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.120 
freedom to move so the sweet spot grows
and<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.570> also<00:01:09.720> allows<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.590> racket<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:10.979> more

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and it also allows the racket to be more

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
and it also allows the racket to be more
aerodynamic<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> air<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.840> we've

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
aerodynamic to the air so we've

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
aerodynamic to the air so we've
distributed<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.979> weight<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> head<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
distributed the weight to the head of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.690 
distributed the weight to the head of
the<00:01:15.180> racket<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.380> means<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.400> hits<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the racket what that means is it hits a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.910 
the racket what that means is it hits a
heavier<00:01:18.030> ball<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> hammer<00:01:19.439> where<00:01:19.740> weight

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
heavier ball like a hammer where weight

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.010 
heavier ball like a hammer where weight
would<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.100> towards<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> end<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.570> allows<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
would be towards the end it allows you

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.630 
would be towards the end it allows you
to<00:01:22.140> drive<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.650> ball<00:01:22.770> through<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.070> court<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to drive the ball through the court and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.219 
to drive the ball through the court and
as<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.060> saw<00:01:24.240> with<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.450> John<00:01:24.720> Isner<00:01:24.930> match

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
as you saw with the John Isner match

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
as you saw with the John Isner match
last<00:01:25.530> year<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.130> Wimbledon<00:01:26.460> 11<00:01:27.030> hours<00:01:27.270> long

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
last year and Wimbledon 11 hours long

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.469 
last year and Wimbledon 11 hours long
5<00:01:28.140> points<00:01:28.650> determine<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.280> match<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.329> by

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
5 points determine that match so by

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.050 
5 points determine that match so by
having<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:31.079> bigger<00:01:31.470> sweet<00:01:31.799> spot<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.729> hitting

having a bigger sweet spot and a hitting
a<00:01:33.119> heavier<00:01:33.390> ball<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.020> allows<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.829> win<00:01:34.979> more

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
a heavier ball it allows to win more

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.219 
a heavier ball it allows to win more

we've been able to distribute the weight

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.300 
we've been able to distribute the weight
in<00:02:55.540> there<00:02:55.720> our<00:02:55.930> swing<00:02:56.290> weights<00:02:56.500> 9<00:02:56.860> out<00:02:57.010> of<00:02:57.040> 10

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
in there our swing weights 9 out of 10

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.040 
in there our swing weights 9 out of 10
times<00:02:57.340> are<00:02:57.790> higher<00:02:57.970> than<00:02:58.180> our<00:02:58.270> competitor<00:02:58.780> and
