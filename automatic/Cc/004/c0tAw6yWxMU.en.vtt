00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
showing you a little trick with PayPal

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.160 
showing you a little trick with PayPal
and<00:00:09.300> net<00:00:09.960> spin<00:00:10.170> because<00:00:11.540> net<00:00:12.540> spends<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:13.080> of

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
and net spin because net spends one of

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.470 
and net spin because net spends one of
the<00:00:13.230> better<00:00:13.549> prepaid<00:00:14.549> cards<00:00:14.880> out<00:00:15.000> there<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.360> my

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
the better prepaid cards out there in my

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.240 
the better prepaid cards out there in my
opinion<00:00:15.809> it's<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.770> use<00:00:17.039> I've

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
opinion it's the one that I use I've

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.480 
opinion it's the one that I use I've
been<00:00:17.369> using<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:17.760> several<00:00:18.359> years<00:00:19.460> so<00:00:20.460> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
been using it for several years so I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.650 
been using it for several years so I
recommend<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.150> sign<00:00:21.359> up<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:21.539> them

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
recommend that you sign up with them

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.529 
recommend that you sign up with them
because<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.080> does<00:00:22.289> make<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.560> much<00:00:22.830> easier<00:00:23.100> to

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
because it does make it much easier to

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.000 
because it does make it much easier to
sort<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.630> get<00:00:24.720> around<00:00:24.930> PayPal's<00:00:25.320> bullshit<00:00:25.859> if

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
sort of get around PayPal's bullshit if

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.560 
sort of get around PayPal's bullshit if
you<00:00:26.340> catch<00:00:26.970> my<00:00:27.150> drift

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
you catch my drift

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.589 
you catch my drift
so<00:00:28.400> anyhow<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> kind<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> discovered<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.359> last

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
so anyhow I kind of discovered this last

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
so anyhow I kind of discovered this last
night<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.990> wasn't<00:00:31.800> sure<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.009> would<00:00:32.070> work<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.430> I

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
night I wasn't sure it would work but I

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.569 
night I wasn't sure it would work but I
was<00:00:32.790> pretty<00:00:33.030> sure<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.510> was<00:00:33.630> right<00:00:33.780> so

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
was pretty sure and I was right so

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.220 
was pretty sure and I was right so
hopefully<00:00:35.579> it's<00:00:36.120> kind<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.390> complicated<00:00:36.809> this

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
hopefully it's kind of complicated this

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.530 
hopefully it's kind of complicated this
whole<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.829> PayPal<00:00:38.160> shit<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.760> hopefully

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
whole like PayPal shit so hopefully

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.420 
whole like PayPal shit so hopefully
somebody<00:00:40.440> out<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.860> able<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> sort<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
somebody out there is able to sort of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.010 
somebody out there is able to sort of
piece<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.790> together<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.360> make<00:00:42.420> use<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
piece this together and make use of it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.299 
piece this together and make use of it
so<00:00:43.940> as<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.510> know<00:00:45.660> probably<00:00:46.590> by<00:00:47.160> now

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
so as you all know probably by now

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
so as you all know probably by now
PayPal<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.590> demanding<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.739> social

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
PayPal is now demanding a social

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.619 
PayPal is now demanding a social
security<00:00:50.280> number<00:00:50.520> when<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> sign<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.360> which

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
security number when you sign up which

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
security number when you sign up which
makes<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.530> sort<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> inconvenient<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.640> you've

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
makes it sort of inconvenient if you've

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.689 
makes it sort of inconvenient if you've
been<00:00:54.000> limited<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.530> recommend<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.399> case

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
been limited so I recommend in that case

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
been limited so I recommend in that case
personally<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.420> what<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> did<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.590> just

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
personally this is what I did was I just

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.920 
personally this is what I did was I just
had<00:00:58.949> my<00:00:59.070> husband<00:00:59.460> open<00:00:59.820> an<00:00:59.910> account<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.840> know

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
had my husband open an account you know

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.709 
had my husband open an account you know
in<00:01:01.050> his<00:01:01.199> name<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.770> his<00:01:02.270> social<00:01:03.270> security<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
in his name with his social security and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.280 
in his name with his social security and
then<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.500> mean<00:01:05.250> he<00:01:05.369> doesn't<00:01:05.519> use<00:01:05.760> PayPal<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.540> but

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
then I mean he doesn't use PayPal so but

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.350 
then I mean he doesn't use PayPal so but
I<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.010> I've<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.460> simply<00:01:08.760> been<00:01:09.030> using<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
I do so I've just simply been using the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.980 
I do so I've just simply been using the
account<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.659> he<00:01:09.810> set<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.229> no<00:01:10.380> problem

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
account that he set up with no problem

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.560 
account that he set up with no problem
so<00:01:12.990> basically<00:01:13.700> let's<00:01:14.700> say<00:01:15.210> though<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
so basically let's say though that you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.690 
so basically let's say though that you
had<00:01:15.780> been<00:01:16.020> limited<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.040> your<00:01:17.159> NetSpend

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.090 
had been limited and that your NetSpend
card<00:01:17.759> was<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.299> know<00:01:18.420> no<00:01:18.780> longer<00:01:19.080> good<00:01:19.770> because

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
card was you know no longer good because

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.740 
card was you know no longer good because
it's<00:01:20.250> linked<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> your<00:01:20.700> limited<00:01:21.540> account

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
