the description so I have used this a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.620 
the description so I have used this a
flashlight<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.250> my<00:00:23.310> car<00:00:24.769> as<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:26.789> could<00:00:26.970> see<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
flashlight in my car as you could see it

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.120 
flashlight in my car as you could see it
is<00:00:28.640> extremely<00:00:29.640> bright<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.130> LED

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
is extremely bright it is a LED

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.690 
is extremely bright it is a LED
flashlight<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.420> has<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> very<00:00:34.980> very<00:00:35.100> bright

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
flashlight it has a very very bright

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.130 
flashlight it has a very very bright
light<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:37.040> reason<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.129> got<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.520> thing<00:00:38.790> because

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
light so reason I got this thing because

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.260 
light so reason I got this thing because
you<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:41.129> won't<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.520> an<00:00:41.700> older<00:00:42.000> car

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you know as it won't have an older car

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.799 
you know as it won't have an older car
so<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.719> most<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> cars<00:00:43.760> lights<00:00:44.809> aren't

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
so in most of the cars lights aren't

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.920 
so in most of the cars lights aren't
aren't<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.530> bright<00:00:47.090> especially<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
aren't that bright especially in the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.220 
aren't that bright especially in the
night<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.039> case<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.489> drop<00:00:50.850> something

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
out when you leave because I have a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.280 
out when you leave because I have a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
feeling that it could eat up your

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.499 
feeling that it could eat up your
battery<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.400> won't<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.820> able<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.240> start

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
battery and you won't be able to start

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.569 
battery and you won't be able to start
your<00:01:39.659> car<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> one

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
downside of this flashlight but in

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.880
