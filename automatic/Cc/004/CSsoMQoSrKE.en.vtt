00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
manufacturers English is not their first

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.469 
manufacturers English is not their first
language<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.549> call<00:01:09.150> something

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
language so when you call something

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.750 
language so when you call something
something<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.530> don't<00:01:10.830> really<00:01:11.220> understand

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
something they don't really understand

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.330 
something they don't really understand
what<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> diagram

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
what it is but if you have a diagram

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.640 
what it is but if you have a diagram
showing<00:01:14.340> where<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.720> understand<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
showing where that is they understand a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.840 
showing where that is they understand a
lot<00:01:16.799> better<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.509> go<00:01:18.770> bust<00:01:23.600> waist<00:01:25.610> we<00:01:26.610> did

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
lot better so we go bust waist we did

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:36.960 
lot better so we go bust waist we did
hip

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:48.260 

then<00:01:37.600> we<00:01:37.720> did<00:01:37.900> Weiss<00:01:40.980> to<00:01:41.980> hip<00:01:46.620> length<00:01:47.620> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
then we did Weiss to hip length of

00:01:48.270 --> 00:02:08.990 
then we did Weiss to hip length of
bodice<00:01:57.210> line<00:01:58.210> at<00:01:59.370> Center<00:02:00.370> French<00:02:07.560> length<00:02:08.560> at

bodice line at Center French length at
side

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:23.059 

we<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.890> strap<00:02:21.410> then<00:02:22.410> we're<00:02:22.560> going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.740> add<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
we of strap then we're going to add the

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.340 
we of strap then we're going to add the
other<00:02:23.100> measurements<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.300> we<00:02:24.600> did<00:02:26.900> which<00:02:27.900> was

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
other measurements that we did which was

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:46.060 
other measurements that we did which was
length<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.400> skirt<00:02:36.410> bias<00:02:37.410> binding<00:02:44.690> width<00:02:45.690> of

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
length of skirt bias binding width of

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:53.110 
length of skirt bias binding width of
him

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:07.190 

elastic<00:02:54.120> panel<00:02:59.000> length<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.320> zip<00:03:01.320> up<00:03:01.920> back<00:03:06.200> and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
elastic panel length of zip up back and

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
elastic panel length of zip up back and
that<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.800> it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
that was it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.070 
that was it
so<00:03:09.890> we'll<00:03:10.890> just<00:03:11.100> correct<00:03:11.520> these<00:03:12.080> reference

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
so we'll just correct these reference

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.680 
so we'll just correct these reference
points<00:03:13.310> up<00:03:14.310> with<00:03:14.580> c<00:03:14.970> d<00:03:15.480> e<00:03:15.510> f<00:03:15.750> g<00:03:16.080> h<00:03:17.390> that's<00:03:18.390> all<00:03:18.570> we

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
points up with c d e f g h that's all we

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.020 
points up with c d e f g h that's all we
went<00:03:18.840> up<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:20.340> don't<00:03:20.520> have<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.760> give<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
went up to so you don't have to give the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.970 
went up to so you don't have to give the
reference<00:03:21.270> point<00:03:21.720> for<00:03:21.900> everyone<00:03:22.500> but<00:03:22.770> just

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
reference point for everyone but just

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.390 
reference point for everyone but just
the<00:03:23.130> main<00:03:23.340> ones<00:03:23.610> will<00:03:23.850> help<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:25.310> then<00:03:26.310> we're

the main ones will help and then we're

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.940 
the main ones will help and then we're
going<00:03:26.490> to<00:03:26.610> put<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.970> measurements<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.320> what

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
notice that i've got a size eight ten

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.800 
notice that i've got a size eight ten
twelve<00:03:34.320> fourteen<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.700> depending<00:03:36.570> on<00:03:36.600> what

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
twelve fourteen so depending on what

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.020 
twelve fourteen so depending on what
market<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.350> are<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.590> might<00:03:37.770> use<00:03:38.070> European<00:03:38.790> or

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
market you are you might use European or

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
this and I measured the gum and that was

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.370 
this and I measured the gum and that was
the<00:03:52.530> size<00:03:52.770> 10<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.280> fill<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.090> out

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:05:03.320 

width<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.630> strap<00:04:50.440> was<00:04:51.070> one<00:04:51.340> point<00:04:51.640> H

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:12.809 

length<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.539> scope<00:05:04.960> was<00:05:05.229> 46<00:05:10.800> bias<00:05:11.800> finding<00:05:12.520> one

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
length of scope was 46 bias finding one

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:33.650 
length of scope was 46 bias finding one
point<00:05:13.150> H<00:05:16.800> width<00:05:17.800> of<00:05:18.039> him<00:05:18.279> was<00:05:19.259> six<00:05:20.259> millimeters

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.550 

the<00:05:34.660> sip<00:05:34.930> was<00:05:35.170> 25<00:05:36.690> now<00:05:37.690> you<00:05:37.750> want<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.020> check<00:05:38.350> all

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
the sip was 25 now you want to check all

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.030 
the sip was 25 now you want to check all
of<00:05:38.980> these<00:05:39.190> measurements<00:05:39.640> and<00:05:40.270> I<00:05:40.360> think<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:41.040> went

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
of these measurements and I think I went

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.780 
of these measurements and I think I went
out<00:05:42.310> of<00:05:42.340> order<00:05:44.970> lengths<00:05:45.970> outside<00:05:47.370> 63<00:05:48.370> so

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
out of order lengths outside 63 so

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:57.000 
out of order lengths outside 63 so
that's<00:05:49.000> a<00:05:49.210> G<00:05:50.100> length<00:05:51.100> at<00:05:51.370> center<00:05:51.970> front<00:05:52.350> 46<00:05:56.010> so

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
that's a G length at center front 46 so

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.250 
that's a G length at center front 46 so
what<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.640> would<00:05:57.940> do<00:05:58.120> is<00:05:58.240> go<00:05:58.450> back<00:05:58.480> to<00:05:58.780> the<00:05:58.870> dammit

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
what I would do is go back to the dammit

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.320 
what I would do is go back to the dammit
and<00:05:59.290> just<00:05:59.560> double<00:05:59.740> check<00:06:00.070> that's<00:06:00.250> right<00:06:00.700> it

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
and just double check that's right it

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.040 
and just double check that's right it
could<00:06:01.540> actually<00:06:01.720> be<00:06:01.960> longer<00:06:02.320> because<00:06:04.050> we're

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
could actually be longer because we're

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.380 
could actually be longer because we're
not<00:06:05.170> measuring<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.680> drop<00:06:06.190> we're<00:06:07.180> measuring

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
not measuring the drop we're measuring

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.780 
not measuring the drop we're measuring
fabric<00:06:08.140> so<00:06:08.560> because<00:06:09.220> fabric<00:06:09.580> things

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
fabric so because fabric things

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.240 
fabric so because fabric things
differently<00:06:10.480> so<00:06:10.510> I<00:06:11.110> would<00:06:11.380> just<00:06:11.410> double<00:06:11.950> check

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
differently so I would just double check

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.440 
differently so I would just double check
that<00:06:12.730> and<00:06:13.770> also<00:06:14.770> you<00:06:15.640> can<00:06:15.820> see<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.120> center

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
that and also you can see the center

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.590 
that and also you can see the center
front<00:06:16.720> dips<00:06:17.080> down<00:06:17.410> and<00:06:17.620> compared<00:06:17.950> to<00:06:18.010> the<00:06:18.280> side

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
front dips down and compared to the side

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.300 
front dips down and compared to the side
so<00:06:19.600> it<00:06:19.720> could<00:06:19.960> be<00:06:20.110> correct<00:06:20.500> but<00:06:20.680> I'd<00:06:20.830> go<00:06:21.040> back

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
so it could be correct but I'd go back

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.010 
so it could be correct but I'd go back
so<00:06:22.000> you<00:06:22.090> just<00:06:22.300> want<00:06:22.510> to<00:06:22.570> check<00:06:22.810> over

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
so you just want to check over

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.390 
so you just want to check over
everything<00:06:23.920> and<00:06:25.530> you<00:06:26.530> know<00:06:26.560> just<00:06:27.100> check<00:06:27.280> that

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
everything and you know just check that

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
everything and you know just check that
you've<00:06:27.490> got<00:06:27.640> the<00:06:27.730> right<00:06:27.880> measurements

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
you've got the right measurements

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.910 
you've got the right measurements
because<00:06:28.570> they're<00:06:28.870> going<00:06:28.990> to<00:06:29.050> see<00:06:29.320> this<00:06:29.560> and

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
because they're going to see this and

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.050 
because they're going to see this and
make<00:06:30.370> it<00:06:30.400> like<00:06:30.730> exactly<00:06:31.540> the<00:06:31.660> same<00:06:32.970> so<00:06:33.970> you

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
make it like exactly the same so you

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.280 
make it like exactly the same so you
want<00:06:34.300> to<00:06:34.360> put<00:06:34.480> the<00:06:34.600> description<00:06:37.020> whatever<00:06:38.020> you

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
want to put the description whatever you

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.740 
want to put the description whatever you
want<00:06:38.440> to<00:06:38.500> call<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:38.830> style<00:06:39.100> jay-z<00:06:39.760> dress<00:06:40.180> make

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
want to call the style jay-z dress make

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.950 
want to call the style jay-z dress make
up<00:06:40.900> a<00:06:40.990> style<00:06:41.350> number<00:06:45.270> maybe<00:06:46.270> put<00:06:46.570> the<00:06:46.720> date

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
up a style number maybe put the date

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:58.090 
up a style number maybe put the date
that<00:06:47.350> it<00:06:47.590> was<00:06:47.620> created

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.189 

if<00:06:59.100> you're<00:06:59.490> referring<00:07:00.120> to<00:07:00.150> another<00:07:00.539> block<00:07:00.930> you

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
if you're referring to another block you

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.140 
if you're referring to another block you
might<00:07:01.380> want<00:07:01.590> to<00:07:01.710> put<00:07:01.860> that<00:07:02.039> there<00:07:02.370> put<00:07:02.669> your

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
might want to put that there put your

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.420 
might want to put that there put your
your<00:07:03.660> label<00:07:04.110> name<00:07:04.380> there<00:07:04.830> and<00:07:05.220> the<00:07:05.580> season<00:07:07.430> so

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
your label name there and the season so

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:14.020 
your label name there and the season so
we'll<00:07:08.580> zoom<00:07:08.789> out<00:07:09.440> that's<00:07:10.910> essentially<00:07:11.910> our

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
we'll zoom out that's essentially our

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.560 
we'll zoom out that's essentially our
your<00:07:15.030> measurement<00:07:15.720> specification
