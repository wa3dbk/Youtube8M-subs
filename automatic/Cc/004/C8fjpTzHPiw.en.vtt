00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
on top to receive 2 tripwire hooks so

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.859 
on top to receive 2 tripwire hooks so
now<00:02:00.729> once<00:02:00.910> you<00:02:00.970> grab<00:02:01.180> your<00:02:01.300> two<00:02:01.450> tripwire

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
now once you grab your two tripwire

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.719 
now once you grab your two tripwire
hooks<00:02:02.170> all<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.470> need<00:02:02.619> is<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.070> tripwire<00:02:03.430> and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
hooks all you need is the tripwire and

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.210 
hooks all you need is the tripwire and
stream<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.420> actually<00:02:04.780> get<00:02:05.170> started<00:02:05.440> so<00:02:06.190> first

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
stream to actually get started so first

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.040 
stream to actually get started so first
off<00:02:06.580> in<00:02:06.729> order<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:07.060> use<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.240> tripwire<00:02:07.540> you're

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
off in order to use a tripwire you're

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.419 
off in order to use a tripwire you're
gonna<00:02:08.140> have<00:02:08.290> to<00:02:08.380> place<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.619> in<00:02:08.860> between<00:02:09.009> two

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
gonna have to place it in between two

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.110 
gonna have to place it in between two
blocks<00:02:10.179> like<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.170> 1<00:02:11.680> 2<00:02:11.920> 3<00:02:12.220> ok

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
blocks like so 1 2 3 ok

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.470 
blocks like so 1 2 3 ok
yeah<00:02:14.160> OCD<00:02:15.160> or<00:02:15.190> something<00:02:15.670> cuz<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.240> to<00:02:16.270> have

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
yeah OCD or something cuz I have to have

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.449 
yeah OCD or something cuz I have to have
it<00:02:16.810> symmetrical<00:02:16.930> all<00:02:17.650> right<00:02:17.770> there<00:02:17.980> we<00:02:18.040> go

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
it symmetrical all right there we go

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.900 
it symmetrical all right there we go
so<00:02:18.760> what<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.030> do<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.750> want<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.170> place<00:02:20.910> two

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
so what you do is you want to place two

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.660 
so what you do is you want to place two
tripwires<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.630> 2g<00:02:23.010> opposite<00:02:24.010> blocks<00:02:24.250> when

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
tripwires on 2g opposite blocks when

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.550 
tripwires on 2g opposite blocks when
you're<00:02:24.790> going<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:24.940> do<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.330> across<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.200> have

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
you're going to do is across it you have

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.830 
you're going to do is across it you have
to<00:02:26.650> place<00:02:26.860> three<00:02:27.370> string<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:28.150> like<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.600> and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
to place three string just like so and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.750 
to place three string just like so and
that's<00:02:29.410> your<00:02:29.590> tripwire<00:02:30.100> like<00:02:30.370> that

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
that's your tripwire like that

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.000 
that's your tripwire like that
so<00:02:31.060> trip<00:02:31.269> wires<00:02:31.480> are<00:02:31.660> basically<00:02:32.110> another<00:02:32.769> way

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
so trip wires are basically another way

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.370 
so trip wires are basically another way
of<00:02:33.160> activating<00:02:33.700> or<00:02:34.060> toggling<00:02:34.540> redstone

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
of activating or toggling redstone

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.710 
of activating or toggling redstone
circuit<00:02:35.860> I'm<00:02:36.850> kind<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.269> like<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.420> pressure

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
circuit I'm kind of like a pressure

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.170 
circuit I'm kind of like a pressure
plate<00:02:37.959> but<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.040> lot<00:02:39.220> harder<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.640> see<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.030> I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
plate but it's a lot harder to see and I

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.790 
plate but it's a lot harder to see and I
think<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.540> word<00:02:40.840> tripwire<00:02:41.290> has<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.530> more

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
think the word tripwire has a more

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.979 
think the word tripwire has a more
negative<00:02:42.070> connotation<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:42.910> people<00:02:43.300> might<00:02:43.450> use

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
negative connotation so people might use

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.140 
negative connotation so people might use
it<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.230> lot<00:02:44.380> more<00:02:44.620> for<00:02:44.860> traps<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.400> stuff<00:02:45.790> like

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
it a lot more for traps and stuff like

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.780 
it a lot more for traps and stuff like
that<00:02:46.600> so<00:02:47.230> when<00:02:47.410> they<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:47.980> someone<00:02:48.430> steps

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
that so when they go and someone steps

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.060 
that so when they go and someone steps
on<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.000> there's<00:02:49.570> an<00:02:49.780> output<00:02:50.140> received<00:02:50.590> at<00:02:50.830> each

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
on it there's an output received at each

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.810 
on it there's an output received at each
end<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.209> tripwire<00:02:52.799> just<00:02:53.799> like<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.250> or<00:02:54.519> it

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
end of the tripwire just like so or it

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.559 
end of the tripwire just like so or it
can<00:02:54.940> even<00:02:55.060> be<00:02:55.209> placed<00:02:55.600> here<00:02:56.170> or<00:02:57.040> here

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
can even be placed here or here

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.190 
can even be placed here or here
on<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.019> sides<00:02:59.290> behind<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.040> around<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:01.200> hundred

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
on the sides behind it around it hundred

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.309 
on the sides behind it around it hundred
you<00:03:02.950> know<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.790> does<00:03:04.239> all<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.079> yeah

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
you know it does all of it so yeah

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.319 
you know it does all of it so yeah
that's<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.099> tripwire<00:03:06.519> really<00:03:06.879> fast<00:03:07.090> so

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
that's the tripwire really fast so

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.729 
that's the tripwire really fast so
that's<00:03:07.510> basically<00:03:07.900> how<00:03:08.110> it<00:03:08.260> works<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.650> now

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
that's basically how it works and now

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:09.869 
that's basically how it works and now
I'm<00:03:08.829> going<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:08.980> explain<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.519> little<00:03:09.549> bit

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
I'm going to explain it a little bit

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.850 
I'm going to explain it a little bit
more<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.599> trip<00:03:10.810> wires<00:03:11.049> can<00:03:11.379> actually<00:03:11.739> be

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
more so trip wires can actually be

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.729 
more so trip wires can actually be
placed<00:03:12.129> up<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.730> 40<00:03:13.120> blocks<00:03:13.480> away<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.409> you<00:03:14.500> can

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
placed up to 40 blocks away so you can

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.100 
placed up to 40 blocks away so you can
have<00:03:14.920> one<00:03:15.579> over<00:03:15.970> there<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.360> one<00:03:16.450> way<00:03:16.900> over

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
have one over there and one way over

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.600 
have one over there and one way over
there<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.409> the<00:03:17.590> space<00:03:17.799> can<00:03:18.010> be<00:03:18.069> up<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.250> 40

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
there and the space can be up to 40

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.580 
there and the space can be up to 40
blocks<00:03:18.909> in<00:03:19.180> between<00:03:19.209> which<00:03:19.900> actually<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.560> a

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
blocks in between which actually is a

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.990 
blocks in between which actually is a
lot<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.040> string<00:03:21.340> though<00:03:21.519> so<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.730> wouldn't

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
lot of string though so I wouldn't

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.369 
lot of string though so I wouldn't
really<00:03:22.150> recommend<00:03:22.299> doing<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:23.049> bigger

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
really recommend doing that bigger

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.920 
really recommend doing that bigger
surface<00:03:23.799> but<00:03:24.159> if<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.370> want<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.640> feel<00:03:25.359> free<00:03:25.900> to

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
surface but if you want to feel free to

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.250 
surface but if you want to feel free to
do<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.230> but<00:03:26.950> yeah<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.209> tripwire<00:03:28.629> is<00:03:28.840> um

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
do that but yeah so the tripwire is um

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.280 
do that but yeah so the tripwire is um
also<00:03:30.099> has<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.909> be<00:03:31.030> placed<00:03:31.299> on<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:32.140> floor

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
also has to be placed on the floor

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.849 
also has to be placed on the floor
mainly<00:03:32.799> but<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.129> can<00:03:33.280> actually<00:03:33.430> place<00:03:33.819> it<00:03:34.030> up

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
mainly but you can actually place it up

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.699 
mainly but you can actually place it up
higher<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.970> some<00:03:37.359> circumstances<00:03:38.200> just<00:03:38.560> like

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
higher in some circumstances just like

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.110 
higher in some circumstances just like
so<00:03:38.859> so<00:03:39.010> if<00:03:39.069> we<00:03:39.129> place<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.340> tripwire<00:03:39.609> here<00:03:39.970> and

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
so so if we place a tripwire here and

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.379 
so so if we place a tripwire here and
here<00:03:40.720> we<00:03:41.260> can<00:03:41.409> link<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.799> across<00:03:42.250> just<00:03:42.940> like<00:03:43.060> so

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
here we can link it across just like so

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.000 
here we can link it across just like so
and<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:44.620> works<00:03:44.920> all<00:03:45.760> right<00:03:45.849> very<00:03:46.629> well<00:03:46.870> see<00:03:47.409> so

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
and it works all right very well see so

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.080 
and it works all right very well see so
like<00:03:48.129> that<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.579> can<00:03:48.700> actually<00:03:48.730> have

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
like that so you can actually have

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.720 
like that so you can actually have
someone<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.569> trap<00:03:49.780> where<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.139> fall<00:03:50.379> and<00:03:50.730> it'll

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
someone a trap where you fall and it'll

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.970 
someone a trap where you fall and it'll
trigger<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.239> like<00:03:52.690> that<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.500> that's<00:03:53.560> one<00:03:53.829> way

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
trigger it like that so that's one way

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.220 
trigger it like that so that's one way
and<00:03:54.220> another<00:03:54.489> thing<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.849> note<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.230> disarming

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
and another thing to note is disarming

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.960 
and another thing to note is disarming
these<00:03:56.409> traps<00:03:56.769> so<00:03:56.950> disarming<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.489> traps<00:03:57.730> is

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
these traps so disarming the traps is

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.869 
these traps so disarming the traps is
actually<00:03:58.780> kind<00:03:59.379> of<00:03:59.440> confusing<00:04:00.040> but<00:04:00.609> all<00:04:00.760> you

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
actually kind of confusing but all you

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.909 
actually kind of confusing but all you
have<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.090> do<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.420> you<00:04:01.870> take<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.260> pair<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.560> shears

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
have to do is you take a pair of shears

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.710 
have to do is you take a pair of shears
and<00:04:03.430> what<00:04:03.549> I<00:04:03.579> would<00:04:03.790> do<00:04:03.910> is<00:04:04.090> when<00:04:04.209> I'm<00:04:04.359> walking

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
and what I would do is when I'm walking

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.809 
and what I would do is when I'm walking
around<00:04:04.810> I'm<00:04:05.680> trying<00:04:05.919> to<00:04:05.980> find<00:04:06.129> these<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.760> just

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
around I'm trying to find these you just

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.280 
around I'm trying to find these you just
move<00:04:07.120> your<00:04:07.209> mouse<00:04:07.299> up<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.720> down<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.109> if<00:04:08.199> you

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
move your mouse up and down and if you

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.780 
move your mouse up and down and if you
see<00:04:08.470> something<00:04:08.680> like<00:04:08.799> this<00:04:08.949> you<00:04:09.310> know<00:04:09.519> there's

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
see something like this you know there's

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.699 
see something like this you know there's
a<00:04:09.849> tripwire<00:04:10.150> there<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:11.349> can<00:04:11.530> actually

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
a tripwire there and you can actually

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.619 
a tripwire there and you can actually
break<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.549> won't<00:04:12.730> actually<00:04:13.180> send<00:04:13.449> off

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
break it and it won't actually send off

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.720 
break it and it won't actually send off
the<00:04:14.049> circuit<00:04:14.379> so<00:04:14.560> for<00:04:14.739> example<00:04:15.250> up<00:04:15.519> here

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
the circuit so for example up here

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.849 
the circuit so for example up here
normally<00:04:16.359> right<00:04:16.570> if<00:04:16.810> we<00:04:17.049> trigger<00:04:17.289> it<00:04:17.380> it'll<00:04:17.739> go

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
normally right if we trigger it it'll go

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.759 
normally right if we trigger it it'll go
off<00:04:18.039> if<00:04:18.280> we<00:04:18.940> break<00:04:19.180> it<00:04:19.239> it'll<00:04:19.930> go<00:04:20.049> off<00:04:20.199> but<00:04:20.560> if

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
off if we break it it'll go off but if

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.500 
off if we break it it'll go off but if
we<00:04:20.949> use<00:04:21.160> shears<00:04:21.400> actually<00:04:21.970> what<00:04:22.300> we<00:04:22.389> can

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
we use shears actually what we can

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.860 
we use shears actually what we can
actually<00:04:22.780> do<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:24.180> just<00:04:25.180> ridiculous<00:04:25.630> shears

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
actually do is just ridiculous shears

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.770 
actually do is just ridiculous shears
and<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.470> won't<00:04:26.680> set<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.580> off<00:04:27.760> so<00:04:28.510> it's<00:04:28.660> really

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
and it won't set it off so it's really

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.010 
and it won't set it off so it's really
cool<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.460> make<00:04:30.460> sure<00:04:30.699> you<00:04:30.880> take<00:04:31.389> note<00:04:31.660> of<00:04:31.810> that

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
cool and make sure you take note of that

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.779 
cool and make sure you take note of that
because<00:04:32.050> that's<00:04:32.440> really<00:04:32.530> important<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.639> not

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
because that's really important to not

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.310 
because that's really important to not
just<00:04:34.060> break<00:04:34.300> any<00:04:34.479> trip<00:04:34.720> wires<00:04:34.930> because

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
just break any trip wires because

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.900 
just break any trip wires because
otherwise<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:36.010> will<00:04:36.250> set<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.580> off<00:04:36.699> and

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
otherwise you will set it off and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.820 
otherwise you will set it off and
actually<00:04:37.870> one<00:04:38.080> way<00:04:38.110> I'm<00:04:38.410> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.620> show<00:04:38.770> you

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
actually one way I'm going to show you

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.010 
actually one way I'm going to show you
though<00:04:39.010> how<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.490> keep<00:04:39.970> people<00:04:40.330> from<00:04:40.360> disarming

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
though how to keep people from disarming

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.119 
though how to keep people from disarming
your<00:04:41.110> traps<00:04:41.409> and<00:04:41.500> getting<00:04:41.889> away<00:04:42.039> with<00:04:42.250> it

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
your traps and getting away with it

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.159 
your traps and getting away with it
is<00:04:43.249> instead<00:04:43.759> you<00:04:44.029> actually<00:04:44.360> set<00:04:44.629> a<00:04:44.809> blood

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
is instead you actually set a blood

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.499 
is instead you actually set a blood
switch<00:04:45.499> over<00:04:46.069> on<00:04:46.219> this<00:04:46.429> end<00:04:46.489> and<00:04:46.849> I'll<00:04:47.059> show

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
switch over on this end and I'll show

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.570 
switch over on this end and I'll show
you<00:04:47.599> that<00:04:47.719> here<00:04:47.959> in<00:04:47.989> a<00:04:48.110> second<00:04:48.439> hang<00:04:48.529> on<00:04:48.679> all

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
you that here in a second hang on all

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.919 
you that here in a second hang on all
right<00:04:49.639> so<00:04:50.059> I've<00:04:50.149> set<00:04:50.360> up<00:04:50.389> a<00:04:50.569> tripwire

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:50.929 
right so I've set up a tripwire

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:52.659 
right so I've set up a tripwire
mechanism<00:04:51.619> with<00:04:51.739> a<00:04:51.769> butt<00:04:51.979> switch<00:04:52.249> right<00:04:52.519> on

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
mechanism with a butt switch right on

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.339 
mechanism with a butt switch right on
the<00:04:52.789> end<00:04:52.909> right<00:04:53.209> here<00:04:53.419> and<00:04:53.689> they're<00:04:54.289> not

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
the end right here and they're not

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.689 
the end right here and they're not
connected<00:04:54.769> right<00:04:54.800> now<00:04:54.919> but<00:04:55.339> I'm<00:04:55.429> going<00:04:55.610> to

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
connected right now but I'm going to

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.549 
connected right now but I'm going to
show<00:04:55.849> you<00:04:55.909> how<00:04:56.149> it<00:04:56.269> works<00:04:56.389> so<00:04:56.659> pretend<00:04:57.169> we<00:04:57.349> have

00:04:57.549 --> 00:04:57.559 
show you how it works so pretend we have

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.339 
show you how it works so pretend we have
a<00:04:57.939> redstone<00:04:58.939> birth<00:04:59.479> trap<00:04:59.779> right<00:04:59.959> here<00:05:00.169> and

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
a redstone birth trap right here and

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.779 
a redstone birth trap right here and
this<00:05:00.499> is<00:05:00.679> our<00:05:00.800> trap<00:05:01.099> right<00:05:01.309> the<00:05:01.459> redstone

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
this is our trap right the redstone

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.609 
this is our trap right the redstone
torch<00:05:01.819> so<00:05:02.089> that's<00:05:02.269> our<00:05:02.419> objective<00:05:02.569> is<00:05:03.319> to<00:05:03.379> get

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:03.619 
torch so that's our objective is to get

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:04.959 
torch so that's our objective is to get
its<00:05:03.800> turn<00:05:04.009> off<00:05:04.159> so<00:05:04.309> normally<00:05:04.639> if<00:05:04.699> a<00:05:04.789> player

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
its turn off so normally if a player

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.359 
its turn off so normally if a player
walks<00:05:05.239> across<00:05:05.509> it<00:05:05.689> right<00:05:05.899> it<00:05:06.589> goes<00:05:06.800> off<00:05:07.039> and

00:05:07.359 --> 00:05:07.369 
walks across it right it goes off and

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:09.489 
walks across it right it goes off and
our<00:05:07.550> objective<00:05:07.999> was<00:05:08.330> completed<00:05:08.869> if<00:05:09.019> they

00:05:09.489 --> 00:05:09.499 
our objective was completed if they

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:11.709 
our objective was completed if they
break<00:05:09.800> it<00:05:10.039> right<00:05:10.189> without<00:05:10.610> shares<00:05:11.059> it<00:05:11.479> goes

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
break it right without shares it goes

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.169 
break it right without shares it goes
off<00:05:11.929> and<00:05:12.169> our<00:05:12.259> objective<00:05:12.619> is<00:05:12.709> completed<00:05:13.219> but

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:14.179 
off and our objective is completed but

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:16.509 
off and our objective is completed but
if<00:05:14.419> we<00:05:14.629> grab<00:05:14.929> sheers<00:05:15.319> right<00:05:15.679> and<00:05:15.889> we<00:05:16.099> break<00:05:16.309> it

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:16.519 
if we grab sheers right and we break it

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:19.119 
if we grab sheers right and we break it
it<00:05:17.300> doesn't<00:05:17.689> work<00:05:17.809> right<00:05:18.050> because<00:05:18.529> the<00:05:18.860> sheers

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
it doesn't work right because the sheers

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.489 
it doesn't work right because the sheers
keep<00:05:19.519> the<00:05:19.699> chop<00:05:19.909> from<00:05:20.149> going<00:05:20.389> off<00:05:20.539> and<00:05:20.779> you<00:05:20.839> can

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:21.499 
keep the chop from going off and you can

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.159 
keep the chop from going off and you can
safely<00:05:21.919> disarm<00:05:22.369> it<00:05:22.490> this<00:05:22.580> way<00:05:22.759> but<00:05:23.659> if<00:05:23.899> you<00:05:24.019> use

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
safely disarm it this way but if you use

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.859 
safely disarm it this way but if you use
a<00:05:24.379> butt<00:05:24.619> switch<00:05:24.919> you<00:05:25.369> can<00:05:25.519> actually<00:05:25.689> hook<00:05:26.689> them

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:26.869 
a butt switch you can actually hook them

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:29.619 
a butt switch you can actually hook them
up<00:05:26.959> and<00:05:27.429> since<00:05:28.429> this<00:05:28.580> is<00:05:28.759> a<00:05:28.789> block<00:05:29.059> update<00:05:29.449> from

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
up and since this is a block update from

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.769 
up and since this is a block update from
the<00:05:29.990> thing<00:05:30.740> going<00:05:31.039> up<00:05:31.279> and<00:05:31.519> down<00:05:31.699> it<00:05:32.599> will

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
the thing going up and down it will

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.839 
the thing going up and down it will
actually<00:05:33.199> still<00:05:33.499> count<00:05:33.889> it<00:05:34.099> and<00:05:34.279> it'll<00:05:34.669> cause

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
actually still count it and it'll cause

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.549 
actually still count it and it'll cause
the<00:05:34.999> trap<00:05:35.209> to<00:05:35.329> still<00:05:35.539> go<00:05:35.659> so<00:05:36.169> now<00:05:36.319> if<00:05:36.409> we<00:05:36.469> use

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:36.559 
the trap to still go so now if we use

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:38.079 
the trap to still go so now if we use
shears<00:05:36.919> now<00:05:37.189> that<00:05:37.339> we've<00:05:37.459> hooked<00:05:37.610> up<00:05:37.759> the<00:05:37.939> bud

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:38.089 
shears now that we've hooked up the bud

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:40.389 
shears now that we've hooked up the bud
switch<00:05:38.360> to<00:05:38.689> our<00:05:38.929> output<00:05:39.679> that<00:05:39.829> we<00:05:39.979> want<00:05:40.159> on<00:05:40.339> the

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:40.399 
switch to our output that we want on the

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:42.159 
switch to our output that we want on the
torch<00:05:41.059> should<00:05:41.239> go<00:05:41.419> off<00:05:41.539> when<00:05:41.719> we<00:05:41.839> break<00:05:41.989> the

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
torch should go off when we break the

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.379 
torch should go off when we break the
string<00:05:42.379> just<00:05:43.249> like<00:05:43.459> that<00:05:43.669> so<00:05:43.909> even<00:05:44.149> though<00:05:44.239> we

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
string just like that so even though we

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.279 
string just like that so even though we
use<00:05:44.539> shears<00:05:46.119> it<00:05:47.119> still<00:05:47.389> causes<00:05:47.809> it<00:05:47.959> to<00:05:47.990> go<00:05:48.169> off

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
use shears it still causes it to go off

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.989 
use shears it still causes it to go off
even<00:05:48.619> if<00:05:48.709> we<00:05:48.829> replace<00:05:49.159> it<00:05:49.399> like<00:05:49.550> this<00:05:49.729> though

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:49.999 
even if we replace it like this though

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:52.329 
even if we replace it like this though
since<00:05:50.479> it<00:05:50.629> goes<00:05:50.779> from<00:05:50.959> here<00:05:51.050> to<00:05:51.379> here<00:05:51.679> the

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:52.339 
since it goes from here to here the

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:53.999 
since it goes from here to here the
torch<00:05:52.579> still<00:05:52.849> does<00:05:53.059> go<00:05:53.240> off<00:05:53.389> took<00:05:53.629> my<00:05:53.809> back

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
torch still does go off took my back

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.679 
torch still does go off took my back
there<00:05:55.009> we<00:05:55.159> go<00:05:55.279> see<00:05:55.819> so<00:05:56.119> that's<00:05:56.209> pretty<00:05:56.509> much

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:56.689 
there we go see so that's pretty much

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.139 
there we go see so that's pretty much
the<00:05:56.869> basics<00:05:57.259> guys<00:05:57.439> of<00:05:57.740> tripwires<00:05:58.610> is<00:05:58.849> really

00:05:59.139 --> 00:05:59.149 
the basics guys of tripwires is really

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:00.639 
the basics guys of tripwires is really
not<00:05:59.300> a<00:05:59.329> whole<00:05:59.449> lot<00:05:59.659> to<00:05:59.689> it<00:05:59.959> it's<00:06:00.199> like<00:06:00.349> trying

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:00.649 
not a whole lot to it it's like trying

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:02.589 
not a whole lot to it it's like trying
to<00:06:00.709> explain<00:06:00.769> a<00:06:01.099> pressure<00:06:01.429> plate<00:06:01.669> or<00:06:02.240> something

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
to explain a pressure plate or something

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:03.699 
to explain a pressure plate or something
like<00:06:02.689> that<00:06:02.929> there's<00:06:03.169> just<00:06:03.259> a<00:06:03.409> couple

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:03.709 
like that there's just a couple

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:04.869 
like that there's just a couple
different<00:06:04.009> things<00:06:04.039> that<00:06:04.399> you<00:06:04.490> can<00:06:04.610> do<00:06:04.759> with

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
different things that you can do with

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.509 
different things that you can do with
them<00:06:05.059> so<00:06:05.659> obviously<00:06:06.559> the<00:06:06.769> string<00:06:07.069> can't<00:06:07.399> be

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:07.519 
them so obviously the string can't be

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:09.730 
them so obviously the string can't be
seen<00:06:07.759> as<00:06:07.969> well<00:06:08.209> from<00:06:08.509> when<00:06:08.719> it's<00:06:08.869> up<00:06:09.139> here<00:06:09.589> like

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
seen as well from when it's up here like

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.139 
seen as well from when it's up here like
this<00:06:09.919> and<00:06:10.099> when<00:06:10.429> you<00:06:10.459> actually<00:06:10.729> place<00:06:11.119> it

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:11.149 
this and when you actually place it

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:13.659 
this and when you actually place it
across<00:06:11.809> stone<00:06:12.499> for<00:06:12.889> example<00:06:13.249> so<00:06:13.399> if<00:06:13.459> we<00:06:13.550> have

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
across stone for example so if we have

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.319 
across stone for example so if we have
stone<00:06:13.939> going<00:06:14.300> this<00:06:14.899> way<00:06:15.079> right<00:06:15.439> it's<00:06:16.329> actually

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:17.329 
stone going this way right it's actually

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:19.359 
stone going this way right it's actually
harder<00:06:17.599> to<00:06:17.629> see<00:06:17.929> on<00:06:18.050> stone<00:06:18.319> as<00:06:18.529> you<00:06:18.919> can<00:06:19.069> see<00:06:19.219> it

00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:19.369 
harder to see on stone as you can see it

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:21.699 
harder to see on stone as you can see it
blends<00:06:19.699> quite<00:06:20.089> in<00:06:20.329> quite<00:06:21.050> well<00:06:21.079> with<00:06:21.289> stone

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:21.709 
blends quite in quite well with stone

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:23.409 
blends quite in quite well with stone
whereas<00:06:22.039> if<00:06:22.219> you<00:06:22.279> put<00:06:22.490> it<00:06:22.579> like<00:06:22.759> on<00:06:22.939> sand<00:06:23.240> or

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
whereas if you put it like on sand or

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:24.969 
whereas if you put it like on sand or
something<00:06:23.569> it's<00:06:23.959> not<00:06:24.110> going<00:06:24.169> to<00:06:24.349> be<00:06:24.469> it's

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
something it's not going to be it's

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.559 
something it's not going to be it's
going<00:06:25.099> to<00:06:25.159> be<00:06:25.249> seeing<00:06:25.490> a<00:06:25.639> lot<00:06:25.759> more<00:06:25.819> easily

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569 
going to be seeing a lot more easily

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:28.899 
going to be seeing a lot more easily
so<00:06:27.379> yeah<00:06:27.499> placing<00:06:28.009> it<00:06:28.099> on<00:06:28.189> different<00:06:28.490> surfaces

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
so yeah placing it on different surfaces

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.839 
so yeah placing it on different surfaces
is<00:06:29.089> also<00:06:29.749> a<00:06:29.779> key<00:06:30.050> point<00:06:30.259> to<00:06:30.529> consider<00:06:30.769> to<00:06:31.699> make

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
is also a key point to consider to make

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.429 
is also a key point to consider to make
sure<00:06:32.029> you<00:06:32.659> figure<00:06:32.869> out<00:06:32.929> where<00:06:33.110> you<00:06:33.199> want<00:06:33.379> to

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:33.439 
sure you figure out where you want to

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:34.839 
sure you figure out where you want to
place<00:06:33.589> your<00:06:33.619> trip<00:06:33.919> wires<00:06:34.129> to<00:06:34.309> hide<00:06:34.519> them<00:06:34.699> the

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
place your trip wires to hide them the

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:36.270 
place your trip wires to hide them the
best

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
best

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.410 
best
you<00:06:36.430> know<00:06:36.550> might<00:06:36.970> play<00:06:37.600> something<00:06:37.990> like<00:06:38.020> this

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
you know might play something like this

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.520 
you know might play something like this
if<00:06:40.420> you<00:06:40.570> want<00:06:40.720> to<00:06:40.810> hide<00:06:40.930> the<00:06:41.110> tripwire<00:06:41.500> a

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
if you want to hide the tripwire a

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.530 
if you want to hide the tripwire a
little<00:06:41.860> bit<00:06:41.980> better<00:06:42.190> right<00:06:42.460> so<00:06:43.180> if<00:06:43.270> you<00:06:43.360> put

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
little bit better right so if you put

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.879 
little bit better right so if you put
that<00:06:43.690> under<00:06:43.870> there<00:06:44.139> see<00:06:44.500> it<00:06:44.620> might<00:06:44.740> be<00:06:44.860> a

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
that under there see it might be a

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.770 
that under there see it might be a
little<00:06:45.040> hard<00:06:45.310> to<00:06:45.370> see<00:06:45.669> kind<00:06:45.910> of<00:06:46.000> thing<00:06:46.150> with

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
little hard to see kind of thing with

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.500 
little hard to see kind of thing with
the<00:06:46.870> tripwire<00:06:47.260> coming<00:06:47.650> out<00:06:47.830> this<00:06:48.340> way<00:06:48.580> but

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510 
the tripwire coming out this way but

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.090 
the tripwire coming out this way but
yeah<00:06:49.720> so<00:06:50.110> there's<00:06:50.290> not<00:06:50.380> a<00:06:50.440> whole<00:06:50.590> lot<00:06:50.650> left<00:06:51.010> to

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
yeah so there's not a whole lot left to

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.770 
yeah so there's not a whole lot left to
talk<00:06:51.280> about<00:06:51.340> trip<00:06:52.210> wires<00:06:52.389> are<00:06:52.600> pretty

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
talk about trip wires are pretty

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.960 
talk about trip wires are pretty
self-explanatory<00:06:53.139> and<00:06:53.889> I<00:06:54.520> hope<00:06:54.700> you<00:06:54.790> guys

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
self-explanatory and I hope you guys
