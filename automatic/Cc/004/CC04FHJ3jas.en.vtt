 first he is a substrate I will hold out 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.880
 straighten mycroft out of paper and I certainly 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.550
 made forging 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:23.539
 Well, that means such a muzzle nose 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:29.240
 such ears too suffered to bend further 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:32.730
 head is stupid let's say how mane u 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.700
 no urine so let's say you don't have 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.149
 here is this channel there is one pair he is also not 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.059
 knows how our legs are like this 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.739
 many taxes here and here but then 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.760
 such a body here and tail as in 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.090
 previous series 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.850
 what a cool cat i want to say 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.120
 about a diamond sword, I certainly comment 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.520
 removed form does not need something one 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.770
 I feel that I have a sword nonsense 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.189
 sheer 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.110
 ghouls better explaining why he is better 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.740
 I have because he 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.320
 stamped and glued their affairs thickness 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.040
 special paper and I have no thickness 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.100
 I have everything decorated on both sides 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.830
 would jesus angel try and he just took 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.049
 and typed only 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.500
 re-printed as if not to paint especially 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.369
 printed and made the thickness of the hoof can 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.740
 each out draw is very beautiful 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.439
 try beautiful as i try 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.960
 that's different but everyone can print 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.590
 I personally do not have a printer, so I 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 I draw here it was interesting as 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.600
 why do you decide I really do not have a printer 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.579
 and if I had, I probably wouldn't 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.540
 imprint went no it's not interest 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.780
 printed cut paste and everything as we would 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.829
 every metal there 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.820
 I did not remember the removal of the printed 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.780
 like rice itself 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.460
 but the scan showed really bad 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.820
 so scan 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.550
 yourself try to guess I plow myself 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.890
 there almost guessed that from lego 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.050
 paraffia husband subscribe no one to attack 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.750
 Well, the result was difficult 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.870
 learn from the experience of its own if not 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.970
 I am thinking it can claim lower but 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.750
 Sorry , something is not just this all 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.750
 bye everyone
