 [intro music] 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:05.269
 Hi, welcome back to Make Thrift Buy, a show 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:09.760
 that had a break for a month because I was in Hong Kong. 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.740
 Today's episode was suggested by ... me, because I saw this tip on tumblr and I found it 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.509
 that it was very cool and I wanted to copy it and I also wanted to choose something 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.380
 that is fairly easy to get back in the mood of Make Thrift Buy. 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.130
 What I wanted to copy was this daisy-breasted cropped t-shirt. The daisies have too 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.029
 creepy little smiles on their face. So let's get started. 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.300
 I have this half-cut shirt that I originally bought second hand and used for fabric 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.649
 in episode 10. I didn't want to throw it away at the end of episode 10, 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.410
 and I'm glad I didn't because I can now use it for this episode. 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.039
 First of all it seemed like a good idea to make the sleeves a bit more, well ... right. 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.980
 So I cut off the other sleeve so that it matched the first. 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.890
 This shirt has already been cut off. Nevertheless, if you come with a new one 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.260
 shirt works, all you have to do is cut the bottom of the shirt to a length that 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.470
 fits you, but add a few inches for hemming before you cut it. 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.470
 With the shirt inside out, I folded the sleeve once and then twice. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.140
 Then I selected a stitch for stretchy fabric 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.520
 and I sewed around the entire sleeve in this way. 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.380
 When both sleeves were finished and the shirt was still inside out, I hemmed the bottom of the shirt. 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.290
 I only folded the bottom edge once because I didn't have too much fabric left to work with, 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.630
 and as I did with the sleeves, I sewed around the entire hem with a zigzag stitch. 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.049
 A smart way to ensure that the hem does not bend is to sew a piece of paper 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.670
 on the shirt when you sew on the hem. An even better way is to put it under 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.299
 place the shirt when you sew so that you can still see what you are doing. 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.329
 Then I just tore away the paper and ... spent ten minutes removing the little papers 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.619
 between the stitches, and I'm done! I have a crop top. 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.479
 Now it's time to add the daisies. I have drawn two daisies 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.700
 using Photoshop, but it's such a simple design that you could do this on yourself 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.349
 MS Paint. I made two and then printed on ironing paper and me 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.090
 she cut out. Then I put on my new crop top and decided where I wanted the daisies 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.790
 and I stuck a small amount of blu-tack where I wanted the middle of each daisy 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.040
 because you don't see your pencil on a black fabric, I won't wind my chalk. Then took it 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.040
 I took the pictures off their paper and I put them on the shirt. 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 [music] 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.159
 The only problem with this shirt is that 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.849
 it is a bit too short. I mean, it's fine if I don't raise my arms, but 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.649
 if I do .... well .. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.964
 My tip number 1 for copying this shirt? Do not cut accidentally 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.580
 your shirt is too short. Now I didn't really have a choice, but if you are in doubt 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.000
 along the length of your shirt, add a few extra inches. If it's too long 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.150
 you can just fold it again and hem, but if you cut it too short 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.159
 you can't go back. But I think I'm going to wear this with a pinafore or dungarees 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.349
 who will make sure that I am not so bared. So I can wear it often anyway. 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.729
 That was it. My conclusion? 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.659
 [clipping sound and zipper sound] 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.879
 Please keep submitting suggestions for things you want me to try on Make Thrift 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.250
 Buy. I want a lot of episodes of this. 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.060
 I have a Pinterest bulletin board on which I have collected everything that you have suggested, 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.040
 that you can visit and find things that I might do in the future or even vote for things, so that 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.189
 if a suggestion gets a lot of likes, I know what you want to see and that will come 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.739
 at the front of my to-do list. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the video. Do it 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:21.739
 a thumbs up if you liked it and I'll see you all at the next episode. Bye!
