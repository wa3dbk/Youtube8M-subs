00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
you do you might know like all there's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.680 
you do you might know like all there's
like<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> huge<00:02:45.989> fence<00:02:46.799> so<00:02:47.310> look<00:02:48.299> out<00:02:48.420> for<00:02:48.480> that

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
like a huge fence so look out for that

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.500 
like a huge fence so look out for that
there's<00:02:49.590> also<00:02:49.890> going<00:02:50.159> to<00:02:50.220> be<00:02:50.310> iron<00:02:50.730> bars<00:02:51.000> so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
there's also going to be iron bars so

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.509 
there's also going to be iron bars so
might<00:02:51.959> be<00:02:52.139> doing<00:02:52.440> some<00:02:52.590> cops<00:02:52.859> and<00:02:53.099> robbers

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519
