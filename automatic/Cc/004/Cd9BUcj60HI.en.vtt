00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
the amount of missiles carried by the

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.860 
the amount of missiles carried by the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
mobile AAA from six to four they've also

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.680 
mobile AAA from six to four they've also
reduced<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.830> mobile<00:02:54.340> aa's<00:02:54.730> 20-millimeter

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
reduced the mobile aa's 20-millimeter

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.810

cannon<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.710> match<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
cannon to match that of the

cannon to match that of the
30-millimeter<00:02:58.450> cannon<00:02:58.780> they<00:02:59.560> say<00:02:59.830> the<00:03:00.460> way<00:03:00.580> it

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
30-millimeter cannon they say the way it

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.900 
30-millimeter cannon they say the way it
was<00:03:01.000> was<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.470> AAA<00:03:02.680> could<00:03:03.190> basically<00:03:03.400> sit

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
was was that the AAA could basically sit

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.020 
was was that the AAA could basically sit
in<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.240> home<00:03:04.420> base<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.900> hit<00:03:05.520> aircraft<00:03:06.520> across

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
in the home base and hit aircraft across

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.210 
in the home base and hit aircraft across
the<00:03:07.270> other<00:03:07.420> side<00:03:07.510> of<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.020> map<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.860> hopefully

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
the other side of the map so hopefully

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.190 
the other side of the map so hopefully
that<00:03:09.370> will<00:03:09.460> address<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.030> they've<00:03:10.960> also

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
that will address that they've also

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.720 
that will address that they've also
reduced<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.670> AAA<00:03:13.390> missiles<00:03:14.290> at<00:03:15.220> least<00:03:15.520> the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
reduced the AAA missiles at least the

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.750 
reduced the AAA missiles at least the
physical<00:03:16.330> impact<00:03:16.959> of<00:03:17.230> them<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.620> damage<00:03:18.100> has

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
physical impact of them the damage has

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.940 
physical impact of them the damage has
not<00:03:19.030> been<00:03:19.239> changed<00:03:19.720> but<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.650> know<00:03:20.800> how

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
not been changed but you know how

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.130 
not been changed but you know how
sometimes<00:03:21.250> if<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.700> helicopter<00:03:22.180> gets<00:03:22.390> hit<00:03:22.600> by<00:03:22.810> an

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
sometimes if a helicopter gets hit by an

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.979 
sometimes if a helicopter gets hit by an
a<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.380> missile<00:03:23.950> it'll<00:03:24.190> flip<00:03:24.760> over<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.209> go<00:03:25.690> out

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
a a missile it'll flip over and go out

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.650 
a a missile it'll flip over and go out
of<00:03:26.230> control<00:03:26.380> that<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.580> going<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.970> stop<00:03:28.330> so

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
of control that is going to stop so

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.050 
of control that is going to stop so
helicopter<00:03:29.500> pilots<00:03:29.950> will<00:03:30.100> have<00:03:30.250> time<00:03:30.550> to

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
helicopter pilots will have time to

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.510 
helicopter pilots will have time to
react<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:31.959> gain<00:03:32.260> control<00:03:32.680> they've<00:03:33.280> also

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
react in gain control they've also

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.520 
react in gain control they've also
reduced<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> cone<00:03:34.480> in<00:03:34.660> which<00:03:34.780> active<00:03:35.230> radar

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
reduced the cone in which active radar

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.740 
reduced the cone in which active radar
