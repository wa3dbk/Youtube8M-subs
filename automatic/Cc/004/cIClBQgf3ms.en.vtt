00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.170
 yes hello people 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.870
 Today I show you how you like the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.930
 Design for the piazza suite comes one 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.789
 Weapon or a dress I'm not quite 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.170
 sure how to describe it can 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.390
 take a look at it myself I'll show 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.240
 you arrive again first you have to go in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.880
 the mario world how that works you see what 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.700
 now any is displayed and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.200
 then you have to go behind the second one 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.610
 big office to this blog with me he is 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.170
 to see here in pink with you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.280
 that's why I'm looking invisible 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.500
 one more time to the left and to the right 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 that he had an orientation he became 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.710
 exactly and as soon as you are under this 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.260
 invisible lokstedt you just have to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.660
 on the other hand, then the pink and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.629
 on top of that is the design for 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.070
 the piazza suite as well as the whole 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.300
 times what you needed for that 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.430
 that produces naturally 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.020
 only one of them if you have the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.840
 produces and we need for it 10 x 0 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.270
 10 for tape 10 string and ten 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.549
 Alcohol is quite manageable 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.310
 materials and I would say put 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.970
 also directly one and go here 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.970
 try out 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.080
 ours, so to speak, try ours at that time 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.340
 good luck with the new ring suite and 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.340
 We crashed down here 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.310
 As you see, that was good for me as well 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.680
 the first try but try 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.090
 maybe you'll like that 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.090
 works properly until then
