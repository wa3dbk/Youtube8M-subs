00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
our patrons and ecd green proposed the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.480 
our patrons and ecd green proposed the
idea<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.289> could<00:00:16.350> put<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> same<00:00:17.010> Lego<00:00:17.310> set

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
idea that I could put the same Lego set

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.160 
idea that I could put the same Lego set
together<00:00:17.670> as<00:00:17.970> he<00:00:18.150> was<00:00:18.300> putting<00:00:18.510> together<00:00:18.690> even

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
together as he was putting together even

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.720 
together as he was putting together even
though<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> live<00:00:19.560> here<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.039> he<00:00:20.340> lives<00:00:20.550> halfway

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730

though I live here and he lives halfway
across<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> world<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.660> thought<00:00:21.869> that's<00:00:22.320> an

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
across the world I thought that's an

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.370 
across the world I thought that's an
