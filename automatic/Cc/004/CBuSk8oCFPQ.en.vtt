00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.600
 hello friends this time I bring you 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.670
 an idea for you to do 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.740
 figures with bread 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.620
 and our ingredients are our bread 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.600
 already with the edges trimmed obviously 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.680
 The edges 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.950
 about three slices of 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.470
 tomato about three slices 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.680
 of cucumber 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.590
 a piece of lettuce and of course 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.239
 our plate that is a little big 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.450
 so that you can appreciate the 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.450
 figure 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.370
 ok proceeding to make the first step 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.560
 let's take our bread 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.290
 let's put it up here 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.820
 thus 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.950
 and let's take our bread banks 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 let's accommodate like this in the form of a little house 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.640
 let's take this thread to a being in 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.170
 chimney shape for this I broke the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.630
 pieces of bread that were too 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.580
 long 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.030
 also form these but these are going to 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.510
 leave a little more to front 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.310
 ok the next step 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 is going to be putting a slice of tomato 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.150
 here in the middle 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.700
 just to decorate 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.299
 and let's take a piece of lettuce 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.570
 I see it as more or less and we're going 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.610
 to put here 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.600
 as if it were a little skirt or as if 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.330
 out a little grass 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.250
 let's accommodate this way we're going to 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.140
 take our cucumbers and we're going to 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.140
 accommodate like this in this way 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.369
 let's see if this does not fall 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.800
 let's break a bit because it's 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.370
 clogging 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.370
 so 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.290
 let's put our 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.060
 and this piece is a bit 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.450
 and we will have the last 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:23.230
 and grabbing shape our little house 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.230
 let's proceed to the third step 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.990
 ok the next step 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.360
 let's take the three remaining banks 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.830
 we are going to put them here below the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.050
 faldita of 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.950
 from the house 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.599
 in this way more or less 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.440
 each one will then accommodate him to his 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.000
 taste let's do with a little house clock 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.600
 so 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.600
 we are going to 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.880
 and we are going to take 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.090
 our tomato and we're going to put that 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.090
 this form 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.090
 as if they were hanging 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.769
 our from our little house clock 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.480
 in this way more or less 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.480
 and we already have our appointment block there 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.080
 This is our determined design is a 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.750
 pretty simple design to do 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.280
 but it's also very fun to them 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.260
 I recommend that they try it at home and 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.070
 let me blow your imagination we are 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.070
 in the next video
