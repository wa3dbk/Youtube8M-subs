00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
program I'm not saying that I'm hitting

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.020 
program I'm not saying that I'm hitting
everything<00:02:59.450> every<00:02:59.870> day<00:03:00.580> but<00:03:01.580> I'm<00:03:01.880> at<00:03:02.000> least

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
everything every day but I'm at least

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.660 
everything every day but I'm at least

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
trying and for right now it's working

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.290 
trying and for right now it's working
because<00:03:05.020> five<00:03:06.020> pounds<00:03:06.530> in<00:03:06.770> just<00:03:07.430> over<00:03:07.970> two

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
because five pounds in just over two

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.190

weeks<00:03:08.330> that's<00:03:09.170> not<00:03:09.380> too<00:03:09.500> bad<00:03:09.740> so<00:03:11.200> hopefully

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
weeks that's not too bad so hopefully

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.830
