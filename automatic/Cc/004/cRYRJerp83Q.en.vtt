00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.090 

this<00:00:00.989> video<00:00:01.260> we're<00:00:01.380> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.560> take<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.740> look<00:00:01.949> at

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
this video we're going to take a look at

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.100 
this video we're going to take a look at
using<00:00:02.340> Pro<00:00:02.730> cutter<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.480> create<00:00:03.840> an<00:00:03.929> object

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
using Pro cutter to create an object

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.889 
using Pro cutter to create an object
that<00:00:04.830> we're<00:00:05.130> going<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.279> fragment<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.569> reason

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
that we're going to fragment the reason

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.750 
that we're going to fragment the reason
that<00:00:06.930> we<00:00:07.140> use<00:00:07.290> pro<00:00:07.589> cutter<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.460> it's

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
that we use pro cutter is that it's

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.690 
that we use pro cutter is that it's
going<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.059> slice<00:00:09.510> an<00:00:09.780> object<00:00:10.349> up<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:11.160> sphere

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
going to slice an object up the sphere

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.629 
going to slice an object up the sphere
and<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.509> going<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.809> create<00:00:13.290> fully<00:00:14.219> closed

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
and it's going to create fully closed

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.120 
and it's going to create fully closed
elements<00:00:15.299> out<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.780> them<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.770> really<00:00:16.980> good

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
elements out of them this is really good

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.349 
elements out of them this is really good
if<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.310> want<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> do<00:00:17.609> things<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:17.910> crumbling

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
if you want to do things like crumbling

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.609 
if you want to do things like crumbling
structures<00:00:19.580> concrete<00:00:20.580> posts<00:00:21.619> anything

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
structures concrete posts anything

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.099 
structures concrete posts anything
that's<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:23.300> realistic<00:00:24.300> solid<00:00:24.869> geometry

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
that's got realistic solid geometry

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.120 
that's got realistic solid geometry
let's<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.260> ahead<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.439> take<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.650> look<00:00:28.859> we've<00:00:29.099> got

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
let's go ahead and take a look we've got

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.460 
let's go ahead and take a look we've got
a<00:00:29.340> bunch<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.789> splines<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:31.019> now<00:00:31.289> each<00:00:31.439> one

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
a bunch of splines out here now each one

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.380 
a bunch of splines out here now each one
of<00:00:31.619> these<00:00:31.740> splines<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.640> actually<00:00:33.000> comes<00:00:33.210> with

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
of these splines is actually comes with

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.240 
of these splines is actually comes with
the<00:00:33.510> default<00:00:33.840> interpolation<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.590> six<00:00:34.920> we're

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the default interpolation of six we're

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.670 
the default interpolation of six we're
going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> see<00:00:35.579> why<00:00:35.760> that's<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.059> little<00:00:36.300> high

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
going to see why that's a little high

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
going to see why that's a little high
pro<00:00:37.680> cutter<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.000> add<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.690> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
pro cutter is going to add a lot of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.020 
pro cutter is going to add a lot of
extra<00:00:40.079> calculation<00:00:40.680> when<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.950> uses<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.550> I'm

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
extra calculation when it uses that I'm

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.160 
extra calculation when it uses that I'm
going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> go<00:00:42.329> ahead<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.510> select<00:00:42.750> all<00:00:43.020> those

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
going to go ahead and select all those

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.830 
going to go ahead and select all those
splines<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.800> extrude<00:00:44.190> them<00:00:44.539> make<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> nice

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
splines and extrude them make it nice

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.440 
splines and extrude them make it nice
and<00:00:45.870> far<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.879> lots<00:00:48.149> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and far you can see that we get lots of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.229 
and far you can see that we get lots of
extra<00:00:48.750> edges<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.059> what<00:00:51.059> that's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
extra edges in here and what that's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.430 
extra edges in here and what that's
going<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.020> cause<00:00:52.170> pro

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
going to do is that's going to cause pro

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.619 
going to do is that's going to cause pro
cutter<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.920> cut<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.399> slowly<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.510> what

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
cutter to cut really slowly so what

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.520 
cutter to cut really slowly so what
we're<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.110> use<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> little

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
we're going to do is use a little

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.639 
we're going to do is use a little
maxscript<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.940> selected<00:00:57.750> dot<00:00:57.930> steps<00:00:58.289> equals

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
maxscript it's selected dot steps equals

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
maxscript it's selected dot steps equals
one<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.100> that's<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> go<00:01:00.000> ahead<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
one and that's going to go ahead and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.200 
one and that's going to go ahead and
reduce<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.690> interpolation<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.090> what<00:01:03.090> we're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
reduce that interpolation and what we're

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.130 
reduce that interpolation and what we're
going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.570> we're<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> take<00:01:03.899> all

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
going to do is we're going to take all

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.950 
going to do is we're going to take all
these<00:01:04.260> extruded<00:01:05.100> splines<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.610> we've<00:01:05.700> got

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
these extruded splines that we've got

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.340 
these extruded splines that we've got
duplicate<00:01:06.960> them<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.860> we're<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
duplicate them and then we're going to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.810 
duplicate them and then we're going to
just<00:01:10.350> angle<00:01:10.740> them<00:01:10.830> around<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.549> we're<00:01:11.700> going

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
just angle them around and we're going

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.000 
just angle them around and we're going
to<00:01:11.880> look<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.360> our<00:01:12.479> projection<00:01:12.990> angle<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
to look at our projection angle this is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.140 
to look at our projection angle this is
the<00:01:14.130> kind<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> pattern<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.090> to

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the kind of the pattern that's going to

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.840 
the kind of the pattern that's going to
be<00:01:15.240> cut<00:01:15.509> through<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.840> sphere<00:01:16.759> from<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
be cut through that sphere from that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.719 
be cut through that sphere from that
side<00:01:18.210> while<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.590> sphere<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> be<00:01:20.520> cut

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
side while the sphere is going to be cut

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
side while the sphere is going to be cut
by<00:01:20.850> these<00:01:20.970> other<00:01:21.180> ones<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:22.020> ahead<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.320> move

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
by these other ones go ahead and move

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
by these other ones go ahead and move
him<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.580> check<00:01:24.420> them<00:01:24.540> again<00:01:24.750> from<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> side

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
him here check them again from the side

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.880 
him here check them again from the side
okay<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.250> looks<00:01:26.310> pretty<00:01:26.490> good<00:01:27.680> let's<00:01:28.680> take

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
okay it looks pretty good let's take

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.080 
okay it looks pretty good let's take
these<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.520> drag<00:01:30.119> them<00:01:30.270> over<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:32.090> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
these here drag them over and you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.460 
these here drag them over and you
remember<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> way<00:01:33.659> pro<00:01:33.960> cutter<00:01:34.229> works

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
remember that the way pro cutter works

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.289 
remember that the way pro cutter works
is<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.920> select<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.310> first<00:01:35.579> cutter<00:01:35.820> object

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
is you select your first cutter object

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.120 
is you select your first cutter object
you<00:01:36.960> say<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> want<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.409> create<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> pro<00:01:37.890> cutter

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you say you want to create a pro cutter

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.710 
you say you want to create a pro cutter
with<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.150> pick<00:01:39.329> your<00:01:39.479> stock

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
with that then you pick your stock

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.569 
with that then you pick your stock
object<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.409> thing<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.680> want<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> cut<00:01:41.100> we're

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
object the thing you want to cut we're

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.510 
object the thing you want to cut we're
going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> cut<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.090> sphere<00:01:42.390> 01<00:01:42.750> pick<00:01:43.350> him<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
going to cut that sphere 01 pick him you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280 
going to cut that sphere 01 pick him you
can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.390> goes<00:01:45.509> ahead<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.079> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
can see that it goes ahead and it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.139 
can see that it goes ahead and it
removes<00:01:46.680> part<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.250> mesh<00:01:47.549> what<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.000> need

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
removes part of that mesh what we need

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.679 
removes part of that mesh what we need
to<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> set<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.759> keep<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.790> stock<00:01:51.240> inside

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
to do is set the keep the stock inside

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.840 
to do is set the keep the stock inside
the<00:01:51.840> cutter<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.320> that'll<00:01:52.950> give<00:01:53.220> us<00:01:53.250> both<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the cutter and that'll give us both the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.289 
the cutter and that'll give us both the
outside<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.689> inside<00:01:55.399> portions<00:01:56.399> let's<00:01:57.149> just

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
outside and inside portions let's just

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.340 
outside and inside portions let's just
go<00:01:57.360> ahead<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.540> take<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.719> quick<00:01:57.990> look<00:01:58.170> at<00:01:58.320> what

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
go ahead and take a quick look at what

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.319 
go ahead and take a quick look at what
we<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.710> right<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:58.950> we've<00:01:59.399> got<00:01:59.579> just<00:01:59.850> one

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
we have right now we've got just one

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.789 
we have right now we've got just one
slice<00:02:00.719> through<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.350> put<00:02:01.469> an<00:02:01.560> edit

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
slice through there will put an edit

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.469 
slice through there will put an edit
poly<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.579> take<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> look<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
poly on it and take a look at the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.840 
poly on it and take a look at the
elements<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.040> see<00:02:05.280> from<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> back

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
elements so you can see from the back

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.499 
elements so you can see from the back
side<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> inside<00:02:07.160> this<00:02:08.160> element<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.209> fully

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
side on the inside this element is fully

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.609 
side on the inside this element is fully
closed

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
closed

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.199 
closed
just<00:02:10.769> move<00:02:10.950> them<00:02:11.099> out<00:02:11.220> here<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:11.970> see

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
just move them out here and you can see

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.649 
just move them out here and you can see
that<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.780> he's<00:02:13.290> left<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.739> fully<00:02:14.299> fully<00:02:15.299> closed

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
that and he's left a fully fully closed

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.920 
that and he's left a fully fully closed
remaining<00:02:16.200> mesh<00:02:16.440> as<00:02:16.590> well<00:02:17.659> this<00:02:18.659> gives<00:02:18.780> a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
remaining mesh as well this gives a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.229 
remaining mesh as well this gives a
really<00:02:19.049> nice<00:02:19.230> f<00:02:19.470> fragmenting<00:02:20.099> effect<00:02:20.580> that's

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
really nice f fragmenting effect that's

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.250 
really nice f fragmenting effect that's
why<00:02:21.360> we're<00:02:21.540> going<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.840> take<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.959> look<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.200> this

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
why we're going to take a look at this

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.130 
why we're going to take a look at this
method<00:02:22.790> go<00:02:23.790> ahead<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.060> unhide<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.810> then<00:02:24.989> what

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
method go ahead and unhide and then what

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.119 
method go ahead and unhide and then what
we're<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.409> do<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.590> pick<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.860> rest<00:02:26.010> of

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
we're going to do is pick the rest of

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.289 
we're going to do is pick the rest of
these<00:02:26.190> cutter<00:02:26.430> objects<00:02:26.879> we're<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:27.150> going<00:02:27.269> to

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
these cutter objects we're just going to

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.520 
these cutter objects we're just going to
go<00:02:27.390> ahead<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.599> multi<00:02:27.840> select<00:02:28.049> these<00:02:28.230> lines

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
go ahead and multi select these lines

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.710 
go ahead and multi select these lines
and<00:02:28.829> say<00:02:28.950> pick<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.849> we're<00:02:30.299> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.510> go<00:02:30.569> and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and say pick and we're going to go and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.940 
and say pick and we're going to go and
put<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.019> pause<00:02:31.319> well<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.829> actually

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
put you on pause well like I actually

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.699 
put you on pause well like I actually
calculates<00:02:32.909> this<00:02:33.090> okay<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.019> this<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.440> finished

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
calculates this okay so this is finished

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.319 
calculates this okay so this is finished
and<00:02:34.980> now<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.670> see<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:35.879> we<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.120> an

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
and now you can see that we have an

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.069 
and now you can see that we have an
object<00:02:36.720> here<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:38.000> very<00:02:39.000> cut<00:02:39.329> up<00:02:39.360> we<00:02:39.930> get

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
object here that is very cut up we get

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.170 
object here that is very cut up we get
all<00:02:40.290> different<00:02:40.620> kinds<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.920> cuts<00:02:41.159> in<00:02:41.310> there<00:02:41.519> we

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
all different kinds of cuts in there we

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.789 
all different kinds of cuts in there we
look<00:02:42.329> from<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.629> kind<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.930> top<00:02:43.170> or<00:02:43.500> that

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
look from the kind of the top or that

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.069 
look from the kind of the top or that
left<00:02:44.069> side<00:02:44.430> we<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.239> see<00:02:45.269> where<00:02:45.569> that<00:02:45.599> pattern

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
left side we can see where that pattern

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.650 
left side we can see where that pattern
was<00:02:46.579> anyway<00:02:47.579> what<00:02:47.609> we<00:02:47.940> want<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.239> now<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.420> we

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
was anyway what we want to do now is we

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.729 
was anyway what we want to do now is we
want<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.870> go<00:02:48.930> ahead<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.140> actually<00:02:49.230> cut<00:02:49.560> this

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
want to go ahead and actually cut this

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.220 
want to go ahead and actually cut this
up<00:02:49.980> or<00:02:50.340> fragment<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.120> up<00:02:51.299> we're<00:02:51.989> going<00:02:52.109> to<00:02:52.170> go

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
up or fragment this up we're going to go

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.890 
up or fragment this up we're going to go
ahead<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.500> jump<00:02:52.980> into<00:02:53.160> TP<00:02:53.700> create<00:02:54.629> a<00:02:54.660> rule

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
ahead and jump into TP create a rule

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.569 
ahead and jump into TP create a rule
we're<00:02:55.290> going<00:02:55.379> to<00:02:55.440> use<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> black<00:02:55.859> box<00:02:56.099> we<00:02:56.310> saved

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
we're going to use a black box we saved

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.240 
we're going to use a black box we saved
before<00:02:56.959> it's<00:02:57.959> under<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.349> test<00:02:58.650> two<00:02:58.859> it's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
before it's under the test two it's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.780 
before it's under the test two it's
called<00:02:59.489> a<00:02:59.579> fragment<00:03:00.390> with<00:03:00.480> light<00:03:00.690> and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
called a fragment with light and

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.710 
called a fragment with light and
fragment<00:03:02.790> with<00:03:02.879> light<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.239> gives<00:03:03.420> us<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.599> good

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
fragment with light just gives us a good

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.149 
fragment with light just gives us a good
starting<00:03:04.049> point<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.470> creates<00:03:04.739> these<00:03:04.920> two

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
starting point and creates these two

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.890 
starting point and creates these two
groups<00:03:05.370> for<00:03:05.700> us<00:03:05.819> we<00:03:06.269> can<00:03:06.420> go<00:03:06.510> ahead<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:06.659> cut

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
groups for us we can go ahead and cut

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.339 
groups for us we can go ahead and cut
that<00:03:07.109> paste<00:03:07.620> them<00:03:07.769> up<00:03:07.859> here<00:03:09.079> now<00:03:10.079> there's<00:03:10.230> some

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
that paste them up here now there's some

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.750 
that paste them up here now there's some
things<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:10.709> need<00:03:10.829> to<00:03:10.980> update<00:03:11.159> we<00:03:11.519> need<00:03:11.670> to

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
things that we need to update we need to

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.610 
things that we need to update we need to
go<00:03:11.849> into<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> bourne<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.810> object<00:03:13.170> particle

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
go into the bourne the object particle

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.220 
go into the bourne the object particle
and<00:03:13.799> pick<00:03:13.920> our<00:03:14.069> source<00:03:14.310> object<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:15.780> line<00:03:16.049> of

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and pick our source object this line of

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.710 
and pick our source object this line of
seven<00:03:16.650> as<00:03:16.859> he<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.489> he's<00:03:17.910> going<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.120> be<00:03:18.299> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
seven as he was he's going to be the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.520 
seven as he was he's going to be the
source<00:03:19.910> particle<00:03:20.910> group<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.900> he's<00:03:22.319> going<00:03:22.470> to

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
source particle group and he's going to

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.990 
source particle group and he's going to
be<00:03:22.620> instant<00:03:23.010> shape<00:03:23.280> then<00:03:23.609> we'll<00:03:23.730> go<00:03:23.819> ahead<00:03:23.910> and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
be instant shape then we'll go ahead and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.539 
be instant shape then we'll go ahead and
hide<00:03:24.239> him<00:03:24.590> now<00:03:25.590> what<00:03:25.739> we<00:03:25.829> also<00:03:25.950> want<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.430> is

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
hide him now what we also want to do is

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.000 
hide him now what we also want to do is
come<00:03:26.669> into<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.910> fragment<00:03:27.389> rule<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.349> adjust

come into the fragment rule and adjust

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.530 
come into the fragment rule and adjust
some<00:03:29.129> things<00:03:29.160> in<00:03:29.459> fragment<00:03:29.970> first<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.329> all<00:03:30.389> we

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
some things in fragment first of all we

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.289 
some things in fragment first of all we
don't<00:03:30.599> want<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> use<00:03:30.959> lights<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:32.030> then<00:03:33.030> what

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
don't want to use lights and then what

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.759 
don't want to use lights and then what
we<00:03:33.450> want<00:03:33.629> to<00:03:33.720> do<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.900> we<00:03:34.019> want<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.260> set<00:03:34.440> smooth

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
we want to do is we want to set smooth

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.500 
we want to do is we want to set smooth
and<00:03:34.980> distance<00:03:35.370> we're<00:03:35.879> going<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.060> set<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:36.359> to

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
and distance we're going to set this to

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.990 
and distance we're going to set this to
be<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.629> hundred<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.079> 80<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.590> 100<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.700> what

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
be a hundred and 80 and 100 and what

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.550 
be a hundred and 80 and 100 and what
this<00:03:39.180> will<00:03:39.239> do<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.810> will<00:03:39.870> say<00:03:40.199> okay

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
this will do is this will say okay

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.189 
this will do is this will say okay
you're<00:03:40.739> smoothing<00:03:41.160> angle<00:03:41.579> can<00:03:42.299> be<00:03:42.329> you<00:03:43.169> know

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
you're smoothing angle can be you know

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.250 
you're smoothing angle can be you know
180<00:03:44.040> degrees<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:45.150> can<00:03:45.329> cover<00:03:45.540> everything<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
180 degrees it can cover everything and

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.339 
180 degrees it can cover everything and
your<00:03:46.949> radius<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.549> be<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:47.699> hundred<00:03:47.910> percent<00:03:48.349> and

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
your radius can be a hundred percent and

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.539 
your radius can be a hundred percent and
what<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:49.680> will<00:03:49.799> do<00:03:49.919> is<00:03:49.949> this<00:03:50.160> will<00:03:50.220> kind<00:03:50.430> of

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
what this will do is this will kind of

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.000 
what this will do is this will kind of
force<00:03:50.910> each<00:03:51.150> element<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:52.139> end<00:03:52.319> up<00:03:52.500> being<00:03:52.889> his

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
force each element to end up being his

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.479 
force each element to end up being his
own<00:03:53.160> fragment<00:03:54.829> can't<00:03:55.829> really<00:03:56.010> see<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.250> right

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
own fragment can't really see it right

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.770 
own fragment can't really see it right
now<00:03:56.519> but<00:03:56.879> there's<00:03:57.060> some<00:03:57.180> other<00:03:57.299> issues<00:03:57.750> that

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
now but there's some other issues that

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.539 
now but there's some other issues that
we've<00:03:58.019> got<00:03:58.230> because<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:58.949> a<00:03:58.980> safe<00:03:59.280> black

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
we've got because this is a safe black

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.150 
we've got because this is a safe black
box<00:04:00.139> we'll<00:04:01.139> go<00:04:01.230> ahead<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.590> take<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.739> look<00:04:01.980> we

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
box we'll go ahead and take a look we

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.360 
box we'll go ahead and take a look we
come<00:04:02.370> down<00:04:02.579> into<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.910> fragment<00:04:03.329> shape<00:04:03.569> and

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
come down into the fragment shape and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.530 
come down into the fragment shape and
because<00:04:05.370> each<00:04:05.549> one<00:04:05.699> of<00:04:05.730> these<00:04:05.849> is<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.060> closed

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
because each one of these is a closed

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.839 
because each one of these is a closed
element<00:04:07.109> we<00:04:08.069> don't<00:04:08.190> really<00:04:08.519> want<00:04:08.699> any

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
element we don't really want any

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.309 
element we don't really want any
thickness<00:04:09.150> because<00:04:09.660> that's<00:04:09.840> actually<00:04:10.019> going

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
thickness because that's actually going

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.470 
thickness because that's actually going
to<00:04:10.410> create<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.680> shelled<00:04:11.099> object<00:04:11.970> it's<00:04:12.209> going<00:04:12.419> to

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
to create a shelled object it's going to

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.900 
to create a shelled object it's going to
it's<00:04:13.199> like<00:04:13.319> adding<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.680> shell<00:04:13.889> modifier<00:04:14.250> to

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
it's like adding a shell modifier to

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.340 
it's like adding a shell modifier to
something<00:04:15.209> that's<00:04:15.389> already<00:04:15.540> solid

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
something that's already solid

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.660 
something that's already solid
it's<00:04:17.470> good<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:17.709> going<00:04:17.860> to<00:04:17.920> make<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.280> kind

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
it's good just going to make it a kind

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.949 
it's good just going to make it a kind
of<00:04:18.730> a<00:04:18.790> hollow<00:04:19.030> object<00:04:19.540> with<00:04:19.660> a<00:04:19.690> little

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
of a hollow object with a little

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.960 
of a hollow object with a little
thickness<00:04:20.160> so<00:04:21.160> what<00:04:21.280> we<00:04:21.430> want<00:04:21.610> to<00:04:21.670> do<00:04:21.760> is<00:04:21.850> we

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
thickness so what we want to do is we

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.390 
thickness so what we want to do is we
want<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.120> say<00:04:22.270> exclude<00:04:22.720> closed<00:04:23.080> fragments<00:04:23.680> you

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
want to say exclude closed fragments you

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.220 
want to say exclude closed fragments you
can<00:04:24.520> see<00:04:24.670> that<00:04:24.700> update<00:04:25.150> changes<00:04:25.630> now<00:04:26.020> those

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
can see that update changes now those

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.840 
can see that update changes now those
actual<00:04:26.680> those<00:04:26.860> elements<00:04:27.250> because<00:04:27.700> they're

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
actual those elements because they're

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.370 
actual those elements because they're
already<00:04:28.000> closed<00:04:28.480> they're<00:04:29.050> just<00:04:29.230> going<00:04:29.320> to

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
already closed they're just going to

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.070 
already closed they're just going to
stay<00:04:29.740> one<00:04:30.040> solid<00:04:30.610> piece<00:04:30.790> of<00:04:30.970> mesh<00:04:31.300> just<00:04:31.930> as

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
stay one solid piece of mesh just as

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.650 
stay one solid piece of mesh just as
they<00:04:32.230> were<00:04:32.290> before<00:04:32.620> we<00:04:32.950> fragmented<00:04:33.550> them<00:04:33.660> but

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
they were before we fragmented them but

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.630 
they were before we fragmented them but
it<00:04:34.750> does<00:04:34.870> create<00:04:35.200> an<00:04:35.410> individual<00:04:36.160> particle

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
it does create an individual particle

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.020 
it does create an individual particle
per<00:04:37.030> element<00:04:38.640> something<00:04:39.640> else<00:04:39.790> we're<00:04:39.910> going

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
per element something else we're going

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.240 
per element something else we're going
to<00:04:40.090> remove<00:04:40.630> this<00:04:40.960> outside<00:04:41.680> edge<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:41.950> back

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
to remove this outside edge and back

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.400 
to remove this outside edge and back

side I material ID assignment because we

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.300 
side I material ID assignment because we
don't<00:04:44.620> want<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:46.000> override<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.450> actual

don't want to override the actual

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.860 
have a specific material ID and take a
look<00:04:57.070> at<00:04:57.160> pro<00:04:57.340> cutter<00:04:57.550> as<00:04:57.790> far<00:04:58.510> as<00:04:58.630> how<00:04:58.840> to

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
look at pro cutter as far as how to

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.990 
look at pro cutter as far as how to
apply<00:04:59.560> that<00:04:59.800> material<00:05:00.190> ID<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.640> inside<00:05:00.970> of

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
apply that material ID to the inside of

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.330 
apply that material ID to the inside of
those<00:05:01.150> cuts<00:05:01.450> and<00:05:01.930> last<00:05:02.770> but<00:05:02.830> not<00:05:02.980> least<00:05:03.040> we're

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
those cuts and last but not least we're

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.920 
those cuts and last but not least we're
going<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.520> change<00:05:03.730> our<00:05:04.000> remaining<00:05:04.450> shape<00:05:04.750> from

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
going to change our remaining shape from

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.290 
going to change our remaining shape from
solid<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.440> hollow<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.850> way<00:05:06.970> it's<00:05:07.150> not

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
solid to hollow and that way it's not

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.670 
solid to hollow and that way it's not
going<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.540> create<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.780> bunch<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.110> extra<00:05:08.380> funky

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
going to create a bunch of extra funky

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.610 
going to create a bunch of extra funky
looking<00:05:08.800> stuff<00:05:10.020> ok<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.260> then<00:05:11.320> what<00:05:11.470> we're

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
looking stuff ok and then what we're

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
looking stuff ok and then what we're
going<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.800> do<00:05:11.920> is<00:05:12.040> we're<00:05:12.190> actually<00:05:12.310> going<00:05:12.550> to

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
going to do is we're actually going to

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.750 
going to do is we're actually going to
animate<00:05:12.880> our<00:05:13.320> threshold<00:05:14.320> value<00:05:14.670> we're<00:05:15.670> just

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
animate our threshold value we're just

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.250 
animate our threshold value we're just
going<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:15.970> come<00:05:16.120> out<00:05:16.210> here<00:05:16.270> we'll<00:05:16.900> start<00:05:17.140> at

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
going to come out here we'll start at

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.220 
going to come out here we'll start at
frame<00:05:17.530> 20<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.830> we'll<00:05:20.950> set<00:05:21.130> a<00:05:21.160> key<00:05:21.460> there<00:05:21.700> for<00:05:21.940> a

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
frame 20 and we'll set a key there for a

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.960 
frame 20 and we'll set a key there for a
threshold<00:05:23.230> value<00:05:23.470> of<00:05:23.560> one<00:05:23.830> let's<00:05:24.490> go<00:05:24.700> up<00:05:24.790> to

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
threshold value of one let's go up to

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.800 
threshold value of one let's go up to
100<00:05:25.450> and<00:05:25.750> say<00:05:26.080> zero<00:05:27.180> see<00:05:28.180> that<00:05:28.330> automatically

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
100 and say zero see that automatically

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.530 
100 and say zero see that automatically
fragments<00:05:29.350> there<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:29.920> so<00:05:30.910> what<00:05:31.060> happens<00:05:31.390> is

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
fragments there and so what happens is

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.230 
fragments there and so what happens is
this<00:05:31.900> object<00:05:32.170> begins<00:05:32.590> and<00:05:33.130> he<00:05:33.550> breaks<00:05:33.820> apart

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
this object begins and he breaks apart

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.870 
this object begins and he breaks apart
what<00:05:34.990> you<00:05:35.080> see<00:05:35.320> there<00:05:35.560> is<00:05:35.710> the<00:05:36.010> completed

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
what you see there is the completed

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.100 
what you see there is the completed
elements<00:05:37.680> breaking<00:05:38.680> away<00:05:39.660> let's<00:05:40.660> take<00:05:40.810> a<00:05:40.840> look

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
elements breaking away let's take a look

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.810 
elements breaking away let's take a look
at<00:05:41.290> what<00:05:41.650> happens<00:05:42.040> if<00:05:42.280> we<00:05:42.460> did<00:05:42.760> have<00:05:44.820> because

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
at what happens if we did have because

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.000 
at what happens if we did have because
we<00:05:45.850> want<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.240> see<00:05:46.570> instead<00:05:47.200> of<00:05:47.350> exclude<00:05:47.740> close

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
we want to see instead of exclude close

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.310 
we want to see instead of exclude close
fragments<00:05:48.580> let's<00:05:48.700> turn<00:05:48.970> that<00:05:49.180> on<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.660> you<00:05:50.200> can

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
fragments let's turn that on and you can

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.900 
fragments let's turn that on and you can
see<00:05:50.470> it<00:05:50.590> gets<00:05:50.800> this<00:05:50.950> extra<00:05:51.370> edge<00:05:51.520> in<00:05:51.760> their

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
see it gets this extra edge in their

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.120 
see it gets this extra edge in their
kind<00:05:52.420> of<00:05:52.480> see<00:05:52.570> that<00:05:52.750> thickness<00:05:53.020> it's<00:05:53.710> creating

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
kind of see that thickness it's creating

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.020 
kind of see that thickness it's creating
a<00:05:54.220> hollowed-out<00:05:55.590> element<00:05:56.590> which<00:05:57.490> may<00:05:57.820> or<00:05:57.850> may

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
a hollowed-out element which may or may

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.640 
a hollowed-out element which may or may
not<00:05:58.060> be<00:05:58.240> desired<00:05:58.720> in<00:05:58.870> our<00:05:59.020> case<00:05:59.230> we<00:05:59.260> want<00:05:59.560> to

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
not be desired in our case we want to

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.980 
not be desired in our case we want to
exclude<00:05:59.950> closed<00:06:00.490> frags<00:06:00.820> so<00:06:01.570> that<00:06:01.720> it<00:06:01.780> only

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
exclude closed frags so that it only

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.510 
exclude closed frags so that it only
uses<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:03.130> elements<00:06:03.580> as<00:06:03.700> we<00:06:03.910> had<00:06:04.030> cut<00:06:04.270> them

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.230 

make<00:06:08.520> this<00:06:08.639> a<00:06:08.699> little<00:06:08.819> more<00:06:08.910> interesting

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
make this a little more interesting

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.760 
make this a little more interesting
really<00:06:09.660> easily<00:06:09.960> we<00:06:10.139> just<00:06:10.289> go<00:06:10.379> ahead<00:06:10.440> and<00:06:10.560> throw

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
really easily we just go ahead and throw

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.860 
really easily we just go ahead and throw
some<00:06:10.919> spin<00:06:11.340> on<00:06:11.370> them<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:13.129> drop<00:06:14.129> that<00:06:14.190> their

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
some spin on them and drop that their

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.790 
some spin on them and drop that their
spin<00:06:15.870> of<00:06:16.020> one<00:06:16.430> ninety<00:06:17.430> percent<00:06:17.550> variation<00:06:18.180> and

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
spin of one ninety percent variation and

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.219 
spin of one ninety percent variation and
so<00:06:19.800> we'll<00:06:19.979> see<00:06:20.460> as<00:06:20.729> these<00:06:21.419> pieces<00:06:21.659> come<00:06:21.960> flying

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
so we'll see as these pieces come flying

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.290 
so we'll see as these pieces come flying
out<00:06:22.520> they're<00:06:23.520> going<00:06:23.639> to<00:06:23.699> have<00:06:23.819> quite<00:06:24.060> a<00:06:24.150> bit<00:06:24.180> of

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
out they're going to have quite a bit of

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:32.830 
out they're going to have quite a bit of
spin<00:06:24.569> to<00:06:24.780> them<00:06:24.900> it's<00:06:25.139> probably<00:06:25.409> a<00:06:25.470> little<00:06:25.530> fast

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.779 

so<00:06:33.840> this<00:06:34.080> method<00:06:34.379> is<00:06:34.440> really<00:06:34.650> good<00:06:34.830> for<00:06:35.610> things

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
so this method is really good for things

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:38.659 
so this method is really good for things
like<00:06:35.879> I<00:06:36.330> think<00:06:36.629> we<00:06:36.720> said<00:06:37.009> buildings<00:06:38.009> or<00:06:38.460> big

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
like I think we said buildings or big

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.450 
like I think we said buildings or big
concrete<00:06:38.909> pillars<00:06:39.630> or<00:06:40.080> any<00:06:40.380> big<00:06:40.740> solid<00:06:41.250> heavy

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
concrete pillars or any big solid heavy

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.210 
concrete pillars or any big solid heavy
object<00:06:42.000> that<00:06:42.090> you<00:06:42.240> need<00:06:42.419> to<00:06:42.860> artistically<00:06:43.860> cut

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
object that you need to artistically cut

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.689 
object that you need to artistically cut
to<00:06:44.669> control<00:06:45.000> the<00:06:45.090> fragmenting<00:06:49.340> okay<00:06:50.340> we'll<00:06:50.610> go

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
to control the fragmenting okay we'll go

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.629 
to control the fragmenting okay we'll go
ahead<00:06:50.759> and<00:06:50.880> save<00:06:51.120> this<00:06:51.150> as<00:06:51.419> fragment<00:06:51.900> 5<00:06:52.639> end

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
ahead and save this as fragment 5 end

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.439 
ahead and save this as fragment 5 end
and<00:06:55.759> we're<00:06:56.759> going<00:06:56.880> to<00:06:56.909> go<00:06:57.030> ahead<00:06:57.060> and<00:06:57.180> save

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:57.449 
and we're going to go ahead and save

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.600 
and we're going to go ahead and save
this<00:06:57.479> as<00:06:59.180> frag<00:07:00.180> elements<00:07:01.310> and<00:07:02.310> we're<00:07:02.430> going<00:07:02.550> to

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
this as frag elements and we're going to

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.129 
this as frag elements and we're going to
save<00:07:02.759> that<00:07:02.789> as<00:07:03.090> black<00:07:03.330> box<00:07:03.569> here<00:07:03.780> in<00:07:03.870> the<00:07:03.930> test

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
save that as black box here in the test

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:10.940 
save that as black box here in the test
two<00:07:04.289> category<00:07:05.150> and<00:07:06.150> exist<00:07:07.050> to<00:07:07.139> create<00:07:07.940> okay
