00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.170
 well then continuing with 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.930
 the videogame collection we are going to start now with what would be the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.539
 overwhelming 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:09.489
 efe efe 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:11.489
 is what it would be called a lot 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:13.649
 let's start with this 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.379
 at a fixed rate of 12 380 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.880
 which corresponds to the year of 1977 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.539
 these things quote 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.560
 is this 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.119
 holland compact machine that designed datarisk 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.039
 at the end of the seventies 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.030
 to be able to this one 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.030
 a variety of games that certainly very limited 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.610
 for this time because there were caritas of 1600 plus however 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.090
 perfect with some versions 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.240
 economic 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.750
 percent that could be read acquire at that time 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.980
 how can I see that atari belonged to guarenas 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.350
 this means that turkey 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.050
 the company had been sold 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.000
 is the way how this works with clothes because it is very interesting or with 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.219
 the peculiarity 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.960
 is that you have two girls from here to one side kenley monaco world 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.789
 2 an original coupon this may contact you 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:15.110
 to the video 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.370
 what then round 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.390
 show the videogame those of coapa pÃ©rez 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.550
 join a palace binge 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.400
 and it is that you flinch 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.940
 crashed in the zra district 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.090
 the game 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.160
 the characteristic that they have experience of compostela 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.550
 because what the sound was not integrated sure that crime and asked 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.289
 but they brought a built-in speaker this console 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.330
 which generated something boston ma vocal proposed to sanction 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.450
 ban ki-moon 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.710
 rustic 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.970
 as for the games that we have included 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.870
 can be chaotic time of behavior and techniques comparison commented that it is very 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.840
 complicated 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.250
 the pastoral centers 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.170
 by the way as I also know what some variants are within what I am 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.909
 the bowl pin 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.840
 but they were also included per cent games like the projected 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.129
 finally give them the fish 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.479
 and mixed with him what is the legitimate pride 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.519
 we have a technical control and that has 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.059
 I explained to him also it will not serve to play him the cuencano 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.060
 as we can see it is practically a control 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.929
 certainly there is 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.559
 percent 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.709
 on the stage where he is 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.079
 embedded in our console 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.430
 quest that we control so we have clear what to do respect the one that starts the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.219
 game 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.759
 we have by what effects the mode that the reader of the 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.909
 the segob remembered quique bouquets 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.980
 the options that indicate that the difficulty and our power button 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:56.249
 this is the current cost left in me are other codes 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.089
 come peace to obama small demonstration 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.349
 how it works 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.169
 I could lower the proper tone of recapte people can play with one with 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.279
 the hand although I can give you a small demonstration 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.350
 locke the 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.659
 min the game of times 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.379
 Beijing 10 reception project 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.569
 picture 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.239
 does it move 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.639
 from side to side ban ki-moon from the other side 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.959
 yes you can you can see it very imaginatively 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.399
 cuba vane that would push counter 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.399
 we do not have a quota please 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:38.219
 and there it is 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.999
 6 cearÃ¡ 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:42.999
 and examples of balls size reduced in size 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.109
 acz 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.199
 I believe that rectal cancer therapy 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.199
 in effect the camera to be able 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:56.510
 corp route of the paddock villasana was the proper for the time that we got bored 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:57.519
 of the rocket 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:58.829
 dt the goal 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:03:59.940
 we can change 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.999
 with mode versus 80 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.649
 p we change towards the cogote we close 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.299
 According to our 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.659
 our 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.369
 the projection 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:16.289
 here we can see several repeat butler 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.059
 percent 

00:04:18.059 --> 00:04:19.659
 not only 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.239
 question to follow 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.930
 x handicapped let's go for more 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.350
 as a group cohen 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.539
 I believe patent 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.539
 minerva mouth form 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.969
 this new strategic project 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.969
 the third classic game of 20 cars 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.509
 it's nothing out of the ordinary 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.539
 flanking half efecom 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.309
 in my calculations now kick-ass 

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:49.730
 ipc of it 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.789
 now as an electrical technician 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.620
 until it finish 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.590
 the beginning minimum of the flow the network 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.590
 is when the executive pines game is over 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.159
