00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
in the whole scale and this is really a

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.920 
in the whole scale and this is really a
neat<00:02:21.730> way<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.360> get<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.690> off<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
neat way to kind of get this off the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.050 
neat way to kind of get this off the
ground<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.620> what<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.950> do<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.130> just<00:02:24.580> play<00:02:24.730> it

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
ground and what you do you just play it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:03:03.500 
ground and what you do you just play it
the<00:02:25.210> way<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.420> see<00:02:25.720> it<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.280> also<00:02:27.280> an<00:02:27.430> example

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.880 

so<00:03:04.510> this<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:04.870> what<00:03:05.050> you<00:03:05.200> could<00:03:05.350> do<00:03:05.470> with<00:03:05.500> the

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
so this is what you could do with the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.550 
so this is what you could do with the
soundtrack<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.880> then<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.960> can<00:03:08.110> kind<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.440> get

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
soundtrack and then you can kind of get

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.250 
soundtrack and then you can kind of get
a<00:03:08.590> feel<00:03:08.950> what<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.400> all<00:03:09.580> about

would tug the first aids no time the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.520 
would tug the first aids no time the
second<00:05:06.310> slur<00:05:06.639> the<00:05:06.970> third<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.110> comes<00:05:08.349> out

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
second slur the third and it comes out

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:16.990 
second slur the third and it comes out
like<00:05:08.770> this

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.580
