00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
there are very clear sex differences in

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.169 
there are very clear sex differences in
the<00:00:05.580> brain<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:07.460> we<00:00:08.460> see<00:00:08.670> these<00:00:08.820> differences

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
the brain and we see these differences

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.959 
the brain and we see these differences
right<00:00:09.660> from<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.559> birth<00:00:10.830> some<00:00:11.370> people<00:00:11.639> wonder

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
right from from birth some people wonder

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.940 
right from from birth some people wonder
whether<00:00:12.120> these<00:00:12.360> differences<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.440> size<00:00:13.740> of

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the child's psychological development

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.990 
the child's psychological development
and<00:00:21.750> certainly<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.859> know<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.220> girls<00:00:23.490> talk

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
and certainly we know that girls talk

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.849 
and certainly we know that girls talk
earlier<00:00:24.539> than<00:00:24.720> boys<00:00:24.930> their<00:00:25.350> language<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
earlier than boys their language is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.250 
earlier than boys their language is
developing<00:00:26.340> faster<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.630> regions<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
developing faster and the regions of the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.529 
developing faster and the regions of the
brain<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.859> involved<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.490> language<00:00:29.730> are

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
brain that are involved in language are

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.470 
brain that are involved in language are
larger<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.380> females<00:00:31.830> than<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.099> males<00:00:32.480> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
larger in females than in males the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.350 
larger in females than in males the
finding<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.559> amygdala<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.489> larger<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
finding that the amygdala is larger in

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.459 
finding that the amygdala is larger in
boys<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.410> interesting<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.480> in<00:00:39.480> boys<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
boys is interesting because in boys and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.040 
boys is interesting because in boys and
girls<00:00:40.950> social<00:00:41.760> development<00:00:42.329> their

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
girls social development their

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.959 
girls social development their
understanding<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> other<00:00:44.040> people's<00:00:44.129> emotions

understanding of other people's emotions

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.260 
understanding of other people's emotions
girls<00:00:45.780> seem<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.170> develop<00:00:46.800> faster<00:00:47.610> their

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
girls seem to develop faster their

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.709 
girls seem to develop faster their
empathy<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.989> better<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.680> average<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.879> this

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
empathy is better on average and this

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.540 
empathy is better on average and this
may<00:00:51.960> well<00:00:52.140> relate<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.010> difference<00:00:53.370> in

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
may well relate to this difference in

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.029 
may well relate to this difference in
the<00:00:53.579> size<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> amygdala<00:00:54.780> our<00:00:55.469> research

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the size of the amygdala our research

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
the size of the amygdala our research
has<00:00:56.280> been<00:00:56.520> looking<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.000> whether<00:00:57.210> children<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
has been looking at whether children and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.760 
has been looking at whether children and
indeed<00:00:59.010> adults<00:00:59.550> with<00:00:59.760> autism<00:01:00.109> might<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.469> an

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
indeed adults with autism might have an

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.390 
indeed adults with autism might have an
extreme<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> male<00:01:03.030> brain<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> autism<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
extreme of the male brain so autism is a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640 
extreme of the male brain so autism is a
developmental<00:01:05.810> condition<00:01:06.810> where<00:01:07.619> people

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
developmental condition where people

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.020 
developmental condition where people
have<00:01:08.130> difficulty<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.820> developing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
have difficulty in developing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.590 
have difficulty in developing
friendships<00:01:09.990> relationships<00:01:11.600> communication

but<00:01:13.229> where<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.500> also<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:14.070> very<00:01:14.100> focused

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
but where they also get very focused

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.460 
but where they also get very focused
sometimes<00:01:16.200> called<00:01:16.729> obsessional<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.470> we've

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
sometimes called obsessional and we've

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
sometimes called obsessional and we've
been<00:01:19.650> interested<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.729> whether<00:01:21.090> the

been interested to see whether the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.980 
been interested to see whether the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
structure of the autistic brain might be

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.429 
structure of the autistic brain might be
an<00:01:25.259> extreme<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.189> what<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.990> typical

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
an extreme of what we see in the typical

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.980 
an extreme of what we see in the typical
male<00:01:28.680> when<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> compare<00:01:30.119> groups<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.630> children

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990

with autism and without autism children

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.160 
with autism and without autism children
with<00:01:34.530> autism<00:01:34.700> show<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:36.060> faster<00:01:36.900> brain

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
with autism show that faster brain

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.590 
with autism show that faster brain
development<00:01:37.970> sometimes<00:01:38.970> thought<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.240> as<00:01:39.479> an

development sometimes thought of as an

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.499 
development sometimes thought of as an
overgrowth<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> early<00:01:40.950> years<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:42.329> when

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
overgrowth in the early years and when

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.120 
overgrowth in the early years and when
you<00:01:42.600> actually<00:01:42.780> compare<00:01:43.320> different<00:01:43.680> parts<00:01:44.040> of

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you actually compare different parts of

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.030 
you actually compare different parts of
the<00:01:44.280> brain<00:01:44.689> some<00:01:45.689> structures<00:01:46.290> fit<00:01:46.710> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the brain some structures fit this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.330 
the brain some structures fit this
extreme<00:01:47.640> male<00:01:48.270> pattern<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> amygdala

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
extreme male pattern so the amygdala

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.730 
extreme male pattern so the amygdala
which<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.700> larger<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.570> typical<00:01:52.110> male<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
which is larger in a typical male is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.850 
which is larger in a typical male is
even<00:01:53.340> larger<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.149> child<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.630> autism<00:01:54.860> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
child with autism but we're also looking

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.100 
child with autism but we're also looking
at<00:02:03.930> these<00:02:04.110> patterns<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:06.479> terms<00:02:06.960> of

terms<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.400> language<00:02:22.819> well<00:02:23.209> then<00:02:23.390> it's<00:02:23.569> very

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
terms of language well then it's very

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.900 
terms of language well then it's very
clear<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.140> children<00:02:24.709> with<00:02:24.830> autism<00:02:24.910> are

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
clear that children with autism are

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.000 
clear that children with autism are
developing<00:02:26.599> social<00:02:26.959> relationships<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
developing social relationships and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.280 
developing social relationships and
language<00:02:28.580> even<00:02:28.940> more<00:02:29.270> slowly<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
language even more slowly so in that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.830 
language even more slowly so in that
respect<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.980> does<00:02:31.160> seem<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.520> fit<00:02:31.760> some<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.720> the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
think biology and culture interact to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.270 
think biology and culture interact to
create<00:03:25.760> these<00:03:25.970> sex<00:03:26.269> differences<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.920> I'm<00:03:28.040> not

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
create these sex differences so I'm not

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.720 
create these sex differences so I'm not
a<00:03:28.549> strong<00:03:29.209> biological<00:03:29.769> determinist<00:03:30.769> but

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
a strong biological determinist but

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.110 
a strong biological determinist but
neither<00:03:31.940> am<00:03:32.150> i<00:03:32.299> a<00:03:32.329> strong<00:03:32.840> cultural<00:03:33.680> or<00:03:34.070> social

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
neither am i a strong cultural or social

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.729 
neither am i a strong cultural or social
determinant<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.329> think<00:03:35.540> there's<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.780> mix<00:03:36.049> that

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
determinant I think there's a mix that

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.190 
determinant I think there's a mix that
comes<00:03:36.980> together<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.549> create<00:03:37.730> them<00:03:38.090> there<00:03:39.079> are

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
comes together to create them there are

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.870 
comes together to create them there are
some<00:03:39.380> people<00:03:39.560> who<00:03:39.799> would<00:03:39.890> argue<00:03:40.280> just<00:03:40.310> for

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
some people who would argue just for

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.449 
some people who would argue just for
biology<00:03:41.390> or<00:03:41.570> just<00:03:41.870> for<00:03:42.109> culture<00:03:42.560> but<00:03:43.190> I<00:03:43.250> think

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
biology or just for culture but I think

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.310 
biology or just for culture but I think
the<00:03:43.579> moderate<00:03:44.030> position<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.840> recognize

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
the moderate position is to recognize

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.530 
the moderate position is to recognize
that<00:03:45.350> both<00:03:45.709> are<00:03:45.950> at<00:03:46.040> work<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.519> think<00:03:47.150> there's<00:03:47.480> a

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
that both are at work I think there's a

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.840 
that both are at work I think there's a
responsibility<00:03:47.950> for<00:03:48.950> people<00:03:49.160> who<00:03:49.519> look<00:03:49.730> at

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
responsibility for people who look at

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.090 
responsibility for people who look at
sex<00:03:50.120> differences<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:51.410> do<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:51.769> in<00:03:51.920> a<00:03:51.980> very

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
sex differences to do so in a very

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.750 
sex differences to do so in a very
careful<00:03:52.720> evidence-based<00:03:53.720> way<00:03:54.459> it's<00:03:55.459> very

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
careful evidence-based way it's very

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.170 
careful evidence-based way it's very
easy<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:56.239> make<00:03:57.069> sweeping<00:03:58.069> statements<00:03:58.670> about

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
easy to make sweeping statements about

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.420 
easy to make sweeping statements about
groups<00:03:59.720> of<00:03:59.870> people<00:04:00.519> including<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:02.450> two<00:04:02.630> sexes

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
groups of people including the two sexes

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.080 
groups of people including the two sexes
which<00:04:04.430> could<00:04:04.850> easily<00:04:05.480> become<00:04:06.940> forms<00:04:07.940> of

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
which could easily become forms of

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.110 
which could easily become forms of
discrimination<00:04:08.359> or<00:04:09.760> generalizations<00:04:10.760> which

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
discrimination or generalizations which

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.949 
discrimination or generalizations which
simply<00:04:11.720> don't<00:04:11.930> apply<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.910> research<00:04:14.720> in

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
simply don't apply and so research in

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.199 
simply don't apply and so research in
this<00:04:15.079> area<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.500> think<00:04:15.650> can<00:04:16.160> proceed<00:04:16.700> but<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.120> has

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
this area I think can proceed but it has

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.810 
this area I think can proceed but it has
to<00:04:17.359> be<00:04:17.389> very<00:04:18.229> responsible<00:04:18.889> it<00:04:19.250> has<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.519> be<00:04:19.640> done

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
to be very responsible it has to be done

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.190 
to be very responsible it has to be done
in<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.060> responsible<00:04:20.750> fashion

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
in the responsible fashion

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.550 
in the responsible fashion
so<00:04:21.830> not<00:04:22.010> claiming<00:04:22.430> more<00:04:22.820> than<00:04:23.060> can<00:04:23.390> be

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
so not claiming more than can be

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.030 
so not claiming more than can be
reasonably<00:04:24.560> claimed

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
reasonably claimed

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.820 
reasonably claimed
on<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.190> basis<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.640> evidence
