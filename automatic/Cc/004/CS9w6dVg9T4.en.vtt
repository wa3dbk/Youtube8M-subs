that idea that if they see themselves in
a<00:00:36.579> photo<00:00:37.000> on<00:00:37.210> a<00:00:37.239> wall<00:00:37.510> whether<00:00:37.960> it's<00:00:38.170> in<00:00:38.530> a

family shot or them on their own it has

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.380 
family shot or them on their own it has
the<00:00:41.050> power<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.530> make<00:00:42.100> them<00:00:42.399> feel<00:00:42.730> really<00:00:43.030> good

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
the power to make them feel really good

about<00:00:43.450> themselves

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.930 

it's<00:00:58.090> about<00:00:58.390> really<00:00:58.990> capturing<00:00:59.530> that<00:01:00.220> child's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
it's about really capturing that child's

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.570 
it's about really capturing that child's
uniqueness<00:01:01.810> and<00:01:02.020> their<00:01:02.560> personality<00:01:03.310> I<00:01:03.340> think

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
uniqueness and their personality I think

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.790 
uniqueness and their personality I think

difference<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.789> our<00:02:09.910> work<00:02:10.090> it's<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.720> very

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
difference in our work it's a very

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.380 
difference in our work it's a very
simple<00:02:11.680> style<00:02:12.040> which<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.550> probably<00:02:13.270> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
simple style which is probably the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:28.850 
simple style which is probably the
beauty<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:14.020> really

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.880 

my<00:02:29.860> dog

my dog

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.260 
my dog
I<00:02:35.860> think<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.100> whole<00:02:37.370> experience<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:38.090> having

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
I think that whole experience of having

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.440 
I think that whole experience of having
a<00:02:38.450> shoot<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:39.050> is<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.860> fun<00:02:40.280> experience<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.970> do<00:02:41.120> so

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
a shoot to is a fun experience to do so

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.699 
a shoot to is a fun experience to do so
think<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.810> what<00:02:42.020> do<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.200> do<00:02:42.319> as<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.470> family

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
think of what do you do as a family

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.320 
think of what do you do as a family
these<00:02:43.040> days<00:02:43.280> whether<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:43.790> go<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.209> beach

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
these days whether you go to the beach

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.470 
these days whether you go to the beach
together<00:02:44.630> or<00:02:45.020> play<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> board<00:02:45.709> game<00:02:45.860> or<00:02:46.459> go<00:02:47.270> for

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
together or play a board game or go for

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.220 
together or play a board game or go for
a<00:02:47.510> bike<00:02:47.660> ride

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
a bike ride

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.949 
a bike ride
having<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.160> family<00:02:49.340> shoot<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:50.030> also<00:02:50.510> another

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
having a family shoot is also another

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.500 
having a family shoot is also another
experience<00:02:51.320> because<00:02:51.740> it's<00:02:51.890> really<00:02:52.190> fun<00:02:52.670> it's

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
experience because it's really fun it's

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.480 
experience because it's really fun it's
quick<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.110> there's<00:02:54.290> no<00:02:54.380> there's<00:02:54.680> no<00:02:54.709> time<00:02:55.010> to
