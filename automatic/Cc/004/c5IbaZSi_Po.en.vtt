talking about and most likely your fog
is<00:01:00.420> checked<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:02.129> what<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> wanna<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.270> to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
is checked so what you wanna do is to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.100 
is checked so what you wanna do is to
remove<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.439> fog<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:05.549> wanna<00:01:05.700> blow<00:01:06.210> down<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
remove the fog you wanna blow down the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.420 
remove the fog you wanna blow down the
tree<00:01:07.500> detail<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.659> way<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> zero<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.560> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
tree detail all the way to zero and the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.020 
tree detail all the way to zero and the
grass<00:01:11.670> level<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.780> zero<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.700> main

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
grass level to zero that is the main

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.980 
grass level to zero that is the main
reason<00:01:15.140> why<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.439> computer<00:01:16.770> lags<00:01:17.220> it's

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
reason why your computer lags it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.249 
reason why your computer lags it's
because<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> grass<00:01:19.799> level<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:21.509> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
because of the grass level and if you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.670 
because of the grass level and if you
have<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> super<00:01:23.070> sonic<00:01:23.909> awesome<00:01:24.680> supercomputer

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
have a super sonic awesome supercomputer

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
have a super sonic awesome supercomputer
what<00:01:25.799> I'm<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> call<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.630> boost

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
what I'm going to call it you can boost

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.840 
what I'm going to call it you can boost
it<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> maximum<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.520> think

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it up to the maximum but I don't think

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.230 
it up to the maximum but I don't think
that's<00:01:30.060> gonna<00:01:30.240> work<00:01:30.600> at<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.920> guys
