the<00:00:19.780> thing<00:00:19.960> about<00:00:19.990> fragrance<00:00:20.620> is<00:00:20.830> you<00:00:21.250> have<00:00:21.430> to

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
the thing about fragrance is you have to

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.180 
the thing about fragrance is you have to
try<00:00:21.790> it<00:00:21.850> you<00:00:22.090> have<00:00:22.240> to<00:00:22.330> put<00:00:22.480> it<00:00:22.570> on<00:00:22.630> your<00:00:22.780> skin

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.750 
right grints really affects how you feel
and<00:00:26.560> I<00:00:26.890> think<00:00:26.920> it's<00:00:27.220> one<00:00:27.370> of<00:00:27.400> those<00:00:27.550> I<00:00:27.730> think

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
and I think it's one of those I think

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.160 
and I think it's one of those I think
it's<00:00:28.030> probably<00:00:28.180> one<00:00:28.330> of<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.510> worst<00:00:28.660> allergies

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
it's probably one of the worst allergies

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.630 
it's probably one of the worst allergies
to<00:00:29.320> have<00:00:29.440> I<00:00:29.560> mean<00:00:29.740> apart<00:00:30.010> from<00:00:30.100> being<00:00:30.370> allergic

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
to have I mean apart from being allergic

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.220 
to have I mean apart from being allergic
to<00:00:30.820> like<00:00:31.000> nuts<00:00:31.300> and<00:00:31.510> seafood

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
to like nuts and seafood

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.770 
to like nuts and seafood
if<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:32.890> can't<00:00:33.160> wear<00:00:33.309> fragrance<00:00:33.730> I<00:00:33.879> think<00:00:34.149> it

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
if you can't wear fragrance I think it

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.389 
if you can't wear fragrance I think it
just<00:00:34.960> kind<00:00:35.109> of<00:00:35.320> takes<00:00:35.530> away<00:00:35.649> that<00:00:35.920> dimension

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
just kind of takes away that dimension

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.160 
just kind of takes away that dimension
from<00:00:36.519> life<00:00:36.760> like<00:00:36.999> its<00:00:37.179> kind<00:00:37.329> of<00:00:37.539> dramatic<00:00:38.050> to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
from life like its kind of dramatic to

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.439 
from life like its kind of dramatic to
