00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
I am Rob Pattinson in college I hadn't

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.080 
I am Rob Pattinson in college I hadn't
read<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.010> books<00:00:14.190> before<00:00:14.520> so<00:00:14.639> that's<00:00:14.760> not<00:00:14.879> like

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
read the books before so that's not like

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.029 
read the books before so that's not like
I<00:00:15.299> had<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> an<00:00:16.049> opinion<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.470> mean<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.650> had<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.800> just

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
I had a an opinion I mean I had to just

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.460 
I had a an opinion I mean I had to just
formulate<00:00:17.610> my<00:00:17.730> own<00:00:17.820> idea<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.210> who<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> guy<00:00:19.439> is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
formulate my own idea of who the guy is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.189 
formulate my own idea of who the guy is
anyway<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.099> guess<00:00:21.089> sometimes<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.019> little

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
anyway I guess sometimes it's a little

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.279 
anyway I guess sometimes it's a little
bit<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.439> pressure<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.669> mean<00:00:24.169> there's<00:00:25.169> no

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
bit more pressure but I mean there's no

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.249 
bit more pressure but I mean there's no
point<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.710> acknowledging<00:00:26.839> what<00:00:27.839> other<00:00:27.990> people

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
point in acknowledging what other people

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.700 
point in acknowledging what other people
really<00:00:29.009> think<00:00:29.249> about<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.539> know<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.589> only

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
really think about it you know the only

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.410 
really think about it you know the only
thing<00:00:31.829> you<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.220> try<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.460> find<00:00:32.790> some

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
thing you can do is try and find some

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.049 
thing you can do is try and find some
element<00:00:33.810> of<00:00:33.870> truth<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.770> yourself<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.520> guess<00:00:35.699> and

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
element of truth to yourself I guess and

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.939 
element of truth to yourself I guess and
then<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.260> start<00:00:37.500> thinking<00:00:37.680> about<00:00:37.710> what

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
then if you start thinking about what

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.490 
then if you start thinking about what
all<00:00:38.039> the<00:00:38.100> fans<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.969> thinking<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:40.050> mean

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
all the fans want and thinking I mean
