00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.920
 tan 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.920
 tee 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:25.840
 We won Japan in a 3-0 match against Japan and Korea against August 10, but we will explain the first goal of Japan 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:32.320
 It is such a form that the situation where the first goal in Japan was born 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:39.699
 There are 4 players who will score points with this goal The first player is the end player 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.060
 The second player was Hasebe, the third was Lee and the fourth was a goal . 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.890
 I 'm Kagawa 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.360
 so 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:51.579
 The situation when entering is such a situation, but the end politics takes the ball in the high position 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.850
 Is three dark I play shake at the Endo players after took the ne ball is at that time 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.309
 Ne 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:01.629
 It is very pressured, but here the player is this diagonal 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.880
 I run vertically at an angle. This is a very good line in this column . Good timing 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.930
 so 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.760
 Hasebe tried to receive at here Hasebe by running 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.780
 It is this center back 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:17.520
 Hasebe thinks that this center back will come out at an early timing 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:22.680
 I 'm going to pressure, when I made a big space in front of this goal 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:27.210
 If it is normal, it takes Endo player pressure, so the quality and anti 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.690
 I would like to put it out vertically, but Hasebe has made a big space here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.250
 The 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:38.450
 Lee has an effect on the space there 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:43.550
 At that time, Endo does not give out to Hasebe, but the central area is the most dangerous 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:47.130
 You can get a pass on this Lee athlete road. This is Endo's share of players 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.240
 And I can not do it without the height of technology 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.950
 Tame here and put a beat and sharp path 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.159
 I will give Lee a pass for being the most dangerous 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.600
 Lee is here with one touch 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:05.780
 Support a good angle and do You're a good distance returns the ball was in the back 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.840
 Kagawa and the ball will enter there 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.920
 Oh dear 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.760
 The pressure comes, but Kagawa has entered the first control a little underfoot 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.560
 It will be a bit cramped situation, but there 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:25.440
 I'm such place as his most wonderful I have thought, but it is the mistakes 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.860
 Fumie It is the ability to cover I went to the feet, but immediately 2 touch eyes firmly of their own 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.240
 Control the ball to where 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:37.010
 You move the ball to the opponent finally and fight the opponent 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:41.980
 You decide just shoot Te he chopsticks but its mistakes in reverse 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:45.500
 It is very high that the ability of recovery after a certain extent of feint is Kaga 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:50.720
 In that sense this goal 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.130
 Endo player's pass The breadth of this vision and this was because Hasebe's this running 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.950
 You have a big space 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:01.200
 And p fabric uses the space at the end and the goal in the individual skill of Kagawa player and very much 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:06.650
 These four people work well together 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.650
 I think it is a wonderful goal that was born using 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.190
 Yeah yeah yeah
