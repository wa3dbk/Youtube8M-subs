and<00:00:22.850> we<00:00:23.850> didn't<00:00:24.060> do<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> lot<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.480> prep<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.960> this

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
and we didn't do a lot of prep for this

it's angle about 45 degrees off to the

well<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:34.430> had<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> lot<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.120> guessing

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
well so I had to do a lot of guessing

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.080 
well so I had to do a lot of guessing
about<00:00:36.660> where<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> put<00:00:37.649> my<00:00:37.680> airplane<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.790> that

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
about where to put my airplane so that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.299 
nice smooth day so all of the relative
motion<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.230> most<00:00:49.620> likely<00:00:49.890> me

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.450 
days when I flew in the Navy formation
flying<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> way<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> life<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.980> that's<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
flying was a way of life and that's a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340 
flying was a way of life and that's a
skill<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> don't<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.329> he<00:01:00.449> ever<00:01:00.480> forget<00:01:01.050> but

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
skill I don't think he ever forget but

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.969 
skill I don't think he ever forget but
you<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:01.859> rusty<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.650> you're<00:01:04.650> seeing

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you get rusty at it and so you're seeing

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:15.470 
you get rusty at it and so you're seeing
the<00:01:05.220> effect<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.150> rust

our plan is to keep the Earth speed down

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.230 
our plan is to keep the Earth speed down

that's the reason his airplane looks

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.800 
that's the reason his airplane looks

we<00:02:29.290> parked<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.800> cloud<00:02:30.160> up<00:02:30.430> there<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:30.970> we

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
we parked that cloud up there so we

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.790 
we parked that cloud up there so we
didn't<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.780> look<00:02:31.960> into<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.410> bright<00:02:32.650> Sun

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
now we're on the base leg we're still

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.210 
now we're on the base leg we're still
descending

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.640

you'll see that off to the left as we're

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.890 
you'll see that off to the left as we're
flying<00:02:46.590> down<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.250> runway<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.570> there<00:02:48.810> are

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
flying down the runway and there are

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.140 
flying down the runway and there are
hills<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.560> north<00:02:49.680> we'll<00:02:50.220> see<00:02:50.460> those<00:02:50.700> as<00:02:50.970> we

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
hills to the north we'll see those as we

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.089 
hills to the north we'll see those as we
fly<00:02:51.420> by

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:06.430 

there's<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:59.000> hills<00:02:59.180> coming<00:02:59.930> into<00:03:00.110> view

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.280 

now<00:03:06.920> we're<00:03:07.220> lined<00:03:07.490> up<00:03:07.730> with<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:07.970> runway

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
now we're lined up with a runway

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.020 
now we're lined up with a runway
there's<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:11.129> four-lane

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
there's the four-lane

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.810 
there's the four-lane
we<00:03:13.540> brief<00:03:13.810> for<00:03:14.140> Brad<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.410> go<00:03:14.710> to<00:03:14.770> full<00:03:15.550> power

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
we brief for Brad to go to full power

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.820 
we brief for Brad to go to full power
and<00:03:16.240> we're<00:03:16.630> going<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.840> both<00:03:17.110> do<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.590> at<00:03:17.740> the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
and we're going to both do that at the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:26.020 
and we're going to both do that at the
same<00:03:18.100> time

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.500 

there<00:03:26.510> he<00:03:26.840> goes<00:03:27.050> full<00:03:27.560> power<00:03:27.830> me<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.510> his

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
there he goes full power me to his

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.650 
there he goes full power me to his
engines<00:03:29.990> a<00:03:30.110> lot<00:03:30.260> stronger<00:03:30.560> than<00:03:30.830> mine<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:32.390> this

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
engines a lot stronger than mine so this

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.930 
engines a lot stronger than mine so this
will<00:03:32.810> get<00:03:32.930> them<00:03:33.050> get<00:03:33.620> us<00:03:33.740> some<00:03:33.950> separation<00:03:34.640> so

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
will get them get us some separation so

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.170 
will get them get us some separation so
that<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:35.240> can<00:03:35.420> enter<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.840> landing<00:03:36.260> pattern<00:03:36.500> I

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
that we can enter the landing pattern I

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.680 
that we can enter the landing pattern I
just<00:03:38.180> can't<00:03:38.420> keep<00:03:38.569> up<00:03:38.780> with<00:03:39.020> them

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.740 

here's<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.410> still<00:03:43.160> that<00:03:43.400> we<00:03:43.550> took<00:03:43.760> a<00:03:44.360> year<00:03:44.720> to

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
here's a still that we took a year to

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.410 
here's a still that we took a year to
ago<00:03:45.200> while<00:03:45.470> we<00:03:45.590> were<00:03:45.710> flying<00:03:45.860> formation<00:03:46.490> you

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
ago while we were flying formation you

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.390 
ago while we were flying formation you
can<00:03:47.570> see<00:03:47.780> both<00:03:47.990> airplanes<00:03:48.470> are<00:03:48.800> pretty<00:03:49.280> much

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
can see both airplanes are pretty much

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.089 
can see both airplanes are pretty much
identical

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.160

and now this isn't interesting picture
there's<00:03:55.379> actually<00:03:55.829> two<00:03:56.040> airplanes<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.700> this

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
there's actually two airplanes in this

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.309 
there's actually two airplanes in this
picture<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.359> you<00:03:57.389> look<00:03:57.659> carefully<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.230> can

see two sets the landing gear hanging
down<00:04:00.510> there<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.790> I'm<00:04:02.939> tucked<00:04:03.239> in<00:04:03.420> behind<00:04:03.629> you
