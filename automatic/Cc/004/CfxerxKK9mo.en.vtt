00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
frame part with the duct tape fold it

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.570 
frame part with the duct tape fold it
over<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.150> fold<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.170> up<00:02:19.319> under<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.739> lip

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
over there and fold it up under the lip

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.550 
over there and fold it up under the lip
so<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.150> snakes<00:02:21.480> can't<00:02:21.870> touch<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.470> get

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
so the snakes can't touch it and get

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.979 
so the snakes can't touch it and get
stuck<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.060> do<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.330> whole<00:02:24.450> thing<00:02:24.510> like

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
stuck to it if I do the whole thing like

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:25.220 
stuck to it if I do the whole thing like
that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
