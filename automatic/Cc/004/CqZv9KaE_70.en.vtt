it's got different settings I used it
for<00:02:04.700> weeks<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.210> didn't<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:07.229> us<00:02:07.409> even<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
for weeks and it didn't make us even a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.320 
for weeks and it didn't make us even a
dent<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.429> my<00:02:10.129> hand<00:02:11.129> here<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:12.180> what

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
dent in my hand here because that's what

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.280 
dent in my hand here because that's what
I<00:02:12.390> tried<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.780> was

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
I tried it on was

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.789 
I tried it on was
section<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.590> my<00:02:13.650> hand<00:02:15.140> but<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.230> says<00:02:16.409> it<00:02:16.560> takes

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
section in my hand but it says it takes

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.880 
section in my hand but it says it takes
six<00:02:17.069> months<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.609> doing<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:18.030> every<00:02:18.530> week<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:21.890> it

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
six months of doing it every week and it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.910 
six months of doing it every week and it
only<00:02:23.099> does<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.790> quarter<00:02:24.359> inch<00:02:24.540> at<00:02:24.719> a<00:02:24.780> time<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.709> it

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
only does a quarter inch at a time so it

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.080 
only does a quarter inch at a time so it
literally<00:02:26.159> does<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.579> size<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.939> this<00:02:27.030> little

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
literally does the size of this little

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.490 
literally does the size of this little
circle<00:02:27.890> which<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.909> know<00:02:30.230> smaller<00:02:31.230> than

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
circle which is you know smaller than

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.949 
circle which is you know smaller than
the<00:02:31.590> diameter<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.099> my<00:02:32.250> pinkie<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.870> you

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
the diameter of my pinkie and so you

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.929 
the diameter of my pinkie and so you
have<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.439> it<00:02:34.590> move<00:02:34.859> do<00:02:35.159> it<00:02:35.280> move<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.760> move

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
have to do it move do it move do it move

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.420 
have to do it move do it move do it move
do<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.239> move<00:02:36.420> do<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.689> move<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.200> even<00:02:38.129> if<00:02:38.310> you're

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
do it move do it move and even if you're

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.860 
do it move do it move and even if you're
going<00:02:38.609> as<00:02:39.349> fast<00:02:40.349> as<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.859> will<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:45.420> takes<00:02:45.629> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
going as fast as it will go it takes a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.909 
going as fast as it will go it takes a
long<00:02:46.260> time<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:50.400> gets<00:02:50.639> hot<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:52.590> there's<00:02:52.859> a

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
long time and it gets hot like there's a

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.589 
long time and it gets hot like there's a
fan<00:02:53.189> in<00:02:53.220> here<00:02:53.579> that<00:02:53.730> will<00:02:53.849> kick<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.150> because

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
fan in here that will kick on because

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.559 
fan in here that will kick on because
the<00:02:54.720> laser<00:02:54.930> gets<00:02:55.139> so<00:02:55.349> hot<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.120> said<00:02:57.299> it

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the laser gets so hot and like I said it

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.449 
the laser gets so hot and like I said it
it<00:02:57.989> kind<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.379> hurts<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.799> feels<00:02:59.010> about<00:02:59.220> like

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
it kind of hurts it feels about like

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.399 
it kind of hurts it feels about like
somebody<00:02:59.970> taking<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.569> rubber<00:03:00.900> band<00:03:01.139> and

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
somebody taking a rubber band and

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.330 
somebody taking a rubber band and
snapping<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.129> on<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:02.879> hand<00:03:03.739> over<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.069> over

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
snapping you on your hand over and over

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.020 
snapping you on your hand over and over
and<00:03:05.669> over<00:03:05.909> again<00:03:06.620> 16<00:03:07.620> times<00:03:07.980> per<00:03:08.250> square<00:03:09.000> inch

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and over again 16 times per square inch

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.399 
and over again 16 times per square inch
so<00:03:09.959> not<00:03:10.859> a<00:03:10.889> whole<00:03:11.099> lot<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.340> fun<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.169> I<00:03:13.169> didn't

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
so not a whole lot of fun and I didn't

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.330 
so not a whole lot of fun and I didn't
use<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.560> enough<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.889> know<00:03:14.040> whether<00:03:14.189> it

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
use it enough to know whether it

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.819 
use it enough to know whether it
actually<00:03:14.459> works
