design<00:00:14.439> teams<00:00:14.740> are<00:00:14.980> getting<00:00:15.279> their<00:00:15.879> teeth

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
design teams are getting their teeth

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.700 
design teams are getting their teeth
into<00:00:16.299> a<00:00:16.480> new<00:00:16.660> challenge<00:00:17.109> but<00:00:17.289> of<00:00:17.380> course<00:00:17.590> the

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
into a new challenge but of course the

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.800 
into a new challenge but of course the
biggest<00:00:17.890> challenge<00:00:18.369> is<00:00:18.519> in<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:19.300> power<00:00:19.510> unit

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
biggest challenge is in the power unit

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.499 
biggest challenge is in the power unit
and<00:00:20.260> that's<00:00:21.099> where<00:00:21.339> we<00:00:21.460> rely<00:00:21.730> heavily<00:00:21.939> on<00:00:22.210> our

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
and that's where we rely heavily on our

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.069 
and that's where we rely heavily on our
engine<00:00:23.140> partner<00:00:23.529> Renault<00:00:24.089> to<00:00:25.089> make<00:00:25.749> sure<00:00:25.929> that

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
engine partner Renault to make sure that

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.200 
engine partner Renault to make sure that
we<00:00:26.169> have<00:00:26.349> a<00:00:26.380> power<00:00:26.650> unit<00:00:27.009> that<00:00:27.189> is<00:00:27.220> competitive

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
we have a power unit that is competitive

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.939 
we have a power unit that is competitive
with<00:00:28.449> our<00:00:28.810> rivals<00:00:29.230> which<00:00:29.409> we've<00:00:29.560> got<00:00:29.589> every

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
with our rivals which we've got every

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:38.030 
with our rivals which we've got every
confidence<00:00:30.130> they<00:00:31.029> will<00:00:31.210> have

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.670 

I<00:00:38.630> think<00:00:39.630> the<00:00:39.690> new<00:00:39.810> regulations<00:00:40.050> are<00:00:40.470> going<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
I think the new regulations are going to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.350 
I think the new regulations are going to
have<00:00:40.770> an<00:00:40.860> effect<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.250> racing<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.760> season<00:00:41.970> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
have an effect on racing this season and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.970 
have an effect on racing this season and
it's<00:00:43.140> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.470> different<00:00:43.800> type<00:00:43.950> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
it's going to be a different type of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.920 
it's going to be a different type of
racing<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:44.670> fuel<00:00:45.150> economy<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.720> now

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
racing because fuel economy is now

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.500 
racing because fuel economy is now
crucial<00:00:46.380> as<00:00:46.710> we're<00:00:46.890> limited<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.790> 100<00:00:48.180> kilos<00:00:48.480> of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
crucial as we're limited to 100 kilos of

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.720 
crucial as we're limited to 100 kilos of
fuel<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.900> start<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.320> grand<00:00:49.530> prix<00:00:49.740> with<00:00:49.950> so

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
fuel to start a grand prix with so

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.850 
fuel to start a grand prix with so
there's<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:51.900> a<00:00:51.960> much<00:00:52.110> more<00:00:52.260> tactical

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
there's going to be a much more tactical

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.600 
there's going to be a much more tactical
approach<00:00:53.750> to<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> racing<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.560> that's<00:00:56.430> going

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
approach to the racing and that's going

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.550 
approach to the racing and that's going
to<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.820> another<00:00:57.030> challenge<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> teams

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
to be another challenge for the teams

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.579 
to be another challenge for the teams
and<00:00:58.770> drivers

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.740 

I<00:01:04.759> think<00:01:05.759> it's<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> take<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> few<00:01:06.390> races

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
I think it's going to take a few races

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.319 
I think it's going to take a few races
for<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.429> racing<00:01:08.429> to<00:01:08.520> settle<00:01:08.850> down<00:01:09.000> before

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
for the racing to settle down before

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.569 
for the racing to settle down before
people<00:01:10.320> work<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.740> what<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> optimum

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
people work out what the optimum

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.370 
people work out what the optimum
strategy<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.179> run<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> grand<00:01:12.780> prix<00:01:12.990> are<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
strategy is to run a grand prix are so I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.169 
strategy is to run a grand prix are so I
think<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:13.710> probably<00:01:13.829> going<00:01:14.579> to<00:01:14.640> take<00:01:14.729> four

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
think it's probably going to take four

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.660 
think it's probably going to take four
or<00:01:15.210> five<00:01:15.479> races<00:01:15.990> until<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.950> sort<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.399> see<00:01:17.640> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
or five races until we sort of see a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.300 
or five races until we sort of see a
pattern<00:01:18.000> start<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.630> emerge

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.389 

I<00:01:26.020> think<00:01:27.020> it's<00:01:27.170> dangerous<00:01:27.590> sometimes<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.280> be

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
I think it's dangerous sometimes to be

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.219 
I think it's dangerous sometimes to be
over<00:01:28.759> confident<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.540> what<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:29.930> have<00:01:30.079> all

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
over confident of what that you have all

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.109 
over confident of what that you have all
the<00:01:30.320> elements<00:01:30.409> in<00:01:30.829> place<00:01:30.950> for<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.759> start<00:01:32.030> of

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
the elements in place for the start of

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.810 
the elements in place for the start of
any<00:01:32.270> season<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:34.280> know<00:01:34.369> we've<00:01:34.520> enjoyed

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
any season and you know we've enjoyed

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.609 
any season and you know we've enjoyed
great<00:01:35.090> continuity<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.840> last<00:01:36.020> few<00:01:36.229> years<00:01:36.289> and

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
great continuity the last few years and

great continuity the last few years and
you<00:01:37.250> know<00:01:37.310> we've<00:01:37.399> got<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.520> strong<00:01:37.729> driver

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
you know we've got a strong driver

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
depth within the team but you can't take

champion is the benchmark in Formula One
and<00:02:07.960> that's<00:02:08.960> going<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.229> be<00:02:09.410> tough<00:02:09.680> for<00:02:09.860> Daniel

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
and that's going to be tough for Daniel

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.590 
and that's going to be tough for Daniel
but<00:02:10.430> I<00:02:10.520> think<00:02:10.760> he's<00:02:10.910> approaching<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.510> with

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
but I think he's approaching it with

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.750 
but I think he's approaching it with
exactly<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.170> right<00:02:12.260> attitude<00:02:12.470> he's<00:02:13.010> looking

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
exactly the right attitude he's looking

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.480 
exactly the right attitude he's looking
to<00:02:13.880> learn<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.390> benefit<00:02:14.780> from<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:16.220> know<00:02:16.310> how

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
to learn and benefit from you know how

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.030 
to learn and benefit from you know how
Sebastian<00:02:17.240> operates<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.040> fundamentally

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
Sebastian operates and fundamentally

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.130 
Sebastian operates and fundamentally
he's<00:02:19.220> very<00:02:19.460> fast<00:02:19.760> he's<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.120> very<00:02:20.540> quick<00:02:20.780> racing

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
he's very fast he's a very quick racing

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.860 
he's very fast he's a very quick racing
driver<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:22.310> think<00:02:23.210> Daniel<00:02:23.450> could<00:02:23.630> really

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
driver and I think Daniel could really

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.010 
driver and I think Daniel could really
you<00:02:24.230> know<00:02:24.380> throw<00:02:24.680> up<00:02:24.740> some<00:02:25.510> surprise<00:02:26.510> results

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
you know throw up some surprise results

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.440 
you know throw up some surprise results
this<00:02:27.170> year<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.500> think<00:02:27.680> he<00:02:27.890> has<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.970> real

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
this year I think he has the real

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.559 
this year I think he has the real
potential<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.230> be<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> star<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.400> future

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.530 

I<00:02:38.249> think<00:02:39.249> the<00:02:39.340> key<00:02:39.519> elements<00:02:39.939> this<00:02:40.090> year<00:02:40.329> will

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
I think the key elements this year will

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.089 
I think the key elements this year will
be<00:02:40.719> obviously<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.409> engine<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:41.829> going<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> be<00:02:42.069> a

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
be obviously the engine is going to be a

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.739 
be obviously the engine is going to be a
crucial<00:02:42.310> factor<00:02:42.609> and<00:02:42.849> I<00:02:42.879> think<00:02:43.090> reliability

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:43.749 
crucial factor and I think reliability

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.899 
crucial factor and I think reliability
of<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.799> power<00:02:45.069> units<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.579> going<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.819> be

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
of the power units is going to be

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.599 
of the power units is going to be
critical<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.569> think<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.019> obviously

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
critical and I think that obviously

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.750 
critical and I think that obviously
whoever<00:02:48.609> has<00:02:48.969> the<00:02:49.150> most<00:02:49.769> powerful<00:02:50.769> reliable

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
whoever has the most powerful reliable

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.940 
whoever has the most powerful reliable
power<00:02:52.329> unit<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.079> probably<00:02:53.560> going<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.769> come<00:02:53.920> out

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
power unit is probably going to come out

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.550 
power unit is probably going to come out
on<00:02:54.099> on<00:02:54.489> top<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.389> it's<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.629> game<00:02:55.810> changer<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:56.409> many

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
on on top so it's a game changer in many

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.649 
on on top so it's a game changer in many
respects<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.519> regulations<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.269> this<00:02:58.420> year

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
respects the regulations for this year

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:07.200 
respects the regulations for this year
but<00:02:59.010> we<00:03:00.010> look<00:03:00.129> forward<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.579> challenge

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.700 

the<00:03:08.210> atmosphere<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.690> team<00:03:08.720> is<00:03:09.050> excellent

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
the atmosphere in the team is excellent

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.960 
the atmosphere in the team is excellent
at<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.890> moment<00:03:10.250> obviously<00:03:10.340> we've<00:03:10.790> been

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
at the moment obviously we've been

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.360 
at the moment obviously we've been
riding<00:03:11.540> on<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.380> crest<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.800> wave<00:03:12.830> over<00:03:13.280> the

riding on a the crest of a wave over the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.240 
riding on a the crest of a wave over the
last<00:03:13.580> four<00:03:13.850> years<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.920> there's<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:15.980> great

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
last four years and there's a great

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.340 
last four years and there's a great
determination<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:17.240> see<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.630> continue<00:03:17.780> into

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
determination to see that continue into

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.430 
determination to see that continue into
2014<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:19.640> been<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.510> most<00:03:20.660> intense<00:03:21.080> winter

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
2014 it's been the most intense winter

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.530 
2014 it's been the most intense winter
we've<00:03:21.590> ever<00:03:21.770> had<00:03:21.980> we've<00:03:22.280> produced<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.150> car<00:03:23.390> in

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
we've ever had we've produced the car in

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.170 
we've ever had we've produced the car in
the<00:03:23.600> shortest<00:03:23.930> possible<00:03:24.170> amount<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.740> time

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
the shortest possible amount of time

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.280 
the shortest possible amount of time
through<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.240> design<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.780> manufacturing

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
through the design and manufacturing

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.800 
through the design and manufacturing
process<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:27.980> it's<00:03:28.180> been<00:03:29.180> fantastic<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.720> see

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
process and it's been fantastic to see

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:39.080 
process and it's been fantastic to see
the<00:03:30.110> teamwork<00:03:30.490> operating<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:32.060> way<00:03:32.210> it<00:03:32.330> has

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.880 

the<00:03:40.090> main<00:03:40.239> focus<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:40.750> obviously<00:03:41.050> to<00:03:41.260> approach

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
the main focus is obviously to approach

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.160 
the main focus is obviously to approach
each<00:03:42.190> event<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.330> get<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.540> best<00:03:43.690> out<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:43.989> each

of end it's a long season a long

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.589 
of end it's a long season a long
calendar<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.340> it's<00:03:48.340> important<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:49.030> optimize

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
calendar and it's important to optimize

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.449 
calendar and it's important to optimize
your<00:03:49.630> chances<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.230> each<00:03:50.470> individual<00:03:51.280> race

your chances of each individual race
which<00:03:51.700> is<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.270> way<00:03:52.420> we've<00:03:52.599> conducted

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
which is the way we've conducted

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.990 
which is the way we've conducted
ourselves<00:03:53.230> previously<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.190> will<00:03:54.760> be<00:03:54.849> no
