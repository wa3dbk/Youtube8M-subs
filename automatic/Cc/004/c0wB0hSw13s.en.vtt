00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.830

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.920
 under it would 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 around Messi 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.360

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.630
 everyone shoot 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.630

 and now the graphics are expanding like that 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.180
 normal as old 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.609
 feels in front of my body 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.599
 so save by back 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.680

 the other graphic 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.579
 so if that's how it works then 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.859
 I'll paint again 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.789
