00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.130
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.130
 and just now has truck resp 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.710
 call of duty the second cup ybbs 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.440
 trailer rausgehauen and you really have 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.080
 seen more confirmations and 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.000
 few funny things I'm just 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.619
 just to participate is first thing you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.769
 looks very funny 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.849
 you see a giant robot of one 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.390
 1 1 red sound waves signal field and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.870
 a human being is not a human but a human 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.610
 zombie shoots and sees 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.440
 really this person does not see 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.860
 human and I believe it is one 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.590
 zombie 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 and they always wanted this one 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.890
 have controlled zombies 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.590
 it never really made it 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.590
 and may have failed 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.539
 you made it with the new element 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.489
 To control these zombies 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.010
 that they can shoot yes because normal 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.899
 zombies killing a king but enough 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.300
 of it and 1 still this show red 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.850
 sound waves are very reminiscent of the Lahn 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.530
 In the sound waves in the trailer before 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.159
 she has also seen her before 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.320
 now here 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.830
 and maybe it's an easter egg 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.229
 Tab where you have where certain switches 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.010
 or activate mechanisms around that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.470
 then to get 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.119
 because of further one sees one sees everywhere 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.220
 on the map times this new element 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.220
 So stone this sidenstein with the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.479
 blue thing in it also quite this map 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.180
 inside out 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.880
 These four tips have indeed the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.729
 are filled with this element and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.320
 funny that everything is always around there 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.110
 yes, yes, maybe the new element 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.540
 Then we come to a tank 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.579
 one sees also very briefly the becomes 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.439
 have similar function as in transit 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.600
 even learns very quickly for one 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:51.630
 Panzer exactly makes the things nidal 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.759
 is a nice gimmick but if it is so 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 like Tracy will forget it to Will Sky 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.060
 chalk web should then see you too 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.979
 these generated stations these are the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.180
 we know by the chapmans important for 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.159
 the easter egg because you have to 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.020
 activate 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.270
 and yes you will be in the course of the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.709
 , game beautiful view and the largest the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.130
 biggest discovery actually what you can 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.050
 this 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.120
 can do are the four elementary 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.650
 You see they are in action 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.430
 I can really horny you 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.660
 say and I hope so you can see 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.660
 of course sees every single element 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:31.200
 water or no water it 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:35.760
 was a fire earth and so on 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.850
 Puff and I hope it is without 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.410
 without ammunition and the couple quieter 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.120
 probably will be like that too 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.660
 a definite limit maybe again 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.710
 bonfire colors or other sex and yes 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.840
 actually I would have liked 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.720
 really maybe that really 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.990
 really really at the limit ammo 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.640
 So when in English or yes 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.350
 infinitely ammunition more really cool 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.590
 but could really blow up who 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.120
 overboard but I find it cool times 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.400
 a map where you just destroy 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.460
 could and yes you can see her in the 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.410
 use very cool and I'm looking forward 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.730
 is something else I hope maybe 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.350
 it is not the wounds it is 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.240
 not the miracle weapons might come 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.950
 one more but I do not think so 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.770
 and then of course you see the three 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.410
 robot i think it will come too 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.330
 One knows that there are four 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.350
 not if anyway - interest 3 pieces and 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.570
 they can also be nice on the 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.640
 You can see the slopes at the end 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.260
 they just beat clearly they kick 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.330
 somewhere on the earth and if you 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.510
 happened to be there standing then you're flat 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.160
 that is your bad luck and so will be out 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.660
 The sea â€‹â€‹could be seen in this trend 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.740
 recognize and I'm sorry if I 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.150
 I have overlooked a few things 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.520
 but wanted to get out as soon as possible 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.370
 hew and tomorrow the time has come 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.020
 yes, I hope you are happy too 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.160
 See you at the next video 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.160
 pure and servus
