in addition Kate Jonas mentioned that
this<00:01:47.780> power<00:01:48.110> generator<00:01:48.530> here<00:01:48.800> does<00:01:49.250> require<00:01:49.520> a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
this power generator here does require a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.910 
this power generator here does require a
minimum<00:01:50.179> of<00:01:50.390> two<00:01:50.630> rotations<00:01:51.229> per<00:01:51.410> second<00:01:51.830> in

minimum of two rotations per second in
order<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.490> achieve<00:01:52.759> enough<00:01:53.060> power<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.390> charge

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
order to achieve enough power to charge

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.240 
order to achieve enough power to charge
your<00:01:53.869> devices<00:01:54.140> but<00:01:54.500> as<00:01:54.590> let's<00:01:54.950> just<00:01:55.069> show<00:01:55.160> you

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
your devices but as let's just show you

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.469 
your devices but as let's just show you
guys<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.580> demonstrate<00:01:55.910> how<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.149> works

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.910 

so<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.690> can<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> iPhone<00:02:04.710> is

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
so as you can see here the iPhone is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.980 
so as you can see here the iPhone is
charging<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> charging<00:02:06.000> sable<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.510> still<00:02:06.810> on

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
charging the charging sable is still on

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
charging the charging sable is still on
and<00:02:07.200> as<00:02:07.350> long<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.130> keep<00:02:08.280> cranking<00:02:08.550> will

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and as long as you keep cranking will

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.669 
and as long as you keep cranking will
keep<00:02:09.390> charging<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.840> here's<00:02:10.050> my<00:02:10.200> rhythm<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.619> I

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
keep charging so here's my rhythm that I

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.500 
keep charging so here's my rhythm that I
found<00:02:11.100> with<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> power<00:02:11.700> generator<00:02:12.240> here<00:02:12.360> it's

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
found with the power generator here it's

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.630 
found with the power generator here it's
not<00:02:12.660> too<00:02:12.810> fast<00:02:13.110> not<00:02:13.440> too<00:02:13.500> slow<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:14.250> actually

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
not too fast not too slow you actually

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.890 
not too fast not too slow you actually
feel<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.000> Smith<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:15.390> one<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.750> actually

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
feel the Smith this one is actually

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.520 
feel the Smith this one is actually
producing<00:02:16.680> power<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.160> your<00:02:17.310> iPhone<00:02:18.530> overall

Pro and yes I did actually try I
couldn't<00:03:30.090> resist<00:03:30.180> trying<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> few

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079

other random appliances such as lamp
here<00:03:33.000> so<00:03:33.360> let's<00:03:33.600> give<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.900> shot<00:03:34.140> all<00:03:34.890> right

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
here so let's give it a shot all right

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.560 
here so let's give it a shot all right
so<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.220> switches<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.820> for<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.120> lamp<00:03:36.329> let's

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
so so switches on for the lamp let's

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:45.850 
so so switches on for the lamp let's
start<00:03:36.780> cranking<00:03:37.140> this

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.900 

so<00:03:46.860> as<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.100> guys<00:03:47.220> can<00:03:47.370> see<00:03:47.550> here<00:03:47.730> this

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
so as you guys can see here this

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.310 
so as you guys can see here this
actually<00:03:48.060> has<00:03:48.300> enough<00:03:48.540> power<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.960> power<00:03:49.110> this

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
actually has enough power to power this

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.840 
actually has enough power to power this
lamp<00:03:49.560> here<00:03:49.740> however<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.100> think<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.430> bulb<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:50.820> it

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
lamp here however I think the bulb in it

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.460 
lamp here however I think the bulb in it
has<00:03:51.090> something<00:03:51.330> that's<00:03:51.510> less<00:03:51.780> than<00:03:51.840> 10<00:03:52.200> watts

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
has something that's less than 10 watts

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.810 
has something that's less than 10 watts
since<00:03:52.770> there's<00:03:52.920> those<00:03:53.010> energy<00:03:53.430> finishing

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
since there's those energy finishing

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.280 
since there's those energy finishing
bulbs<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.510> pretty<00:03:54.690> cool<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.170> actually

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
bulbs it's pretty cool that it actually

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.370 
bulbs it's pretty cool that it actually
works<00:03:56.570> also<00:03:57.570> for<00:03:57.780> those<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.050> learning<00:03:58.230> how

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
works also for those of you learning how

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.960 
works also for those of you learning how
