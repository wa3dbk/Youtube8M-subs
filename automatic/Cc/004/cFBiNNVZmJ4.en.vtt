00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 all youtube today I show you how 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.509
 one files from the raspberry pi 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.090
 downloads or files, of course 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.219
 on it invites, for example, to ours 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.769
 raspberry pi in our mysql structure 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.089
 to record or to plugins too 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.520
 install or 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.740
 Do not bonn this within the xbmc 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.310
 and that is really easy 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.619
 we need a tool for the mac 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.070
 I show the windows first 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.039
 calculator 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.840
 and here for the scp , take it 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.440
 so the best tool actually what you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.030
 can take for it and as always the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.750
 link there is in the wiener 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.710
 description and we download here 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.170
 You can choose if you want to 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.750
 installation package or whether 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 you would rather have a portable xl 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.199
 would you like to speak on a usb 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.149
 you could not copy a stick 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.280
 Install needs fits on the side 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.140
 a little on there is not a lot of advertising 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.649
 that you end up somewhere else afterwards 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.539
 When I wanted to go anyway 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.680
 download install there you have to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.390
 Make sure that they are the right one 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.020
 Language selects during installation 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.439
 and as far as I know he wants the google 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.850
 install chrome with the not wanted 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.229
 simply select the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.100
 if it did , it could, of course 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.900
 let the whole thing then looks like this 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.439
 I open it and that is actually 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.159
 quite simple, we just look that 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.049
 the transmission protocol sftp stands 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.540
 and the computer name here we give on 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.470
 best is the ip of our raspberry pi 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.290
 in my case 10.0 point 15 13 at 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.799
 username comes to rhp and xp 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.180
 password raspberry that's like at 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.909
 this terminal connection 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.530
 Now just come on sign up back 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.869
 then he connects us she wants that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.920
 but in order to save that every time 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.680
 have to react again 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.770
 here we can give names I call 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.750
 that time raspberry pi 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.670
 and then we have the quasi 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.229
 saved and I show that now 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.270
 every time we turn on which one we have 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.950
 this view first and see 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.259
 our stored server in the case 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.790
 old raspberry 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.319
 I use the Print once sign 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.000
 at the first registration is still coming 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.439
 big window where you can see that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.200
 key must be replaced 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:23.840
 just confirm this window with yes 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.250
 Now here again the password 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.870
 I probably have 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.180
 mistyped and already there are many 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.569
 People know this view from the total 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.090
 commander for example or older hare 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:42.319
 like me from the norton commander of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.200
 then and yes that is actually quite 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.829
 we simply long to immediately xp 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.819
 directory and in the directory on xp 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:55.849
 there is the hidden xbmc folder here 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.239
 then stands point xbmc point means 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.000
 under linux that it is hidden and 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.579
 opens the suitcase and then we see 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.349
 here is our usual file 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.920
 structures we also from the judge 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.079
 recognize 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.420
 Here we have the user data directory 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:15.139
 and here are all our files in it 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.930
 like advents settings pros xml and stop 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.799
 the whole bustle say so we can 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.079
 go now 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.769
 on the left side we see ours 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.269
 local hard drive or if we want 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.209
 we can go up here too and 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.769
 Painting drives take for example 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.489
 I just go there and around you 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.650
 to show that I am I go now 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.290
 now and never the akws settings the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.410
 I can easily drag and drop 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.329
 overwritten 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.599
 and then he asks again do you want 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.400
 Copy that and I say cool 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.030
 here but the fear is here already 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.579
 surfaced 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.280
 and of course exactly the same way 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.810
 Just drag drop and then I asked 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.400
 Here again what is already there 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.230
 do you want to overwrite that? 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.730
 here have I want and you have 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.419
 I overwrite that completely 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.370
 easy and almost almost yourself 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.409
 explanatory 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.569
 if you have several directories here 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:11.590
 it goes upstairs then of course you come up 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.900
 the helm sd card i would you 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.640
 Do not recommend too much to 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.889
 because that could lead to that 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.880
 So the raspberry does not start anymore 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.220
 best move here in the home directory 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.840
 experian and then here under the point 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.430
 xbmc vehicle is there can not 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.570
 Of course you can do a lot wrong 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.970
 just like on the windows computer now 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.760
 delete user data directory and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.960
 then he's back to zero or the xp 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.419
 to and the xbmc it then empty and quasi 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.080
 in the factory still interesting here 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:46.530
 is you can under attitude you can 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.720
 your under integration application 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.389
 determine where airport is if you because 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.100
 I go here to clarify on select 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.560
 have my putter lying on the desktop 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.139
 this is getting more and more chaotic here 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.229
 always clean up then you can quasi off 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.850
 immediately if you have the stp open 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.510
 just up here in the toolbar 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:10.780
 Click on this symbol and open it 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.580
 you automatically poti and connects you 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.849
 and you do not have to separate this anymore 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.120
 start from each other 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:21.700
 the password and you see we are 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.639
 now via terminal on the rest barry 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.430
 own sounds around here any 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:32.169
 to remove commands by hand 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:35.770
 so much for the windows that come to me 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.080
 over to the mac at mac there are also 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.750
 several programs i recommend trends 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.310
 with the company panic, however, is 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.729
 not for free that costs already 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.010
 little bit of all for no money 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.510
 I want to spend it hyperdub 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.430
 that's funny that we have one 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.760
 tigerente the tool now also for 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.370
 windows looks exactly like that though 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.389
 under windows I think stop if scp 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.000
 the better solution 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.250
 Of course we can just switch to new ones 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 connections click here our data 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.349
 enter 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.539
 but we want to save that by 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:14.020
 here once this bookmark mode 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:14.729
 go down here to plus and press 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.759
 then 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.979
 quite normal to enter our data server 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:23.400
 is again the ip-address as a name 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.770
 I respectfully assign user name 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.909
 For the password, it is only here 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:33.120
 no dialogue an input field if we 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.800
 but connect immediately and then asked 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.330
 us for the password and then we have 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.800
 the possibility that the mac key ring 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.099
 save and then do not ask us 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.139
 more 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.509
 I was ever so connected 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.509
 Now this window does not come and we 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.939
 are almost directly there if you have the 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.860
 first time starts since your home xp 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:53.580
 a directory and probably see 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.389
 this point xmb xbmc directory is not 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.740
 then you have to look under presentation 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.659
 Show hidden files 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.080
 See if that is gone then you can see him 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:06.870
 Nothing at all therefore looks like presentation 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.639
 and hidden files show so napp 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.979
 Actually, Jesus is the same as with Windows 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:14.189
 you can go to the xbmc directory here 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:16.139
 go and also here simply by 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:17.279
 drag &amp; drop the files out copy 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.439
 then the number comes in 

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:20.639
 transfer window 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:22.770
 there you see what you do last so 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:25.110
 has done and can clean it again 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.120
 copy and here again the query 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.039
 Attention that we already exist 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.189
 we can also override that 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:34.050
 want to rename or skip that 

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:38.189
 So pretty self-explanatory 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.810
 that's easy and I guess 

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:41.699
 that's clear in any case 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.039
 if not fit in with me 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:47.539
 comments otherwise I would first 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.539
 say until the next video
