00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 thank you very much for the time presume 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.899
 us some shoes before anything that are 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.880
 new colors of nike as it is called the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.639
 model and tell us a little about the model 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.030
 this the ctr is the model that we will be 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.279
 using now easy the classic is from 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.500
 very striking colors colors that 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.180
 distinguish now if you want from any 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.949
 point that finds you in the stadium that 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.320
 be it then you have to be be singing 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.810
 up to reach you realize and 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.670
 distinguish which is the new model of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.679
 nike and this shoe tool very 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.450
 comfortable in the model with comfortable climate 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.300
 because it 's a little bit wider than the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.570
 front does not squeeze me so much and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.600
 good to be also having the ats that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.440
 It is a system that prevents 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.930
 this water to the shoe makes it waterproof 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 This is very comfortable and good, avoid citing 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.890
 grappling with the practical sock you 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.769
 mojes that you start to run inside 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.559
 of the same shoe because it's your turn to reappear 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.329
 this Saturday against veracruz after 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.549
 a match there that you did not want 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.350
 risk a muscle injury how do you 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.250
 you feel like times you feel good going 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.230
 to be a party 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.500
 it's important to us because we 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.300
 about adding the three points even more 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.690
 to the qualification to the liguilla not 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.680
 we have two parties this less than the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.810
 most rivals 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.270
 one of them we will be playing after 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.640
 of the veracruz party or tickets 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.290
 very important with 63 points now 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.540
 later the three points before 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.630
 xolos right here in the Aztec waist and 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.750
 good means pretty are they is a 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.690
 no no no easy place to play in 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.190
 she will Veracruz if it can be complicated if 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.899
 we allow it but we go with 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.729
 much conviction a lot of confidence that 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.920
 we can see the three points from 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.020
 when you will not play there in the pirate 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.729
 many sources already has rap has 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.160
 while we do not play over there, I think the 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.970
 last game I played in veracruz 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.039
 with morelia not even with atlante 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.590
 we were over there then you already have 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.899
 has mice today in america is the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.340
 maybe maybe against saints maybe 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.039
 against the lion it cost him a little 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.780
 visitor, I do not like to see this happen 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.209
 against veracruz we do not have to be 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.490
 or are very aware that it is not going to 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.390
 be a simple party them 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.040
 surely they will be trying to 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.420
 prepare well on the field 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.580
 avoid giving away some space because 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.209
 they know that we are dangerous 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.220
 dangerous with open spaces 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.450
 so then we have to be very 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.610
 smart to play the same 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.750
 way not to risk what is not 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.330
 we have to risk we are of 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.459
 visitor yes and I repeat you we always have 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.220
 the conviction of bringing us the three 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.160
 points and to win the game in the 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.000
 the field we are on but also 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.280
 we have enough 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.980
 smart to know how to handle the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.140
 party and good to bring the points there 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.209
 and follow up is also not a goal 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.959
 yes definitely continue in the leadership 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.480
 I think it was not thought at first 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.040
 much in this situation now is not a 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.660
 obsession but of course we 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.330
 I would love to finish super leaders not 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.430
 we have the ability to do it we have 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.769
 two games less and we are in the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.769
 first place then I know that you can
