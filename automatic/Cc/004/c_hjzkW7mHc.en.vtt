00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
post apocalyptic literature began in

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.750 
post apocalyptic literature began in
1945<00:00:40.990> because<00:00:41.710> before<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.070> if<00:00:42.430> you<00:00:42.520> wanted

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
1945 because before that if you wanted

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.920 
1945 because before that if you wanted
to<00:00:42.850> end<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.120> world<00:00:43.300> you'd<00:00:43.570> have<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.810> do<00:00:43.900> all

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
to end the world you'd have to do all

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.840 
to end the world you'd have to do all
the<00:00:44.140> TNT<00:00:44.530> underneath<00:00:44.950> there<00:00:45.160> are<00:00:45.400> Eiffel

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
the TNT underneath there are Eiffel

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.760 
the TNT underneath there are Eiffel
Tower<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.240> send<00:00:46.660> into<00:00:46.900> the<00:00:46.930> moon<00:00:47.140> blow<00:00:47.530> up<00:00:47.620> the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
Tower and send into the moon blow up the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.500 
Tower and send into the moon blow up the
moon<00:00:47.890> said<00:00:48.340> they<00:00:48.490> are<00:00:48.610> flying<00:00:48.970> into<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.270> Sun

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
moon said they are flying into the Sun

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.060 
moon said they are flying into the Sun
and<00:00:49.780> even<00:00:50.110> that<00:00:50.230> wasn't<00:00:50.410> guaranteed<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.950> work

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
and even that wasn't guaranteed to work

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.260 
and even that wasn't guaranteed to work
so<00:00:51.990> so<00:00:52.990> after<00:00:53.250> 1945<00:00:54.250> America<00:00:54.880> showed<00:00:55.030> us<00:00:55.150> how

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
so so after 1945 America showed us how

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.630 
so so after 1945 America showed us how
easy<00:00:55.660> it<00:00:55.930> was<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.110> end<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.560> world<00:00:56.770> are<00:00:57.070> by

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
easy it was to end the world are by

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.090 
easy it was to end the world are by
dropping<00:00:58.060> two<00:00:58.210> atomic<00:00:58.480> bombs<00:00:58.660> um<00:00:59.200> I'm<00:01:00.040> from

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
dropping two atomic bombs um I'm from

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.950 
dropping two atomic bombs um I'm from
then<00:01:00.520> on<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.940> end<00:01:01.090> of<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.240> world<00:01:01.330> didn't<00:01:01.750> just

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
then on the end of the world didn't just

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.750 
then on the end of the world didn't just
look<00:01:02.080> like<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.290> possibility<00:01:02.860> it<00:01:03.280> looked<00:01:03.610> quite

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
look like a possibility it looked quite

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.890 
look like a possibility it looked quite
lightly<00:01:04.089> so<00:01:04.960> um<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.939> know<00:01:07.030> post-apocalyptic

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
lightly so um you know post-apocalyptic

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.480 
lightly so um you know post-apocalyptic
like<00:01:08.350> shirts<00:01:08.620> it's<00:01:08.830> interesting<00:01:08.980> post

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
like shirts it's interesting post

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.460 
like shirts it's interesting post
apocalyptic<00:01:09.850> because<00:01:10.300> there's<00:01:11.080> actually<00:01:11.440> a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
apocalyptic because there's actually a

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.080 
apocalyptic because there's actually a
story<00:01:11.740> after<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.280> because<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.640> apocalypse

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
story after that because the apocalypse

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.880 
story after that because the apocalypse
surely<00:01:13.420> means<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.780> end<00:01:13.930> but<00:01:14.410> stuff<00:01:14.650> keeps

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
surely means the end but stuff keeps

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.590 
surely means the end but stuff keeps
going<00:01:15.190> you<00:01:15.670> know<00:01:15.790> in<00:01:15.970> real<00:01:16.120> life<00:01:16.360> and

going you know in real life and
apocalyptic<00:01:17.230> scenario<00:01:18.100> we<00:01:18.220> don't<00:01:18.400> with<00:01:18.520> just

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
apocalyptic scenario we don't with just

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.910 
apocalyptic scenario we don't with just
three<00:01:18.880> things<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.600> know<00:01:19.720> rocks<00:01:20.020> cockroaches

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
three things you know rocks cockroaches
