00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.689
 Today we are going to make pig in the Cuban way 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:24.490
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:30.439
 they are black pepper oregano cumin oil 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:35.290
 lemon juice orange juice garlic salt 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.290
 cilantro and a piece of loin 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.690
 The first thing we are going to do is clean 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.170
 of excess fat on the loin and we're going to 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.260
 carry a plastic bag that is 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.040
 fit for food now let's catch 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:59.330
 and we're going to pour the lemon juice that 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.320
 we have squeezed we are going to also throw the 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.320
 Orange juice 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.140
 let's take a good short lion 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.820
 oil 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.010
 As you can see, it has made a hairline in the 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.780
 meat to take all those forgetfulness 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.840
 from within 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.750
 for me 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.120
 let's have cum 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.490
 nothing happens because I have a lot because 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.180
 like this we are going to move it, we are going to 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.180
 cast also 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.160
 the oregano 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.530
 the pepper 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.800
 It's a very easy recipe and you'll see what 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.300
 fast and rich that is 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.300
 a good handful of salt 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.920
 crushed garlic and cilantro very 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.530
 chopped as you see we have put everything 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.180
 in the bag and it has been all wrong more 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.409
 divided now let's catch with the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.330
 bag 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.769
 and we're going to close it and let's go 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.769
 moving so that everything is integrated 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.910
 once we have moved it well it has 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.069
 distributed everything now we are going to do 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.590
 the bag a knot and we will take it to the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.500
 refrigerator a minimum of 12 hours for 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.770
 sponge well the taste as we have caught 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.420
 and we had one night and part of the day 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.209
 our macerating house you are going to see what 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.370
 smell richer then now let's catch and 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.500
 we 're going to put it in a pileup 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.320
 for one we have preheated the oven 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.500
 at 180 degrees and we're going to take our 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.959
 meat approximately 40 minutes 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.380
 until it is done with a little bit of this 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.380
 juice 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.870
 It has happened approximately 45 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.540
 minutes and the meat is already done let's 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.340
 wait for it to cool down a bit since 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.310
