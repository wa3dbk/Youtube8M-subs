00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
at us that I got two days ago here the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.519 
at us that I got two days ago here the
shiny<00:00:27.599> steel<00:00:27.990> shield<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.699> crazy

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
shiny steel shield on that is so crazy

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.740 
shiny steel shield on that is so crazy
look<00:00:31.529> how<00:00:31.650> cool<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.920> looks<00:00:32.149> it's<00:00:33.149> not<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
look how cool that looks it's not in a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.830 
look how cool that looks it's not in a
tree<00:00:33.960> which<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.550> decent<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.969> guess<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.660> I

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
tree which is decent I guess because I

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.290 
tree which is decent I guess because I
think<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.440> really<00:00:37.710> good<00:00:37.950> at<00:00:38.129> defense<00:00:39.059> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
think it's really good at defense and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.850 
think it's really good at defense and
special<00:00:39.480> events<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.170> i<00:00:40.200> think<00:00:40.410> its<00:00:40.500> defense

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
special events but i think its defense

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520 
special events but i think its defense
is<00:00:40.980> better<00:00:41.190> than<00:00:41.460> special<00:00:41.879> defense<00:00:42.350> going<00:00:43.350> off

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
is better than special defense going off

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.270 
is better than special defense going off
stats<00:00:44.930> good<00:00:45.930> endurance<00:00:46.379> at<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:47.070> not

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
stats good endurance at all that's not

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580 
stats good endurance at all that's not
very<00:00:47.309> good<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.850> pokemon<00:00:48.690> that's
