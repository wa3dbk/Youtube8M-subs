think<00:03:20.450> we<00:03:20.810> can<00:03:20.959> we<00:03:21.230> can<00:03:21.380> certainly<00:03:21.620> do<00:03:22.549> as<00:03:22.700> best

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
think we can we can certainly do as best

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.280 
think we can we can certainly do as best
we<00:03:23.000> can<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.359> lose<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.599> championship<00:03:23.780> there
