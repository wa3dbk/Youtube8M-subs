neat effects to a large out-of-focus
light<00:02:56.280> areas<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.480> course<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.959> being<00:02:58.170> focused

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
light areas of course that being focused

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.789 
light areas of course that being focused
right<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.750> obviously<00:03:01.049> if<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.260> use<00:03:01.410> like<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
right so obviously if you use like the

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.559 
right so obviously if you use like the
heart<00:03:02.370> or<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.549> star<00:03:02.850> you<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.180> out<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.329> focus

heart or the star you have out of focus

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.920 
heart or the star you have out of focus
lights<00:03:03.930> instead<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.410> being<00:03:04.560> like<00:03:04.590> octagon<00:03:05.280> zor

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
lights instead of being like octagon zor

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.349 
lights instead of being like octagon zor
glowing<00:03:06.930> orbs<00:03:07.500> they'll<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.799> hard<00:03:08.310> zor<00:03:08.670> stars

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
glowing orbs they'll be hard zor stars

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.710

which<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.140> kind<00:03:10.319> of<00:03:10.350> cool<00:03:10.410> now<00:03:11.370> also<00:03:11.720> swappable

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
which is kind of cool now also swappable

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.569 
which is kind of cool now also swappable
optics<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.950> neat<00:03:14.190> thing<00:03:14.310> about<00:03:14.370> the

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
optics is the neat thing about the

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.150 
optics is the neat thing about the

have been able to notice there the

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.190 
have been able to notice there the
optics<00:04:16.209> are<00:04:16.299> color-coded<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:16.959> bright<00:04:17.169> green

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
optics are color-coded the bright green

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.560 
optics are color-coded the bright green
is<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.650> doublet<00:04:18.100> this<00:04:18.430> purple<00:04:18.880> is<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.239> zone

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
is the doublet this purple is the zone

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.409 
is the doublet this purple is the zone
optic<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:21.040> looks<00:04:21.190> like<00:04:21.370> yellow<00:04:21.790> is<00:04:21.970> single

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
optic it looks like yellow is single

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.230 
optic it looks like yellow is single
glass<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:23.020> kind<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.830> blue<00:04:24.100> plastic<00:04:24.700> optic

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
glass and kind of a blue plastic optic

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.390 
glass and kind of a blue plastic optic
and<00:04:25.510> then<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.900> get<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.080> switchable<00:04:26.500> internal

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
and then you get a switchable internal

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.400 
and then you get a switchable internal
optic<00:04:27.729> here<00:04:28.030> see<00:04:28.810> if<00:04:28.870> we<00:04:28.960> can<00:04:29.080> see<00:04:29.139> there<00:04:29.320> you

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
optic here see if we can see there you

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.719 
optic here see if we can see there you
can<00:04:29.650> see<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.860> two<00:04:29.979> little<00:04:30.100> holes<00:04:30.280> down<00:04:30.490> there

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
can see the two little holes down there

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.570 
can see the two little holes down there
you<00:04:31.240> can<00:04:31.389> use<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.720> tip<00:04:32.020> of<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.580> aperature

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
you can use the tip of the aperature

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.450 
you can use the tip of the aperature
tool<00:04:33.880> where<00:04:34.120> that<00:04:34.270> get<00:04:34.419> off<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:35.310> there<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.370> go

like<00:04:43.990> after<00:04:44.320> 200<00:04:44.860> is<00:04:44.979> I<00:04:45.100> think<00:04:45.690> it's

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
like after 200 is I think it's

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.480 
like after 200 is I think it's
ridiculous<00:04:47.200> for<00:04:47.410> yeah<00:04:47.830> extremely<00:04:48.160> long

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
ridiculous for yeah extremely long

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.640 
ridiculous for yeah extremely long
exposures<00:04:49.060> we<00:04:49.660> tried<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:49.930> up<00:04:50.080> in<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.289> office

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
exposures we tried it up in the office

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.860 
exposures we tried it up in the office
earlier<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.160> took<00:04:51.340> 40<00:04:51.820> seconds<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.450> expose

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
earlier and it took 40 seconds to expose

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:01.790 
earlier and it took 40 seconds to expose
in<00:04:53.200> fluorescent<00:04:54.160> and<00:04:54.310> daylight<00:04:56.130> so

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.639 

can<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:02.889> twist<00:05:03.099> pop<00:05:03.789> it<00:05:03.939> out<00:05:04.409> goes<00:05:05.409> in<00:05:05.529> its

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:05.649 
can you twist pop it out goes in its

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:13.049 
can you twist pop it out goes in its
case<00:05:10.679> now<00:05:11.679> as<00:05:11.830> you<00:05:12.009> can<00:05:12.129> tell<00:05:12.189> linds<00:05:12.729> babies

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:13.059 
case now as you can tell linds babies

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.790 
case now as you can tell linds babies
are<00:05:13.209> kind<00:05:13.689> of<00:05:13.779> a<00:05:13.869> pain<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.110> work<00:05:14.379> with<00:05:14.589> it

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
are kind of a pain to work with it

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.230 
are kind of a pain to work with it
sometimes<00:05:15.219> they<00:05:15.399> take<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.580> lot<00:05:15.729> of<00:05:15.789> work<00:05:16.029> and

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
sometimes they take a lot of work and

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.659 
sometimes they take a lot of work and
care<00:05:16.449> and<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:17.800> forces<00:05:18.069> you<00:05:18.219> to<00:05:18.279> slow<00:05:18.369> down

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
care and it forces you to slow down

is<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.389> distinct<00:05:37.869> look<00:05:38.080> that<00:05:38.349> comes<00:05:38.529> from<00:05:38.679> linds

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
is a distinct look that comes from linds

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.100 
is a distinct look that comes from linds
babies<00:05:39.399> and<00:05:39.729> if<00:05:40.149> that<00:05:40.300> look<00:05:40.449> is<00:05:40.599> for<00:05:40.779> you<00:05:40.869> this

babies and if that look is for you this

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.100 
babies and if that look is for you this
is<00:05:41.289> the<00:05:42.099> most<00:05:42.279> controlled<00:05:42.849> way<00:05:43.089> to<00:05:43.149> get<00:05:43.419> it<00:05:43.539> the

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
is the most controlled way to get it the

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.790 
is the most controlled way to get it the

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:50.019 
repeatable settings they can be set so

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:52.259 
repeatable settings they can be set so
you<00:05:50.110> can<00:05:50.289> do<00:05:50.499> studio<00:05:50.889> work<00:05:50.979> with<00:05:51.309> them<00:05:51.490> the

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:52.269 
you can do studio work with them the

you can do studio work with them the
original<00:05:52.719> muse<00:05:53.019> is<00:05:53.379> a<00:05:53.439> is<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:54.459> cheaper

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
original muse is a is the cheaper

bellows design where you just kind of

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:00.509 
bellows design where you just kind of
squeeze<00:05:58.869> in<00:05:59.169> and<00:05:59.319> out<00:05:59.439> and<00:05:59.679> the<00:06:00.099> effects<00:06:00.399> are

squeeze in and out and the effects are

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.309 
squeeze in and out and the effects are

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
less repeatable with that one so

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.420
