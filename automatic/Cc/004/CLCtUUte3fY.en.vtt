having it in mind that's where it makes
me<00:01:42.159> feel<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.399> little<00:01:42.640> bit<00:01:42.790> better<00:01:43.000> about<00:01:43.329> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
me feel a little bit better about the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.380 
me feel a little bit better about the
situation<00:01:44.049> if<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:45.130> were<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.759> get<00:01:46.000> into

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
situation if I were to get into

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.719 
situation if I were to get into
something<00:01:46.750> like<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.229> 100%<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.310> time<00:01:48.490> you

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
something like that 100% of the time you

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.880 
something like that 100% of the time you
will<00:01:48.880> receive<00:01:49.299> a<00:01:49.329> bone<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.869> hide<00:01:50.140> dirt

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
will receive a bone and hide dirt

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.520 
will receive a bone and hide dirt
although<00:01:51.700> there<00:01:51.969> are<00:01:52.149> a<00:01:52.180> few<00:01:52.390> items<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.320> are

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
although there are a few items that are

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.620 
although there are a few items that are
worth<00:01:53.799> picking<00:01:54.100> up<00:01:54.430> for<00:01:54.729> example<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.360> water

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
worth picking up for example the water

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.620 
worth picking up for example the water
is<00:01:56.100> 75<00:01:57.100> sec<00:01:57.430> every<00:01:57.790> time<00:01:57.969> the<00:01:58.090> green<00:01:58.270> dragon

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
is 75 sec every time the green dragon

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.620 
is 75 sec every time the green dragon
drops<00:01:58.840> those<00:01:59.790> two<00:02:00.790> lists<00:02:00.969> off<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.180> few<00:02:01.479> other

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
drops those two lists off a few other

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.170 
drops those two lists off a few other
ones<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.079> eddy<00:02:02.350> full<00:02:02.680> humps<00:02:02.979> elk<00:02:03.189> for<00:02:03.520> 2k<00:02:03.939> each
