00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
to show this to the world will start the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.899 
to show this to the world will start the
test<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.380> while<00:01:11.040> starting<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:12.479> I'll<00:01:12.600> um

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
test and while starting I think I'll um

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.450 
test and while starting I think I'll um
put<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:16.159> maybe<00:01:17.159> zoom<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.850> bit

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
put like that maybe zoom in a little bit

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.200 
put like that maybe zoom in a little bit
just<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.610> bit

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.570 

okay<00:01:25.960> so<00:01:26.020> this<00:01:26.350> can<00:01:26.560> maybe<00:01:26.740> take<00:01:26.979> maybe<00:01:27.280> two<00:01:27.549> or

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
okay so this can maybe take maybe two or

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.250 
okay so this can maybe take maybe two or
three<00:01:27.790> minutes<00:01:30.150> well<00:01:31.150> it's<00:01:31.450> fourteen<00:01:32.110> percent

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
three minutes well it's fourteen percent

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.410 
three minutes well it's fourteen percent

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.690 
will part two is in depth review we take
out<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.819> pre-installed<00:02:59.420> apps<00:03:00.280> do<00:03:01.280> some<00:03:01.489> point

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
out the pre-installed apps do some point

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.190 
out the pre-installed apps do some point
browsing<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:05.319> this<00:03:06.319> is<00:03:06.500> part<00:03:06.739> 3<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:08.200> while

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
browsing and this is part 3 and while

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.949 
browsing and this is part 3 and while
also<00:03:09.409> probably<00:03:09.739> just<00:03:09.890> do<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.069> part<00:03:10.870> for<00:03:12.910> just

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
also probably just do a part for just

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.240 
also probably just do a part for just
maybe<00:03:14.959> it's<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.260> results<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.010> antutu

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
maybe it's the results of the antutu

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.580 
maybe it's the results of the antutu
benchmark<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:17.209> if<00:03:18.109> you<00:03:18.200> don't<00:03:18.319> want<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.500> watch

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
benchmark so if you don't want to watch

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.960 
benchmark so if you don't want to watch
this<00:03:18.650> full<00:03:19.069> one<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.370> can<00:03:19.489> just<00:03:19.609> go<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.790> that

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
this full one you can just go to that

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.890 
this full one you can just go to that
but<00:03:20.660> uh<00:03:21.670> salsa<00:03:22.670> cos<00:03:22.819> we're<00:03:22.970> in<00:03:23.090> China<00:03:23.359> takes<00:03:23.780> a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
but uh salsa cos we're in China takes a

while<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.379> upload<00:03:24.560> YouTube<00:03:25.160> videos<00:03:25.609> because

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
while to upload YouTube videos because

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.990 
while to upload YouTube videos because
of<00:03:26.359> the<00:03:26.480> firewall<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.650> for<00:03:31.579> eighty<00:03:31.790> percent

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
of the firewall so I for eighty percent

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.229 
of the firewall so I for eighty percent
eighty-seven<00:03:32.870> percent<00:03:33.310> I'll<00:03:34.310> pull<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.060> up<00:03:35.209> a

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
eighty-seven percent I'll pull it up a

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.839 
eighty-seven percent I'll pull it up a
little<00:03:35.750> bit<00:03:35.870> closer<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.379> you<00:03:36.560> can<00:03:36.670> we<00:03:37.670> can

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
little bit closer so you can we can

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.390 
little bit closer so you can we can
count<00:03:38.000> down<00:03:38.390> together<00:03:42.370> eighty-seven<00:03:43.370> percent

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
count down together eighty-seven percent

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.530 
count down together eighty-seven percent
slow<00:03:44.060> there<00:03:45.340> I'm<00:03:46.340> really<00:03:46.549> curious<00:03:46.880> what<00:03:47.419> this

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
slow there I'm really curious what this

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.599 
slow there I'm really curious what this
will<00:03:47.720> get<00:03:50.620> we<00:03:51.620> did<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.799> benchmark<00:03:52.430> on<00:03:52.519> the

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
will get we did a benchmark on the

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.690 
will get we did a benchmark on the
people<00:03:52.910> s<00:03:53.060> 1<00:03:53.299> purl<00:03:53.630> on<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.959> got<00:03:54.139> like<00:03:54.700> 17,000

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
people s 1 purl on that got like 17,000

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.330 
people s 1 purl on that got like 17,000
something<00:03:56.329> which<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.810> highest<00:03:56.959> ever<00:03:57.440> so

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
something which is the highest ever so

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.210 
something which is the highest ever so
this<00:03:58.579> kids<00:03:58.790> 17,000<00:03:59.599> this<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.769> going<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.040> be<00:04:01.190> a

this kids 17,000 this is going to be a

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.759 
this kids 17,000 this is going to be a
big<00:04:01.910> hit<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.450> even<00:04:02.870> if<00:04:02.959> it<00:04:02.989> doesn't<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.590> mean

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
big hit and even if it doesn't I mean

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.809 
big hit and even if it doesn't I mean
just<00:04:04.549> a<00:04:04.639> 7.9<00:04:05.450> inch<00:04:05.540> screen<00:04:06.019> right<00:04:06.290> now<00:04:06.319> is<00:04:06.680> just

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
just a 7.9 inch screen right now is just

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.520 
just a 7.9 inch screen right now is just
so<00:04:07.819> popular<00:04:08.239> right<00:04:08.269> now<00:04:08.419> everyone<00:04:09.319> is

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
so popular right now everyone is

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:18.520 
so popular right now everyone is
releasing<00:04:10.099> them<00:04:14.079> so<00:04:15.079> sticks<00:04:15.410> on<00:04:15.530> 93%<00:04:17.530> testing

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
releasing them so sticks on 93% testing

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.200

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.839 

okay<00:04:36.949> so<00:04:37.010> there's<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.900> ram<00:04:38.919> 2,900<00:04:39.919> cebu<00:04:40.460> integer

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
okay so there's a ram 2,900 cebu integer
