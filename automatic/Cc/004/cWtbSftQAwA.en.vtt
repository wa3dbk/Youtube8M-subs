let's<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.120> call<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.330> eight<00:02:26.629> hours<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.110> LTE

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
let's just call it eight hours and LTE

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.460 
let's just call it eight hours and LTE
10<00:02:27.799> hours<00:02:27.950> on<00:02:28.069> Wi-Fi<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.450> definitely<00:02:30.049> pretty

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
10 hours on Wi-Fi so definitely pretty

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.199 
10 hours on Wi-Fi so definitely pretty
amazing<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:31.069> what<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.489> would<00:02:31.670> take<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:31.910> there

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
amazing on what it would take you there

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.449 
amazing on what it would take you there
so<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:32.930> got<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.110> two<00:02:33.349> piece<00:02:33.560> style<00:02:33.890> case<00:02:34.190> here

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
so it's got a two piece style case here

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.150 
so it's got a two piece style case here
that<00:02:34.489> pops<00:02:35.330> apart<00:02:35.780> at<00:02:35.930> least<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.260> should<00:02:36.500> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
that pops apart at least it should and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.350 
that pops apart at least it should and
she<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:37.549> sees<00:02:37.670> come<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:37.940> Lightning

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
she just sees come the Lightning

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.270 
she just sees come the Lightning
protector<00:02:38.930> there<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:39.349> pretty<00:02:39.530> durable<00:02:39.920> and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
protector there it's pretty durable and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.280 
protector there it's pretty durable and
thick<00:02:40.580> when<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.879> comes<00:02:41.090> down<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.690> now<00:02:41.870> on

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
thick when it comes down to it now on

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.990 
thick when it comes down to it now on
the<00:02:42.349> bottom<00:02:42.560> here<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.280> have<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.640> ability<00:02:43.970> to

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
the bottom here we have the ability to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.759 
the bottom here we have the ability to
see<00:02:44.239> how<00:02:44.269> much<00:02:44.569> powers<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.260> looks<00:02:45.500> like<00:02:45.590> we

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
see how much powers and it looks like we

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.470 
see how much powers and it looks like we
don't<00:02:45.860> have<00:02:46.130> any<00:02:46.250> power<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.090> actually

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
don't have any power this is actually

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.910 
don't have any power this is actually
been<00:02:47.569> seeing<00:02:47.780> our<00:02:47.989> shelf<00:02:48.290> for<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.560> little<00:02:48.739> while

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
been seeing our shelf for a little while

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.620 
been seeing our shelf for a little while
so<00:02:49.250> that's<00:02:49.549> probably<00:02:49.910> why<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.150> doesn't<00:02:50.360> have

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
so that's probably why it doesn't have

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.289 
so that's probably why it doesn't have
any<00:02:50.750> power<00:02:51.099> but<00:02:52.099> it<00:02:52.280> has<00:02:52.430> two<00:02:52.610> standby<00:02:53.060> switch

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
any power but it has two standby switch

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.170 
any power but it has two standby switch
where<00:02:54.079> you<00:02:54.200> can<00:02:54.349> switch<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:54.799> on<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.400> off<00:02:55.489> to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
where you can switch this on and off to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.880 
where you can switch this on and off to
determine<00:02:56.599> if<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.019> want<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.290> send<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.620> power

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
determine if you want to send the power

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.520 
determine if you want to send the power
to<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.730> unit<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.360> then<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.019> course<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.349> have

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
to the unit and then of course you have

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.410 
to the unit and then of course you have
your<00:03:00.560> major<00:03:01.129> case<00:03:01.430> with<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.730> battery<00:03:02.060> built

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
your major case with the battery built

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.600 
your major case with the battery built
into<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.900> here<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.890> what<00:03:04.099> we're<00:03:04.220> going<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.370> take

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
into it here so what we're going to take

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.199 
into it here so what we're going to take
and<00:03:04.879> do<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.709> put<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.750> put<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.959> iPhone<00:03:09.590> 5s<00:03:10.370> into

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
and do is put the put the iPhone 5s into

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.850 
and do is put the put the iPhone 5s into
the<00:03:11.299> device<00:03:11.480> or<00:03:11.660> I'm<00:03:12.170> assuming<00:03:12.590> this<00:03:12.680> is

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
the device or I'm assuming this is

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.750 
the device or I'm assuming this is
iPhone<00:03:13.250> 5<00:03:13.549> but<00:03:14.510> an<00:03:14.959> iPhone<00:03:15.350> 5s<00:03:15.709> will<00:03:16.160> work<00:03:16.430> for

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
iPhone 5 but an iPhone 5s will work for

beautifully done and it looks good and

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.840 
beautifully done and it looks good and
it<00:03:21.410> doesn't<00:03:21.620> create<00:03:22.069> too<00:03:22.130> much<00:03:22.400> bulk

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
it doesn't create too much bulk

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.360 
it doesn't create too much bulk
what's<00:03:23.000> nice<00:03:23.180> it's<00:03:23.450> got<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.630> nice<00:03:23.840> rounded<00:03:24.410> kind

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
what's nice it's got a nice rounded kind

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.520 
what's nice it's got a nice rounded kind
of<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.579> soft<00:03:25.849> finish<00:03:26.120> back<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:27.049> makes<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.380> so

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
of a soft finish back that makes it so

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.839
