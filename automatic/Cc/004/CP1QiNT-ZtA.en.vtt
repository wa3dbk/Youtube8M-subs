00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.359 
hilarious to fight very light-hearted
nothing<00:01:09.240> too<00:01:09.390> serious<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.650> moment<00:01:10.979> after<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
nothing too serious the moment after the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.490 
nothing too serious the moment after the
fight<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
fight was a little here there because it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
fight was a little here there because it
was<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.740> mainly<00:01:13.890> them<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.460> lounging<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
was just mainly them just lounging and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.170 
was just mainly them just lounging and
relaxing<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.530> whatnot<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:18.000> they

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
relaxing and whatnot I like how they

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
relaxing and whatnot I like how they
were<00:01:18.360> hinting<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> whole<00:01:19.259> movie<00:01:19.830> Z

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
were hinting at the whole movie Z

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
were hinting at the whole movie Z
because<00:01:20.490> probably<00:01:20.729> right<00:01:21.210> after<00:01:21.360> these

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
because probably right after these

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.749 
because probably right after these
events<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.140> where<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> film's<00:01:23.159> he<00:01:23.369> starts

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
events is where the film's he starts

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.390 
events is where the film's he starts
which<00:01:24.020> technically<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.320> not<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:26.130> let

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
which technically would not really let

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.920 
which technically would not really let
it<00:01:26.549> work<00:01:26.700> into<00:01:27.000> Canon<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.600> don't<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.810> how

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it work into Canon so I don't know how

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
it work into Canon so I don't know how
that's<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.290> play<00:01:28.350> maybe<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:29.280> Oda

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that's going to play maybe just Oda

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.490 
that's going to play maybe just Oda
actually<00:01:30.240> isn't<00:01:30.390> letting<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.110> canon

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
actually isn't letting this be canon

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.280 
actually isn't letting this be canon
because<00:01:31.799> from<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> way<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.299> portrayed

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
because from the way it was portrayed

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.270 
because from the way it was portrayed
again<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> haven't<00:01:34.890> seen<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> movie
