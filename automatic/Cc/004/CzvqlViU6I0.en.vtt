00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.460
 I'm happy and looking for more 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.250
 want to succeed more have more success with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 the team personally and I just look for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.220
 that was not waiting for anything 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.490
 I just wanted to enjoy wanted 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.289
 to feel important again and here what 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.259
 I got 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.269
 and I'm very good, I do not have anything else 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.089
 what to say I am very well I had already said 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.410
 that I felt very well in the preseason 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:36.870
 that started in a way and I think that 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.500
 it has been noticed that I feel good 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.000
 physically and with desire that the most 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.630
 important that I do not mind being 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.330
 playing every game 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.070
 and while it is if good sign that 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.380
 you're physically okay that does not have 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.930
 injuries and try to contribute to each 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.790
 party as much as I can because 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.030
 name so it represents the club and 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.739
 the stadium is the party that you want most 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.650
 I think he has everyone but I think 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.770
 that we are in the champions that the three 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.150
 rivals are difficult and you have to 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.920
 enjoy these moments you have to 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.960
 take the opportunity that we have of 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.500
 can the champions that does not pass all the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.680
 days and give the maximum and enjoy but to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.940
 the time demand us and believe in our 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.780
 possibilities because I think the team 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.080
 can fight to pass the round and what 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 let's try is positive that is in 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.890
 all that the training has 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.210
 options to choose from and that the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.790
 competition in the team be 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.830
 that is stronger and better I think that 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.130
 when we are all the level will go up 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.490
 and let's hope it's soon because 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.500
 we need all the players and the 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.830
