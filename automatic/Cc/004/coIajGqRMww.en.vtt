00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 welcome to the edge of the cup tv I am 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.520
 blogger and today we are going to talk about the 20 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.520
 years of power rangers 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.250
 in the 80's the businessman higgins aba 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.310
 tried to bring the united states into super 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.539
 Japanese sentai called neighborhood but in a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.980
 producer who buys because they 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.390
 found that the American public is a 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.699
 prejudice on the part of all 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.810
 characters and Japanese and I found until 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.580
 he was on set 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.109
 then a few years later he founded 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.110
 his own company to save the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.350
 drew bought the rights of super sentai 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.020
 different called Japanese and the rangers and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.040
 brings a mix of Japanese and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.260
 american 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.840
 then all Japanese scenes of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.510
 fights are Japanese and all scenes without 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.920
 The character's costume clothes are 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.210
 living the day to day of them are scenes 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 original american 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.140
 Paulo then it is actually a hybrid 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.570
 American and Japanese 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.609
 then because of the scenes that are not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.859
 fight to be totally american 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.699
 the pot has nothing to do with the series 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.100
 original 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.630
 so much that if you realize the people 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.880
 work when it is transformed from 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.520
 pink front of the season 1 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.060
 she does not have it because in the series 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.880
 Last 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.140
 is not a yellow flag is is an entity 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.000
 yellow 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.890
 this model of American series mix 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.930
 for the Polish woman, it was so certain that the room 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 tried to do other series beyond 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.270
 power rangers to mix the two 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.770
 genres 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.229
 she tried doing and I think pt 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.700
 based on three different facts 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.740
 online marketing is also based rider 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.810
 and turned focus is based on the fighter 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.549
 only different than the series 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 they did not revenge they were really well 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.939
 ebb timbu was the power 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.829
 rangers 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.540
 this first season actually are 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.439
 three seasons in Haiti for the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.950
 rangers 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.259
 it lasted three years and from there everything 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.649
 year they began to do a good of 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.210
 new with new theme a different name 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.729
 renewing the series every year as it is 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.500
 made in japan because in haiti it shows a 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.750
 power rangers in season one 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.759
 they used about 2 cents 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.530
 non-violence and of India 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.319
 that's why the white rangers is a 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.239
 Tiger Not Dinosaur Like That Team 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.970
 was in 1996 then the first to 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.459
 Anderson finished and had a miniseries of 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.040
 only two episodes he called more 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.480
 dies and beautiful where we 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.370
 chase after your powers that you 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.280
 are lost while we were 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.930
 speaking already ps defending the land 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 Actually the show was pretty weak. 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.950
 No one really liked it but she gets one. 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.769
 next prelude that would be paulo engel 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.959
 which is based on the Japanese rangers then 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.090
 the first seasons in the form of candle 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.830
 are intertwined with history 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.209
 characters because a link passes the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.950
 power for the next generation 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.230
 but the space-to-series projection is one 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.610
 linearity of the series will be 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.010
 intertwined with my parents had 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.530
 repeated characters all be part of 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.390
 one thing only after that the room will not 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.560
 gave up integrating the series 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.630
 I think it 's mostly easier 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.880
 because in Japan there is no interconnection between 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.700
 faithful and achieves a totally 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.860
 addiction with the exception of one episode 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.600
 every season has when the blood 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.310
 meets the previous season 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.440
 besides those meetings that have already invested in 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.030
 Previous season you now find 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.560
 during the entire history of the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.060
 flamengo will start 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.400
 They were days in space and meet 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.410
 the ninja turtles they fight with her 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.980
 but until it emerges in space and helmet is 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.480
 crazy 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.600
 in the first season is the line 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.340
 trade will see that it is walking and 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.190
 eternally red episode 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.030
 they face a villain who actually 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.829
 are the victor box but are not the blogs 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.000
 It's just their clothes and this episode. 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.049
 totally red 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 in fact the special episode the 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.709
 first episode of birthday for the 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.239
 rangers who had collaborated 10 years 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.500
 franchise of all indictments 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.350
 have appeared to fight alongside 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.819
 in all my friends but died 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.470
 while sleeping on the grill 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.560
 a lot of people did not like it because it is not 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.519
 the red rangers as to the difference 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 none 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.299
 it was at that time also for the same 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.950
 space that was reproducing a concept 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.870
 original created specially for them 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.720
 that there were no Japanese 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.920
 inspired by an old Japanese series 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.359
 the dae nam 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.400
 but it is actually a new concept that 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.200
 are for leisure that is an armor 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.720
 especially used by one hundred and red that 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.910
 made him absolutely strong that way 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.709
 a relationship so special for so many people 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.620
 that it lasts until today 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.810
 not to mention that Japan itself liked the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.470
 point to catch the project leader 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.750
 and use a caring film of theirs 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.880
 so it 's not just another American who 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.380
 take Japanese heavy police as well 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.540
 borrowed from america 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.580
 a few years later he stopped redemption 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.500
 and the big one in fact this series is that 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.930
 they have created the rangers themselves want to see 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.570
 Titanic does not exist in Japanese version 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.060
 after that it's walls created games are 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.700
 two times it was in the ufpb that they 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.530
 have created a special squadron that is the 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.020
 squadron with his strength his art of 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.210
 police and in the parana no longer appears 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.860
 search the jungle when they create 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.220
 spirit that are three tents that 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.200
 are the top 90 masters in 2001 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.400
 It was not going very well. 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.710
 the franchise was not giving enough 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.820
 money and she sold all rights 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.400
 all she had 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.810
 At Disney then companies started to 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.360
 be produced by disney from 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.979
 2001 with a ninja power storm 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.570
 at that time says not only to have 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.240
 greatly improved the quality of the footage 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.800
 started filming in new zealand 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.750
 introduce a new concept that was that 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.820
 the unprocessed rangers in their 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.970
 also had powers of attorney. 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.260
 so they were super fast super store 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.240
 audience of the series unfortunately she fell 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.140
 compared to what formerly so much 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.900
 that in 2007-15 of them even decided 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.760
 stop to do the spreadsheets and spoke 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.470
 make the series become a cartoon 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.320
 From there the franchise follows 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.900
 but the idea did not go out of paper and disney 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.120
 did a few more seasons thought until 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.070
 in remastering season not 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.470
 only on tv did she do it 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.150
 only it did not work and she episode 32 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.020
 canceled that no one was like this 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.639
 then in 2010 she did not have not have 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.270
 more rights for me says she returned 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:04.840
 I thought it was important that 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.180
 new production and compared this morals 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.039
 The difference now is that the series is not 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.900
 one more season only due to the 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:13.750
 episode they see the series in two 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.120
 past parts that the main series that 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.280
 is the samurai for example and the second 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.979
 part that the super then this wall and 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.100
 overpriced as mega-strong and that 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:26.500
 In addition, they returned with the 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.330
 original music of the old cars 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.580
 Even for people who are not there the day has been 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.750
 adapted problem obviously then in 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.380
 2013 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.270
 pass debuted last season until 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.060
 now produced from paulo skaf for the 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.410
 power megaforce season that goes 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.020
 continue continuing now in February 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.640
 They call a named one for the rangers 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.560
 super megan fox the series is a 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.660
 20th anniversary celebration of the franchise is 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.270
 based on represent us bokai see that 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.720
 was the celebration of 35 years of the series 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.040
 then this series will be more 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.700
 nostalgia for people who like paulo 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.670
 because they will have a super mega force 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.110
 they have the keys since they 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.419
 can turn into any day of the 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.850
 past and all other 19 years for the 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:11.620
 index the old actors will appear 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.090
 they will be able to use the organs the weapons 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.910
 the powers that everything that was of the Indians 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.280
 without telling that they promised last 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:21.669
 episode or next to it will have a 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.890
 a special episode in which all the 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:25.710
 priests will be active in the 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.810
 same time voting 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:31.150
 if you want to watch power rangers or 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.040
