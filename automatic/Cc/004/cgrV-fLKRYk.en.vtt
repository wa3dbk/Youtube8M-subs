Hello my lovely viewers, I'm Kanak and welcome
to Kanak's Kitchen. Today i will be showing

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.660
you how to prepare flavoured potato wedges.
These are crusty and oven baked wedges. In

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.939
this the potato wedges are first tossed with
lots of herbs and spices with some olive oil

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.750
in it and then they are baked into the oven
until tender. These are perfect as an appetizer

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.120
with some dip on the side or even as a side
dish with any kinds of meals or soups. So

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.809
let's see what all things you will be needing
for this.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.809
First, pre heat the oven at 200 degree celcius
for around ten minutes. Here I have cut each

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.160
potato into half length wise and then I have
cut each half into four equal sized wedges.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.009
So each potato will give eight wedges and
I have put them into salted boiling water

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.740
just for four to five minutes and then I have
removed them out. Now patdry all the potato

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.740
wedges with the kitchen towel or a napkin
and keep it aside. Next, in a bowl stir in

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.770
the olive oil along with some black pepper,
red chilly flake, oregano, thyme, rose merry,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.450
ginger garlic crushed, fresh parseley and
onion powder and mix everything well to make

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:42.410
a good marinate out of it. Now I am going
to put in the potato wedges into this marinate

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.679
along with very little salt and give everything
a good mix until all the potatoes are properly

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:00.679
coated with the herbs and the marinate. Lastly
I am going to mix in the dry parmesan cheese

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:12.459
and again mix everything well. Now these are
nicely coated and ready to go in the oven.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.680
Now place the potato wedges evenly on the
baking sheet lined with the foil. Be sure

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.459
to space them out a bit so that they are cooked
uniformly. Now I am going to put this into

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.459
the oven and bake for around twenty to twenty
five minutes at 180 degress celcius or until

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:38.799
they are tender when pierced with a fork.
Now its been done, now remove them. You can

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.209
see how lovely they look. I am going to serve
them hot with the mayo dip. So my flavouredful

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.069
and oven baked potato wedges are ready. As
you can see they have come out very good with

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.569
golden brown color on top because of the different
herbs and olive oil we have used over here.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.069
These are a perfect alternative to fatty french
fries. Here I am serving this with the mayo

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.489
dip today. If you can you can also serve this
with some ketchup on the side or if you want

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.319
you can make any other cream cheese dip of
your choice. So do try this and let me know
