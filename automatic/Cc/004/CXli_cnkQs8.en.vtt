00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.450 
guy in Matthews who can come in he can
fit<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.320> seemingly<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.160> he's<00:00:59.430> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
fit in seemingly and he's a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
fit in seemingly and he's a
plug-and-play<00:00:59.789> type<00:01:00.359> guy<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.960> oh<00:01:01.260> by<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.440> way

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
plug-and-play type guy and oh by the way

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.340 
plug-and-play type guy and oh by the way
he's<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> very<00:01:02.309> good<00:01:02.760> lineman<00:01:03.210> very<00:01:03.690> versatile

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
he's a very good lineman very versatile

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.770 
he's a very good lineman very versatile
very<00:01:04.589> strong<00:01:05.040> book<00:01:05.670> equally<00:01:06.270> good<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.659> both

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
very strong book equally good in both

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
very strong book equally good in both
the<00:01:06.990> running<00:01:07.320> game<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.710> pass<00:01:08.010> blocking<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the running game and pass blocking I

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760 
the running game and pass blocking I
think<00:01:09.420> even<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.110> than<00:01:10.260> Greg<00:01:10.500> Robinson

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
think even more so than Greg Robinson

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.580 
think even more so than Greg Robinson
the<00:01:11.580> safest<00:01:12.240> pick<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.869> draft<00:01:12.930> maybe<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the safest pick in this draft maybe a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.380 
the safest pick in this draft maybe a
ceiling<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.490> big<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.790> glad<00:01:15.000> Greg

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
ceiling is not as big as glad Greg

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.590 
ceiling is not as big as glad Greg
Robinson<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.530> certainly<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.100> solid<00:01:17.729> guy<00:01:17.939> going

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
Robinson but certainly a solid guy going

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.030 
Robinson but certainly a solid guy going
to<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> veteran<00:01:19.140> offense<00:01:19.560> who<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:19.950> he's

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to a veteran offense who I think he's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
to a veteran offense who I think he's
going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> fit<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.549> nicely<00:01:20.790> there<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.689> Atlanta

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
going to fit in nicely there in Atlanta

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560 
going to fit in nicely there in Atlanta
Atlanta<00:01:22.619> gets<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> guy<00:01:23.369> offensive<00:01:24.180> lineman
