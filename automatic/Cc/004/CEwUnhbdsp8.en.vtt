00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.940
 Hello, I'm Ronny Winkler yours 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.290
 personal chef many of you 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.119
 are always looking for space 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.769
 hopes so who computer program you 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:13.539
 helping to develop an action 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.219
 and you probably do not know 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.750
 how wonderful that also with microsoft 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.340
 word works there namely 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.320
 a lot of helpful feature to this 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.640
 theme I show you this time in this 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.220
 little tutorial here 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.440
 and I have a lesson in detail 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.620
 prepared and now I am writing in 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.000
 this file ideas me to a new one 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.370
 history come to the senses 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.659
 I really write it like this 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.710
 I can think of it now, too 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.409
 no connection 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.359
 I just write down as well 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.309
 you would do that in everyday life too 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.719
 The only important thing is I give every idea 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:49.179
 a short and crisp headline here 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.339
 For example, I have the thought of 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.139
 a moment in the story in that 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.139
 my hands are fighting with a monster 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:59.199
 So the headline big fight then 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:01.359
 What else will I do that, okay? 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.930
 the girl so the heroes of mine 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.610
 history fights with a monster because 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.980
 Of course it makes a person off 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.390
 wants to free danger to life 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.950
 So I'm writing this in too 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.950
 my file into it 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.860
 maybe years later 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.640
 of course also a moment of tension 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:40.210
 speak the monster lures the girl in 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:43.630
 a fall and how do we do that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.259
 closer the monster attracts the heroes 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.810
 my story in a fall by him 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.340
 so days with girls realize that 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 Maybe not even now 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.600
 two points maybe something is missing 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.600
 another one 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.020
 Also, why does that happen? 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.070
 All clear the starting situation 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.950
 man floats in danger of death and a 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.940
 maybe even then it will be enough 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.940
 to demonstrate this to you 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.570
 yes of course the rescue will be on 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.090
 at the beginning several people are sitting in 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.710
 a fall then it is the finished 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.660
 make it easy for us 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.010
 by way of exception for this little tutorial 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:44.820
 and say another helper leads to 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:49.990
 an unexpected solution and free 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:54.220
 the characters out of the trap 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.680
 so now i can do my individual 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.140
 I mark headlines 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.880
 up here on the state here 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.140
 predefined headings layout i 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.360
 mark the headings and 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.790
 then click on the headline that has 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.140
 a definite advantage for me 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.940
 can now if I have this 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.010
 Heading marked according to heading 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.860
 have 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.250
 above the view functions 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.610
 navigate the headlines me 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.959
 in the sidebar 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.320
 I can do the individual headlines 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.600
 now click and drag 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.470
 move 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.790
 the advantage is if i do that 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.890
 shifts the text 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.660
 which belongs to this heading in 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.970
 my document so i can mine 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.019
 ideas now without any back and forth 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.700
 to copy 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.680
 because bring a logical order 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.989
 I'll wait here for starting situations 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.640
 Rescue a trap is being prepared 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.080
 then comes the big fight and the 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.720
 hopeless situation and did that 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.610
 Solution and a story is done 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.190
 That's a really great possibility 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.720
 to arrange your thoughts ideas 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.329
 Sort and add to a story 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.170
 come and who clearly has it now 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.610
 find out 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.340
 what it is about is namely the 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.739
 history led to well I hope 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.720
 tutorial helped you and we see 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.720
