00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello friends after a year without videos 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.299
 what January , returned with a 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.429
 article on pirate consoles 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.590
 good let's start with the well-known 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.540
 pop station this console is one of the most 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.759
 similar in terms of details except 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.650
 for some things like for example the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.690
 keys to be and they were changed from 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.250
 instead replaced the buttons to 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 raise and lower the volume were 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.640
 replaced by a button that you say 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.920
 although the volume goes down or goes up 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.140
 depending on how many times you press it 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.330
 and you could mute the game they added the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.399
 Reset button to reset has only 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.320
 one game uses double batteries and the least 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.460
 visible to the eye the quality of the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 screen is not the same xd xd xd xd 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.890
 xddddd xd xd xd xd xddddd xd me 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.200
 I forgot one detail the triggers have 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.360
 disappeared and there are many versions 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.610
 from this console we will continue with the fan 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.649
 station this is also similar 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.320
 there are a lot of mistakes in this as 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.149
 example on the lid instead of putting ps1 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.070
 there is a logo that puts fan stage are the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.140
 controls change a lot lacks 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.910
 quality and the most disappointing waiting 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.979
 at least have a disk slot at 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.690
 open the lid you find a slot for 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.580
 cartridge and not discs that is here 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.830
 they are and they also included a gun 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 to play one day and another bad thing ni 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.790
 It is even compatible with cartridges 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.100
 Nintendo only accepts the cartridges 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.380
 pirated of it we have also 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.360
 found with another similar console the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 wii wii or the pirate wiki we can 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.080
 observe the changes there is no slot for 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.150
 discs but instead they put 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.190
 something blue there are no buttons like those in the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990
 normal wii on the front side but that 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.970
 on one side there are buttons 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.100
 similar to those of the playstation the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.080
 drivers are different includes a 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.000
 two hands control and you already have all 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.130
 the included plugins and there is a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.230
 game included in cartridge called wii 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.940
 wii sports go ridiculous but so 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.130
 least has kept the controls 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.260
 wireless is a small reason why 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.450
 which one wishes to acquire some 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.490
 time you did a nintendo dsi not the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.590
 I got this then I bought a 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.450
 neo the ball game the differences are 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.790
 the following buttons are 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.710
 practically the same there are two screens 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.840
 but unlike the pop stage they are 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.760
 these and change the games has the game 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.040
 of the pop station and a very game 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.810
 funny called street fighter x from 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.820
 the screen below does not serve as 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.610
 only that would serve would be to save the 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.620
 another game 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.450
 screen is of the minimum quality is not 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.550
 can close well is one of the worst 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.860
 consoles of the world and the buttons are from 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.960
 very bad quality is also at peseta 3 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.090
 the most ridiculous pirate console in this 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.160
 Needless to say differences as 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.930
 with a little pause in the video the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.270
 they can notice and if they thought that pop 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.550
 station had finished think about it better 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.440
 because he already reached psp station but in 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.690
 go version this has improved a lot in 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.730
 As pirated, it slips from 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.530
 up and down the buttons are almost 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.270
 same except that it does not have 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.250
 analog stick and improving the 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.200
 pirated is that it has cartridges we give 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.180
 thanks to the pirates who gave us a 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.100
 best chance of pirates in a few 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.110
 years the pirate consoles will be like 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.870
 normal right now before I go 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.940
 we will compare the psp go against pspv 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.739
 let's see, we will analyze console in box 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.780
 console just removed from the packaging and 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.000
 console open in box are very 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.890
 similar except for the pcpe that has 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.630
 the points that the box contains 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.520
 come out they only have different ones 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.290
 wifi ignition switches 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.390
 disappeared and the sonny button 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.040
 disappeared and open are also what 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.470
 same except for the analog stick 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.270
 Good to say goodbye and commemorate my 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.250
 new video what repels of this 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.860
 although your mom returned the iphone because 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.860
 he said he did not bring keyboard xd xd xd
