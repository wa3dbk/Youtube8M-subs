00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
anything like that that this seed does

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.130 
anything like that that this seed does
have<00:00:44.340> some<00:00:44.700> cool<00:00:44.879> diamonds<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.510> let's<00:00:46.020> go

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
have some cool diamonds so let's go

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.350 
have some cool diamonds so let's go
ahead<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.820> mark<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.090> yeah<00:00:48.329> that

ahead and mark it with that yeah that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.840 
ahead and mark it with that yeah that
bat<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.890> sure<00:00:50.039> signal<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.489> back<00:00:50.610> but

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
bat that will sure signal to be back but

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.590 
bat that will sure signal to be back but
um<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.699> show<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> guys<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.390> looks

um just show you guys what this looks

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.650 
um just show you guys what this looks
like<00:00:54.660> without<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.649> course<00:00:56.270> skipping<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.539> know

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
like without of course skipping you know

like without of course skipping you know
the<00:00:57.840> great<00:00:58.140> part<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.859> nice<00:00:59.070> little

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the great part there is a nice little

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.660 
the great part there is a nice little
ocean<00:00:59.489> around<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.829> outskirts<00:01:01.829> well<00:01:02.370> most<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
ocean around the outskirts well most the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
ocean around the outskirts well most the
outskirts<00:01:03.090> are<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.359> few<00:01:03.510> ponds<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.080> such<00:01:04.290> it's

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
outskirts are a few ponds and such it's

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.469 
outskirts are a few ponds and such it's
a<00:01:04.890> little<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.610> bit<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.850> slow<00:01:06.119> water

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
a little bit a little bit of slow water

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.760 
a little bit a little bit of slow water
over<00:01:06.750> there<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.110> other<00:01:07.229> than<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.619> is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
over there but other than that this is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
over there but other than that this is
just<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.130> fairly<00:01:09.000> flat<00:01:09.330> seed<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> lot<00:01:10.140> of

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
just a fairly flat seed with a lot of

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.350 
just a fairly flat seed with a lot of
building<00:01:10.560> space<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> ton

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
building space like there you have a ton

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 
building space like there you have a ton
of<00:01:12.390> building<00:01:12.750> space<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.770> also<00:01:13.890> has<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
of building space but it also has a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
of building space but it also has a
great<00:01:14.909> great<00:01:15.630> value<00:01:15.869> probably<00:01:16.500> great<00:01:16.680> like

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
great great value probably great like

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.950 
great great value probably great like
excavation<00:01:17.400> value<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.659> few

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
excavation value to it there are a few

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.539 
excavation value to it there are a few
valleys<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.590> hills<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> cool<00:01:20.340> stuff<00:01:20.490> like

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
valleys and hills and cool stuff like

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.080 
valleys and hills and cool stuff like
that<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.119> will<00:01:21.390> jump<00:01:21.780> back<00:01:21.840> down<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.920> our

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
that but I will jump back down to our

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.700 
that but I will jump back down to our
blah<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.780> was<00:01:25.080> weird<00:01:25.470> how<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
blah what and that was weird how I

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.710 
blah what and that was weird how I
thought<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:27.000> weird<00:01:27.360> okay<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
thought that was that was weird okay so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.819 
thought that was that was weird okay so
yeah<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.970> will<00:01:30.090> go<00:01:30.299> down<00:01:30.630> underground<00:01:31.470> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
yeah so we will go down underground to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.910 
yeah so we will go down underground to
show<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.100> guys<00:01:32.400> why<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> would<00:01:33.840> probably<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
show you guys why you would probably you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.249 
show you guys why you would probably you
know<00:01:35.090> more<00:01:36.090> often<00:01:36.210> than<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> try<00:01:37.140> out

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
know more often than not want to try out

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.690 
know more often than not want to try out
the<00:01:37.380> seat<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.680> course<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.520> has

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the seat of course that's because it has

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.719 
the seat of course that's because it has
easy<00:01:39.630> access<00:01:39.930> diamonds<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.979> that's<00:01:41.490> always

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
easy access diamonds and that's always

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.969 
easy access diamonds and that's always
the<00:01:42.119> best<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.630> want<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> try<00:01:43.259> doing<00:01:43.409> more<00:01:43.680> seeds

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the best I want to try doing more seeds

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.590 
the best I want to try doing more seeds
or<00:01:44.250> variation<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.909> kind<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.210> different<00:01:45.479> seeds

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
or variation of kind of different seeds

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.450 
or variation of kind of different seeds
although<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.649> population<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.280> only

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
although really in population the only

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.830 
although really in population the only
thing<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.850> ever<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.180> look<00:01:48.450> for<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
thing you can ever really look for is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.109 
thing you can ever really look for is
extreme<00:01:49.680> hills<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.189> diamonds<00:01:50.700> under<00:01:50.880> spawn

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
extreme hills or diamonds under spawn

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.300 
extreme hills or diamonds under spawn
there's<00:01:51.360> no<00:01:51.479> caves<00:01:51.869> there's<00:01:52.320> no<00:01:52.619> there's<00:01:53.250> no
