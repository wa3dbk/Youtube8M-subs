00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
folding collaboration with a knife and

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.160 
folding collaboration with a knife and
eraser<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.100> know<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.449> really<00:00:48.780> common

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
eraser and I know just not really common

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.960 
eraser and I know just not really common
is<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> years<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.040> have<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.519> kitchen

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
is all the years I have in the kitchen

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.460 
is all the years I have in the kitchen
to<00:00:51.809> use<00:00:52.229> as<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.190> utility<00:00:53.729> knife<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.839> also<00:00:55.290> bring

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
to use as a utility knife and also bring

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.900 
to use as a utility knife and also bring
it<00:00:55.589> into<00:00:55.769> something<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.430> can

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it into something that can

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it into something that can
use<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.600> tactical<00:00:58.110> knife

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
use as a tactical knife

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.800 
use as a tactical knife
so<00:00:59.530> there<00:00:59.740> are<00:00:59.800> two<00:00:59.920> variations<00:01:00.340> of<00:01:00.970> the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
so there are two variations of the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.560 
so there are two variations of the
eraser<00:01:02.230> there<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.460> satin<00:01:03.970> finish<00:01:04.330> blade

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
eraser there is the satin finish blade

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.710 
eraser there is the satin finish blade
with<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.800> silver<00:01:06.340> bolsters<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.240> contour

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
with the silver bolsters and the contour

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.650 
with the silver bolsters and the contour
black<00:01:07.900> g10<00:01:08.350> handles<00:01:08.800> and<00:01:09.220> also<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.330> all-black

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
black g10 handles and also the all-black

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.260 
black g10 handles and also the all-black
Lane<00:01:10.990> is<00:01:11.350> partially<00:01:11.890> serrated<00:01:12.220> with<00:01:13.120> the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
Lane is partially serrated with the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.780 
Lane is partially serrated with the
black<00:01:13.479> holsters<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.860> black<00:01:15.040> g10<00:01:15.370> candles

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
black holsters and the black g10 candles

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.969 
black holsters and the black g10 candles
now<00:01:16.570> there's<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.080> lot<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.260> things<00:01:17.530> going<00:01:17.860> on

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
now there's a lot of things going on

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.320 
now there's a lot of things going on
this<00:01:18.190> night<00:01:18.369> first<00:01:18.670> of<00:01:18.790> all<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.030> flip

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
this night first of all that the flip

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.270 
this night first of all that the flip
can<00:01:20.020> be<00:01:20.170> mounted<00:01:20.320> in<00:01:20.800> four<00:01:21.070> different

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
can be mounted in four different

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.510 
can be mounted in four different
directions<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.720> righty<00:01:22.930> lefty<00:01:23.440> tip<00:01:24.130> up<00:01:24.310> and

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
directions for righty lefty tip up and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.620 
directions for righty lefty tip up and
tip<00:01:24.700> down<00:01:24.880> Keri<00:01:25.240> that's<00:01:26.200> also<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:26.950> lock<00:01:27.220> feature

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
tip down Keri that's also a lock feature

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.990 
tip down Keri that's also a lock feature
that<00:01:28.630> allows<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.619> liner<00:01:29.890> lock<00:01:30.160> to<00:01:30.460> be<00:01:30.610> locked

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
that allows the liner lock to be locked

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.520 
that allows the liner lock to be locked
in<00:01:31.300> so<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.720> can<00:01:31.869> be<00:01:32.410> accidentally<00:01:33.100> disengage

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
in so you can be accidentally disengage

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.440 
in so you can be accidentally disengage
now<00:01:35.530> this<00:01:35.770> knife<00:01:36.040> does<00:01:36.490> work<00:01:36.759> on<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.149> flipper

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
now this knife does work on the flipper

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.800 
now this knife does work on the flipper
mechanism<00:01:38.200> so<00:01:38.740> all<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.070> do<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.640> push<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.630> back

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
mechanism so all you do is push the back

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.469 
mechanism so all you do is push the back
of<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.140> of<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.130> flipper<00:01:42.610> mechanism<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.450> the

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
of the of the flipper mechanism and the

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.330 
of the of the flipper mechanism and the
plane<00:01:44.080> opens<00:01:44.530> up<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:45.460> there's<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.390> lot<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.810> edge

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
plane opens up and there's a lot of edge

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.190 
plane opens up and there's a lot of edge
on<00:01:48.340> this<00:01:48.640> knife<00:01:48.880> for<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.210> full<00:01:49.479> inch<00:01:49.720> blade

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
on this knife for a full inch blade

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.249 
on this knife for a full inch blade
there's<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.920> lot<00:01:51.160> of<00:01:51.190> cutting<00:01:51.580> edge<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
there's a lot of cutting edge and the

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.100 
there's a lot of cutting edge and the
tip<00:01:53.530> is<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.800> reverse<00:01:54.250> tanto<00:01:54.880> che<00:01:54.910> so<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.899> full

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
tip is a reverse tanto che so the full

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.770 
tip is a reverse tanto che so the full
thickness<00:01:56.380> or<00:01:56.680> play<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.190> only<00:01:57.780> almost

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
thickness or play is only almost

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.529 
thickness or play is only almost
suitable<00:01:59.560> so<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.039> thickness<00:02:00.550> gives<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.360> lot

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
suitable so the thickness gives it a lot

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.680 
suitable so the thickness gives it a lot
of<00:02:01.690> strike<00:02:01.990> while<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:02.920> edges<00:02:03.520> extremely<00:02:04.090> fine

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
of strike while the edges extremely fine

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.980 
of strike while the edges extremely fine
then<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:05.380> can<00:02:05.650> do<00:02:05.799> some<00:02:06.010> fun<00:02:06.450> catastrophe<00:02:07.450> and

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
then you can do some fun catastrophe and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.249 
then you can do some fun catastrophe and
because<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.590> flipper<00:02:08.920> mechanism

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
because of the flipper mechanism

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.890 
because of the flipper mechanism
and<00:02:10.409> is<00:02:10.739> always<00:02:10.979> protected<00:02:11.700> I'm<00:02:12.150> sliding<00:02:12.510> onto

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and is always protected I'm sliding onto

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.110 
and is always protected I'm sliding onto
the<00:02:13.140> edge<00:02:13.349> and<00:02:14.099> those<00:02:14.430> are<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.640> features<00:02:15.090> that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the edge and those are the features that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.910 
the edge and those are the features that
really<00:02:15.780> make<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.260> thing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
really make this thing
