00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
but I went downstairs and I saw that I

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.509 
but I went downstairs and I saw that I
got<00:00:05.040> another<00:00:05.850> pair<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.420> my<00:00:06.839> J<00:00:07.410> bud<00:00:07.649> or<00:00:07.890> jlab

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
got another pair of my J bud or jlab

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.290 
got another pair of my J bud or jlab
audio<00:00:08.910> j<00:00:09.269> buds<00:00:09.840> j5<00:00:10.740> that's<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.519> lot<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.759> days<00:00:12.059> I

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
audio j buds j5 that's a lot of days I

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.629 
audio j buds j5 that's a lot of days I
headphones<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> figured<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.460> would

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
headphones in so I figured I would

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.829 
headphones in so I figured I would
actually<00:00:14.730> do<00:00:15.030> there<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> little<00:00:15.360> bit<00:00:15.480> older

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
actually do there a little bit older

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.689 
actually do there a little bit older
because<00:00:15.990> they<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> pair<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.740> j<00:00:16.949> sixes<00:00:17.400> but

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
because they have a pair of j sixes but

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.510 
because they have a pair of j sixes but
most<00:00:18.390> people<00:00:18.630> still<00:00:18.840> opt<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.380> getting<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.980> j5

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
most people still opt to getting the j5

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.810 
most people still opt to getting the j5
so<00:00:20.880> i<00:00:20.939> figure<00:00:21.150> i'd<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> little<00:00:22.400> unboxing<00:00:23.400> you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
so i figure i'd do a little unboxing you

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.420 
so i figure i'd do a little unboxing you
know<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.840> box<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.470> not<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.310> an

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
know it's not a box it's not like an

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.810 
know it's not a box it's not like an
envelope<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.119> i<00:00:27.650> would<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.460> well<00:00:29.519> as

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
them from dinging all over the place a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.000 
them from dinging all over the place a
little<00:02:24.319> bit<00:02:24.409> better<00:02:24.590> when<00:02:24.709> you're<00:02:24.859> working

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
little bit better when you're working

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.349 
little bit better when you're working
out<00:02:25.340> or<00:02:25.489> something<00:02:25.670> like<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.790> these<00:02:26.239> are

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
out or something like that these are

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.149 
out or something like that these are
great<00:02:26.599> for<00:02:26.900> their<00:02:27.379> notice<00:02:27.730> cancelling<00:02:28.730> so

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
great for their notice cancelling so

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.770 
great for their notice cancelling so
watching<00:02:31.159> they<00:02:31.519> said<00:02:31.760> noise<00:02:32.030> reducing<00:02:32.599> I

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
watching they said noise reducing I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.089 
watching they said noise reducing I
don't<00:02:33.019> think<00:02:33.139> that<00:02:33.170> as<00:02:33.349> our<00:02:33.469> noise<00:02:33.709> cancelling

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
don't think that as our noise cancelling

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.099 
don't think that as our noise cancelling
salt<00:02:34.370> like<00:02:34.569> built<00:02:35.569> into<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.139> but<00:02:36.889> it's<00:02:37.760> more<00:02:38.109> so

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
salt like built into it but it's more so

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.679 
salt like built into it but it's more so
I<00:02:39.139> just<00:02:39.379> hit<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.889> camera<00:02:40.159> but<00:02:40.340> it's<00:02:40.819> more<00:02:41.120> just

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
I just hit the camera but it's more just

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.080 
I just hit the camera but it's more just
the<00:02:42.049> fact<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.290> they're<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.709> ear<00:02:43.040> headphones

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the fact that they're in ear headphones

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.750 
the fact that they're in ear headphones
alone<00:02:44.090> will<00:02:44.569> make<00:02:44.599> them<00:02:44.980> much<00:02:45.980> better<00:02:46.219> for<00:02:46.519> if

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
alone will make them much better for if

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.399 
alone will make them much better for if
you<00:02:46.909> don't<00:02:47.060> want<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.269> hear<00:02:47.419> everything<00:02:47.840> else

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
you don't want to hear everything else

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.429 
you don't want to hear everything else
that's<00:02:48.590> going<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.939> I<00:02:50.269> can't<00:02:50.900> really<00:02:51.109> show

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
that's going on so I can't really show

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.379 
that's going on so I can't really show
you<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.709> whole<00:02:51.889> length<00:02:52.189> but<00:02:52.669> it's<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.359> very

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
you the whole length but it's a very

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.000 
you the whole length but it's a very
long<00:02:53.810> board<00:02:54.109> never<00:02:54.500> going<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.739> have<00:02:54.829> an<00:02:54.919> issue

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
long board never going to have an issue

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.009 
long board never going to have an issue
with<00:02:55.129> that<00:02:55.250> they<00:02:55.969> have<00:02:56.150> kind<00:02:56.689> of<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.840> unique

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
with that they have kind of a unique

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.319 
with that they have kind of a unique
separator<00:02:57.889> in<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.189> middle<00:02:58.489> which<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.939> nice<00:02:59.090> it

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
separator in the middle which is nice it

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.929 
separator in the middle which is nice it
takes<00:02:59.959> it<00:03:00.199> and<00:03:00.319> then<00:03:00.439> separates<00:03:00.859> it<00:03:01.040> into<00:03:01.099> two

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
takes it and then separates it into two

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.879 
takes it and then separates it into two
but<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:02.359> a<00:03:02.389> little<00:03:02.510> bit<00:03:02.659> thicker<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.199> bigger

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
but it's a little bit thicker and bigger

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
reducing earbuds so you're not going to

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.719 
reducing earbuds so you're not going to
get<00:04:23.659> that<00:04:23.870> with<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.229> apple<00:04:24.560> headphones<00:04:24.740> or

get that with the apple headphones or
earbuds<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.569> said<00:04:27.310> because<00:04:28.310> they<00:04:28.520> don't<00:04:28.699> go

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
earbuds I said because they don't go

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.029 
earbuds I said because they don't go
into<00:04:29.090> your<00:04:29.539> ear<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:30.110> there's<00:04:30.319> no<00:04:30.500> sort<00:04:30.830> of

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
into your ear so there's no sort of

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.420 
into your ear so there's no sort of
canceling<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.240> other<00:04:32.750> noises<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:34.009> you<00:04:34.069> do<00:04:34.280> have

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
canceling of other noises so you do have

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.830 
canceling of other noises so you do have
to<00:04:34.580> turn<00:04:34.759> everything<00:04:35.030> up<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.509> like<00:04:35.719> the

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840
