and possibly having a better match
victoriously<00:00:29.699> against<00:00:30.029> Brock<00:00:30.269> rather<00:00:30.929> than<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
victoriously against Brock rather than a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.080 
victoriously against Brock rather than a
throwaway<00:00:31.679> match<00:00:31.769> with<00:00:32.189> sting<00:00:32.489> who<00:00:32.700> wrestles

Undertaker will prove which he really
doesn't<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.739> he<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.270> much<00:00:42.450> more

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
doesn't have to that he is so much more

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.630 
doesn't have to that he is so much more
than<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> streak<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.890> generation<00:00:44.280> of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
than the streak to this generation of

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.750 
than the streak to this generation of
fans<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.329> would<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.200> would<00:00:47.190> not<00:00:47.579> do<00:00:47.700> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
fans what would you do I would not do a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.160 
fans what would you do I would not do a
rematch<00:00:48.120> between<00:00:48.570> Undertaker<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.110> Brock

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.650 
rematch between Undertaker and Brock
Lesnar<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.920> tell<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.219> much<00:00:50.600> part<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
Lesnar I can tell you that much part of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.029 
Lesnar I can tell you that much part of
it<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:51.899> their<00:00:52.289> first<00:00:52.530> match<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.770> no

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it is because their first match was no

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.639 
it is because their first match was no
good<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.520> that's<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.960> main<00:00:55.140> reason<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
good but that's not the main reason the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.220 
good but that's not the main reason the
main<00:00:55.800> reason<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.899> rematch

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
main reason is you don't have to rematch

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.840 
main reason is you don't have to rematch
everybody<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.550> babyface

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
everybody you know like if a babyface

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.330 
everybody you know like if a babyface
loses<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> match<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.350> okay<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> rematch

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
loses a match it's okay not to rematch

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.750 
loses a match it's okay not to rematch
them<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> whole<00:01:03.300> even-steven<00:01:03.870> deal

them and do the whole even-steven deal
in<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.909> way<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> kind<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> fact<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
in a way I kind of like the fact that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.560 
in a way I kind of like the fact that
the<00:01:07.350> Undertaker<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.820> loss<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.390> Brock

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that Brock went over on him he was the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.510 
that Brock went over on him he was the
stronger<00:01:12.450> guy<00:01:12.720> he's<00:01:13.020> younger<00:01:13.380> he's<00:01:13.920> stronger

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
stronger guy he's younger he's stronger

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.410 
stronger guy he's younger he's stronger
he's<00:01:14.909> bigger<00:01:15.299> he's<00:01:15.570> faster<00:01:16.939> physically<00:01:17.939> right

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
he's bigger he's faster physically right

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.240 
he's bigger he's faster physically right
now<00:01:18.450> today<00:01:18.930> he's<00:01:19.290> better<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.680> every

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
now today he's better in every

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
now today he's better in every
conceivable<00:01:20.490> way<00:01:20.909> than<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> Undertaker<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
conceivable way than the Undertaker is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
conceivable way than the Undertaker is
the<00:01:22.530> Undertaker<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.310> would<00:01:23.970> say<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the Undertaker I would say the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
the Undertaker I would say the
Undertaker<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:24.930> starting<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.560> show<00:01:25.770> his

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
Undertaker is now starting to show his

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.620 
Undertaker is now starting to show his
age<00:01:26.130> realistically<00:01:26.820> he's<00:01:27.090> been<00:01:27.270> showing<00:01:27.420> his

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
age realistically he's been showing his

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.080 
age realistically he's been showing his
age<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> few<00:01:28.470> years<00:01:28.850> he<00:01:29.850> looked

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
age now for a few years he looked

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.289 
age now for a few years he looked
particularly<00:01:30.570> old<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.590> year<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.150> that's

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
particularly old this year and so that's

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.640 
particularly old this year and so that's
why<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.600> there's<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:33.960> least<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.229> chance<00:01:34.259> he

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
why I think there's at least a chance he

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.580 
why I think there's at least a chance he
has<00:01:34.799> wrestled<00:01:35.220> his<00:01:35.340> last<00:01:35.549> match<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.240> you

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
has wrestled his last match I'm with you

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.120 
has wrestled his last match I'm with you
actually<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.619> don't<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:37.979> actually

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
actually I don't know if you actually

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.499 
actually I don't know if you actually
believe<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.820> or<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.420> think

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
believe this or not but I think

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.270 
believe this or not but I think
Undertaker<00:01:40.200> has<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.560> wrestled<00:01:40.950> his<00:01:41.040> last

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
Undertaker has not wrestled his last

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310 
Undertaker has not wrestled his last
match<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:42.240> he<00:01:42.360> does<00:01:42.540> come<00:01:42.750> back<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.200> they<00:01:43.259> do

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
match if he does come back and they do

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
match if he does come back and they do
the<00:01:43.530> match<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.950> sting<00:01:44.250> fine<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.060> think<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the match with sting fine I think it's a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.760 
the match with sting fine I think it's a
big<00:01:45.600> attraction<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.290> no<00:01:46.409> problem<00:01:46.560> with

that or you can put him in the ring with
somebody<00:01:49.920> else<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.610> would<00:01:51.090> not<00:01:51.210> put<00:01:51.240> him<00:01:51.479> in

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the following month at night of

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.479 
the following month at night of
champions<00:02:32.569> which<00:02:33.140> is<00:02:33.260> why<00:02:33.379> i<00:02:33.440> think<00:02:33.560> i<00:02:33.920> could

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
champions which is why i think i could

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.070 
champions which is why i think i could
see<00:02:34.730> him<00:02:34.910> winning<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.480> then<00:02:35.569> dropping<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
see him winning it and then dropping it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.199 
see him winning it and then dropping it
right<00:02:36.230> back<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.950> Cena<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.640> rematch<00:02:37.970> the

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
right back to Cena in a rematch the

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.610 
right back to Cena in a rematch the
month<00:02:38.390> after<00:02:38.720> which<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.989> think<00:02:39.170> would<00:02:39.260> be<00:02:39.379> a<00:02:39.410> big

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
month after which I think would be a big

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.729 
month after which I think would be a big
mistake<00:02:40.120> but<00:02:41.120> unless<00:02:42.019> you<00:02:42.170> can<00:02:42.349> get<00:02:42.500> him<00:02:42.530> in

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
mistake but unless you can get him in

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.430 
mistake but unless you can get him in
for<00:02:42.920> more<00:02:43.069> dates<00:02:43.540> how<00:02:44.540> realistic<00:02:44.959> that<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.410> I

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
for more dates how realistic that is I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.640 
for more dates how realistic that is I
don't<00:02:45.709> know<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.880> however<00:02:47.480> they<00:02:47.810> handle<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.260> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
don't know so however they handle it the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.979 
don't know so however they handle it the
point<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.069> champion<00:02:49.910> or<00:02:50.030> no<00:02:50.120> champion<00:02:50.630> Brock
