00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
trying to get the point and I would just

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.719 
trying to get the point and I would just
use<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:52.200> corner<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> little<00:01:53.520> tiny

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
little piece that normally I wouldn't

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.340 
little piece that normally I wouldn't

bother because you get streaks with the
wedge<00:01:58.530> tip<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.280> when<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.430> use<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> brush<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
wedge tip but when you use the brush you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.319 
wedge tip but when you use the brush you
can<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> get<00:02:01.200> streaks<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:03.149> work

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
can not to get streaks if you work

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.250 
can not to get streaks if you work
quickly

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.600 

and<00:02:09.260> then<00:02:09.350> if<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.530> let<00:02:09.650> it<00:02:09.740> dry<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.310> then<00:02:10.400> you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
and then if you let it dry and then you

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.580 
and then if you let it dry and then you
go<00:02:10.700> over<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:11.150> there<00:02:11.450> will<00:02:11.570> be<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.780> streak<00:02:12.170> as

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.670 
don't have one I have a fine tip which
obviously<00:02:43.780> he's<00:02:44.780> doing<00:02:45.050> nice<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:47.470> spin<00:02:48.470> line

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
obviously he's doing nice I spin line

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.600 
obviously he's doing nice I spin line
and<00:02:50.530> then<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:52.130> same<00:02:52.340> as<00:02:52.610> with<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.850> Copic<00:02:53.600> a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
and then the same as with the Copic a

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.350 
and then the same as with the Copic a
wedge<00:02:55.610> tip<00:02:56.000> which<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:56.780> slightly<00:02:57.410> larger<00:02:57.860> and

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.880 

now<00:03:02.360> this<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:02.870> where<00:03:03.020> my<00:03:03.110> opinion<00:03:03.590> kind<00:03:03.800> of

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
now this is where my opinion kind of

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.760 
now this is where my opinion kind of
switches<00:03:04.340> with<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.210> with<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.020> wedge<00:03:06.410> because

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
switches with the with the wedge because

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.680 
switches with the with the wedge because
on<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.190> pro<00:03:07.430> markets<00:03:07.850> i<00:03:08.000> will<00:03:08.150> use<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.540> wedge

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
on the pro markets i will use the wedge

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.820 
on the pro markets i will use the wedge
because<00:03:08.990> as<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.290> can<00:03:09.440> see<00:03:11.410> there<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.680> no

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
because as you can see there is no

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.400 
because as you can see there is no

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.880

and blending the coolpix are the best

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.190 
and blending the coolpix are the best
because<00:03:54.620> they<00:03:55.280> stay<00:03:55.520> wet<00:03:55.790> for<00:03:56.090> longer<00:03:56.390> whereas

early sinister disease these are all my
opinion<00:04:01.850> nobody<00:04:02.180> else's<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:03.050> might<00:04:03.200> have

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
opinion nobody else's so you might have

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.870 
opinion nobody else's so you might have
a<00:04:03.320> different<00:04:03.500> experience<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:04.610> is<00:04:04.730> my

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
a different experience this is my

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.949 
a different experience this is my
opinion<00:04:06.519> now<00:04:07.519> if<00:04:07.850> you're<00:04:08.180> on<00:04:08.269> a<00:04:08.330> budget<00:04:08.360> i

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
opinion now if you're on a budget i

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.870 
opinion now if you're on a budget i
would<00:04:09.320> say<00:04:09.560> go<00:04:09.860> for<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.100> pro<00:04:10.250> markers<00:04:10.670> because

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
would say go for the pro markers because

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.160 
would say go for the pro markers because
you've<00:04:11.180> only<00:04:11.330> get<00:04:11.510> used<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.810> using<00:04:11.989> them<00:04:13.090> and

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
you've only get used to using them and

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.240 
you've only get used to using them and
they<00:04:15.170> are<00:04:15.320> good<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:15.710> the<00:04:15.830> color<00:04:16.039> can

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
they are good but the color can

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.279 
they are good but the color can
sometimes<00:04:16.580> come<00:04:16.789> out<00:04:16.910> darker<00:04:17.390> than<00:04:18.229> it

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
sometimes come out darker than it

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:26.580 
sometimes come out darker than it
actually<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.890> until<00:04:19.669> it's<00:04:19.820> dried

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.650 

earlier<00:04:27.590> when<00:04:27.770> they<00:04:27.920> dried<00:04:28.270> that's<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.450> core

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
earlier when they dried that's the core

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.510 
earlier when they dried that's the core
pick<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.140> that<00:04:30.380> is<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.920> pro<00:04:31.250> marker<00:04:33.340> but<00:04:34.340> yeah

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
pick and that is the pro marker but yeah

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.640 
pick and that is the pro marker but yeah
um<00:04:35.230> personally<00:04:36.230> I<00:04:36.940> like<00:04:37.940> them<00:04:38.210> both<00:04:38.240> but<00:04:38.750> for

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
um personally I like them both but for

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.550 
um personally I like them both but for
coloring<00:04:40.240> co<00:04:41.240> picked<00:04:41.540> and<00:04:42.170> that's<00:04:42.350> what

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
coloring co picked and that's what

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.780 
coloring co picked and that's what
you're<00:04:42.710> probably<00:04:42.860> going<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.280> be<00:04:43.400> using<00:04:43.580> them

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
you're probably going to be using them

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.860 
you're probably going to be using them
for<00:04:43.990> if<00:04:44.990> it's<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.350> small<00:04:45.470> area<00:04:45.860> then<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.870> the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
for if it's a small area then and the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.040 
for if it's a small area then and the
pro<00:04:48.020> markers<00:04:48.410> are<00:04:48.530> good<00:04:48.710> but<00:04:49.610> if<00:04:50.030> you're<00:04:50.720> doing

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
pro markers are good but if you're doing

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.800 
pro markers are good but if you're doing
a<00:04:51.200> large<00:04:51.410> area<00:04:51.860> such<00:04:52.160> as<00:04:52.190> hair<00:04:52.760> or<00:04:53.090> skin<00:04:53.420> on<00:04:53.750> a
