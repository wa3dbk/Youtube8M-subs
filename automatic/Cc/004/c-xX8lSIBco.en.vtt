00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.170
 I think it's fair companions and 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.519
 compañeras that the people of puerto rico 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.450
 and in the legislative record 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:07.450
 consigned the following 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.400
 some senators of the minority have 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.400
 accused the majority 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.890
 of not giving him the opportunity 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.230
 here some senators of the minority have 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.570
 made accusations against 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.560
 presidency and they have gone to court and 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.400
 have failed on all occasions 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.109
 and I have to tell you today 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.720
 that when the popular party 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.930
 notified 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.660
 I wanted to vary the procedure as 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.760
 lawyer that I am 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.650
 and taking responsibility 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.770
 constitutional that I have as president 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.820
 this body interpreter that they were 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 missed in the popular party 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.460
 and file a writ of judgment 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.400
 declaratory for it to be the court 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.570
 whoever decided according to the right to 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.300
 who was entitled to the seat because 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.760
 the lord and today fellow senator angel 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.070
 Rodríguez otero had communicated 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.720
 that he understood that it belonged to him 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.450
 the seat for precisely the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.369
 jurisprudence and the applicable law 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.369
 and I had the popular party 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.810
 formally notifying me that they wanted 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.550
 fill the vacancy in a different way 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.800
 and had another Puerto Rican 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.960
 who plays in a game different from mine 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.960
 that competes with what competed and 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.240
 compete against party mates 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.240
 but I decided not to deny him the opportunity 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.940
 and recently we saw how in a forum 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.240
 public 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.840
 the governor was asked 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.729
 to look at carlos cruz decide 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.110
 alleging that he had been dismissed by 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.690
 law 7 when a person 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.310
 that he had a transitory room that 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.550
 he left the popular party and that his period 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.340
 He won in May 2009, I say 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.950
 today look at the angel angel face 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.710
 butt and tell them that you denied him 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.930
 the opportunity look at the knee otero 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.460
 and you called him a traitor and that 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.580
 they tried to violate their rights as 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.530
 senator look them in the face and tell them 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.440
 that you do not want it here and that 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.180
 they preferred another senator and by the way 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.100
 apologize because they were 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.950
 wrong in right 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.370
 there is fear look 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.040
 so to classmates this 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.650
 president has been fair to those of 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.200
 majorities and with minorities and the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.110
 mate rodríguez otero today is 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.709
 sitting there because we went to court and 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.640
 we asked the court to decide and 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.640
 the court decided
