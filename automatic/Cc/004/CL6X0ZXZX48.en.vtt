 I can do this for 13 euro 99 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.340
 already on pc as well as playstation 3 and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.950
 xbox 360 caused the undead to 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.840
 plenty of goose bumps and the ios 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.290
 version stands for horror pure 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.300
 and that is only meant positively in 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.579
 walking dead the game is about 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.930
 do not play around with zombie as often 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.930
 an action title 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.280
 rather, it is a kind 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.070
 interactive movie a text adventure 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.140
 where you decide how to spend it 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.899
 The game is based on a comic book 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.270
 Series by Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.190
 which already in a cult 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.110
 TV series was processed 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.880
 the world exists as we know it 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.950
 not much more was the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.930
 world domination of zombies taken over 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.880
 and the surviving humans fight 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 only to survive naked 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.740
 the game now shows you a new one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.000
 strand of action in this universe so 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.950
 named the control over the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.350
 prisoners leveret the one at 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.330
 crossing with the police car into one 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.939
 accident gets involved and free 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.509
 henceforth to survive among the undead 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.509
 fight 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.560
 the gameplay will turn you off all the time 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.170
 changing perspectives shown quite so 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.180
 like in a movie you control 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.580
 as if by an invisible virtual 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.620
 analog-stick interesting things people 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.480
 and objects are highlighted and 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.790
 you can do it with a simple tip 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.860
 open doors to unlock things 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.480
 look at the window or talk to others 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.120
 but the real game is 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.030
 less run and tackle but 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.410
 especially from interactive 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.270
 between sequences and dialogues themselves 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.280
 Imminent battles are being fought by the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.410
 tension-building music sent 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.030
 initiated so that you are often banned 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.560
 in front of his touchscreen squats with 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.300
 sweat beads on the forehead 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.460
 just to get through the next moment 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.290
 Desperate step &amp; vision against one 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.290
 to defend hungry undead 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.330
 in dialogues with other people 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.580
 you determine the direction of the conversation 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.530
 by your choice answer a 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.580
 run down 'currently balten worries 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.080
 that you during yours 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.770
 decisions additionally under pressure 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.920
 devices 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.050
 that's both positive and negative 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.209
 because this adventure form of 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.940
 interactive and non-interactive 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.130
 between sequences is quite a bit 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.440
 uniquely intense and very 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.630
 become atmospheric at the same time 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.739
 but also the length produces the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:11.420
 players often only in one 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:13.459
 The comic graphic is pushing the audience 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.340
 looks excellent she is very 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.410
 detailed and crispy hot, though 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.120
 not yet optimized for iphone 5 the 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.860
 Speech output is excellent and the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.989
 ingenious soundscape you should 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.190
 necessarily on headphones or one 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.050
 enjoy the plant 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.390
 Unfortunately, the game is completely up 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.190
 english so the game is only for the 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.660
 I recommend the language of this 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.660
 are reasonably powerful 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.010
 red 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.400
 No 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.400
 magath 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:08.030
 my conclusion walking dead the game is for 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.040
 personally an absolute highlight 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.330
 I like the television series and I think so 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.940
 the mood was from the game 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.060
 excellently captured the whole game 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.700
 concept stands out beneficially from others 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.959
 adventures and other ios are titled and 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.030
 I was especially happy about it 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.250
 that the title clearly refers to one 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.620
 adult targeting is directed among the 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.910
 all ios kerschl so far does this 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.740
 really good 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.810
 It did not bother me that the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.000
 Control sometimes a bit hakelig and the 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.650
 camera is not optimal and also the 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.419
 frequent spectator role in the game 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.860
 I rather than welcome 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.010
 varied 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.750
 I can start walking dead so all 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.870
 adult players on harder 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.370
 adventure plus are only recommend as 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.470
 it looks like you have the game 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.950
 already played or the television series 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.050
 seen 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.570
 I look forward to yours as always 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.790
 Thank you for watching and see you 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.790
 next time 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.790
 fabian 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.540
