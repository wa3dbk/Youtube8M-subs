Hogan would be posing with savages wife

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.090 
Hogan would be posing with savages wife
I<00:00:42.329> think<00:00:42.690> anybody<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.079> Macho<00:00:43.469> Man<00:00:43.620> shoes<00:00:43.890> would

I think anybody in Macho Man shoes would

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.680 
I think anybody in Macho Man shoes would
have<00:00:44.129> felt<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> same<00:00:44.700> way<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> always<00:00:45.090> said

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
have felt the same way I always said

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.020 
have felt the same way I always said
Hulk<00:00:46.410> Hogan<00:00:46.829> when<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.370> look<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.940> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
Hulk Hogan when you really look at it in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.830 
Hulk Hogan when you really look at it in
that<00:00:48.350> storyline<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.340> real<00:00:50.579> heel<00:00:50.969> because

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
that storyline was the real heel because

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
that storyline was the real heel because
the<00:00:52.140> way<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.469> guy<00:00:52.680> would<00:00:52.920> act<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.789> it

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the way this guy would act I think it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
the way this guy would act I think it
was<00:00:54.000> when<00:00:54.180> they<00:00:54.690> won<00:00:54.870> their<00:00:55.020> Survivor<00:00:55.440> Series

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
was when they won their Survivor Series

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.580 
was when they won their Survivor Series
match<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.219> 88<00:00:56.510> Savage<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.930> beaten<00:00:58.379> down

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
match in 88 Savage was just beaten down

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.830 
match in 88 Savage was just beaten down
badly<00:00:59.160> by<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.309> heels<00:00:59.640> Hogan<00:01:00.120> wins<00:01:00.300> Hogan's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
badly by the heels Hogan wins Hogan's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.290 
badly by the heels Hogan wins Hogan's
celebrating<00:01:01.500> he<00:01:01.920> picks<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.399> Elizabeth<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
celebrating he picks up Elizabeth I

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.880 
celebrating he picks up Elizabeth I
think<00:01:03.870> he<00:01:03.960> may<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.110> had<00:01:04.229> his<00:01:04.439> hand<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.769> her

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
think he may have had his hand on her

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
think he may have had his hand on her
ass<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.309> mean<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:06.180> Randy<00:01:06.540> Savage<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.020> want<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
ass I mean if I'm Randy Savage I want to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810 
ass I mean if I'm Randy Savage I want to
tear<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.470> guy's<00:01:07.770> head<00:01:07.979> off<00:01:08.010> his<00:01:08.220> shoulders

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
tear this guy's head off his shoulders

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
tear this guy's head off his shoulders
so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> think<00:01:09.960> Savage<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.979> this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
so I think Savage in this in this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.859 
so I think Savage in this in this
storyline<00:01:11.460> had<00:01:11.850> every<00:01:12.090> reason<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.630> jealous

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
storyline had every reason to be jealous

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.660 
storyline had every reason to be jealous
and<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.350> always<00:01:13.590> looked<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.860> Hogan<00:01:14.220> almost<00:01:14.520> as

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
and I always looked at Hogan almost as

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.770 
and I always looked at Hogan almost as
the<00:01:14.790> heel<00:01:15.799> but<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.909> folklore<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the heel but you know folklore has it

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
the heel but you know folklore has it
that<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:19.950> Elizabeth's<00:01:20.460> idea<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that it was all Elizabeth's idea the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.219 
that it was all Elizabeth's idea the
whole<00:01:21.500> concept<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> mega<00:01:23.009> powers

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
whole concept of the mega powers

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.499 
whole concept of the mega powers
alliance<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:25.619> them<00:01:26.369> breaking<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
alliance and then them breaking up and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.179 
alliance and then them breaking up and
having<00:01:27.720> Elizabeth<00:01:28.320> really<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> driving

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
having Elizabeth really be the driving

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.039 
having Elizabeth really be the driving
force<00:01:29.369> between<00:01:29.790> them<00:01:30.150> supposedly<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.900> all

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
force between them supposedly was all

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
force between them supposedly was all
her<00:01:31.229> idea<00:01:31.259> which<00:01:31.799> if<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> was<00:01:32.189> she<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> very
