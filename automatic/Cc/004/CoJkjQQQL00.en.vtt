00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
is not in bad condition we try to slide

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.060 
is not in bad condition we try to slide
our<00:01:44.820> paper<00:01:45.210> under<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.470> brittle<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
our paper under there it's so brittle it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.130 
our paper under there it's so brittle it
it<00:01:47.700> won't<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.149> too<00:01:48.210> far<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:48.990> you're

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it won't go too far but if you're

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.649 
it won't go too far but if you're
sliding<00:01:49.430> if<00:01:50.430> you're<00:01:50.670> sliding<00:01:50.880> 10<00:01:51.270> here's<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
sliding if you're sliding 10 here's the

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.889 
sliding if you're sliding 10 here's the
idea<00:01:52.729> there's<00:01:53.729> no<00:01:53.909> staples<00:01:54.210> holding<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> wire

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
idea there's no staples holding the wire

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.760 
idea there's no staples holding the wire
here<00:01:55.229> back<00:01:55.439> when<00:01:55.649> they<00:01:55.770> did<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.659> used

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
here back when they did this they used

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.120 
here back when they did this they used
very<00:01:58.770> nails<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.200> wire<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.890> no

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
very nails so this this wire is see no

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.969 
very nails so this this wire is see no
no<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.240> an<00:02:03.360> odd<00:02:03.540> wire<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.380> stucco<00:02:04.710> but

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
no this is an odd wire for stucco but

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.590 
no this is an odd wire for stucco but
I've<00:02:05.159> seen<00:02:05.430> every<00:02:05.670> type<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.000> wire<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.450> could

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
I've seen every type of wire you could

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.330 
I've seen every type of wire you could
know<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:07.320> right<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.649> you're<00:02:07.799> shoving<00:02:08.160> this

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
know all right so you're shoving this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.479 
know all right so you're shoving this
tin<00:02:09.270> flashing<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.649> will<00:02:10.890> hit<00:02:11.459> a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
tin flashing in there you will hit a

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.140 
tin flashing in there you will hit a
nail<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.000> question<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.420> when

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
nail the question is when

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.509 
nail the question is when
so<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.810> idea<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.319> they<00:02:14.590> they<00:02:15.040> put<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.340> tin

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
so the idea is they they put the tin

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.890 
so the idea is they they put the tin
flashing<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.150> there<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:16.480> they're<00:02:16.720> going<00:02:16.810> to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
flashing in there and they're going to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.180 
flashing in there and they're going to
hit<00:02:16.989> nails<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.709> there<00:02:17.799> when<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.040> hit<00:02:18.159> a

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
hit nails here and there when you hit a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.800 
hit nails here and there when you hit a
nail<00:02:18.370> well<00:02:18.730> you're<00:02:18.940> simply<00:02:19.269> not<00:02:19.299> going<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.659> go

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
nail well you're simply not going to go

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.839 
nail well you're simply not going to go
any<00:02:19.959> further<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.950> that's<00:02:21.250> what<00:02:21.459> they've<00:02:21.640> done

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
any further so that's what they've done

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.940 
any further so that's what they've done
here<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.299> over<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.260> years<00:02:23.470> I've<00:02:23.650> seen<00:02:23.680> this

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
here in over the years I've seen this

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.630 
here in over the years I've seen this
about<00:02:24.269> 30<00:02:25.269> times<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:25.959> again<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.950> tell<00:02:27.220> folks<00:02:27.489> if

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
about 30 times and again I tell folks if

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.490 
about 30 times and again I tell folks if
you're<00:02:27.730> comfortable<00:02:28.000> doing<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.540> do<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.080> but

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
you're comfortable doing it do it but

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.580 
you're comfortable doing it do it but
usually<00:02:30.329> best<00:02:31.329> ways<00:02:31.510> take<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:31.989> all<00:02:32.110> off

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
usually best ways take it all off

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.520 
usually best ways take it all off
or<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:32.950> shimmy<00:02:33.250> our<00:02:33.519> single<00:02:34.329> paper<00:02:34.569> under<00:02:35.319> here

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
or we shimmy our single paper under here

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.440 
or we shimmy our single paper under here
and<00:02:35.590> then<00:02:35.709> double<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.099> up<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.640> anyway<00:02:37.420> I

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
and then double it up so anyway I

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.509 
and then double it up so anyway I
thought<00:02:37.780> I'd<00:02:37.930> point<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.349> out<00:02:38.470> because<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:39.099> do

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
thought I'd point it out because I do

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.430 
thought I'd point it out because I do
see<00:02:39.849> this<00:02:40.030> pretty<00:02:40.239> often<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.079> common

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
see this pretty often and it's a common

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.970 
see this pretty often and it's a common
question<00:02:41.860> I'm<00:02:42.010> asked<00:02:43.000> as<00:02:43.750> far<00:02:44.049> as<00:02:44.230> our<00:02:44.530> screen

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
question I'm asked as far as our screen

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.190 
question I'm asked as far as our screen
where<00:02:45.160> do<00:02:45.250> we<00:02:45.340> put<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.700> well<00:02:46.060> this<00:02:46.750> street<00:02:47.079> is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
where do we put that well this street is

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.080 
where do we put that well this street is
going<00:02:47.349> to<00:02:47.410> go<00:02:47.590> underneath<00:02:48.099> this<00:02:48.430> existing

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
going to go underneath this existing

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.089 
going to go underneath this existing
flashing<00:02:49.599> right<00:02:50.290> here<00:02:50.470> where<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.709> diverter

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
flashing right here where the diverter

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.699 
flashing right here where the diverter
is<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:52.090> guy<00:02:52.299> here<00:02:52.569> is<00:02:52.599> a<00:02:52.690> diverter<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.470> water

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
is this guy here is a diverter the water

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.099 
is this guy here is a diverter the water
comes<00:02:54.010> here<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.400> diverts<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.910> into<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
comes here and it diverts it into the

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:56.460 
comes here and it diverts it into the
gutter

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
gutter

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.099 
gutter

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
so I'm going to be back at the diverter

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.530

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
and I always like to go above the roof

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.569 
and I always like to go above the roof
by<00:03:01.720> about<00:03:01.959> an<00:03:02.109> inch<00:03:02.319> anyway<00:03:03.069> when<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.310> get<00:03:03.459> to

that<00:03:03.670> stage<00:03:04.060> we're<00:03:04.930> doing<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.230> whole<00:03:05.500> roof

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
that stage we're doing this whole roof

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.670 
that stage we're doing this whole roof
but<00:03:06.129> for<00:03:06.489> just<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.879> sake<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.500> showing<00:03:08.500> you

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.990 
want my this flashing has got to come
over<00:03:53.230> there<00:03:53.530> step<00:03:54.250> flash<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.699> that's<00:03:54.819> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
over there step flash and that's the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.039 
over there step flash and that's the
most<00:03:55.180> important<00:03:55.720> thing<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:57.299> that's<00:03:58.299> priority

over everything that if water does go

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.960 
over everything that if water does go
through<00:04:02.769> here<00:04:03.040> we<00:04:03.160> want<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.579> drip<00:04:03.790> out

through here we want it to drip out

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.860 
through here we want it to drip out
harmlessly<00:04:04.540> through<00:04:04.870> these<00:04:05.019> drip<00:04:05.650> holes<00:04:05.919> so
