00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.910
 I have never had one 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.660
 Playstation because it always takes 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.719
 recognizable 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.610
 the games I have to do that now we 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.379

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.469
 more unpacked it last time 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.360
 ultimately shows so now I just have to 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.090
 let's see that I am here with micro and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.100
 camera and all in the world come clear 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.829
 and maybe somehow 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.280
 See what's in there now 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.399
 ok so you do not see much shit yet 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.350
 People of the war jet pipe a logistics 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.210
 problem 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.920
 the camera is being hedged and the same 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.000
 mikro it already with retired ok 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.159
 newspaper 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.790
 yes, we have two to send 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.159
 so i'll get package somehow 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.860
 out that's really the logistics 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:22.430
 hardest I pack so far 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.430
 hammer bill 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:37.060
 carton I go to dispose of shortly 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:39.940
 and there is already quite back there he is 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.960
 just not so playstation 3 package 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.170
 looks alright out there shining in 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:53.710
 So we want to be order 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:57.430
 the whole thing is the seal 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.620
 do not retain returned items intact 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.600
 we are looking forward to 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:07.720
 a price deduction with traces of use 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.450
 yes the rule is now 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.570
 Immediately no longer intact friends come 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.090
 you already can not see much 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.500
 At the moment I see it but I should 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.550
 do I first had to somehow 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.980
 Let's do it all, that's serious 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.560
 i mean seriously china once 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:34.660
 pointed out so come on yes yes okay 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.459
 I've opened is none 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.140
 the playstation 4 somehow becomes 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.660
 I know how many months came out 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.360
 I am doing an unboxing to playstation 3 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.950
 yes that was cool only that my unboxing 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.970
 I have never been completely bad 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.120
 such a logistic so I can you 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.739
 as show fits so well that pretty 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.220
 hard down there we will eventually 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.709
 in it 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.520
 and up here we have the device 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.100
 well in it 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.060
 ok I'll get out the more we do 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.709
 Unpack the smaller everything will be 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.470
 the better we can see that too 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:12.450
 in the video age like salad unpacking 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.590
 I am completely awkward but I am already 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.050
 I have to pack but I can 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.349
 so I expect times before pioneer 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.880
 this logistics problems have something like why 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:37.709
 I suddenly have logistical problems on it 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:42.410
 everything but after carton okay so then 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:45.840
 Here we have packaging with instructions 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.209
 We do not need packaging instructions 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.190
 So at least not now 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:57.330
 how unattractive we have a controller 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.650
 pro super that here is a Kontrollschacht 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.970
 I have something in my hand 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.799
 just as they did so well then 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.940
 So quite so of the's never gives what 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.120
 So I have a playstation 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.780
 gambled but oh my god that was it all 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.250
 I do not know any unusual place 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.070
 Maybe it's more like what's called, unfortunately 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.410
 I have my game pc patch since the 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.950
 is so basically imitation places 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.510
 link interesting but yes I have to say 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.970
 I had something interesting , too 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.950
 not okay so what else is there there 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.169
 are also cables in there where the first time 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.050
 get out 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:37.139
 this is sony playstation that is av 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:41.130
 Things can be done here that was there that is 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:45.200
 probably think for the controller 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:48.120
 I have the cable still a cable in it 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.470
 That's what you call a power cable 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.300
 I would say 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:57.419
 and something else in there av adapter dingens 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.560
 everything clearly so still something on cables 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.750
 or no 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.310
 okay so oh my god 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.160
 because everything has been going to break such a 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.440
 Package peel off are always for me 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.330
 like a state or not 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.620
 egg shell but the packaging from 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.670
 1 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:19.930
 so then we always want the good 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:24.020
 I'm sorry, I'm still alive 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.730
 Here's but this pretty easily so 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.670
 I would have a hard time harder for me 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:33.980
 presented so colleagues there we have that 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:38.630
 good playstation 3 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.410
 there, there, I have no idea 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.480
 from that 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.850
 that will be the first thing we have to do first 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.230
 watch but here come the cds 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:51.380
 it just looks like down here 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:54.880
 usb blu-ray is on it and her behind 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:59.000
 Hammer hammer power cable and everything 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:02.830
 all clear av multi also digital hdmi 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.790
 audio hdmi cable but also so jo 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.950
 I would say that is 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:11.210
 Playstation 3 arrived and I can 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:14.000
 initially to gamble with the controller and 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.220
 cabling or was it from today I pack 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.810
 from playstation 3 my friends 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.150
 That is not Japanese games 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.890
 searched and then soon forest is white 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.600
 Not if I'm good enough Japanese 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.400
 can then be the Japanese let's 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.110
 start play 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.450
 In that sense I want to say film too 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.450
 see you and nice until next time
