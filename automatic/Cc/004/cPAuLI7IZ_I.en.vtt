world I think the impact of the CSU in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.050 
world I think the impact of the CSU in
California<00:01:12.439> has<00:01:12.560> been<00:01:12.590> considerable<00:01:13.430> but<00:01:13.909> we

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
California has been considerable but we

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.520 
California has been considerable but we
did<00:01:14.210> not<00:01:14.329> have<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.509> lot<00:01:14.719> of<00:01:14.750> money<00:01:15.020> when<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.229> was

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
did not have a lot of money when I was

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.010 
did not have a lot of money when I was
growing<00:01:15.920> up<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.340> we<00:01:16.820> really<00:01:17.090> struggled<00:01:17.539> and

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
growing up and we really struggled and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.959 
growing up and we really struggled and
the<00:01:18.500> fact<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:18.799> I<00:01:18.890> had<00:01:19.070> access<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:19.670> this

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
system I would say the technological

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.630 
system I would say the technological
revolutions<00:01:35.630> in<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:35.869> last<00:01:36.109> 30<00:01:36.380> 40<00:01:36.499> years<00:01:36.799> have

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
revolutions in the last 30 40 years have

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.770 
revolutions in the last 30 40 years have
all<00:01:37.820> started<00:01:38.329> in<00:01:38.450> from<00:01:38.719> California<00:01:39.320> and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
all started in from California and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.390 
all started in from California and
than<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.500> rest<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.890> country<00:01:42.190> benefits

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
than the rest of the country benefits

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.100 
than the rest of the country benefits
and<00:01:42.820> now<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.360> rest<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.780> world<00:01:43.960> is

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
and now the rest of the world is

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.840 
and now the rest of the world is
benefiting<00:01:44.560> from<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.890> and<00:01:45.040> these<00:01:45.190> these

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
benefiting from it and these these

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.970 
benefiting from it and these these
technological<00:01:46.690> revolutions<00:01:47.260> really<00:01:47.740> come

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
technological revolutions really come

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.980 
technological revolutions really come
out<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:48.700> engineers<00:01:49.360> produced<00:01:49.780> by

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
out of the engineers produced by

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.080 
out of the engineers produced by
universities<00:01:50.710> like<00:01:50.950> Cal<00:01:51.070> State<00:01:51.310> LA<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.970> know

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
universities like Cal State LA you know

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.300 
universities like Cal State LA you know
but<00:01:52.330> I<00:01:52.360> don't<00:01:52.870> think<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.530> colleges<00:01:54.160> are

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
but I don't think that the colleges are

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.730 
but I don't think that the colleges are
really<00:01:54.550> getting<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.120> type<00:01:56.050> of<00:01:56.080> resources

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
really getting the type of resources

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.010 
really getting the type of resources
that<00:01:56.890> they<00:01:57.010> should<00:01:57.190> be<00:01:57.280> getting<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:58.570> us<00:01:58.690> to<00:01:58.870> be

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
that they should be getting for us to be

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.920 
that they should be getting for us to be

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
competitive in the global world we need

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.980 
competitive in the global world we need
to<00:02:02.080> have<00:02:02.290> access<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:03.250> campuses<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.090> programs
