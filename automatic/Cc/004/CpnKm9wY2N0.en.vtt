00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.110
 stars stories 71 how to bring 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.520
 to wiggle a universe into the universe 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.140
 last two follow the stones 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.520
 I have stories about the cosmic 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.910
 inflation is spoken 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.160
 in sequence 69, I explained why 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.160
 the modern big bang model ever 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.110
 If you have to come up with it, that's yours 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.000
 inflation phase must have taken place 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.770
 and in episode 70 I have about it 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.950
 what the inflation at all 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.720
 is and how it works 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.489
 everything indicates that ours 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.309
 universe immediately after his 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.230
 emergence during an unimaginable 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.690
 short period unimaginable fast 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.940
 has expanded and only after this 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.180
 inflationary phase has it with one 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.330
 Corpse wise temperate expansion 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.220
 began 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.990
 So the expansion we are today too 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.750
 can still see when we are the distant 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.340
 watching galaxies as I said you were 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.860
 convinced that have been so 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.270
 you have had many with the inflation 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.280
 Observation data are from 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.350
 can interpret and inflation 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.850
 also has to all other cosmological 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.090
 and particle physical theories 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.250
 Fit but there was no direct 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.770
 evidence for their existence and it is 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.020
 quite impossible appeared such 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.939
 to get evidence for the astronomers 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.619
 have it hard if they only 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.840
 normal things about the universe 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.390
 want to find out everything they do 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.549
 Can not look at them 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.380
 the stars and galaxies fly 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.880
 we can study a little in the lab 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.640
 You can only do it from afar 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.049
 look at it and hope for enough light 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.609
 collect from it similar 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.320
 to gain useful data 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.359
 in terms are the astronomers 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.939
 tremendously creative but at some point it is just 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:01.420
 End because the light at least in the 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.850
 astronomy utilizable form first existed 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.109
 almost 400,000 years after the big bang 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.909
 that is the cosmological 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.740
 background radiation from in the 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.620
 earlier consequences were already on the speech 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.590
 Only 400,000 years after the big bang was 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.660
 the universe cool enough for that to happen 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.130
 light could ever spread before that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.250
 it was opaque and the 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.860
 cosmological background radiation 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.240
 almost creates a curtain through the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.800
 astronomy can not see 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.920
 because before that there was no light that one 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.030
 could observe inflation found 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.540
 but it immediately after the big bang 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.880
 instead of 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.620
 the first light was only 400,000 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.980
 years later and the gap in between 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.880
 seems to be unbridgeable but she 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.490
 is not it 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.480
 at least not if we are not 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.410
 more on the light alone 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.420
 restrict 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.800
 we can not see each other 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.720
 immediately after the big bang happened 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.790
 But that's the thing that happened then 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.050
 are the effects that will 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.239
 quite well 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.500
 and the key to that is the 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.640
 gravitational waves the existence of 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.230
 gravitational waves the albert has 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.080
 einstein already almost 100 years ago 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.420
 predicted setting explains that 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.950
 cavitation no force is the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.959
 immediately and without loss of time 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.360
 conveys it is the ice newtons 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.739
 at that time thought gravitation 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.950
 Spreads at the speed of light 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.450
 out and there the gravitation einstein 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.030
 theory is a direct consequence of 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.100
 deformation of the room itself is also has 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.140
 their propagation with the deformation of the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.330
 to do space 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.040
 every mass bends the room and because of that 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.530
 Movement of bodies of the curvature of the body 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.570
 space people of the bill and so it will be 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.799
 a force acting a 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.360
 gravitational waves you can now 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.489
 a little bit like that 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.769
 Waves in the water gets from the stones 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.810
 pond then waves from there 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.910
 in all directions and the same 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.950
 generate certain events in the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.870
 universe gravitational waves are themselves 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.760
 spread out everywhere if for example 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.370
 two black holes collide or 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.799
 a big star then explodes 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.280
 the tremendous events that the 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.239
 Space itself was beginning to wobble 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.310
 theoretically you should measure something like that 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.810
 can and it will be tried too 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.850
 There are different experiments 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.769
 currently underway are those after the 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.320
 rhythmic upsets and stretching 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.239
 the space itself is searched for there 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.040
 effect but is quite small is one 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.489
 Direct evidence so far not yet 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.709
 successful 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.660
 indirectly, on the other hand, one has the effects of 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.570
 gravitational waves already observed and 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.820
 19 93 is even the nobel prize for 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.040
 want to lend physics 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.660
 the second key for the observation of the 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.729
 Cosmic inflation is the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.130
 background radiation itself the 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.330
 intensity of background radiation the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.189
 is not always accurate 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.169
 finally the spread of the radiation 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:39.990
 was yes of the matter at that time in the 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.120
 Universe was influenced and 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.729
 dense and less dense regions in the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.710
 early universe then have in more or 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.870
 less intense intensities of 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.099
 background radiation results when we 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.530
 So today the background radiation 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.689
 then we can watch pretty well 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.889
 see how the matter in the early 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.900
 universe was distributed 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.550
 there are regions where intensity 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.830
 density is there are regions bring 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.840
 this weakness is and that betrays and 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.759
 what about how the matter was distributed 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.830
 But there is another effect 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.199
 that we can observe and that is 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.940
 the polarization of light 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.229
 can be done in different ways 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.449
 swing and polarization 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.729
 simply describes in which 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.620
 direction the light waves swing 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.090
 minute the light waves on their way 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.009
 be distracted somehow then 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.840
 this influences the polarization 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.669
 one can as well as from the measurement of 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.560
 Polarization on the distribution in the 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.120
 the early universe close the 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.219
 complete details which are a bit 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.379
 complicated but you can do two 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.189
 different types of polarization 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.099
 distinguish 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:41.340
 the fashion of the scientists and e 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.960
 The mods are called b modes 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.520
 This is especially interesting for them 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.009
 to draw conclusions 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.300
 gravitational waves to gravitational waves 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.150
 can the distribution of matter 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.560
 influence and in turn 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.020
 influences the polarization of the light 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.000
 and if an event in history 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.039
 the universe is quite powerful 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.650
 then caused gravitational waves 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.479
 the cosmic inflation with the enormous 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.669
 fast expansion has what the whole 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.589
 Universe started to wobble 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.870
 and that has a whole matter 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:12.419
 certain distribution on coined and the 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.550
 resulting polarization the 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.810
 has a very concrete pattern that is 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.889
 from the theory of inflation 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.620
 predict 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.740
 So there is actually a concrete one 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.319
 Predict the existence of the 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.819
 inflationary phase follows and itself 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.889
 confirm by observations or 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.500
 you have to disprove this now 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.789
 only make observations 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.389
 Of course, that's not so easy 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.460
 how it sounds 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.080
 the technique of the instruments it only since 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.750
 some years far enough around the 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.209
 polarization of the background radiation 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.310
 really accurate but 2014 is 

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:46.590
 it actually succeeded these so-called 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.960
 prix medial ground 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.780
 really to watch so exactly 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.580
 the special polarization pattern there 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.590
 is also the gravitational waves bernd 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.350
 deflationary phase has been generated 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.510
 So it was successful until the big bang 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.340
 even looking back not only with 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.950
 not alone but also with the 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.170
 gravitation the observation of the pri 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.030
 medial ground was not only the first 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.280
 Real confirmation that the inflation 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.930
 Real is that was the first step 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.180
 towards a completely new kind of 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.310
 astronomy is not an astronomy 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.930
 more only duty is based but also on 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.640
 the observation of gravitational waves 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.710
 and hopefully soon 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.900
 someday also the direct proof of 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.520
 then gravitational waves succeed 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.750
 us completely new instruments and 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.730
 techniques available 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.990
 then our view is not over 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.330
 the curtain of background radiation 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.800
 then we can adjust until the 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.790
 Big Bang himself or maybe 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.680
 even beyond 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.840
 we can observe what we are doing today
