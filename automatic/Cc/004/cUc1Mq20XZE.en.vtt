00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 before throwing ourselves headlong into that 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.850
 that the internet has to offer us with fake 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.890
 every day we read these 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.200
 declarations of ski jackie morimoto a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.910
 about the two morimoto remake games 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.440
 first of all he made his mouth open to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.360
 wolf to all those who have registered 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.029
 to various championships around the world 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.830
 on pokemon hicks ey's wifi 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.050
 what we are interested in, however, concerns 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.269
 omega ruby ​​and what to do in fact 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.640
 morimoto said it seems that pokémon 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.210
 omega robinho and alpha sapphire we were 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.920
 announced 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 I really think that these games are 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.090
 will cause another huge change 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.250
 in the world of struggles and now the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.530
 he asks what he has and is discounted 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.620
 said is a simple opinion 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.239
 or it is a small anticipation of a 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.760
 great change that we will have in the remakes 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.680
 I have no idea and thanks to all these 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.050
 people who continue to give 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.090
 live information is growing at 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.309
 exorbitant levels of stuff I don't have 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.789
 never had for any other game I say 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.489
 really 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.739
 Now we pass the corner fake it 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.789
 on deviantart and I happened to find 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.859
 in these images that have been 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.449
 also spread on many facebook pages 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.850
 these images have been running for some time 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.470
 month and since we are now on the subject I have 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.630
 decided to let you see it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.110
 they represent how they could 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.030
 be the ruby and sapphire remake for 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.299
 a graphic in three of these 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.970
 images are taken from something that 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.700
 it could be someone's project 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.409
 another one chrome something like that not 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.049
 I'm sure they're showing it 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.790
 in many and the information I have 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.130
 unfortunately few have succeeded in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.020
 find many images and looking at them 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.750
 could already begin to understand how 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.000
 could be a viable alternative 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.310
 graphics to the style of xy mandate that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.229
 now already from the videos of gradino chiove 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.600
 we could see that style 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.000
 at least that of pokemon in battle is 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.590
 similar to pokemon xe y yo not 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.149
 I would hope so much in a style 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.850
 graphic similar to that of images 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.590
 that you're lethal 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.540
 the saying says that hope is the last 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.970
 to die so if you like this style 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.040
 keep hoping maybe you lose 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.020
 satisfied I will not hide that also a 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.759
 I like this style and if I had to 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.560
 choose between this and pokémon 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.880
 xy 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.540
 well the fight would be really a lot 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.540
 arduous
