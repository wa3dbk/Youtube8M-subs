00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello and welcome to hardware advice 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.200
 here is the update of the 700 euro gaming 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.099
 computers march 2014 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.750
 as a processor of the Intel Core i5 4570 with 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.350
 4 3 2 gigahertz 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.150
 he has a day of 3.6 gigahertz 84 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.230
 watt tdp and an integrated 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.119
 graphic unit 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.250
 Of course, that's enough for all the usual ones 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.019
 play easy and should be for gamers 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.840
 the next two to four years the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.119
 suffice as cpu cooler the arctic 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.890
 cooling freezer seven mainly 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.600
 there for the processor to quietly 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.460
 cool and therefore the processor 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.640
 to be able to keep his turbo cycle throughout 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 and as mainboard the hockey 85 in the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.450
 profile with the intel b85 chipset it has 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.570
 usb3 sata3 four ddr3 ram banks pci 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.969
 express 3.0 a 10.1 sound chip and am 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.350
 panel 4 x usb 2 ps2 vga dvi and hdmi for 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.250
 the integrated graphics unit of the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.859
 Processors twice usb 3.0 socket and 5 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.379
 35 mm to wieandt ostling for 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.950
 Be careful of the sound chip as a working memory 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.040
 gigabyte cuddly ballistix word ddr3 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.240
 1600 m 10 90 kid 8 gb in time for 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.189
 gamer more than enough 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.720
 it's one through it which we there one man 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.170
 can operate in the dual channel mode 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.930
 and ddr3 1600 and 10 9 is pretty much 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.580
 as fast as the one terabyte invite you 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.020
 money desktop hdd it is a 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.030
 above-average fast hard disk 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.790
 and an appointment for the most under 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.360
 you are enough as a graphics card the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.640
 pelle geforce gtx 470 ossi it is one 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.630
 overclocked version of gtx with 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 a big cooler 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.439
 which means she should not be too loud 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.460
 They should be almost all current 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.140
 play on the highest 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.850
 Graphics settings and 60 fps 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.430
 can play so in the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 graphics cards such as the fdp you have to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.110
 Go down a little bit as 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.920
 power supply the bike ride system power7 with 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.990
 400 watts 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.450
 You get that for just 40 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.090
 euro be quiet quality and 400 watts 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.670
 are still enough for the pc 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.939
 a dvd burner from samsung and as 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.590
 housing the corsair kbc to 200 it is 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.610
 a little worse size with each one 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.959
 amount of space in there 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.790
 but of course he is allowed to do it himself 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.470
 decide which one to accept 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.450
 that was it with the video 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.040
 if the video is older than for months 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.300
 the description will look there on the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.770
 click on each link 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.870
 This is always up to date 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.870
 version then until the next video
