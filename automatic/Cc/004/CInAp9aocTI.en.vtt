00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
other weird thing is and maybe I'm just

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.100 
other weird thing is and maybe I'm just
stupid<00:02:28.730> but<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.570> film<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.900> way<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.500> get<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
stupid but if I film this way I get the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.930 
stupid but if I film this way I get the
HD<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.680> vertical<00:02:33.890> stripe<00:02:34.340> when<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.700> would

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
HD in a vertical stripe when I would

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.000 
HD in a vertical stripe when I would
just<00:02:35.090> rather<00:02:35.209> have<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.660> camera<00:02:36.110> have<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.560> gyro

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
just rather have the camera have a gyro

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.530 
just rather have the camera have a gyro
inside<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.580> figure<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.880> out<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.270> have<00:02:38.420> to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
inside and figure that out so I have to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.300 
inside and figure that out so I have to
hold<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.870> this<00:02:39.170> way<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.560> order<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.830> film<00:02:40.040> it's

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
hold it this way in order to film it's

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.640 
hold it this way in order to film it's
just<00:02:40.489> not<00:02:40.790> comfortable<00:02:41.690> or<00:02:42.020> convenient<00:02:42.380> in<00:02:42.530> my

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
to do is I'm going to next do basically

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.140 
to do is I'm going to next do basically
just<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.630> comparison<00:03:21.230> between<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:22.150> between

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
just a comparison between this between

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.930 
just a comparison between this between
the<00:03:23.299> bloggie<00:03:23.570> we<00:03:24.470> also<00:03:24.620> have<00:03:24.739> one<00:03:25.549> of<00:03:25.670> these<00:03:25.760> go

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
the bloggie we also have one of these go

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.810 
the bloggie we also have one of these go
Kodak's<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:27.829> just<00:03:28.070> a<00:03:28.130> bunch<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.400> other<00:03:28.579> ones

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
Kodak's and just a bunch of other ones

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.789 
Kodak's and just a bunch of other ones
so<00:03:28.910> we<00:03:29.150> can<00:03:29.299> just<00:03:29.480> kind<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.690> have<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.900> comparison

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
so we can just kind of have a comparison

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.009 
so we can just kind of have a comparison
between<00:03:30.829> the<00:03:31.280> video<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.570> then<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.810> sound

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
between the video and then the sound

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.350 
between the video and then the sound
quality<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.530> stuff<00:03:33.950> like<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.459> once

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360
