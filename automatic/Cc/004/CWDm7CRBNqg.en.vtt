00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.559
 the world as they are here knees 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.230
 commenting on a gameplay and showing a 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:11.419
 small tutorial about how good it is 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.839
 how to make a mini game where 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.910
 consist and crush the other this is 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.710
 quite funny and has played several and 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.270
 with some friends and well let's see 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.360
 how it is done 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.040
 we need what we want 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.540
 and I in this case already know that I 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.440
 love to use the iron blocks 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.930
 They are quite nice not 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.680
 we will be back 4 x 7 12 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.680
 7 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:43.810
 well I did it 8 so cut 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.260
 one well now yes like that 7 and what 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.260
 fill in 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.730
 and good already having these comrades 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.410
 good as the troll pig says 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.050
 having this what we are going to do 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.910
 let's put 1 2 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.910
 and 3 well 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.070
 3a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.760
 3 and here like this 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.409
 until we got here to the same place 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.970
 then we can already cut this this is not 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.920
 for 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.940
 now on the other side we're going to do what 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.940
 same this symmetrical 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 and now we're here and we can 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.520
 cut you're 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.470
 good to camera after this what 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.240
 we are going to do is that with our 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.320
 buttons let's grab buttons and the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.040
 let's put here like this like that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.720
 ready 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.820
 now with our 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.180
 this sticky pistons we are going to put them 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.670
 back he cited 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.100
 in this way looking down all 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.290
 and as you remember, this is symmetrical 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.090
 then we are going to do it 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.789
 way from the other side 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.049
 ok having this we are going to put our 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.170
 block of what we had 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.990
 chosen here like this 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.709
 down the pistons and the other side 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.890
 still be exactly the same to the pig 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.890
 troll 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.840
 then as you see there is more or 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.459
 less well if I explain myself 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.880
 then well we have the first 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.070
 part of all this 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.280
 now with this we are going to leave a little picture 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.280
 and let's go putting here I'm 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.090
 okay 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.200
 and well I worked a little bit more than 64 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.540
 because I knew that this is going to happen to me 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.680
 and let's do it again here we leave 1 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.290
 and here we put this 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.859
 and on the other side you already know that we put a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.599
 machine so we do not go out as you see if 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.450
 I get right now I explain if I 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.879
 I can not get out okay, a thousand sheep 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.799
 currently then we will be here 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.920
 as if crushing the poor to the 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.989
 other low then that's not all 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.590
 because I need to kill what is this 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.500
 other 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.840
 and the cow troll and all the trolls already 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.970
 now we are going to do it to enter 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.290
 we grabbed another piston spirit and what 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.170
 let's put there there is no forgiveness here 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.170
 is and we are going to put of the block that 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.200
 want me in this case uses Berber 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.290
 of the same that will be iron and we will put it 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.610
 there and with the other sticky piston what 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.129
 we will do the same, remember that 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.040
 symmetrical I do not know how many of you 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.620
 said sir and with good then now 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.099
 we will grab our shovel or whatever and 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.520
 we'll start here to do this 2 towards 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.340
 down ok 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.420
 2 down to get here because 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.770
 here we are going to put our plate 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.570
 I presented 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.570
 then we are going to cut here 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:05.380
 well here here and here ok then now 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.380
 yes let's do good 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.390
 let's put a torch rest of 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.790
 way that the piston and we're going to fill 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.350
 from the rector until here and here he will go 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.440
 up our pressure plate then 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.590
 we put here written now already having 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.370
 this in the food here 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.370
 we cover 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.340
 to this party 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.729
 and here I go to our pressure plate 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:34.300
 then we put it now to enter 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:37.000
 as you see it opens and we pass and well here 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.130
 we started playing but good not to have 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.050
 gone in as there is no way out I'll have 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.900
 I would break these new moments for 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.960
 explain how and on the other side other 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.699
 time I repeat it's symmetrical then we're going to 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.580
 have to do the same thing on the other side 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.950
 already having this we go here to where 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.830
 are both of us and we are going to start 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.980
 here not here we are going to use do two 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.880
 downwards ok 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.470
 then loves this and here we 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.750
 that are in this city under pressure 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.300
 then up to here we are going to break 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.310
 friends 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.680
 let's have here like that ok 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.640
 and then here is the ojito 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.410
 because this will be while the 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.410
 catchment then what are we going to do 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.540
 it's the same thing will break this and with the 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.400
 holy towers we will do this so that it 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.230
 open then let's follow our 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.710
 way and we're going to put it where 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.750
 let's leave our pressure plate 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.470
 so let's put this here, let's go 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.300
 start to plug and activate then ok 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.460
 As you can see, it works well and we enter 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.760
 then already having the two players 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.930
 we have finished this little game 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.250
 then already having the two players 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.170
 what we are going to do is that the other 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.530
 player will also be inside and 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.890
 Well let's start crushing and good 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.610
 it's quite fun I hope to have them 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.010
 I hope you liked this 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.540
 tutorial this is a little game that 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.790
 it's pretty fun if you 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.200
 you play with friends and then I do not expect anything 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.450
 bring them also some employment playing 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.840
 with my subscribers and nothing we're going to 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.840
 the next
