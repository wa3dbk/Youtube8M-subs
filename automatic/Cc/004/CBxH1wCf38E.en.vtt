00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.220 

take<00:01:02.320> down<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.620> next<00:01:02.890> section<00:01:03.460> I<00:01:07.110> called<00:01:08.110> that

this<00:01:10.570> one<00:01:10.750> back<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:14.310> alternating<00:01:15.310> the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
this one back and alternating the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.969 
this one back and alternating the
direction<00:01:15.730> just<00:01:16.240> gives<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:17.170> little<00:01:17.650> bit<00:01:17.860> of

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
direction just gives you a little bit of

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:32.499 
direction just gives you a little bit of
movement<00:01:18.250> so<00:01:19.030> it's<00:01:19.210> not<00:01:19.390> overly<00:01:20.910> perfect

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.789 

really<00:01:33.509> quick<00:01:33.689> that's<00:01:33.899> three<00:01:34.200> sections<00:01:34.619> with

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
really quick that's three sections with

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.560 
really quick that's three sections with
the<00:01:34.890> curl<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.280> smooth<00:01:35.789> of<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.360> bit<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the curl and smooth of a little bit of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.069 
the curl and smooth of a little bit of
body<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.469> this<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.250> before<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:40.579> after

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
body so this would be before and after

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.060 
body so this would be before and after
I'm<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.289> do<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> same<00:01:43.590> thing<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.860> the
