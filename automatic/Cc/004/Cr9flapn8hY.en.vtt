00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.539
 and it just also welcome to another 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.119
 video lesson and in today's video I want 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.490
 working the location of the Greek ways 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.079
 on the guitar arm and a little paper to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.650
 people gain some speed 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:35.250
 It's still cool for those who do not know the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.920
 modes strikes can send an email to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.170
 me in alabama point to dictate clothing 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.780
 gmail.com with your entourage that the calculation 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.079
 of freight for you and you can purchase 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.730
 should also be Greek motorcycles which is 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.079
 fantastic car dvd double with fitting 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.000
 didactic 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.460
 Finally an exercise that I'm going to spend today is 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.590
 one of the exercises that also has the dvd 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.379
 It's cool and anyone who has an interest too 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.449
 have the online avoidance course from which 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.560
 they receive videos at home is very cool 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.940
 legal then the proposal is as follows 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.640
 I'm going to work with Greek motorcycles at 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:18.840
 biggest sun championship so I have 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:27.329
 only the game there Doric front 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:30.000
 easy wind resource 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.520
 then has the single largest sun field 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.719
 each one of them will generate a 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.819
 way for me 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:40.950
 the proposal wants to pass the next let's go 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:42.959
 locate launched junior in both 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.549
 first strings of the guitar then 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.420
 thinking of the first two strings of the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.649
 guitar 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.170
 I'm here in Section 7 right to 34 I 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.270
 I want to pass the next I always answered 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.909
 these three new ones in the case of working 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.780
 with the modes typed three knots per 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.450
 ropes 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.959
 the last two notes that would be the two 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.390
 here always of any rope 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:11.569
 the last two will always be the two 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.569
 first of the next module of ok now 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.090
 so I have the pain here both 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.889
 the last two will be the first 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.720
 my next module phishing mode case 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:31.430
 the last two will be the first two 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.430
 my modes legitimately 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.500
 is a form of location that is 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.540
 practice my ass off right for us is 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.150
 seeking the speed it fed 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.130
 of things on the ground is a bitch tool 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.760
 nice for you to get a way 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.760
 side of the other 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.170
 outside this can be done from your hit 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840
 the jealousy 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.880
 this will suit any rope or 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.500
 its non- military forms 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.830
 the last two are these will be the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.830
 delicious 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.640
 It's cool, then hurry up for us. 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.650
 get enough speed more 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.610
 example that does not offer you is 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.549
 divided into large ten place notes per 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.959
 by telephone in the case here the other one of 10 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.060
 so the sugar cane we can 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.890
 enough speed against our shape 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.890
 to put a metronome here for us 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.060
 legal is a nice exercise like 50 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.129
 cent speed and theory is applied 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.750
 putting it here on a stand now 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.269
 It's cool for who is a great 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.159
 tool for you there improvising there 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.159
 I have Portuguese here. 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.819
 It's interesting to bring her the last one. 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:02.819
 School, right? 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.479
 sometimes in the middle 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.759
 the king of snakes 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.970
 there they again cd twice each group 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.970
 on here 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.080
 O 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.099
 the grass is a nice tool you 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.259
 Are you using improvisation so I trained? 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:14.500
 achieve a quite dry Metro 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.330
 audio quality and then only 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.069
 that speed does not give anything personal 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.069
 hug with god of the next
