00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
the most shocking news might be bet this

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.259 
the most shocking news might be bet this
might<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.099> shelby<00:03:41.550> name<00:03:41.760> could<00:03:42.239> be

might be that the shelby name could be

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.410 
might be that the shelby name could be
dropped<00:03:42.630> in<00:03:42.810> place<00:03:43.050> of<00:03:43.260> an<00:03:43.709> svt<00:03:44.280> cobra<00:03:44.670> moniker

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
dropped in place of an svt cobra moniker

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.290 
dropped in place of an svt cobra moniker
with<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.530> supercharged<00:03:47.099> 5.8<00:03:47.700> liter<00:03:47.760> v8

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
with that the supercharged 5.8 liter v8

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.030 
with that the supercharged 5.8 liter v8
could<00:03:48.810> be<00:03:48.930> replaced<00:03:49.290> with<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> naturally

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
could be replaced with a naturally

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.860 
could be replaced with a naturally
aspirated<00:03:50.069> engine<00:03:51.030> it's<00:03:51.480> hard<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.720> imagine

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
aspirated engine it's hard to imagine

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.750 
aspirated engine it's hard to imagine
the<00:03:52.170> replacement<00:03:52.739> will<00:03:52.860> make<00:03:53.040> more<00:03:53.459> than<00:03:53.519> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
the replacement will make more than the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.210 
the replacement will make more than the
current<00:03:54.290> 662<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.500> these<00:03:57.680> so<00:03:58.680> we'll<00:03:58.860> just<00:03:59.069> have

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
current 662 of these so we'll just have

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.729 
current 662 of these so we'll just have
to<00:03:59.370> see<00:03:59.900> what<00:04:00.900> that's<00:04:01.049> all<00:04:01.260> about<00:04:01.319> i<00:04:01.560> guess

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
to see what that's all about i guess

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.039 
to see what that's all about i guess
when<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.730> comes<00:04:03.060> out<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.510> other<00:04:03.540> news<00:04:03.840> isn't

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
when it comes out the other news isn't

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.080 
when it comes out the other news isn't
so<00:04:04.290> bad<00:04:04.440> though<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.860> entry-level<00:04:05.130> model<00:04:05.640> will

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
so bad though the entry-level model will

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.090 
so bad though the entry-level model will
continue<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.569> use<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> v6<00:04:07.290> while<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.920> next

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
continue to use a v6 while the next

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.430 
continue to use a v6 while the next
level<00:04:08.459> up<00:04:08.640> could<00:04:09.150> gain<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> new<00:04:09.630> 2.3<00:04:10.230> liter

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
level up could gain a new 2.3 liter

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.009 
level up could gain a new 2.3 liter
