00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.220
 Let's wrap the line on the arriving screen. 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.590
 all I like to put the line roll 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.860
 inside a crate because it does not 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:23.850
 walks on the whole table on the ground and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:26.090
 rolling all over the bladder in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.000

 I used this line to line with flames. 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.210
 You can try others I have not tried 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.469

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:49.770
 Wonderful, I'll test and I'll tell 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.680
 You sing in string string something. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.350
 with, it's going to be very good so we're going 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.850
 to wrap this up, it wrapped the whole piece 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.390
 all bladder 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.359
 There we are going to have a piece like that. 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.640

 Give a champion we'll pass us 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.100
 Let's make a mixer at the time we 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.580
 you had on the last line operation - 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.770
 19 and ended here iwa cut him off 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.380
 that would make space a little glue 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.960
 This is who I learned. 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.480
 line and then we'll make way 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.850
 following my already hitherto dry 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.470
 we were prepared hardener to pass 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.750
 on this line to stay hard 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.910
 then take it comes to stay in that 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.630

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.500
 It tends to 4 tablespoons plus it is 400 ml 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.840
 It's still there, I do not 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.620

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.020
 cool down 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.780
