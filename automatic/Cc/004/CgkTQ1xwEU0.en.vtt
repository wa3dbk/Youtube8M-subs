driving the clock line with my wellies

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.490 
driving the clock line with my wellies
on<00:00:10.820> because<00:00:11.820> it's<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.090> wet<00:00:12.780> around<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.349> about

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
on because it's so wet around and about

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.740 
on because it's so wet around and about
we're<00:00:14.429> trying<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.700> keep<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> trailers<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
we're trying to keep the trailers on the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.230 
we're trying to keep the trailers on the
track<00:00:16.590> at<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.770> top<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.160> field<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.940> where

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
track at the top of this field so where

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.790 
track at the top of this field so where
would<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> end<00:00:19.109> here<00:00:19.199> I'll<00:00:19.500> unload

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
would I get to the end here I'll unload

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.070 
would I get to the end here I'll unload
and<00:00:20.039> we'll<00:00:20.130> keep<00:00:20.430> trailers<00:00:20.939> off<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.689> fields

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
and we'll keep trailers off the fields

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840 
and we'll keep trailers off the fields
we<00:00:22.619> can<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.010> practically<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:23.609> rank

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
we can do that practically with rank

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.370 
we can do that practically with rank
because<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.269> doesn't<00:00:24.570> yield<00:00:24.689> quite<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.199> much

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
because it doesn't yield quite as much

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.769 
because it doesn't yield quite as much
as<00:00:25.560> some<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> other<00:00:26.070> crops<00:00:26.539> that<00:00:27.539> we're

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
as some of the other crops that we're

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.089 
as some of the other crops that we're
hopefully<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.529> using<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
hopefully going to be using the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.370 
hopefully going to be using the
harvesting<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.970> year<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
harvesting this year so this is the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.990 
harvesting this year so this is the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
sort of four and half tonnes a hectare

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
sort of four and half tonnes a hectare
which<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.100> really<00:00:35.399> good<00:00:35.579> at<00:00:35.790> surprising

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
which is really good at surprising

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.490 
which is really good at surprising
called<00:00:36.540> flash<00:00:38.329> not<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> bigger<00:00:39.629> biomass<00:00:40.230> crop

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
called flash not a bigger biomass crop

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.990 
called flash not a bigger biomass crop
or<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> yield<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.219> had<00:00:41.370> last<00:00:41.550> year<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
or a yield that we had last year but I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.819 
or a yield that we had last year but I
think<00:00:42.030> that's<00:00:42.420> becoming<00:00:43.170> evident<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
think that's becoming evident with the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.290 
think that's becoming evident with the
season<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.399> we've<00:00:44.550> had<00:00:44.700> none<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> yields

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
season that we've had none of the yields

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.779 
season that we've had none of the yields
are<00:00:45.420> quite<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.719> good<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:46.219> last<00:00:47.219> year<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.640> very

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
are quite as good as last year was very
