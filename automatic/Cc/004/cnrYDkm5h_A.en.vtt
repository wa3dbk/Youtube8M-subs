00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.240
 well it him everyone is mr 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.010
 young people find themselves today 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.570
 for a very short video of an article 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.680
 of planets I intended to post on 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.130
 social networks including twitter and 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.810
 Facebook 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.860
 but I said to myself and some of my 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.390
 friends told me but think about those too 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.650
 who do not follow you on twitter and 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.920
 facebook make a little video for 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.489
 present them the next stuff 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.050
 of the vanguard and the test of 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.039
 wolf house so by cons I saw 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.179
 a little trick as you can see 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.350
 several reddit megaman x 4 apparently 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:42.579
 had the chance to discover the new 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.260
 content for hockey wolf house 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.909
 on the other hand, these shouts below this is 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.909
 not confirmed but apparently according to 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.219
 megaman x 4 on May 19th would be the date of 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.120
 the exit of the wolf house so that 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.440
 it's really learning with 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.999
 big tweezers especially I left 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.219
 see a little on his site if we will see 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.929
 in fact he claims it's just a 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.809
 theory he liked that suddenly saw that 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.409
 the dark biloa was announced 45 days before 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.210
 his exit 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.130
 he assumes that seen class it barely turns 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.530
 to be announced so he counts 45 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.180
 days from February 3rd so he there 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.050
 presume it will be May 19th but that 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.820
 it's really to take with big 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.360
 tweezers one is really not sure brief 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 so the difficulty of the assaults will be 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.690
 level 32 as you can see 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.680
 suddenly at the level of 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.980
 shit and stops here I'm sorry 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.970
 will get there 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.290
 you have the warlock so the organist 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.030
 who is right here hop 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.050
 as you can see you have 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.390
 some stuff let's go I'll 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.710
 show some stuff that's it 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.100
 rather pretty well I think it really 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.930
 friendly 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.550
 you have the gloves here are the torsos sas 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.710
 and I did not blame the test 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.750
 so that's the stuff of the test you 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.100
 suddenly have the vanguard that is not 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.330
 badly too jousting way I will put you 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.290
 the link you will go from each is a little 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.940
 what you want to see I'm going 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.050
 just show you the thing this one is 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.550
 rather pretty as you can see 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.590
 really nice but on the other hand it's 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.800
 written in Japanese it looks good so 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.060
 so that's a bit hard for for 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.920
 look well there you also have each 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.560
 detail of each weapon and sent sellers 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.490
 test where before guard you have the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.510
 hunter that I find 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.200
 particularly cool and that suddenly 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.340
 I'm interested here is not bad 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.660
 it's classic but nice I like 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.910
 legs with the delirium of two young 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.170
 war is really nice 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.300
 it was suddenly the evidence will you 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.940
 have the caps too here is rather nice 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.209
 again what is there that I find 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.010
 owl also at the ch and the hunter 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.500
 you see it starts at 30 light 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.420
 new pop so will have to see what 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.040
 it gives the same level of the legs I 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.060
 find them particularly nice 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.190
 is going to be nice good it's a little 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.930
 fisherman's boot but really I 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.959
 find it all the same rather cool up no 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.820
 we go down and the titan is not bad 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.470
 cool too it's really we get into 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.000
 more classic armor but really 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.040
 stylish for the bassinet me I think I 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.330
 find them really cool it's more 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.280
 big nag we are really in the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.959
 bigger robots meaning union of the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.060
 robotic delirium it's really nice 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.880
 this one is really cool look up 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.200
 really nice at the color level the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.420
 torso still nice in the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.500
 titans too so that's after you 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.360
 will have the weapons 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.890
 so that's the weapons of the test 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.760
 so skins it stays 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.010
 overall classic 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.330
 so here are apparently the weapons 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.220
 will start at 300 damage what I 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.480
 find a little weird but good 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.250
 well that's how it's hop 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.820
 so I 'm going to show you for example a 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.440
 scout who is rather nice too 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.730
 as could see at level 2 of the 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.430
 scope of damage and everything rather 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.959
 effective as usual and there suddenly 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.190
 the weapons of the vanguard always to 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.960
 300 because I still find 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.280
 especially weird for that 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.490
 do not change a lot it looks like 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.900
 really everything we've seen 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.600
 they did not put too much effort there 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.800
 but after that it's a little 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.860
 same thing I like the word union 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.120
 written on it is really nice 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.260
 so here I've done you pretty much the 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.760
 turn if the revolver looks rather not 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.990
 wrong 12 balls in the charger for a 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.000
 revolver of the avant-garde it's when 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.230
 even pretty cool so here I go you 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.400
 leave the link in the description at 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.480
 the less you have the site you can 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.770
 go see what you 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.070
 interested in age a small image that 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.140
 bad 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.300
 if the sniper looks pretty cool too 4 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.440
 balance which is rather nice here I 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.640
 leave you the link in the description 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.320
 do not hesitate to the Czechs and 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.460
 do not hesitate to follow me on 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.720
 social networks because I post 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.340
 sometimes full of little links like that 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.480
 and once again really take some 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.220
 tweezers in relation to the date of 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.750
 exit or I hope this little 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.520
