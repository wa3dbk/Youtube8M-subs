00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
it might work for some people but it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.550 
it might work for some people but it
wasn't<00:02:20.190> working<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.610> me<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.440> patients<00:02:22.440> who

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
wasn't working for me for patients who

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.290 
wasn't working for me for patients who
want<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.980> come<00:02:23.250> off<00:02:23.370> medications<00:02:24.030> there's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
want to come off medications there's

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.290 
want to come off medications there's
really<00:02:24.540> three<00:02:25.190> main<00:02:26.190> types<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.819> therapies

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
really three main types of therapies

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.809 
really three main types of therapies
surgical<00:02:28.170> therapies<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:29.099> Michelle<00:02:29.520> I

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
surgical therapies for Michelle I

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.580 
surgical therapies for Michelle I
recommended<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.810> microvascular

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
recommended a microvascular

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.040 
recommended a microvascular
decompression<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:32.490> think<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
decompression I think that that is a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.000 
decompression I think that that is a
more<00:02:34.680> durable<00:02:34.980> treatment<00:02:35.670> for<00:02:36.209> patients<00:02:37.010> and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
more durable treatment for patients and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.770 
more durable treatment for patients and
I<00:02:38.069> like<00:02:38.280> recommending<00:02:38.880> this<00:02:39.000> for<00:02:39.209> patients

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
I like recommending this for patients

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.050 
I like recommending this for patients
who<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:39.930> young<00:02:40.190> quite<00:02:41.190> simply<00:02:41.520> put<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.880> goal

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
who are young quite simply put the goal

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.000 
who are young quite simply put the goal
of<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.270> surgery<00:02:42.660> as<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.900> lift<00:02:43.110> artery<00:02:43.680> off<00:02:43.800> of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
of the surgery as the lift artery off of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.630 
of the surgery as the lift artery off of
the<00:02:44.099> nerve

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
the nerve

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.970 
the nerve
we<00:02:45.390> make<00:02:45.570> an<00:02:45.720> incision<00:02:45.870> right<00:02:46.500> behind<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.950> ear

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
we make an incision right behind the ear

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.700 
we make an incision right behind the ear
and<00:02:47.400> we<00:02:47.730> take<00:02:47.940> off<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> little<00:02:48.420> bone<00:02:48.690> right<00:02:49.470> back

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
and we take off a little bone right back

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.240 
and we take off a little bone right back
here<00:02:50.070> we're<00:02:50.490> able<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.940> then<00:02:51.740> slip<00:02:52.740> in<00:02:52.890> front<00:02:53.160> of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
here we're able to then slip in front of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.060 
here we're able to then slip in front of
the<00:02:53.340> cerebellum<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.500> lift<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.620> artery<00:02:55.920> off

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
the cerebellum and lift the artery off

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.690 
the cerebellum and lift the artery off
of<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.340> nerve<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.820> then<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:58.230> close<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
of the nerve and then we close the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.460 
of the nerve and then we close the

two hours to do and once the surgery is

two hours to do and once the surgery is
completed<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.610> tell<00:03:05.850> patients<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.510> expect<00:03:06.900> a
