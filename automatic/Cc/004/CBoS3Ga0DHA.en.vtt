00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.590
 also help tv 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.559
 thank you for visiting good friends like 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.459
 You can see this I started to dismantle 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.349
 This engine is from a Toyota Kameni 2002 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:18.289
 good as you can see this I'm already 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.630
 disassembling the engine and practically the 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:27.590
 mount all the parts as you can see 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:30.289
 here remove this part that is going to 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.940
 hit the engine and here you choose 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.460
 the manipulate the peanut funk this and what 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.460
 remove also this 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 and this already 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.149
 already removing the other parts as they can 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.489
 see already disconnect the air conditioner 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.269
 also because when it's going to change in a 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.969
 engine has to remove the this way and 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.160
 is the air conditioning first 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:03.280
 make sure to take out the refrigerant that 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.280
 have the compressor this 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.140
 and I started loosening the screws here 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.040
 of the transmission because the motor is going 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.960
 attached to the transmission engine transmission 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.990
 this 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.210
 I already have the screws loose and here 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.680
 is the full injection as you can see 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.490
 here is in the background injection over 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.740
 these four little tubes something very 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.210
 simple nothing complicated 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.820
 this is all very easy not 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.310
 has no science to remove an engine is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.500
 the simplest thing that you can have 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.979
 they can do it the only thing that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.650
 you need is a little bit of patience 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.140
 watch carefully where they go all parties 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.810
 If you can take several photos to 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.330
 its engine so that when they put it back 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.470
 the other then realize how they are going 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.680
 all the parts as you can see here already 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.140
 remove acquire olive manifold that 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.820
 man and football is this one take it away here the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.670
 another that went here opposite where they are 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.819
 these four holes was this which 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.879
 remove this one 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.980
 and here you all the hoses disconnect 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.030
 all this and connecting all the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.629
 sensors disconnect and here is the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.629
 thermostat 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.920
 Well, it's practically ready 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.910
 motor for 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.910
 to get it out 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.739
 this engine is almost ready to be able to 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:39.000
 get out just need to buy the engine 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.000
 and I'll be able to 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.850
 and good this as you can see here this 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.070
 already 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:53.180
 I'm ready to remove the engine and 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:53.180
 remove the top cover I have ready 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.440
 the hydraulic to lift the engine 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.880
 as you can see here adjust this when 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.500
 an engine is removed is very important 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.730
 have this level because with this level 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.650
 we can adjust our engine to the level 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.019
 that we want especially for when 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.700
 we install it is very easy 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.019
 with this level to be able to work then 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.720
 that is optional that you want it 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.540
 buy but this level is very 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.519
 important brings 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.340
 these hooks that one of the subjects 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.170
 here with the motor with the screws and 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.230
 on this other side it also brings 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.020
 on this other side we also bring the 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.450
 chains 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.080
 the chains but in this case I tie 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.840
 another chain that because they had not 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.140
 screws to tighten then this one already 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.010
 feed them something there but how can 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.150
 see and realize and remove all everything 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.740
 important to check whenever you have been 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.460
 removed all the screws from the 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.440
 transmission the screws that go here 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.870
 in the transmission all our 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.970
 screws have to be removed and 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.060
 then when they go to give him the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.550
 hydraulic, they will give it slowly 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.070
 as slowly as they can until 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.320
 go see that the engine is pulling and 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.810
 let's go try to see that these two 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.630
 these parts that are here are going 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.610
 opening when we are already seeing that 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.010
 they have opened then there practically 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:26.910
 we are going to be seeing how to leave the 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.000
 engine now let's continue 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.770
 as you can see here you start it 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.240
 to open I'm putting the a screwdriver 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.710
 here very carefully with much 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:41.310
 caution and if you notice it is already 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.110
 starting to open then what I'm going to 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.860
 do right now I'm going to take a little 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.610
 of lubricant 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.040
 there you can not give an account and started 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.780
 open but 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.060
 this we have to make him open a 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.060
 little bit more so that it comes out of the ones 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.890
 taquitos he has and then with that 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.720
 and it will be very important this 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.090
 get all screws well do not force 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.360
 nothing to take your time to do it anymore 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.789
 what a 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.180
 if they have not got a screw or something 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.990
 the engine is not going to come out so we're going to 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.310
 keep doing it with patience 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.950
 with this as you can see then already 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.860
 I took out the engine 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:29.290
 after struggling a bit 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.440
 because then the truth that has many 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.050
 screws the thing that and it cost me a 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.400
 bit 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.889
 take it out because it takes a lot 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.770
 many things that you have to be putting 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.020
 and taking out that thing but the truth that 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.539
 thank god came out alone god could 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.340
 help in this because then the truth that 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.289
 It's a little complicated but nothing 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.370
 another world has nothing of science 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.370
 doing it only requires 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:04.170
 be patient and dedicate yourself to doing the 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.680
 things and basically that's all that 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.490
 you need here as you can see it's like 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.160
 how is it going 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.740
 this is how they have gotten things have 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.180
 that give a little pressure to the 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.050
 things so I can go out and like 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.169
 you can see there 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.199
 the car was already leaving all the 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.970
 full engine here 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.289
 the reason that we are forgotten so that 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.300
 realize, look how you look at 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.300
 transmission is just a 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.729
 like a little tube, the one he has there is where 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.529
 come swollen the engine 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.499
 and it's practically the hardest part 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:48.699
 what it costs when you put an engine is 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:50.529
 put the engine in that little part of there and 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:56.009
 where is that gear is all 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:56.009
 basically does not have great science 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.530
 when installing the motor or removing it but from 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.000
 he has a little bit of 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.430
 complication by the screws that a 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.400
 Sometimes they are somewhat hidden and took a 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.849
 little bit of time 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.709
 to remove it but then 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:19.409
 when you are going to change the engine they have to 

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:19.409
 remove your steering favor 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.850
 and water pumps 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.740
 alternator and its good air compressor 

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.940
 and how can you see here thanks to 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.940
 God everything went well 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.650
 Well now I can only install the 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:41.650
 I have to search for it and then that's not 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.650
 we take the days then I go back to record
