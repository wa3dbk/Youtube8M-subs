one tone higher then the five so GD is

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
because it's relative to G it's a

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.410 
because it's relative to G it's a

scale if you're not you should because
this<00:02:14.840> one<00:02:15.049> four<00:02:15.319> scales<00:02:15.650> he<00:02:15.830> needs<00:02:16.010> alone<00:02:19.989> well

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
this one four scales he needs alone well
