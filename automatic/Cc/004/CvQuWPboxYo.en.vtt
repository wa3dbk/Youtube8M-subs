00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.809 
galleon I don't know if I pronounced
that<00:03:25.780> right<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.769> has<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.400> really<00:03:27.609> cool

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
that right but it has a really cool

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.059 
that right but it has a really cool
