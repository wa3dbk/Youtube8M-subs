and then he showed up I don't like the

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.620 
and then he showed up I don't like the
voice<00:04:17.950> that<00:04:18.190> Jamie<00:04:18.489> Foxx<00:04:18.520> is<00:04:18.880> doing<00:04:19.180> at<00:04:19.299> all<00:04:19.419> it

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
voice that Jamie Foxx is doing at all it

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.080

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
and the darker color palette I know this

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.249 
and the darker color palette I know this
one<00:04:59.669> looks<00:04:59.819> more<00:04:59.939> like<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.150> comics<00:05:00.599> but<00:05:00.870> I

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
one looks more like the comics but I

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.050 
one looks more like the comics but I
feel<00:05:01.500> it's<00:05:01.740> bright<00:05:01.979> colors<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.729> the<00:05:02.819> white

front<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.050> center<00:06:07.229> but<00:06:07.379> then<00:06:07.469> they're<00:06:07.560> like

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:07.589 
front and center but then they're like

surprise it's David Bowie Green Goblin

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.559 
surprise it's David Bowie Green Goblin
instead<00:06:10.409> I<00:06:10.680> can<00:06:11.250> be<00:06:11.400> cool<00:06:11.639> with<00:06:11.789> that<00:06:11.939> but<00:06:12.449> I<00:06:12.479> do

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
instead I can be cool with that but I do

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.540 
instead I can be cool with that but I do
feel<00:06:12.930> is<00:06:13.080> relegate<00:06:13.469> select<00:06:13.830> row<00:06:14.039> and<00:06:14.310> Rhino

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
feel is relegate select row and Rhino

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.029 
feel is relegate select row and Rhino
and<00:06:14.969> everybody<00:06:15.270> else<00:06:15.479> to<00:06:15.990> henchman<00:06:16.589> status

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
and everybody else to henchman status

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.700 
and everybody else to henchman status
and<00:06:17.370> I<00:06:18.360> think<00:06:18.389> that<00:06:18.750> electro<00:06:19.349> could<00:06:19.500> have<00:06:19.589> been

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
and I think that electro could have been

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.499 
and I think that electro could have been
maybe<00:06:19.889> maybe<00:06:20.610> more<00:06:20.939> I<00:06:20.969> think<00:06:21.150> you<00:06:21.270> could<00:06:21.419> have

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:21.509 
maybe maybe more I think you could have

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:22.820 
maybe maybe more I think you could have
been<00:06:21.629> you<00:06:21.990> know<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.319> little<00:06:22.439> bit<00:06:22.740> more

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
been you know a little bit more

impressive of a villain and also boy the

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.929 
impressive of a villain and also boy the
