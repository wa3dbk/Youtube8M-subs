00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi all dear friends this is android 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.540
 insider. and today we would like to 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.250
 push a couple of the freshest phablets 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.200
 present korean ma bell promo 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.639
 samsung galaxy laptop 4 will find out 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.960
 relationship with a representative at all and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.960
 new camp iphone 6 plus 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:27.110
 and so well four from samsung is the flagship 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.579
 ruler perhaps the whole country 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.020
 android smartphones running under 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.119
 control a lot of 'nuclear 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.040
 processor has variations with the regiment on 4 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.110
 cores and with a branded casino myself at 80 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.550
 guitar building fugitives and all that 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.019
 with the addition of a very prominent 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.120
 the amount of RAM in 3 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.800
 gigabyte is probably the most interesting 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.720
 many 4 lack of emphasis on 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.579
 technological frills which Koreans 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.110
 with a margin instead of this user 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.000
 offers some entertaining and 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.410
 kind of even useful pieces like that 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.090
 same stylus case design 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.489
 additional features with health and 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.500
 ok design like that let's 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.059
 watch metal edging is 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.980
 also a safety cage thing 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.899
 really useful well not only with 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.970
 stylistically we are apparatus 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.580
 especially not bend but we believe the video we sat down 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.110
 that it is very problematic but what with 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.119
 stiffeners in iphone are observed 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.119
 disadvantages we have been aware of for a long time 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.460
 heel plastic under the skin and he 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.690
 quite interesting compared to 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.580
 already bored with aluminum in 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.350
 opposite camp yes and in general 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.090
 ability to accommodate an extra pair of 10 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.800
 inches body compact pablito from 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.350
 Cupertino companies are worth a lot 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.600
 five and a half to 5.7 is not so 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.450
 much difference but visually for more 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.190
 coziness screen for more already coziness 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.510
 galactic laptop added a couple more 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.430
 there are interesting chips for example 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.260
 possibility of a pair of application windows 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.300
 at the same time use at least watch out for 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.400
 twitter reads the text even see 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.110
 youtube answering work mail all these 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.000
 things evolve with gadgets 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.979
 from the ruler on getting cosmetic and 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.690
 speed improvements second chip 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.640
 fully one-handed control of all 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.500
 working field which is monetized to 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.670
 windows in the corner where you can safely 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.070
 operate even with one hand not 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.110
 experience interference in any application oh yes 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.210
 Vedzhita still there in both devices 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.490
 it seems to be true it's time 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.740
 arranged in asana curtains and looks 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.780
 weird and even at their discretion their 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.490
 not distributing but the android shell 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.709
 gives room for customization interface 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.480
 the elements are much larger, but aluminum 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.010
 glass that continues to envelop 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.930
 next generation fona got 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.850
 rounding of edges which led to some 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.530
 look for someone sti big and expensive 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.560
 gadget and this is somewhat disturbing 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.980
 and the same display resolution of someone 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.050
 testicles 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.180
 This, too, plus kopilochku Korean 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.500
 the product is finally all current 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.330
 generation of flagships already slowly 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.430
 overgrown with similar super clear 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.500
 mobile riding screens but love 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.060
 my like now you can not give 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.800
 less 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.050
 question with cameras protruding or not 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.760
 The question is important and we will probably prepare 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.650
 separate comparison in different modes and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.170
 conditions here also note the most 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.430
 highlight 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.350
 The resolution of the pictures is two superior 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.180
 such supports 16 megapixels against 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.830
 eight plays a prominent role when trying 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.840
 make a snapshot for the same 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.580
 instagram happiness there are more people 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.380
 all aspects of quality 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.420
 photos attach a few frames 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.420
 so that you can see the possibilities of Komi 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.069
 not 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.420
 as for the front camera then 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.900
 samsung added some interesting 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.430
 chips 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.200
 the most interesting ones are 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.939
 widescreen self bumps which 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.709
 let us capture the whole company of us 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:30.319
 lumpy extensive but reasonably 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.390
 she would not be well in the conditions for reference 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.579
 do not have to pick in luminosity in 19 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.620
 This will help the six from apple with this 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.720
 everything is fine too but software strapping 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.180
 perhaps not older by our sensation 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.129
 the smaller the device, the more convenient 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.930
 manage in photo and video mode and 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.700
 in here again, somehow more interesting 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.590
 looks teach and basically same 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.540
 advantage for lovers to work with 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.730
 cutting texts and other things can be 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.859
 the same s pen special stylus 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.329
 perform technology vacuum which 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.549
 allow for a noticeable variety a 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.590
 action again 4 yes we know about the fact that 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.840
 nature gave us 10 styluses this is ours 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.760
 fingers but they can be improved in iphone 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.560
 this is not and is not expected yet 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.420
 specific graphics editor with 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.280
 special input devices all 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.530
 does exist and it can not be denied 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.299
 This means that the consumer is 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.250
 opportunity is needed and often happens 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.570
 necessary however out of the box it is not 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.760
 available for devices from apple 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.370
 by the way as for the scrapbooks notes and 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.870
 app features with but generally here 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.520
 you can even have these photos of the text 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.919
 items cut neat and division 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.510
 straight full tool for yes there 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.520
 mining of all stripes life time 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.139
 devices with our very active 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.510
 load is approximately equal and is 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.440
 one and a half two days for 6 plus this is quite 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.849
 significant progress 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.470
 and here is a ruler but here's a good one 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.930
 life expectancy is famous for a long time 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.490
 and well, four exceptions did not however 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.139
 there is also in the field of power supply 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.030
 some interesting points of this 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.190
 quick to 50 percent in half an hour 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.960
 charging and possible in case of acute 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.419
 need to change the battery in 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.639
 iPhone you have these bonuses for sure no no and 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.919
 fun power saving mode even 2 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.449
 both black and white and take into account the possibilities 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.130
 super mallet display but most 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.500
 Extreme almost a month can 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.030
 live it more easily until the end 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.250
 days to stretch out a form even with thirty 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.909
 charge percent at lunchtime 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.409
 performance arrange by 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.419
 application optimization in apple 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.190
 product and muscularity will teach eric 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.260
 approximately equal in the interface that in 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.090
 games alas 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.220
 developers are trying to give the user 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.170
 exactly what he wants so same 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.180
 games somehow work the same way 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.830
 and this despite the fact that in the same background I 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.900
 gigabyte fullhd ram 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.940
 display and in samsung eat someone and 3 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.470
 GB RAM synthetics we you 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.210
 try not to burden just 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.270
 let's look at the picture on the hair 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.970
 devices and decide for yourself where and how 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.070
 running up the big screen not only for 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.110
 games are good but the movie for example to see 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.880
 it is quite possible if we are on the same iPhone 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.070
 we can restrict ourselves only to those 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.780
 the amount of memory you chose when buying 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.030
 or back crappy external hard 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.820
 you can insert a card into 4 discs 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.920
 Memory for 128 gigabytes and if it is not 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.860
 enough then you can still take the map 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.960
 memory and more and it is much faster 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.520
 more convenient and more compact in the end 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.930
 good quality display requires 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.370
 good content and it takes 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.950
 really quite a lot of space and 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.200
 if it can be expanded it is always 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.540
 well horde those very chips with hells 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.010
 heart rate monitor and even added a couple 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.900
 add-ons like level measurements 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.820
 blood oxygen as recently studied 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.850
 Tenge sensors for example also appeared 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.830
 but when it's all in one sometimes to someone 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.390
 It may be more convenient remote control you in 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.010
 classical infrared since 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.830
 past generation has not gone anywhere and 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.900
 if you get used to it fairly easy to 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.670
 new background of these buns yet and not 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.100
 anticipated want would be curious 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.840
 look at their implementation version on 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.280
 our view of the superiority of single gadgets 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.260
 over the other to identify quite difficult 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.030
 since for the most part the differences lie 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.430
 names in user ideology but 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.960
 us on android insider is closer still laptop 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.990
 4 due to the mass of small technical 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.030
 fichech eradication below well, but on this 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.350
 us all it was android n centrbt.ru 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.640
