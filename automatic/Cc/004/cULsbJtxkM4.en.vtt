00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
power there with this body which is the

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:03.980 
power there with this body which is the
way<00:00:03.330> he's<00:00:03.480> dressed

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
it's to watch it's things like the cake

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.369 
it's to watch it's things like the cake
all<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.210> thing<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.569> very<00:00:06.629> parent<00:00:07.049> formula

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
all this thing is a very parent formula

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.720 
all this thing is a very parent formula
probably<00:00:08.010> probably<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.429> very<00:00:08.580> firm

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
probably probably got a very firm

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.250 
probably probably got a very firm
handshake<00:00:09.030> as<00:00:09.480> well<00:00:09.630> but<00:00:09.690> probably<00:00:10.110> like<00:00:10.230> a

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
handshake as well but probably like a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.560 
handshake as well but probably like a
vise<00:00:11.040> like<00:00:11.309> probably<00:00:11.730> bit<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> crawl

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
vise like probably bit like a crawl

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.060 
vise like probably bit like a crawl
I<00:00:12.599> don't<00:00:12.960> did<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.139> shake<00:00:13.320> hands<00:00:13.530> with<00:00:13.679> Myles

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
I don't did you shake hands with Myles

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.919 
I don't did you shake hands with Myles
yes<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.280> did<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:14.759> was<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.940> like<00:00:15.030> exactly<00:00:15.299> like

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
yes I did what was it like exactly like

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.609 
yes I did what was it like exactly like
the<00:00:16.080> claw<00:00:18.170> powerful<00:00:19.170> grip<00:00:19.289> there<00:00:19.439> with<00:00:19.529> her

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the claw powerful grip there with her

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.320 
the claw powerful grip there with her
because<00:00:19.740> handshakes<00:00:20.160> are<00:00:20.220> very<00:00:20.369> important<00:00:20.789> to

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
because handshakes are very important to

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.670 
because handshakes are very important to
find<00:00:21.539> out<00:00:21.750> about<00:00:21.900> someone<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.380> their<00:00:22.529> body

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
find out about someone with their body

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.990 
find out about someone with their body
language<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.100> why<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.490> should<00:00:23.640> counter<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
language is why we should counter the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
language is why we should counter the
game<00:00:24.180> didn't<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.449> say<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.230> came<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.529> think

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
game didn't we say when I came I think

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230 
game didn't we say when I came I think
we<00:00:25.769> should<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.070> did<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.670> manage<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.180> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
we should can did you manage to get that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.359 
we should can did you manage to get that
Tim<00:00:27.599> I've<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> graphic<00:00:31.040> it's<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.099> straight

I've got mild asthma

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380 
I've got mild asthma
and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.460> finally<00:01:20.790> said<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.030> should<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and then finally said we should have a

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.789 
and then finally said we should have a
well<00:01:21.659> good<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> engine<00:01:22.409> which<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
well good way of the engine which is a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.109 
well good way of the engine which is a
nice<00:01:22.890> model<00:01:23.189> we're<00:01:23.579> that's<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.880> complicated

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
nice model we're that's so complicated

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.880 
nice model we're that's so complicated
when<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.659> had<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.869> double-handed<00:01:25.320> hashtag

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
when we had a double-handed hashtag

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.800 
when we had a double-handed hashtag
which<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.000> risky<00:01:27.299> one<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.659> worth

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
which is it's a risky one but it's worth

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.330 
which is it's a risky one but it's worth
that<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.110> call<00:01:28.289> that<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.100> glass<00:01:30.950> sorry<00:01:31.950> Alex

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that we call that the glass sorry Alex

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.490 
that we call that the glass sorry Alex
