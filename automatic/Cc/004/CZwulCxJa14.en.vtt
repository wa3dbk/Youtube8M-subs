we've never done that to my knowledge

nobody has ever done we're very excited
about<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.620> also<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.090> risk<00:00:36.270> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
about it and I also think at the risk of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.160 
about it and I also think at the risk of
sounding<00:00:36.829> cliche<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:39.170> possibly

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
sounding cliche I think this is possibly

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.889 
sounding cliche I think this is possibly
the<00:00:40.260> best<00:00:40.469> record<00:00:40.710> we've<00:00:40.980> ever<00:00:41.160> done<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.670> very

known<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.470> long<00:01:16.680> time<00:01:16.979> some<00:01:17.310> people<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.700> just

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
known a long time some people are just

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.870 
known a long time some people are just
met<00:01:18.439> but<00:01:19.439> we're<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> process<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.610> putting

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
met but we're in the process of putting

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.850 
met but we're in the process of putting
all<00:01:21.119> those<00:01:22.640> recordings<00:01:23.640> together<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.860> that's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
all those recordings together and that's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
all those recordings together and that's
why<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.250> delayed<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> release<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.689> first

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
why we delayed the release in the first

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.450 
why we delayed the release in the first
place<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.380> initially<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:29.130> were<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
place I think initially we were going to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.340 
place I think initially we were going to
problem<00:01:29.820> probably<00:01:30.479> look<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> june

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
problem probably look for like a june

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
problem probably look for like a june
release<00:01:31.530> or<00:01:31.920> something<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> be

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
release or something so it's going to be

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.399 
release or something so it's going to be
a<00:01:33.000> very<00:01:33.600> unique<00:01:34.670> sort<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.790> approach<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:37.140> far

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
new material to play even if it's a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.630 
new material to play even if it's a
cover<00:01:55.049> song<00:01:55.290> we've<00:01:55.560> never<00:01:55.770> played<00:01:56.009> before<00:01:56.280> we

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
cover song we've never played before we

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
cover song we've never played before we
always<00:01:56.969> find<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.360> way<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.630> making<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.259> our<00:01:58.530> own

but<00:01:59.219> sometimes<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.000> reinvent<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> old

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
but sometimes you can reinvent the old

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.289 
but sometimes you can reinvent the old
songs<00:02:01.110> too<00:02:01.530> which<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.799> nice<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.030> Allman

we're not one of those bands that's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.760 
we're not one of those bands that's
going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> play<00:02:24.810> all<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.200> biggest<00:02:26.410> songs

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
going to play all the biggest songs

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.949 
going to play all the biggest songs
every<00:02:27.220> night<00:02:27.430> there<00:02:27.940> are<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.150> few<00:02:28.330> songs<00:02:28.600> that

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
every night there are a few songs that

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.740 
every night there are a few songs that
get<00:02:29.280> repeated<00:02:30.280> more<00:02:30.820> than<00:02:31.000> others<00:02:31.300> but<00:02:31.510> for

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
get repeated more than others but for

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.720 
get repeated more than others but for
the<00:02:31.840> most<00:02:31.989> part<00:02:32.110> every<00:02:32.500> show<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.709> different<00:02:33.340> we

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
the most part every show is different we

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.270 
the most part every show is different we
just<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.410> whatever<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:35.709> can<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:35.980> keep

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
just do whatever we can to keep

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.699 
just do whatever we can to keep
ourselves<00:02:36.810> inspired<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.200> hopefully<00:02:38.500> that

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
ourselves inspired and hopefully that

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.250 
ourselves inspired and hopefully that
will<00:02:38.830> keep<00:02:39.250> people<00:02:39.760> coming<00:02:39.910> back<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:41.020> think

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
will keep people coming back and I think

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.680 
will keep people coming back and I think
a<00:02:41.320> nice<00:02:41.560> balance<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.820> two<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.060> really

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
a nice balance of the two is really

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.690 
a nice balance of the two is really
where<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.200> are<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.860> don't<00:02:45.160> think<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.430> Allman

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
where we are I don't think the Allman

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.490 
where we are I don't think the Allman
Brothers<00:02:45.730> would<00:02:46.269> be<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.200> Allman<00:02:47.470> Brothers

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
Brothers would be the Allman Brothers

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.550 
Brothers would be the Allman Brothers
Band<00:02:48.010> or<00:02:48.340> we<00:02:49.150> wouldn't<00:02:49.420> be<00:02:49.510> still<00:02:49.959> around<00:02:50.320> and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
Band or we wouldn't be still around and

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.400 
Band or we wouldn't be still around and
still<00:02:50.860> as<00:02:51.130> valid<00:02:51.610> as<00:02:51.730> as<00:02:51.970> we<00:02:52.300> are<00:02:52.510> without<00:02:53.019> that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
still as valid as as we are without that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.320 
still as valid as as we are without that
balance<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.190> know<00:02:54.310> if<00:02:54.489> we<00:02:54.670> were<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:54.820> playing

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
balance you know if we were just playing

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.500 
balance you know if we were just playing
short<00:02:56.080> versions<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.890> greatest<00:02:57.130> hits<00:02:57.510> then

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
short versions of the greatest hits then

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.780 
short versions of the greatest hits then
nobody<00:02:58.720> would<00:02:59.080> want<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.380> come<00:02:59.530> for<00:02:59.980> 11<00:03:00.340> nights

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
nobody would want to come for 11 nights

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.890 
nobody would want to come for 11 nights
if<00:03:01.209> we<00:03:01.510> were<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:02.080> jamming<00:03:03.180> without<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.600> song

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
if we were just jamming without the song

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.400 
if we were just jamming without the song
craft<00:03:05.380> being<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:06.010> huge<00:03:06.580> part<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.000> equation

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
craft being a huge part of the equation

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.960 
craft being a huge part of the equation
then<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.680> audience<00:03:09.220> would<00:03:09.370> be<00:03:09.550> more<00:03:09.760> limited

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
then the audience would be more limited

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.479 
then the audience would be more limited
but<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.750> think<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.350> combination<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.220> two

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
but I think the combination of the two

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.090 
but I think the combination of the two
is<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.940> winning<00:03:13.450> one<00:03:13.600> I've<00:03:14.320> always<00:03:14.560> wanted<00:03:14.739> to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
is a winning one I've always wanted to

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.490 
is a winning one I've always wanted to
do<00:03:15.310> something<00:03:15.790> with<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.630> symphony<00:03:17.079> but<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.260> never

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
do something with a symphony but I never

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.100 
do something with a symphony but I never
have<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.459> really<00:03:18.700> great<00:03:19.480> challenge

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
have so it's a really great challenge

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.880 
have so it's a really great challenge
for<00:03:20.170> me<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.120> was<00:03:22.540> really<00:03:22.870> psyched<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.530> it

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
for me and I was really psyched that it

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.370 
for me and I was really psyched that it
would<00:03:24.040> be<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.579> know<00:03:24.700> doing<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.540> music<00:03:26.049> under

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
would be you know doing this music under

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.539 
would be you know doing this music under
these<00:03:26.500> conditions<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:27.130> think<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.400> going<00:03:27.459> to

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
these conditions I think it's going to

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.910 
these conditions I think it's going to
be<00:03:27.730> really<00:03:28.510> amazing<00:03:28.870> I'm<00:03:29.260> really<00:03:29.709> psyched

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
be really amazing I'm really psyched

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.199 
be really amazing I'm really psyched
about<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.370> so<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.030> next<00:03:31.060> step<00:03:31.329> i<00:03:31.570> guess<00:03:32.070> was

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
about it so the next step i guess was

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.390 
about it so the next step i guess was
songs<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.810> arrangements<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.860> all<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.160> kind

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
songs and arrangements and all that kind

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.800 
songs and arrangements and all that kind
of<00:03:36.489> stuff<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.910> working<00:03:37.540> with<00:03:37.660> different

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
of stuff and working with different

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.229 
of stuff and working with different
arrangers<00:03:38.500> on<00:03:38.769> how<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.579> approach<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
arrangers on how to approach the

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.479 
arrangers on how to approach the
material<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.930> felt<00:03:41.890> like<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.100> was<00:03:42.250> very

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
material I felt like it was very

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.819 
material I felt like it was very
important<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.090> we<00:03:43.269> take<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.260> Grateful<00:03:44.680> Dead

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
important that we take the Grateful Dead

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.830 
important that we take the Grateful Dead
spirit<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.519> Jerry<00:03:45.760> Garcia<00:03:45.820> spirit<00:03:46.690> and

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
spirit of the Jerry Garcia spirit and

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.380 
spirit of the Jerry Garcia spirit and
approach<00:03:47.650> even<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.280> symphonic<00:03:48.910> production

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
approach even the symphonic production

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.500 
approach even the symphonic production
in<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:50.320> way<00:03:50.530> that's<00:03:50.920> different<00:03:51.299> from<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.390> norm

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
in a way that's different from the norm

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.300 
in a way that's different from the norm
I<00:03:53.019> didn't<00:03:53.410> want<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.769> be<00:03:53.920> just<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:54.220> a

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.529 
and you see the growth spurts you know
like<00:05:50.160> with<00:05:50.310> Duane<00:05:50.580> Allman<00:05:50.789> who<00:05:51.030> was<00:05:51.180> here<00:05:51.330> such

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
like with Duane Allman who was here such

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.629 
like with Duane Allman who was here such
a<00:05:51.570> short<00:05:51.840> period<00:05:51.960> of<00:05:52.470> time<00:05:52.560> he<00:05:53.070> was<00:05:53.370> great<00:05:53.610> in

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
a short period of time he was great in

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.400 
a short period of time he was great in
69<00:05:54.510> but<00:05:55.289> in<00:05:55.410> 70<00:05:56.010> way<00:05:56.520> better<00:05:56.850> and<00:05:57.180> then<00:05:57.389> 71<00:05:58.080> way

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
69 but in 70 way better and then 71 way

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.590 
69 but in 70 way better and then 71 way
better<00:05:58.740> so<00:05:59.070> who<00:05:59.310> knows<00:05:59.490> what<00:05:59.789> seventy<00:06:00.210> two<00:06:00.360> and

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
better so who knows what seventy two and

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.240 
better so who knows what seventy two and
three<00:06:00.780> and<00:06:00.810> four<00:06:00.990> would<00:06:01.830> have<00:06:01.979> brought

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
three and four would have brought

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.400 
three and four would have brought
because<00:06:02.820> you<00:06:02.970> could<00:06:03.120> really<00:06:03.479> see<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.960> that

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
because you could really see that that
