the sidebar so you'll see tables and the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.859 
the sidebar so you'll see tables and the
content<00:01:57.840> distributed<00:01:58.290> throughout<00:01:59.600> get<00:02:00.600> back

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
content distributed throughout get back

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.600 
content distributed throughout get back
to<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.200> front<00:02:01.469> end<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.710> you'll<00:02:01.890> see<00:02:02.130> kind<00:02:02.549> of

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
to the front end and you'll see kind of

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.339 
to the front end and you'll see kind of
how<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.909> tables<00:02:03.600> are<00:02:03.780> laid<00:02:04.020> out

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.270 

it's<00:02:09.349> easiest<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:10.700> my<00:02:11.150> opinion<00:02:11.950> just<00:02:12.950> to

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
it's easiest in my opinion just to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.530 
it's easiest in my opinion just to
include<00:02:14.180> vertical<00:02:14.900> content<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:17.420> a

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
include vertical content in a in a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.520 
include vertical content in a in a
single<00:02:17.989> vertical<00:02:18.439> table<00:02:19.219> and<00:02:19.370> then<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.900> then

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
single vertical table and then and then

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.920 
single vertical table and then and then
align<00:02:21.920> those<00:02:22.129> via<00:02:22.370> line<00:02:22.609> those<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.150> top<00:02:23.390> be

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
align those via line those to the top be

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.170 
align those via line those to the top be
a<00:02:23.959> minus<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.620> top<00:02:24.829> and<00:02:25.069> just<00:02:25.939> kind<00:02:26.150> of

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
a minus to the top and just kind of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.280 
a minus to the top and just kind of
separate<00:02:26.659> everything<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.310> blank<00:02:28.790> in<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.959> cell

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
separate everything be a blank in a cell

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.729 
separate everything be a blank in a cell
basically<00:02:32.230> everything<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.319> centered

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
basically everything is centered

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.869 
basically everything is centered
horizontally<00:02:34.099> and<00:02:34.900> via<00:02:35.900> line<00:02:36.139> to<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.439> top<00:02:36.879> so

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
horizontally and via line to the top so

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.490 
horizontally and via line to the top so
that's<00:02:38.090> basically<00:02:38.389> what<00:02:39.019> we<00:02:39.139> had<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.379> work

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
that's basically what we had to work

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.949 
that's basically what we had to work
with<00:02:39.650> at<00:02:39.769> this<00:02:39.859> point<00:02:39.950> all<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.579> these<00:02:40.970> are

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
with at this point all of these are

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.170 
with at this point all of these are
single<00:02:42.439> images<00:02:42.829> you<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.400> get<00:02:43.579> more<00:02:43.760> elaborate

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
single images you can get more elaborate

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.349 
single images you can get more elaborate
if<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.419> want<00:02:44.599> but<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.439> this<00:02:46.040> was<00:02:46.250> by<00:02:47.030> far<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
if you want but the this was by far the

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.740 
if you want but the this was by far the
simplest<00:02:47.930> way<00:02:48.919> to<00:02:48.950> do<00:02:49.340> things<00:02:49.579> and<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.299> do<00:02:50.510> them

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
simplest way to do things and to do them

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.159 
simplest way to do things and to do them
well<00:02:51.079> so<00:02:51.470> that<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:52.069> translates<00:02:52.639> to<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.239> widest

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
well so that it translates to the widest

00:02:54.169 --> 00:03:01.209 
well so that it translates to the widest
variety<00:02:54.319> of<00:02:54.620> email<00:02:55.040> clients<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.959> I<00:03:00.219> basically

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.219 
variety of email clients so I basically

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.690 
variety of email clients so I basically
you<00:03:01.519> can<00:03:01.639> take<00:03:01.819> this<00:03:02.950> HTML<00:03:03.950> content<00:03:04.159> and<00:03:04.489> copy

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
you can take this HTML content and copy

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.909 
you can take this HTML content and copy
it<00:03:04.939> or<00:03:06.639> we're<00:03:07.639> in<00:03:07.879> online<00:03:08.269> outbox<00:03:08.870> we<00:03:09.739> can

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919 
it or we're in online outbox we can

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:15.640 
it or we're in online outbox we can
actually<00:03:11.260> import<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.470> file<00:03:14.290> I'm<00:03:15.290> going<00:03:15.470> to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
actually import this file I'm going to

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.680 
actually import this file I'm going to
go<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.829> templates<00:03:16.430> create<00:03:16.879> custom<00:03:17.239> template

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.220 

we're<00:03:20.690> going<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.870> name<00:03:21.049> this<00:03:21.079> template

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.890 

and<00:03:27.230> we<00:03:27.890> will<00:03:28.069> not<00:03:28.340> use<00:03:28.400> an<00:03:28.790> email<00:03:28.939> template<00:03:29.480> to

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
and we will not use an email template to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.619 
and we will not use an email template to
begin<00:03:30.230> with<00:03:30.730> we'll<00:03:31.730> do<00:03:31.879> it<00:03:32.000> all<00:03:32.180> from<00:03:32.540> scratch

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
begin with we'll do it all from scratch

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.140 
begin with we'll do it all from scratch
now<00:03:33.349> again<00:03:33.500> like<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:33.890> said<00:03:33.920> we<00:03:34.370> could<00:03:34.640> upload

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
now again like I said we could upload

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.630 
now again like I said we could upload
this<00:03:35.359> file<00:03:35.659> from<00:03:35.959> our<00:03:36.140> computer<00:03:36.469> but<00:03:37.340> it's

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
this file from our computer but it's

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.619 
this file from our computer but it's
it's<00:03:38.390> almost<00:03:39.109> easier<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:39.950> this<00:03:40.640> case<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:44.480> you

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
it's almost easier in this case so you

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:53.699 
it's almost easier in this case so you
simply<00:03:44.900> copy<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:45.680> paste<00:03:46.609> in<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:48.530> HTML<00:03:49.219> editor

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.619 

you'll<00:03:54.709> notice<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.700> images<00:03:56.480> are<00:03:56.599> not

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
you'll notice the images are not

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.640 
you'll notice the images are not
referenced<00:03:57.730> so<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:59.120> easiest<00:03:59.209> thing<00:03:59.780> to<00:04:00.049> do<00:04:00.349> is

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
referenced so the easiest thing to do is

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.610 
referenced so the easiest thing to do is
to<00:04:01.459> go<00:04:02.030> in<00:04:02.329> and<00:04:02.629> just<00:04:03.370> upload<00:04:04.370> those<00:04:04.579> images<00:04:05.620> so

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
to go in and just upload those images so

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.030 
to go in and just upload those images so
we<00:04:06.739> can<00:04:06.919> upload<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:08.780> specific<00:04:09.290> image<00:04:09.620> from

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
we can upload the specific image from

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:21.180 
we can upload the specific image from
our<00:04:10.480> particular<00:04:13.659> clients<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:19.220> would<00:04:19.430> be

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
our particular clients and this would be

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.870 
our particular clients and this would be
heterotopic<00:04:26.169> back<00:04:27.169> in<00:04:27.410> we<00:04:28.099> can<00:04:28.250> then<00:04:28.400> update

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
heterotopic back in we can then update

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.670 
heterotopic back in we can then update
that<00:04:30.550> in<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.729> same<00:04:32.000> manner<00:04:32.270> we<00:04:33.260> would<00:04:33.380> just<00:04:33.560> go

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
that in the same manner we would just go

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.529 
that in the same manner we would just go
through<00:04:33.949> and<00:04:34.159> replace<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.880> I've<00:04:35.360> gone

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
through and replace and I've gone

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:36.850 
through and replace and I've gone
through<00:04:35.659> and<00:04:35.930> uploaded<00:04:36.289> these<00:04:36.380> images<00:04:36.740> yet

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
through and uploaded these images yet

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.580 
through and uploaded these images yet
images<00:04:37.430> ahead<00:04:37.639> of<00:04:37.760> time<00:04:37.909> but<00:04:38.979> you<00:04:39.979> can<00:04:40.130> see<00:04:40.370> how

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
images ahead of time but you can see how

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.050 
images ahead of time but you can see how
to<00:04:42.590> basically<00:04:42.919> just<00:04:43.130> replace<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:44.000> existing

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:58.799 

images<00:04:50.060> with<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.110> actual<00:04:51.590> images

00:04:58.799 --> 00:04:58.809 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:02.350

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
from here so i will i'll go through and

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.899 
from here so i will i'll go through and
continue<00:05:02.749> that<00:05:03.379> method<00:05:04.159> and<00:05:04.309> do<00:05:04.429> more<00:05:04.580> i'll

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
continue that method and do more i'll

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.589 
continue that method and do more i'll
see<00:05:05.119> you<00:05:05.179> on<00:05:05.239> the<00:05:05.360> other<00:05:05.389> side<00:05:07.300> okay<00:05:08.300> so<00:05:08.360> I've

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
see you on the other side okay so I've

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:09.999 
see you on the other side okay so I've
gone<00:05:08.779> through<00:05:08.839> and<00:05:09.139> replaced<00:05:09.439> all<00:05:09.589> the<00:05:09.619> images

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 
gone through and replaced all the images

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.570 
gone through and replaced all the images
I<00:05:10.599> formatted<00:05:11.599> some<00:05:11.959> of<00:05:12.080> this<00:05:12.169> text<00:05:12.769> to<00:05:13.189> make<00:05:13.369> it

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
I formatted some of this text to make it

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.479 
I formatted some of this text to make it
just<00:05:14.300> a<00:05:14.389> little<00:05:14.419> more<00:05:17.319> closer<00:05:18.319> to<00:05:18.619> what<00:05:18.800> the

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:19.489 
just a little more closer to what the

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:23.079 
just a little more closer to what the
the<00:05:19.759> client<00:05:20.089> was<00:05:20.179> wanting<00:05:20.649> but<00:05:21.649> basically<00:05:22.369> we

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:23.089 
the client was wanting but basically we

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:30.070 
the client was wanting but basically we
can<00:05:24.069> select<00:05:25.069> text<00:05:25.519> and<00:05:26.389> select<00:05:27.349> the<00:05:28.629> family<00:05:29.629> so

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
can select text and select the family so

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.139 
can select text and select the family so
if<00:05:30.199> we<00:05:30.529> don't<00:05:30.800> want<00:05:30.979> it<00:05:31.069> to<00:05:31.219> follow<00:05:31.519> the<00:05:31.909> other

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:32.149 
if we don't want it to follow the other

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:37.499 
if we don't want it to follow the other
CSS<00:05:32.649> we<00:05:33.649> can<00:05:33.969> select<00:05:34.969> it<00:05:35.330> and<00:05:35.509> just<00:05:36.069> stylize<00:05:37.069> it

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
CSS we can select it and just stylize it

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.299 
CSS we can select it and just stylize it
immediately<00:05:38.889> here<00:05:39.889> if<00:05:40.099> we<00:05:40.279> want<00:05:40.459> things<00:05:40.909> to<00:05:41.209> be

00:05:42.299 --> 00:05:42.309 
immediately here if we want things to be

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:47.919 
immediately here if we want things to be
specific<00:05:43.309> links<00:05:44.019> we<00:05:45.019> can<00:05:45.169> do<00:05:45.349> that<00:05:45.619> as<00:05:46.929> you

those<00:06:30.679> is<00:06:30.939> they<00:06:31.939> are<00:06:31.969> using<00:06:32.679> their<00:06:33.679> just

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
those is they are using their just

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.899 
those is they are using their just
stripping<00:06:34.369> anything<00:06:35.059> before<00:06:35.749> the<00:06:36.909> beginning

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:37.909 
stripping anything before the beginning

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:41.649 
stripping anything before the beginning
tags<00:06:38.479> so<00:06:39.169> if<00:06:39.379> you<00:06:39.499> had<00:06:39.789> style<00:06:40.789> in<00:06:41.089> the<00:06:41.269> header

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
tags so if you had style in the header

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.790 
tags so if you had style in the header
they<00:06:42.589> would<00:06:42.740> be<00:06:42.919> stripped<00:06:43.659> so<00:06:44.659> this<00:06:45.439> is<00:06:45.589> how<00:06:45.740> we

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
they would be stripped so this is how we

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.119 
they would be stripped so this is how we
do<00:06:46.039> this<00:06:46.249> here<00:06:46.699> in<00:06:46.999> just<00:06:47.719> within<00:06:47.929> the<00:06:48.050> body<00:06:48.259> so

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.129 
do this here in just within the body so

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.730 
do this here in just within the body so
the<00:06:49.249> body<00:06:49.399> can<00:06:49.519> reference<00:06:49.969> that<00:06:50.289> so<00:06:51.289> basically

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
the body can reference that so basically

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.029 
the body can reference that so basically
we<00:06:52.249> have<00:06:56.139> you<00:06:57.139> know<00:06:57.259> we've<00:06:57.469> replaced<00:06:57.860> the
