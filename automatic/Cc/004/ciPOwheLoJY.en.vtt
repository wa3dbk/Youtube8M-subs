thigh guard and that's actually going to

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.700 
thigh guard and that's actually going to
be<00:01:29.460> integrated<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.510> knee<00:01:30.720> stack<00:01:31.500> as

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
be integrated into the knee stack as

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.280 
be integrated into the knee stack as
well<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.450> first<00:01:33.450> layer<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.870> knee<00:01:34.050> stock

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
well the first layer of the knee stock

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.260 
well the first layer of the knee stock
right<00:01:34.530> here<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.950> gonna<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.610> soft<00:01:35.970> foam

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
right here is gonna be that soft foam

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.820 
right here is gonna be that soft foam
and<00:01:36.510> so<00:01:37.080> it's<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> give<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.620> really

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
comfortable feel there and then the next

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.960 
comfortable feel there and then the next
layer<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.860> knee<00:01:41.250> stack<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:41.940> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
layer of the knee stack is going to be a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.000 
layer of the knee stack is going to be a
little<00:01:42.330> bit<00:01:42.480> denser<00:01:42.930> foam<00:01:43.140> that's<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
little bit denser foam that's going to

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.410 
little bit denser foam that's going to
give<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.430> bit<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.760> protection

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
and then this next layer is going to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.940 
and then this next layer is going to
help<00:01:48.720> absorb<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.200> lot<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.500> shock<00:01:49.740> when

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
bit better rebound control and then

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.809 
bit better rebound control and then
taking<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.349> look<00:02:28.380> at<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.830> flex<00:02:29.250> points<00:02:29.640> here

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
taking a look at the flex points here

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.370 
taking a look at the flex points here
there's<00:02:30.239> gonna<00:02:30.360> be<00:02:30.480> one<00:02:30.660> right<00:02:30.930> above<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.780 
flex with these pads and it's also going
to<00:02:37.500> make<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.160> little<00:02:38.310> bit<00:02:38.520> narrower

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
to make it so it's a little bit narrower

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.420 
to make it so it's a little bit narrower
