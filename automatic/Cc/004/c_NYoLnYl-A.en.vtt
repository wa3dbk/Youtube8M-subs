00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.610
 game folder that local disk is 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.150
 let's do and gentlemen we can play now 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.270
 online very important we need to have 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.250
 steam open I use my main account 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.010
 but I recommend that you do not use it 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.900
 main belief an account together with 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.720
 your friend or with the person you are going to 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.600
 play online to play two online 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.670
 people and in this method the two have 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.650
 that I use crack I do not think the two 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.090
 they have to use crack I do not think 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.000
 can play with people who have 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.380
 the original game because at the moment of 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.360
 what are you playing you mark yourself as if 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.040
 you were playing space guard other 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.290
 game does not make you look like you're 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.230
 playing spin trailers so they 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.730
 I also recommend that you use your account 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.440
 secondary not your primary account for 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 this kind of case and well that's it 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.190
 what you have to do is just paste the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.470
 crack in the espn trailers folder in 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.290
 the folder where the game is and that's 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.690
 we have everything ready to play at 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.940
 multiplayer obviously have to have 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.220
 open esteem there is no need to poke 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.110
 the game to sting like we did with 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.820
 euro 3 or anything that there is no need to 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.110
 do nothing but take the steam has 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.300
 open here I have it give me the steam 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.070
 have open esteem and therefore have the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.440
 game installed not here we paste the crack 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.120
 and it's all I'm going to pause this 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.490
 video because now I'm going to record for 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.260
 that they see that it is already working 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.790
 bogrÃ¡n I will put the payment of the cam you are 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.050
 already because camps is if I do not use it for 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.630
 to record the ones in place we were not going to open 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.490
 here the game because well we 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.080
 back gentlemen as you see I have to 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.060
 steam what is the steam 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.550
 let's see see them tell me I'm 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.690
 playing space war my friend proposes is the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.760
 that will help me to see that 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.710
 is working totally they say that 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.560
 we're playing space war that's what 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.360
 Mark when when you are playing 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.700
 sprint airs with the character case that 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.530
 I just passed them is not very important 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.420
 open it as administrator right click 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.490
 and run as a game administrator 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.930
 you just have to go here and 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.810
 come here there is a lobby that is in 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.280
 progress and say that a player is missing 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.320
 I think if you can join anybody 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.210
 of these lobbies but to play with your 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.930
 friend, you have to give him a game here 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.240
 among friends here you give and create a 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.490
 game of friends and you put him create 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.170
 a meeting here to create a 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.240
 meeting point then you choose the map 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.490
 that you want and a plain we are going to 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.950
 put a plain here is the difficulty 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.570
 casual or simulation you already know not the 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.870
 they wanted players to paint and then 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.540
 you know what this is 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.030
 and here we invite you to invite friends here 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.280

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.980
 to the same stage and invite him 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.670
 let's wait for him to join and here I 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.130
 it's going to look like an inhabitant 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.930
 you already saw and says you are not ready 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.850
 because this tells you that you prepare that 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.250
 if you are ready to start the game 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.730

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.740

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.729
 go to the ironworks for the woods and 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.610

 why we listen to the sea we are going to 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.690
 cross the sea a little bit to leave them a 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.070
 little bit more so that they see that if it 's 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.000
 A) Yes 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.880
