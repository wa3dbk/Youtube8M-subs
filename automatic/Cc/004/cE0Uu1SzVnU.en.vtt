 the meat of the network 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.409

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.130
 they can account 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.290
 is already ending in our network is 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.080
 releasing those cubes that are being 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.760
 mixing with the ginger with the garlic and 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.860

 the traffickers 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.580
 a good man is doing our 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.870
 sauce 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.040
 we add at this time we are going to get 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.040
 our broccoli 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.530
 is the cooking and the reason starts friends 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.650
 the aroma and the flavors 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.750
 for now add the broccoli already 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.660
 We gave 5 minutes of cooking 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.900
 approximately we incorporate all the 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.900
 Peppers 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.770

 We already gave you 32 cooking equipment now 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:04.010
 what we are going to do is our slurry 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.860
 we have speculated on fried water corn 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.050
 there is very good 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.050
 but what are we going to do is mix it like this 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.550
 for flavor 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.950
 what began to be done here 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.050
 what we are going to do is express it with 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.430
 this 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.430
 then there is very good 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.460
 we started moving move move that can 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.380
 see this well expressing that now 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.940
 incorporate with the other ingredients 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.870
 this so that it sticks and every bite 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.240
 have that characteristic flavor of 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.270
 cubes 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.390
 of the meat vegetables all 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.390
