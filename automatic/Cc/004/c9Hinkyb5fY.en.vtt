hi<00:00:00.420> guys<00:00:00.630> this<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.920> just<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.399> quick<00:00:02.970> video

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
hi guys this is just a quick video

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.960 
hi guys this is just a quick video
particularly<00:00:04.710> for<00:00:05.009> slider<00:00:05.930> 273<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.760> suggest<00:00:08.760> I

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
particularly for slider 273 to suggest I

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.009 
particularly for slider 273 to suggest I
could<00:00:09.210> solar-power

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
could solar-power

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.539 
could solar-power
my<00:00:10.440> little<00:00:10.710> car<00:00:12.650> well<00:00:13.650> I've<00:00:13.769> done<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.160> sort

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
my little car well I've done that sort

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.180 
my little car well I've done that sort
of<00:00:15.020> all<00:00:16.020> I've<00:00:16.230> done<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.560> I've<00:00:16.680> connected<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.160> few

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
of all I've done is I've connected a few

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.689 
of all I've done is I've connected a few
solar<00:00:17.670> panels<00:00:18.320> directly<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.680> those<00:00:19.830> external

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
solar panels directly to those external

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.679 
solar panels directly to those external
contacts<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.810> I've<00:00:21.960> put<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.320> car<00:00:23.689> just

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
contacts that I've put on this car just

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.130 
contacts that I've put on this car just
lift<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.019> up<00:00:26.029> so<00:00:27.029> that's<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.390> wired<00:00:27.750> round

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
lift it up so that's just wired round

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.070 
lift it up so that's just wired round
there<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:29.119> hopefully<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.240> charged<00:00:30.689> up<00:00:30.900> in

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
there so hopefully it's charged up in

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.870 
there so hopefully it's charged up in
the<00:00:31.199> Sun<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.679> morning<00:00:34.430> it's<00:00:35.430> been<00:00:35.579> raining

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the Sun this morning it's been raining

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
the Sun this morning it's been raining
as<00:00:36.149> well<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.870> we've<00:00:37.020> had<00:00:37.140> much

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
as well so I don't think we've had much

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:51.290 
as well so I don't think we've had much
Sun<00:00:40.640> there<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.730> go<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> that's<00:00:50.309> charged<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.059> my

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
Sun there we go so that's charged up my

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.670 
Sun there we go so that's charged up my
super<00:00:52.140> capacitor<00:00:52.739> that's<00:00:52.949> inside<00:00:53.340> there<00:00:54.680> from

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
super capacitor that's inside there from

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
super capacitor that's inside there from
the<00:00:55.829> sunlight<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.370> morning<00:00:56.820> without<00:00:57.539> any

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the sunlight this morning without any

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
the sunlight this morning without any
clever<00:00:58.350> circuitry<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.370> think<00:00:59.550> that's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
clever circuitry or and I think that's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.049 
clever circuitry or and I think that's
just<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.649> few<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.920> solar<00:01:02.309> panels<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.879> I've

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
just a few of my solar panels that I've

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.509 
just a few of my solar panels that I've
joined<00:01:03.239> together<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> different<00:01:04.619> project

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
joined together for a different project

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.750 
joined together for a different project
and<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.990> thought<00:01:07.170> how<00:01:07.950> about<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.310> wiring

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and I just thought how about just wiring

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.780 
and I just thought how about just wiring
them<00:01:08.939> straight<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> those<00:01:09.659> contacts<00:01:10.790> so

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
them straight on to those contacts so

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.160 
them straight on to those contacts so
that's<00:01:11.970> all<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.270> done<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.659> charged

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that's all it's done it's just charged

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
that's all it's done it's just charged
up<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> super<00:01:13.830> cap<00:01:15.049> won't<00:01:16.049> last<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.590> long<00:01:19.759> but

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
up the super cap won't last for long but

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.070 
up the super cap won't last for long but
that<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:20.970> enough<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> give<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.630> little<00:01:21.720> run

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that was enough to give it a little run

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.999 
that was enough to give it a little run
this<00:01:22.320> morning<00:01:23.509> let's<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.140> show<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
this morning let's see if I can show you

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.749 
this morning let's see if I can show you
the<00:01:26.250> circuitry<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> super<00:01:30.600> capacitor

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
the circuitry this is a super capacitor

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:39.649 
the circuitry this is a super capacitor
2<00:01:32.759> point<00:01:33.030> 7<00:01:33.390> volts<00:01:33.869> 5<00:01:34.560> ferrets<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.360> start

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
2 point 7 volts 5 ferrets so if we start

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.719 
2 point 7 volts 5 ferrets so if we start
from<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.960> positive<00:01:40.140> side<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> super

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
from the positive side of the super

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.569 
from the positive side of the super
capacitor<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:43.409> goes<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> positive<00:01:44.340> side

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
capacitor that goes to the positive side

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.960 
capacitor that goes to the positive side
of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.850> motor<00:01:45.710> we've<00:01:46.710> also<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> wire<00:01:47.759> that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
of the motor we've also got a wire that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.069 
of the motor we've also got a wire that
goes<00:01:48.030> from<00:01:48.540> there

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
goes from there

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.530 
goes from there
the<00:01:49.740> red<00:01:49.920> one<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.829> brass<00:01:52.829> contact<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the red one to this brass contact that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.469 
the red one to this brass contact that
sticks<00:01:54.930> outside<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.680> car<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.360> can

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
sticks outside the car so that we can

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.160 
sticks outside the car so that we can
charge<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.790> from<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.939> negative<00:02:00.329> side<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
charge it from the negative side of the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.030 
charge it from the negative side of the
super<00:02:01.619> capacitor<00:02:03.079> goes<00:02:04.079> around<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.710> blue

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
super capacitor goes around this blue

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.760 
super capacitor goes around this blue
wire<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:06.299> goes<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.170> other<00:02:07.380> brass

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
wire that goes to this other brass

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.160 
wire that goes to this other brass
contact<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.910> we<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.179> charge<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.660> from<00:02:09.810> outside

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
contact so we can charge it from outside

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.780 
contact so we can charge it from outside
the<00:02:10.349> car

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the car

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.649 
the car
it<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:12.719> goes<00:02:13.099> into<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.459> switch<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> put

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
it then goes into the switch that I put

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.050 
it then goes into the switch that I put
on<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.870> back<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.230> car

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
on the back of the car

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.809 
on the back of the car
through<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.209> switch<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.260> other<00:02:19.349> side

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
through the switch and the other side

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.059 
through the switch and the other side
comes<00:02:20.819> around<00:02:21.120> here<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.379> negative<00:02:22.769> side

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
comes around here to the negative side

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.750 
comes around here to the negative side
of<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.280> motor<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:25.739> we<00:02:25.890> turn<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.280> switch<00:02:26.519> on

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
of the motor so if we turn the switch on

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.069 
of the motor so if we turn the switch on
I<00:02:27.030> think<00:02:27.090> there's<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.359> little<00:02:27.510> bit<00:02:27.659> of<00:02:27.840> charge

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
I think there's a little bit of charge

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.030 
I think there's a little bit of charge
left<00:02:28.379> in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> capacitor<00:02:29.250> yep<00:02:30.560> just<00:02:31.560> enough<00:02:31.829> to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
left in the capacitor yep just enough to

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.089 
left in the capacitor yep just enough to
make<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.519> go<00:02:33.829> nearly<00:02:34.829> run<00:02:35.010> out<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.829> should

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
make it go nearly run out so I should

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.860 
make it go nearly run out so I should
just<00:02:38.129> tuck<00:02:38.549> these<00:02:38.790> wires<00:02:39.090> out<00:02:39.359> the<00:02:39.510> way<00:02:39.629> with<00:02:39.840> a
