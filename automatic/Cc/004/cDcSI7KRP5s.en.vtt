00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.630
 bad so far good this you also 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.720
 spanair for your home your castle or what 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.430
 that is if the golems not 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.500
 it satisfies because we agree it is very 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.450
 fools if they go walking and they do not work 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.660
 for not good at all I say no 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.600
 they serve for nothing when estz dÃ­az 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.830
 you will only need as long as you are not 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.670

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.620

 there will be waiting for our 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.330
 our own knights 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.670
 now let's put up 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.140
 of archer 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.569
 let's do work here 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.000
 and here we are going to put an archer we are going to 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.940
 put another by rows and here we go to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.240
 put one of our magicians we are going to 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.240
 put it 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.450
 well let's say we already have our 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.310
 castle in our house well defended 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.270
 of defense defended by him 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.640
 and we are going to put them to fight with the 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.340
 enemies 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.610
 the enemy knights 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.470
 now let's fight 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.130
 and they are going to be defending their 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.890
 Castle also fight with stretches and 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.610
 all 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.430
 these are winning ours for 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.770
 that they see are very strong every time 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.190
 we beat an enemy like that exploits 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.810
 and fill all the fire 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.880
 Now let's remove it now 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.430
 We are going away, take off, remove, remove, remove, remove 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.510
 removes and removes our win 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.290
 now let's put one of archers 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.010
 enemies so that others fight 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.019
 archers with him with them 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.959
 this also as I say he defends 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:55.260
 Move mods are defending themselves 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.019
 hurry up the case and they already died so that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.689
 see that they are fine but our archers 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:03.750
 what I do not like is that it fills everything 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.640
 Fire fucking mode is the only bad thing 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.960
 this is our magician let's put another 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.819
 magician to see what happens 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:15.010
 I was wrong 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.010
 let's put one of enemy magician 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:21.310
 well what does our enemy do? 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.410
 magician is that he fills everything with fire 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.300
 they already saw good the same one just 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.520
 commit suicide 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.940
 and he is making his spells so that 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.650
 drop all this all but let me remove 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.360
 this because if you 're not going to keep doing 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.340
 spawn 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.460
 a jet of gray spokes cars is 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.699
 being a disaster thank you in ways this 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.699
 mod 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.620
 but a disaster a wow side 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.129
 I do not know why it is falling both 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.739
 passive atheistic passive 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.899
 to this you can rest assured little friend 

00:04:55.739 --> 00:05:00.719
 this is the ring all thanks to all 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:03.460
 the attacks of these so I should not have 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:05.440
 have put loft and fine 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.470
 and good as I say it is what adds 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.210
 to this mode you will put your spanair of 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.310

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.110
