past six years the United States is
rapidly<00:01:14.880> becoming<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.450> leader<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.840> solar

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
rapidly becoming a leader in solar

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.980 
rapidly becoming a leader in solar
energy<00:01:16.880> last<00:01:17.880> year<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.270> biggest<00:01:18.750> year

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
energy last year was the biggest year

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.100 
energy last year was the biggest year
for<00:01:19.409> solar<00:01:19.650> power<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.610> our<00:01:20.790> history<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.570> in

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
for solar power in our history and in

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
for solar power in our history and in
fact<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.920> solar<00:01:23.159> industry<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.729> adding<00:01:24.060> jobs

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
fact the solar industry is adding jobs

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.749 
fact the solar industry is adding jobs
ten<00:01:24.600> times<00:01:24.810> faster<00:01:25.290> than<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.680> economy<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
ten times faster than the economy as a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.140 
ten times faster than the economy as a
whole

whole

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.569

so<00:01:27.810> we're<00:01:28.200> proving<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.950> possible<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
so we're proving that it is possible to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.359 
so we're proving that it is possible to
grow<00:01:30.270> our<00:01:30.509> economy<00:01:30.990> robustly<00:01:31.470> while<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.250> the

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
as a whole because as we get economies

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.569 
as a whole because as we get economies
of<00:03:10.349> scale<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.180> demand<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.949> solar<00:03:13.949> and<00:03:14.340> wind

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
of scale and demand for solar and wind

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.699 
of scale and demand for solar and wind
and<00:03:15.239> other<00:03:15.359> renewable<00:03:15.780> energies<00:03:16.469> growth

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
and other renewable energies growth

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.909 
and other renewable energies growth
obviously<00:03:17.900> that<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.079> help<00:03:19.199> drive<00:03:19.470> down<00:03:19.769> the

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
obviously that can help drive down the

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.249 
obviously that can help drive down the
overall<00:03:20.489> price<00:03:20.759> make<00:03:21.659> it<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.900> much<00:03:22.079> more

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:22.259 
overall price make it that much more

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:23.479 
overall price make it that much more
efficient<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.859> we<00:03:22.949> start<00:03:23.189> getting<00:03:23.310> a

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
efficient and we start getting a

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.879 
efficient and we start getting a
virtuous<00:03:23.909> cycle<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:25.439> good<00:03:25.620> for<00:03:25.829> the

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
virtuous cycle that is good for the

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.469 
virtuous cycle that is good for the
environment<00:03:26.009> and<00:03:26.579> creates<00:03:26.909> jobs<00:03:27.000> here<00:03:27.449> in

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:27.479 
environment and creates jobs here in

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.629 
environment and creates jobs here in
America<00:03:27.599> so<00:03:28.019> we<00:03:28.799> very<00:03:29.040> much<00:03:29.250> want<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.579> thank
