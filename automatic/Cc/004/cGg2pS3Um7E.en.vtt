I<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:32.729> think<00:01:32.850> dentistry<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:34.020> lot<00:01:34.290> more

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
I really think dentistry is a lot more

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.200 
I really think dentistry is a lot more
than<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.979> being<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.310> molar<00:01:35.490> mechanic<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
than just being a molar mechanic it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.800 
than just being a molar mechanic it
really<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:37.140> being<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:38.369> physician<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
really is about being a physician of the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.149 
really is about being a physician of the
oral<00:01:40.140> mouth<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.560> think<00:01:40.770> there's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.979> real

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
oral mouth I think there's a real

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
oral mouth I think there's a real
responsibility<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.630> has<00:01:42.750> been<00:01:42.930> lost

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
responsibility that really has been lost

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.300 
responsibility that really has been lost
we<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.530> over<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> years<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.100> down<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
we think over the years in down the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.359 
we think over the years in down the
street<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:45.119> think<00:01:45.689> especially<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.950> all<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
street I think especially with all the

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
street I think especially with all the

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
suppose I was just I was not quite

getting the results that I expected you

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.130 
getting the results that I expected you
know<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.090> was<00:04:32.180> using<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:32.450> lot<00:04:32.540> of<00:04:32.600> appliances

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
know I was using a lot of appliances

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.230 
know I was using a lot of appliances
that<00:04:33.350> I<00:04:33.590> was<00:04:33.980> told<00:04:34.190> would<00:04:34.430> get<00:04:34.910> those<00:04:35.060> results

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
that I was told would get those results

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.810 
that I was told would get those results
but<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:36.020> didn't<00:04:36.320> really<00:04:36.470> I<00:04:36.740> didn't<00:04:37.340> I<00:04:37.460> would

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
but it didn't really I didn't I would

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.100 
but it didn't really I didn't I would
get<00:04:37.940> close<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.420> where<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:38.570> was<00:04:38.690> trying<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:38.930> get

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
get close to where I was trying to get

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.390 
get close to where I was trying to get
to<00:04:39.230> but<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.500> didn't<00:04:39.980> quite<00:04:40.040> get<00:04:40.460> there<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:42.400> I

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
to but it didn't quite get there and I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.830 
to but it didn't quite get there and I
suppose<00:04:43.760> I<00:04:43.940> was<00:04:44.030> happy<00:04:44.300> with<00:04:44.420> it<00:04:44.600> because<00:04:44.720> I

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
suppose I was happy with it because I

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.030 
suppose I was happy with it because I
knew<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.020> was<00:04:45.140> doing<00:04:45.290> a<00:04:45.350> lot<00:04:45.440> better<00:04:45.500> than<00:04:45.860> what

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
knew I was doing a lot better than what

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.610 
knew I was doing a lot better than what
others<00:04:46.640> would<00:04:46.790> do<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.210> achieve<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:47.720> but<00:04:48.560> I

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
others would do to achieve that but I

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.190 
others would do to achieve that but I
wasn't<00:04:48.980> getting<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.490> my<00:04:49.880> my<00:04:50.420> goal<00:04:50.690> you<00:04:51.080> know

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
but the actual treatment they're doing

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.520 
but the actual treatment they're doing
is<00:05:13.880> exactly<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.360> same<00:05:14.540> so<00:05:14.750> I<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:15.080> came<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.500> a

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
is exactly the same so I I came to a

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.630 
is exactly the same so I I came to a
point<00:05:15.650> where<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:15.890> wasn't<00:05:16.100> learning<00:05:16.370> anything

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
point where I wasn't learning anything

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.960 
point where I wasn't learning anything
anything<00:05:17.540> new<00:05:17.870> so<00:05:18.560> it<00:05:18.620> wasn't<00:05:18.920> until<00:05:19.190> I<00:05:19.490> looked

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
anything new so it wasn't until I looked

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.150 
anything new so it wasn't until I looked
at<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.300> when<00:05:20.510> I<00:05:20.540> realized<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:21.080> there's<00:05:22.070> a

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
at this when I realized that there's a

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.920 
at this when I realized that there's a
hole<00:05:22.310> bigger<00:05:22.580> world<00:05:22.820> out<00:05:23.030> there<00:05:23.150> that<00:05:23.480> I<00:05:23.630> need

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
hole bigger world out there that I need

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.380 
hole bigger world out there that I need
to<00:05:24.050> explore<00:05:24.430> just<00:05:25.430> that<00:05:25.580> you<00:05:25.790> know<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.240> whole

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
to explore just that you know the whole

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.270 
to explore just that you know the whole
I<00:05:26.510> suppose<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.840> whole<00:05:26.990> philosophy<00:05:27.290> that<00:05:27.650> that

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
I suppose the whole philosophy that that

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.980 
I suppose the whole philosophy that that
you<00:05:28.490> know<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:28.760> that<00:05:29.150> muscles<00:05:29.630> and<00:05:29.840> either

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
you know that that muscles and either

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.510 
you know that that muscles and either
way<00:05:30.200> and<00:05:30.380> that<00:05:30.500> can<00:05:30.710> actually<00:05:30.860> have<00:05:31.100> an<00:05:31.190> effect

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
way and that can actually have an effect

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.700 
way and that can actually have an effect
on<00:05:31.640> how<00:05:31.790> faces<00:05:32.210> growing<00:05:32.450> I<00:05:32.810> mean<00:05:33.230> people<00:05:33.590> just

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
on how faces growing I mean people just

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.020 
on how faces growing I mean people just
don't<00:05:33.980> believe<00:05:34.190> that<00:05:34.400> they<00:05:34.520> just<00:05:34.700> think<00:05:34.880> that

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
don't believe that they just think that

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.450 
don't believe that they just think that
you<00:05:35.180> know<00:05:35.270> it's<00:05:35.750> genetically<00:05:36.460> predisposed

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
you know it's genetically predisposed

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.250 
you know it's genetically predisposed
and<00:05:37.760> that<00:05:38.030> can't<00:05:38.240> be<00:05:38.330> influenced

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
and that can't be influenced

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.530 
and that can't be influenced
but<00:05:40.950> certainly<00:05:41.580> it's<00:05:42.000> all<00:05:42.090> environmental

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
but certainly it's all environmental

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.140 
but certainly it's all environmental
factors<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.620> notice<00:05:43.890> it's<00:05:44.550> proven<00:05:44.910> without<00:05:44.970> a

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
factors you notice it's proven without a

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.470 
factors you notice it's proven without a
doubt<00:05:46.070> so<00:05:47.070> unless<00:05:47.340> you<00:05:47.580> correct<00:05:47.910> that<00:05:48.060> it's

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
doubt so unless you correct that it's

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.450 
doubt so unless you correct that it's
you're<00:05:49.170> never<00:05:49.350> going<00:05:49.530> to<00:05:49.560> win<00:05:49.680> I<00:05:49.980> was<00:05:50.310> the

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
almost a week of pain so I I didn't want

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.870 
almost a week of pain so I I didn't want

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
okay well since 1996 i've been i've been

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.030 
okay well since 1996 i've been i've been
taking<00:06:33.240> classes<00:06:33.540> for<00:06:34.170> a<00:06:34.200> non<00:06:34.470> extraction

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
taking classes for a non extraction

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.060 
taking classes for a non extraction
orthodontics<00:06:35.640> and<00:06:35.850> and<00:06:36.330> we<00:06:36.870> were<00:06:36.990> what<00:06:37.560> I<00:06:37.590> what

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
orthodontics and and we were what I what

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.640 
orthodontics and and we were what I what
my<00:06:38.220> experience<00:06:39.060> has<00:06:39.600> been<00:06:39.660> was<00:06:39.990> we<00:06:40.200> we

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
my experience has been was we we

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.320 
my experience has been was we we
developed<00:06:41.130> the<00:06:41.280> arches<00:06:41.730> laterally<00:06:42.240> and

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
developed the arches laterally and

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.660 
developed the arches laterally and
sometimes<00:06:42.810> and<00:06:43.080> sometimes<00:06:43.830> we<00:06:44.220> make<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.490> jaws

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
sometimes and sometimes we make the jaws

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.140 
sometimes and sometimes we make the jaws
wider<00:06:45.150> and<00:06:45.480> longer<00:06:46.380> so<00:06:47.190> that<00:06:47.370> gives<00:06:47.790> more

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
wider and longer so that gives more

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.940 
wider and longer so that gives more
tongue<00:06:48.360> space<00:06:48.660> but<00:06:48.900> I<00:06:48.930> didn't<00:06:49.230> know<00:06:49.320> if<00:06:49.890> that

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
tongue space but I didn't know if that

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.460 
tongue space but I didn't know if that
was<00:06:50.250> that<00:06:50.820> was<00:06:50.910> what<00:06:51.120> I<00:06:51.150> was<00:06:51.300> doing<00:06:51.690> but<00:06:51.720> I<00:06:52.080> just

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
was that was what I was doing but I just

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.900 
was that was what I was doing but I just
found<00:06:52.620> better<00:06:53.010> things<00:06:53.310> that<00:06:53.490> happened<00:06:53.820> to

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
found better things that happened to

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.900 
found better things that happened to
patients<00:06:54.390> they<00:06:54.810> had<00:06:55.230> better<00:06:55.470> bites<00:06:55.770> they<00:06:56.190> they

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
patients they had better bites they they

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.860 
patients they had better bites they they
look<00:06:57.090> better<00:06:57.270> but<00:06:57.990> so<00:06:59.240> then<00:07:00.240> when<00:07:00.360> I<00:07:00.390> met<00:07:00.630> bill

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
look better but so then when I met bill

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.710 
look better but so then when I met bill
and<00:07:01.140> we<00:07:01.530> found<00:07:01.740> another<00:07:01.920> component<00:07:02.550> it<00:07:03.000> was<00:07:03.330> it

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
and we found another component it was it

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.210 
and we found another component it was it
was<00:07:03.900> the<00:07:04.080> patients<00:07:04.500> that<00:07:04.530> had<00:07:04.740> poor<00:07:05.040> oral

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
was the patients that had poor oral

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.110 
was the patients that had poor oral
posture<00:07:05.490> that<00:07:06.650> that<00:07:07.650> that<00:07:08.520> I<00:07:08.580> never<00:07:08.850> diagnosed

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
posture that that that I never diagnosed

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.690 
posture that that that I never diagnosed
and<00:07:09.690> then<00:07:09.810> I<00:07:10.020> found<00:07:10.500> that<00:07:10.710> even<00:07:11.280> though<00:07:11.520> they

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
and then I found that even though they

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.070 
and then I found that even though they
had<00:07:11.820> straight<00:07:12.120> teeth<00:07:12.360> there<00:07:12.570> was<00:07:12.690> something

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
had straight teeth there was something

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.900 
had straight teeth there was something
missing<00:07:13.440> when<00:07:13.770> they<00:07:13.890> grew<00:07:14.100> up<00:07:14.250> or<00:07:14.490> when<00:07:14.760> they

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910 
missing when they grew up or when they

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.850 
missing when they grew up or when they
went<00:07:15.330> through<00:07:15.510> a<00:07:15.540> growth<00:07:15.870> spurt<00:07:15.900> because<00:07:16.770> I

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
went through a growth spurt because I

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.710 
went through a growth spurt because I
see<00:07:17.070> a<00:07:17.100> lot<00:07:17.280> of<00:07:17.340> kids<00:07:17.970> when<00:07:18.120> they're<00:07:18.270> seven<00:07:18.600> or

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 
see a lot of kids when they're seven or

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.200 
see a lot of kids when they're seven or
eight<00:07:18.840> and<00:07:19.080> I<00:07:19.140> do<00:07:19.200> my<00:07:19.530> my<00:07:20.460> Corrections<00:07:20.910> early

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:24.450 
you have a general practice you can see

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.510 
you have a general practice you can see
them<00:07:24.630> every<00:07:24.900> six<00:07:25.080> months<00:07:25.440> and<00:07:25.620> you<00:07:26.100> see<00:07:26.310> some

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
them every six months and you see some

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.310 
them every six months and you see some
changes<00:07:27.060> in<00:07:27.120> the<00:07:27.360> face<00:07:27.540> and<00:07:27.750> here's<00:07:27.930> wondering

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.320 
changes in the face and here's wondering

they have straight teeth but why do they

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.830 
they have straight teeth but why do they
look<00:07:30.060> so<00:07:31.310> less<00:07:32.310> attractive<00:07:32.880> than<00:07:32.910> when<00:07:33.180> they

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 
look so less attractive than when they

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.430 
look so less attractive than when they
were<00:07:33.870> when<00:07:34.260> you<00:07:34.350> cheated<00:07:34.620> them<00:07:34.800> in<00:07:34.950> phase<00:07:35.160> one
