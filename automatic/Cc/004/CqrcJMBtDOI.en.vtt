00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 how are you all guys who are like 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.580
 be and be all welcome 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.350
 Again today is already Friday 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.090
 we are at the end of the first 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.160
 week or problem for me the first 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.780
 school week and that makes me feel 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.089
 well I say I do not know was a week a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.630
 bit complicated after being there 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.850
 yes 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.640
 go three weeks almost a month without classes 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.289
 be completely free without having 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.330
 absolutely nothing to do more than 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.400
 you can enjoy those vacations 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.580
 for nothing because I feel a little 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.790
 again walking me to what it is then 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.770
 in the school routine and homework go to the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.480
 school and all that, so really 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.940
 it's pretty good I say good and I 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.309
 I'm almost almost glad to finish the first 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.170
 week and then nothing will start to try 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.329
 grab again the rhythm we had 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.640
 inside the channel then getting used to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.930
 what is the school schedule not me 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.430
 I think for most 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 I say for the majority because I know there 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.789
 people who enter up as within 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 three months to school so good at 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.090
 most inside equally this week not 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.129
 so I really hope they 've gone 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.719
 very very well and they have enjoyed it 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.059
 at least its first days I say I know 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.940
 that is not the most the school operates but 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.310
 well, at least 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.660
 alright so guys I give what what 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.250
 I have for you after this 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.440
 small brief introduction that I had 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.790
 I want to tell you, I want to talk to you 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.560
 about the weekly challenges that 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.620
 we have already for what is the month of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.660
 January and is that guys again has 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.400
 published as usual every month a 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.900
 image through the facebook page of 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.670
 plants against zombies gardens warfare 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.190
 in which they have divided this month of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.440
 January in four weeks which then 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.240
 you could say that there are four you can 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.240
 events by calling it in a certain way 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 although the first two are not so 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.740
 community challenge and the penultimate ones 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.300
 yes what it is that they are so I'm going to 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.160
 comment a little here in the background 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.890
 we have the image starting with what 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.720
 it's week number one and it's that if it was 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.210
 how the year started the plants against 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.610
 zombies tells us only about 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.440
 of the little envelope that they gave us in 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.260
 commemoration of what was the end of the year or 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.660
 the first of January as it is then 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.160
 nothing else remind us there that do not forget 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.510
 that is not good that you will not forget 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.000
 claim what was your prize in the 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.040
 store stickers, basically in 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 honor to this not that year has ended 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.880
 so that was the only little thing 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.710
 interesting that we had during the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.320
 first week 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.810
 but already for the second week 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.820
 I just think it's this we have what 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.380
 which is the subject of the envelopes these 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.240
 we can buy at the store 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.250
 stickers for those people who 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.410
 as I missed a few 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.970
 envelopes of what was then all the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.070
 Christmas season of the month of December 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.080
 they will remember that there were envelopes 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.110
 free but you had to connect to 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.730
 live every day in those weeks then 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.680
 good was when he suffered the subject of 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.110
 hack from xbox live at least I 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.060
 I lost a minimum of five or six 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.200
 even a little more about cited well 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.420
 that for those people that like me 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.980
 we have not completed the collection of 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.140
 Christmas accessories we can acquire 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.330
 this kind of envelopes for a quantity of 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.510
 30 thousand coins only for time 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.400

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.660

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.510
 they want to continue buying the accessories 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.950
 they will be able to do it until 20 money and 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.080
 good guys already happening with what is the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.150
 week number 3 now it is a challenge 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.460
 a community challenge how is it that 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.200
 we know and now it's going to be done 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.660
 that are the little engineers in this 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.790
 occasion we are going to have to make use of 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.530
 the unique pump pumps these 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.200
 how sound are you 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.600
 the enemies go for example here not 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.080
 tells us that the first challenge is going to 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.230
 be thus stun 7 million 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.540
 players goes out well with whatever it is 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.880
 the bomb is that you throw and that 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.590
 moment it explodes stuns or also 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.239
 through the mines that you place at 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.040
 along the map and when someone happens 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.600
 near them equal stunned reuters 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.910
 with any of these two methods 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.260
 works are going to accumulate and the first 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.440
 challenge as it was that I had already said 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.100
 are 7 million after enemies of 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.620
 players 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.040
 equally affected by this ability 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.820
 and the second challenge is 14 million 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.940
 get the first prize will be an envelope 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.519
 ultra rare and for the second challenge are 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.069
 two ultra rare envelopes guys so 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.200
 because basically it is what there is 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.480
 pretty simple I think the challenge 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.100
 I mean what you have to do is 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.530
 respect the amount, it is a 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.600
 quite decent amount but it is 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.280
 simple or is only a matter 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.829
 to reappear find an enemy and 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.950
 throw the sonic bomb and it's all and there 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.490
 plus one so you can throw 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.780
 infinitely 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.580
 the number of times you want to 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.020
 so I think it is 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.210
 quite considering what is this 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.949
 challenge for week number 3 already for 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.530
 the week number four guys challenge 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.910
 based on what the carnivore is in this 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.800
 occasion will be based on what is the 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.560
 pringue guys in the pringue of the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.090

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.300
 that we have to pring some 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.419
