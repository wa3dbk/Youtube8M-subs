hi<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.260> Ron<00:00:01.530> at<00:00:01.680> camera<00:00:02.010> town<00:00:02.190> calm<00:00:02.669> and

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hi this is Ron at camera town calm and

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.269 
hi this is Ron at camera town calm and
in<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.110> video<00:00:04.259> right<00:00:04.589> now<00:00:04.620> we're<00:00:04.859> testing

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
in this video right now we're testing

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.920 
in this video right now we're testing
the<00:00:05.400> brand<00:00:05.879> new<00:00:06.029> firmware<00:00:06.450> update<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
the brand new firmware update for the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.410 
the brand new firmware update for the
canon<00:00:07.319> 5d<00:00:07.560> mark<00:00:07.830> two<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.059> firmware

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
canon 5d mark two this is firmware

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.990 
canon 5d mark two this is firmware
update<00:00:09.690> version<00:00:09.870> 2.0<00:00:10.830> point<00:00:11.070> three<00:00:11.340> which

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
update version 2.0 point three which

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.360 
update version 2.0 point three which
adds<00:00:12.320> manual<00:00:13.320> control<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> audio<00:00:14.099> with

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
adds manual control of the audio with

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.829 
adds manual control of the audio with
audio<00:00:14.670> levels<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> back<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.660> camera

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
audio levels on the back of the camera

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.740 
audio levels on the back of the camera
right<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:16.949> I'm<00:00:17.130> testing<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.910> audio<00:00:18.270> using<00:00:18.510> my

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
right now I'm testing the audio using my

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.859 
right now I'm testing the audio using my
voice<00:00:19.320> microphone<00:00:20.029> using<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.180> GC<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
voice microphone using a GC of the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.779 
voice microphone using a GC of the
automatic<00:00:22.350> gain<00:00:22.560> control<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.220> 5d<00:00:23.580> mark

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
automatic gain control of the 5d mark

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.570 
automatic gain control of the 5d mark
two<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> automatic<00:00:25.380> gain<00:00:25.529> control

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
two so the automatic gain control

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.589 
two so the automatic gain control
typically<00:00:26.580> adds<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.939> little<00:00:27.029> bit<00:00:27.150> more<00:00:27.330> hiss

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
typically adds a little bit more hiss

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.540 
typically adds a little bit more hiss
because<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> tends<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> bump<00:00:29.160> up<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> audio

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
because it tends to bump up the audio

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.040 
because it tends to bump up the audio
during<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> quiet<00:00:30.300> passengers<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
during the quiet passengers and it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.359 
during the quiet passengers and it
brings<00:00:31.230> down<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.439> audio<00:00:31.830> during<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> loud

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
brings down the audio during the loud

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
brings down the audio during the loud
passages<00:00:32.630> passages<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> be

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
passages passages what I'm going to be

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.350 
passages passages what I'm going to be
doing<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.070> switching<00:00:35.460> now<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.610> manual<00:00:36.180> mode

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
doing is switching now to manual mode

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
doing is switching now to manual mode
trying<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.290> keep<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> levels<00:00:37.890> right<00:00:38.040> around

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
trying to keep the levels right around

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.880 
trying to keep the levels right around
negative<00:00:38.430> 12<00:00:38.820> DB<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.960> give<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.350> some<00:00:40.530> idea<00:00:40.800> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
negative 12 DB to give you some idea of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.080 
negative 12 DB to give you some idea of
what<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> quality<00:00:41.370> difference<00:00:41.550> will<00:00:41.820> be<00:00:41.910> when

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
what the quality difference will be when

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.240 
what the quality difference will be when
you<00:00:42.210> actually<00:00:42.570> use<00:00:42.930> manual<00:00:43.200> audio<00:00:43.680> versus<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
you actually use manual audio versus the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.119 
you actually use manual audio versus the
automatic<00:00:44.670> gain<00:00:44.820> control<00:00:45.860> ok<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.100> now

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
automatic gain control ok right now

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.819 
automatic gain control ok right now
switch<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> manual<00:00:48.719> audio<00:00:49.110> recording<00:00:49.680> so

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
switch now to manual audio recording so

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.439 
switch now to manual audio recording so
I'm<00:00:49.920> actually<00:00:50.039> recording<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.670> negative<00:00:50.850> 12<00:00:51.210> DB

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
I'm actually recording at negative 12 DB

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
I'm actually recording at negative 12 DB
on<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.079> audio<00:00:52.320> meters<00:00:52.739> i'm<00:00:53.399> using<00:00:53.760> say

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
on the audio meters i'm using say

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.729 
on the audio meters i'm using say
microphone<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.750> everything's<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> same<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
microphone so everything's the same and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
microphone so everything's the same and
again<00:00:56.399> we're<00:00:56.579> testing<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> canon<00:00:57.300> 5d<00:00:57.510> mark

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
again we're testing the canon 5d mark

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.650 
again we're testing the canon 5d mark
two<00:00:58.100> firmware<00:00:59.100> update<00:00:59.399> version<00:00:59.579> 2.0<00:01:00.390> point

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
two firmware update version 2.0 point

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.160 
two firmware update version 2.0 point
three<00:01:01.050> i<00:01:01.609> think<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.699> sounds<00:01:02.969> better<00:01:03.170> actually

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
three i think it sounds better actually

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.030 
three i think it sounds better actually
I've<00:01:04.229> been<00:01:04.260> listened<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> yet<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:04.920> i'm

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
I've been listened to it yet but i'm

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.090 
I've been listened to it yet but i'm
pretty<00:01:05.250> sure<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> sound<00:01:05.880> better

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
pretty sure it's going to sound better

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.160 
pretty sure it's going to sound better
ok<00:01:08.100> right<00:01:08.340> now<00:01:08.369> i<00:01:08.580> am<00:01:09.030> testing<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.540> built-in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
ok right now i am testing the built-in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.230 
ok right now i am testing the built-in
microphone<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.040> 5d<00:01:11.520> mark<00:01:11.760> two<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
microphone on the 5d mark two this is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200 
microphone on the 5d mark two this is
the<00:01:12.390> internal<00:01:12.780> model<00:01:13.549> microphone<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.119> i'm

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the internal model microphone and i'm

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.969 
the internal model microphone and i'm
using<00:01:15.509> manual<00:01:15.750> control<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:16.500> rather<00:01:16.799> than

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
using manual control now rather than

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.190 
using manual control now rather than
automatic<00:01:17.520> gain<00:01:17.700> control<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.360> i'm<00:01:18.869> still<00:01:19.110> at

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
automatic gain control and i'm still at

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.499 
automatic gain control and i'm still at
the<00:01:19.290> negative<00:01:19.619> 12<00:01:19.860> DB<00:01:20.040> i'm<00:01:20.790> using<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> 15

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the negative 12 DB i'm using a 15

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
the negative 12 DB i'm using a 15
millimeter<00:01:21.780> f-18<00:01:22.409> lens<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:23.310> set<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:24.060> at

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
millimeter f-18 lens I'm set I think at

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
millimeter f-18 lens I'm set I think at
about<00:01:24.390> f2<00:01:24.810> 8<00:01:24.960> i'd<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.350> double<00:01:25.619> check<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
about f2 8 i'd have to double check it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.800 
about f2 8 i'd have to double check it
but<00:01:26.369> there's<00:01:26.549> no<00:01:26.640> image<00:01:26.909> stabilization<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
but there's no image stabilization and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.870 
but there's no image stabilization and
autofocus<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.530> off<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.460> should<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.670> no

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
autofocus is off so this should be no

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.060 
autofocus is off so this should be no
noise<00:01:30.150> coming<00:01:30.540> from<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> camera<00:01:31.049> itself<00:01:31.140> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
noise coming from the camera itself so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.530 
noise coming from the camera itself so
this<00:01:32.369> would<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> decent<00:01:32.850> test<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.390> see

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
this would be a decent test to see

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.410 
this would be a decent test to see
whether<00:01:33.890> automatic<00:01:34.890> gain<00:01:35.040> control<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.700> menu

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
whether automatic gain control and menu

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.030 
whether automatic gain control and menu
control<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:37.049> differ<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.740> built-in

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
control really differ for the built-in

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.830 
control really differ for the built-in
microphone<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.970> now<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> second<00:01:39.630> i'm<00:01:39.720> going

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
microphone so now in a second i'm going

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.600 
microphone so now in a second i'm going
to<00:01:39.930> switch<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.170> automatic<00:01:41.100> gain<00:01:41.579> control

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
to switch to automatic gain control

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.630 
to switch to automatic gain control
using<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> built-in<00:01:42.689> microphone<00:01:43.579> okay<00:01:44.579> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
using the built-in microphone okay so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.950 
using the built-in microphone okay so
right<00:01:44.970> now<00:01:45.000> i'm<00:01:45.210> using<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.600> built-in

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
right now i'm using the built-in

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.510 
right now i'm using the built-in
microphone<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.619> i'm<00:01:46.740> using<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.100> automatic

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
microphone that i'm using the automatic

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.240 
microphone that i'm using the automatic
gain<00:01:47.880> control<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> 5d<00:01:49.049> mark<00:01:49.259> two<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:50.100> is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
gain control on the 5d mark two this is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.429 
gain control on the 5d mark two this is
using<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> new<00:01:50.790> firmware<00:01:51.060> version<00:01:51.630> 2.0<00:01:52.259> point

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
using the new firmware version 2.0 point

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
using the new firmware version 2.0 point
three<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> idea<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> test

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
three and the idea here is the test

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.870 
three and the idea here is the test
which<00:01:54.840> sounds<00:01:55.170> better<00:01:55.350> i'm<00:01:55.649> assuming<00:01:56.340> manual

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
which sounds better i'm assuming manual

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.160 
which sounds better i'm assuming manual
audio<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.420> always<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> sound<00:01:57.990> better

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
audio is always going to sound better

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.959 
audio is always going to sound better
than<00:01:58.290> automatic<00:01:58.829> gain<00:01:58.979> control<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.850> this

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
than automatic gain control but this

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
than automatic gain control but this
will<00:02:00.180> again<00:02:00.420> give<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> an<00:02:00.990> indication<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
will again give you an indication of the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.219 
will again give you an indication of the
differences<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.280> quality<00:02:02.869> even<00:02:03.869> using<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
differences in quality even using the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.530 
differences in quality even using the
built-in<00:02:04.500> microphone<00:02:04.950> between<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> DC<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
built-in microphone between a DC or the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.960 
built-in microphone between a DC or the
manual<00:02:06.840> mode<00:02:07.020> which<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.740> listened<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.129> so

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
manual mode which we just listened to so

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.609 
manual mode which we just listened to so
this<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.479> automatic<00:02:09.660> gain<00:02:10.140> control<00:02:10.170> on

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
this is the automatic gain control on

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:19.950 
this is the automatic gain control on
the<00:02:10.770> 5d<00:02:11.099> mark<00:02:11.340> two

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960
