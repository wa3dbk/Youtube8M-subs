00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
stats are absolutely unbelievable I was

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:51.949 
stats are absolutely unbelievable I was
looking<00:03:50.820> at<00:03:50.850> them<00:03:51.030> during<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.390> squad<00:03:51.720> builder

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
looking at them during a squad builder

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.720 
looking at them during a squad builder
last<00:03:52.140> week<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.530> they<00:03:52.650> are<00:03:52.769> absolutely<00:03:52.920> insane

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
last week and they are absolutely insane

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.420 
last week and they are absolutely insane
and<00:03:54.540> for<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.840> squad<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.110> played<00:03:55.380> him<00:03:55.500> in<00:03:55.620> which

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
and for the squad I played him in which

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.270 
and for the squad I played him in which
was<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.850> believe<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.180> was<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.330> perfect<00:03:58.280> squad

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
was I believe it was the perfect squad

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.860 
was I believe it was the perfect squad
for<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.489> hundred<00:03:59.790> thousand<00:04:00.239> coins<00:04:00.330> he<00:04:00.660> was<00:04:00.780> an

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
for a hundred thousand coins he was an

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.470 
for a hundred thousand coins he was an
absolute<00:04:01.290> god<00:04:01.620> which<00:04:02.430> can<00:04:02.580> be<00:04:02.700> told<00:04:02.970> by<00:04:03.150> his<00:04:03.209> in

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
absolute god which can be told by his in

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.370 
absolute god which can be told by his in
game<00:04:03.750> stats<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.620> I<00:04:04.650> believe<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:05.730> a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
game stats so I believe this is a

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.009 
game stats so I believe this is a
hundred<00:04:07.380> K<00:04:07.620> pack<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:09.180> we<00:04:09.239> do<00:04:09.329> have<00:04:09.390> two<00:04:09.750> more

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
hundred K pack so we do have two more

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.560 
hundred K pack so we do have two more
and<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.590> get<00:04:10.860> kakkar<00:04:11.220> which<00:04:11.760> goes<00:04:12.150> for<00:04:12.420> at

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
and we get kakkar which goes for at

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.210 
and we get kakkar which goes for at
legals<00:04:12.989> for<00:04:13.140> absolutely<00:04:13.560> nothing<00:04:13.799> which<00:04:14.100> is

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
legals for absolutely nothing which is

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.729 
legals for absolutely nothing which is
surprising<00:04:14.790> because<00:04:14.940> he<00:04:15.600> isn't<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:16.440> lowest

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
surprising because he isn't the lowest

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.650 
surprising because he isn't the lowest
rate<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.100> players<00:04:17.340> he<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.579> 84<00:04:18.060> 18<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.510> mean

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
rate of the players he is 84 18 I mean

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.909 
rate of the players he is 84 18 I mean
it<00:04:18.720> doesn't<00:04:18.930> have<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.140> pacing<00:04:19.590> but<00:04:19.830> he's

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
it doesn't have that pacing but he's

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.560 
it doesn't have that pacing but he's
still<00:04:20.099> a<00:04:20.160> solid<00:04:20.430> player<00:04:20.760> for<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.120> Brazilian

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
still a solid player for a Brazilian

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.320 
still a solid player for a Brazilian
squad<00:04:21.770> even<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.950> BBVA<00:04:23.490> squad<00:04:23.849> he's<00:04:24.000> not<00:04:24.150> too

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
squad even for a BBVA squad he's not too

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.160 
squad even for a BBVA squad he's not too
bad

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
bad

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.970 
bad
and<00:04:25.470> we<00:04:25.560> do<00:04:25.740> get<00:04:26.040> Kim<00:04:26.760> Chang<00:04:27.380> Qing<00:04:28.380> Kim<00:04:28.770> Chang

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
and we do get Kim Chang Qing Kim Chang

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.280 
and we do get Kim Chang Qing Kim Chang
soo<00:04:29.280> he<00:04:29.460> does<00:04:29.640> have<00:04:29.850> 85<00:04:30.450> pace<00:04:30.780> which<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.260> a

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
soo he does have 85 pace which for a

we've<00:04:59.730> got<00:04:59.760> one<00:05:00.060> more<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.450> think<00:05:00.840> we<00:05:01.170> do<00:05:01.290> have

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
we've got one more I think we do have

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.120 
we've got one more I think we do have
one<00:05:01.620> more<00:05:01.700> that<00:05:02.700> will<00:05:02.820> complete<00:05:02.970> to<00:05:03.390> the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
one more that will complete to the

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.500 
one more that will complete to the
125,000<00:05:05.130> coins<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.670> we<00:05:05.730> probably<00:05:06.090> have<00:05:06.330> made

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
125,000 coins and we probably have made

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.370 
125,000 coins and we probably have made
around<00:05:06.750> 20k<00:05:07.470> pack<00:05:07.770> unless<00:05:08.760> EA<00:05:09.060> can<00:05:09.600> we<00:05:09.780> can

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
around 20k pack unless EA can we can

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.140 
around 20k pack unless EA can we can
save<00:05:10.740> me<00:05:11.010> here<00:05:11.190> unless<00:05:11.340> they<00:05:11.550> can<00:05:11.730> dig<00:05:11.940> me<00:05:12.120> out

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150
