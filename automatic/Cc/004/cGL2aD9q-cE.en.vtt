00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
I'm going to try to show you how to tie

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.829 
I'm going to try to show you how to tie
a<00:00:03.870> really<00:00:04.350> good<00:00:04.560> doubled<00:00:05.460> lying<00:00:05.700> five<00:00:06.240> turn

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
a really good doubled lying five turn

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.730 
a really good doubled lying five turn
you<00:00:07.080> know<00:00:07.230> not<00:00:08.240> I've<00:00:09.240> doubled<00:00:09.660> my<00:00:09.780> line<00:00:10.050> for

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
you know not I've doubled my line for

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.980 
you know not I've doubled my line for
about<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.040> foot<00:00:11.639> don't<00:00:12.120> cheat<00:00:12.540> yourself<00:00:12.630> on

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
about a foot don't cheat yourself on

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.299 
about a foot don't cheat yourself on
this<00:00:13.110> at<00:00:13.290> first<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.679> easier<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.070> tell<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
this at first it's easier to tell you

this at first it's easier to tell you
with<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> longer<00:00:14.759> line<00:00:15.420> I'm<00:00:15.780> gonna<00:00:16.260> pass<00:00:16.529> that

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
with a longer line I'm gonna pass that

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.700 
with a longer line I'm gonna pass that
doubled<00:00:17.100> line<00:00:17.279> through<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> swivel<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.710> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
doubled line through a swivel and a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.220 
doubled line through a swivel and a
pinch<00:00:20.010> up<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.300> I'm<00:00:21.689> gonna<00:00:21.840> pull<00:00:22.109> it

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
pinch up here and I'm gonna pull it

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.810 
pinch up here and I'm gonna pull it
through<00:00:22.470> until<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:23.250> I'm<00:00:23.430> gonna<00:00:23.550> say

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
through until I have all I'm gonna say

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.330 
through until I have all I'm gonna say
about<00:00:24.000> three<00:00:24.600> or<00:00:24.720> four<00:00:24.990> inches<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.769> tag<00:00:26.130> on

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
about three or four inches of the tag on

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.609 
about three or four inches of the tag on
left<00:00:27.170> then<00:00:28.250> I'm<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.019> form<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.140> loop<00:00:31.320> like

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
left then I'm going to form a loop like

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.090 
left then I'm going to form a loop like
that<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.630> I'm<00:00:33.630> gonna<00:00:33.719> take<00:00:33.989> my<00:00:34.170> time<00:00:34.469> I'm

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that and I'm gonna take my time I'm

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.549 
that and I'm gonna take my time I'm
gonna<00:00:35.309> make<00:00:35.399> sure<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.079> lines<00:00:37.290> are

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
gonna make sure that all the lines are

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.229 
gonna make sure that all the lines are
of<00:00:37.649> equal<00:00:37.770> tension<00:00:38.309> by<00:00:38.430> tugging<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.879> loop<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
of equal tension by tugging the loop a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.850 
of equal tension by tugging the loop a
little<00:00:39.360> bit<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.930> pulling<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.649> bit

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
little bit and pulling this a little bit

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.920 
little bit and pulling this a little bit
and<00:00:41.040> pulling<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.760> bit<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.210> wanna

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and pulling this a little bit I wanna

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.389 
and pulling this a little bit I wanna
make<00:00:43.050> sure<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.200> tag<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.890> about<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.250> right

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
make sure my tag in is about the right

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.060 
make sure my tag in is about the right
length<00:00:44.989> about<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> right<00:00:46.320> length<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
length about the right length here and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.680 
length about the right length here and
I'm<00:00:47.520> gonna<00:00:47.610> make<00:00:47.789> sure<00:00:47.940> there's<00:00:48.120> enough<00:00:48.180> free

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
I'm gonna make sure there's enough free

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.240 
I'm gonna make sure there's enough free
line<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.590> capture<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
line here so I can capture it with the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.819 
line here so I can capture it with the
back<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.610> my<00:00:50.789> hand<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.899> control<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.739> not

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
back of my hand to control that and not

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
back of my hand to control that and not
get<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> way<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:54.300> I'm<00:00:54.449> gonna<00:00:54.570> make<00:00:54.780> my

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
get it in the way now I'm gonna make my

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
get it in the way now I'm gonna make my
five<00:00:55.320> turns<00:00:56.510> there's<00:00:57.510> one

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.360 

or<00:01:18.960> five<00:01:19.990> sorry<00:01:20.500> that's<00:01:20.620> a<00:01:20.710> little<00:01:20.950> clumsy<00:01:21.130> but

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
or five sorry that's a little clumsy but

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.390 
or five sorry that's a little clumsy but
a<00:01:21.700> little<00:01:22.060> bit<00:01:22.150> of<00:01:22.270> stage<00:01:22.450> fright<00:01:22.690> I<00:01:22.750> guess

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
a little bit of stage fright I guess

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.030 
a little bit of stage fright I guess
okay<00:01:24.400> now<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.730> have<00:01:24.880> my<00:01:25.180> turns<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:26.230> here's<00:01:26.920> the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
okay now I have my turns and here's the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.880 
okay now I have my turns and here's the
tricky<00:01:27.370> part<00:01:27.400> as<00:01:28.150> I<00:01:28.360> look<00:01:28.570> at<00:01:28.690> my<00:01:28.720> loop<00:01:29.140> the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
tricky part as I look at my loop the

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.650 
tricky part as I look at my loop the
wraps<00:01:30.100> around<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.550> loop<00:01:30.760> I<00:01:30.970> can<00:01:31.390> see<00:01:31.540> that

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
wraps around the loop I can see that

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.090 
wraps around the loop I can see that
they're<00:01:31.840> closer<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.380> tighter<00:01:32.530> here<00:01:32.920> than

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
they're closer and tighter here than

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.530 
they're closer and tighter here than
they<00:01:33.190> are<00:01:33.220> back<00:01:33.520> there<00:01:33.730> that'll<00:01:34.090> cause<00:01:34.270> this

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
they are back there that'll cause this

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.130 
they are back there that'll cause this
not<00:01:35.230> to<00:01:35.500> not<00:01:35.740> wrap<00:01:36.040> around<00:01:36.400> itself<00:01:36.790> well<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
not to not wrap around itself well so

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.840 
not to not wrap around itself well so
I'm<00:01:38.260> gonna<00:01:38.440> take<00:01:38.680> a<00:01:38.710> second<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.220> tease<00:01:39.460> things

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
I'm gonna take a second to tease things

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.060 
I'm gonna take a second to tease things
down<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.180> little<00:01:40.420> bit<00:01:40.600> here<00:01:40.900> just<00:01:41.080> even<00:01:41.770> up<00:01:41.890> all

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
down a little bit here just even up all

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.620 
down a little bit here just even up all
those<00:01:42.250> wraps<00:01:42.550> nice<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:44.760> okay<00:01:45.760> now<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.510> make

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
those wraps nice and okay now and make

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.300 
those wraps nice and okay now and make
sure<00:01:46.780> there's<00:01:46.960> equal<00:01:47.260> tension<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:47.800> all<00:01:48.040> the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
sure there's equal tension on all the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.030 
sure there's equal tension on all the
lines<00:01:49.120> so<00:01:49.870> I'm<00:01:50.110> gonna<00:01:50.230> kind<00:01:50.440> of<00:01:50.530> grab<00:01:50.770> things

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
lines so I'm gonna kind of grab things

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.470 
lines so I'm gonna kind of grab things
and<00:01:51.160> kind<00:01:51.400> of<00:01:51.460> tug<00:01:51.670> here<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.910> little<00:01:52.090> bit

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
and kind of tug here a little bit

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.320 
and kind of tug here a little bit
I<00:01:52.510> want<00:01:53.170> this<00:01:53.320> loop<00:01:53.620> to<00:01:53.860> be<00:01:54.310> nice<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:54.820> even<00:01:55.060> and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
I want this loop to be nice and even and

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.420 
I want this loop to be nice and even and
kind<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.660> oblong<00:01:56.170> like<00:01:56.410> this<00:01:56.620> I<00:01:56.770> don't<00:01:56.830> want<00:01:57.310> it

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
kind of oblong like this I don't want it

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.890 
kind of oblong like this I don't want it

one end would be fatter than the other
end<00:02:05.160> nice<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.400> even<00:02:06.760> I'm<00:02:07.240> gonna<00:02:07.390> give<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.570> a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
end nice and even I'm gonna give it a

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.720 
end nice and even I'm gonna give it a
little<00:02:07.900> bit<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.200> twist<00:02:08.560> like<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.190> it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
little bit of a twist like this it

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.100 
little bit of a twist like this it
doesn't<00:02:10.000> really<00:02:10.119> stay<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.600> way<00:02:10.750> but<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:11.020> just

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
doesn't really stay that way but it just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.510 
doesn't really stay that way but it just
kind<00:02:11.320> of<00:02:11.380> helps<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.710> not<00:02:11.890> get<00:02:12.070> started<00:02:12.340> a

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
kind of helps the not get started a

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.610 
kind of helps the not get started a
little<00:02:12.670> bit<00:02:12.880> now<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.720> line<00:02:13.990> needs<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.410> slide

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
little bit now the line needs to slide

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.800 
little bit now the line needs to slide
through<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.130> swivel<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:15.670> don't<00:02:15.910> grab<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.240> at

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
through the swivel so don't grab it at

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.300 
through the swivel so don't grab it at
the<00:02:17.050> swivel<00:02:17.410> let<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.650> pass<00:02:17.800> through<00:02:18.130> there

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the swivel let it pass through there

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.910 
the swivel let it pass through there
grab<00:02:18.970> all<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.510> lines<00:02:19.870> on<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:21.400> other<00:02:21.430> end

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
grab all the lines on the other end

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.340 
grab all the lines on the other end
firmly<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.790> now<00:02:25.300> I'm<00:02:25.450> gonna<00:02:25.570> start<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.140> pull

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
firmly and now I'm gonna start to pull

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.710 
firmly and now I'm gonna start to pull
and<00:02:26.650> you'll<00:02:27.160> see<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.580> twist<00:02:28.060> start<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.570> happen

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
and you'll see the twist start to happen

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.780 
and you'll see the twist start to happen
here's<00:02:29.590> where<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.860> need<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.190> now<00:02:30.400> progress

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
here's where you need to now progress

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.920 
here's where you need to now progress
quickly<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.540> swiftly<00:02:33.239> there<00:02:34.239> we<00:02:34.390> go<00:02:34.540> if<00:02:34.780> you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
quickly and swiftly there we go if you

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.780 
quickly and swiftly there we go if you
do<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.200> slowly<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.830> wraps<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:36.160> don't<00:02:36.580> do<00:02:36.760> a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
do it slowly the wraps just don't do a

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.940 
do it slowly the wraps just don't do a
good<00:02:37.030> job<00:02:37.090> now<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.080> can<00:02:38.350> see<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.739> wraps

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
good job now I can see that the wraps

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.240 
good job now I can see that the wraps
really<00:02:39.489> did<00:02:39.700> quite<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.620> nice<00:02:41.620> job<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:41.920> going

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
really did quite a nice job of going

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.310 
really did quite a nice job of going
around<00:02:42.580> themselves<00:02:42.730> but<00:02:43.660> if<00:02:43.810> they<00:02:43.959> don't<00:02:44.170> look

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
around themselves but if they don't look

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.060 
around themselves but if they don't look
quite<00:02:44.380> perfect<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.190> can<00:02:45.430> split<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:47.200> this

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
quite perfect you can split this this

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.490 
quite perfect you can split this this
and<00:02:48.340> here<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.850> kind<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.600> give<00:02:49.720> tug<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.140> one<00:02:50.320> way

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
and here and kind of give tug it one way

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.630 
and here and kind of give tug it one way
and<00:02:50.530> then<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.920> other<00:02:50.950> way<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.520> will

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
and then the other way and this will

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.270 
and then the other way and this will
help<00:02:51.900> uniform<00:02:52.900> make<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.560> all<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.830> lot<00:02:54.040> all

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
help uniform make the all the lot all

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.210 
help uniform make the all the lot all
the<00:02:54.570> twists<00:02:55.570> around<00:02:55.660> uniform<00:02:56.320> don't<00:02:57.010> pull<00:02:57.190> too

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
the twists around uniform don't pull too

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.620 
the twists around uniform don't pull too
hard<00:02:57.400> though<00:02:57.790> otherwise<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.300> knot<00:02:58.420> will<00:02:58.540> be

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
hard though otherwise the knot will be

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.750 
hard though otherwise the knot will be
too<00:02:58.780> tight<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.170> draw<00:02:59.380> down<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.620> line<00:02:59.950> now<00:03:00.640> I'm

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
too tight to draw down the line now I'm

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.400 
too tight to draw down the line now I'm
going<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:00.970> grab<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.269> tag<00:03:01.510> in<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.959> standing

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
going to grab the tag in in the standing

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.360 
going to grab the tag in in the standing
line<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.860> I'm<00:03:03.670> going<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.560> pull<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:05.950> slide

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
line and I'm going to pull it and slide

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.960 
line and I'm going to pull it and slide
it<00:03:06.400> down<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.420> swivel<00:03:10.290> now<00:03:11.290> as<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.400> look<00:03:12.430> here

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
it down to the swivel now as I look here

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.750 
it down to the swivel now as I look here
just<00:03:13.510> before<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:14.050> hits<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.470> swivel<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:15.010> can<00:03:15.550> see

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
just before it hits the swivel I can see

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.330 
just before it hits the swivel I can see
there<00:03:16.000> might<00:03:16.390> be<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.600> twist<00:03:17.050> there<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.280> don't

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
there might be a twist there and I don't

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.910 
there might be a twist there and I don't
want<00:03:18.640> twists<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:19.959> incorporated<00:03:20.739> in<00:03:20.830> this

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
want twists to be incorporated in this

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.860 
want twists to be incorporated in this
knot<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:21.970> I'm<00:03:22.120> going<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.300> twist<00:03:22.540> them<00:03:22.690> out<00:03:22.840> a

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
knot so I'm going to twist them out a

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.030 
knot so I'm going to twist them out a
little<00:03:23.050> bit<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.350> straighten<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.709> out

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
little bit and straighten it out

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.520 
little bit and straighten it out
there<00:03:24.400> we<00:03:24.459> go<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.810> now<00:03:26.109> I'm<00:03:26.290> going<00:03:26.440> to

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
there we go and now I'm going to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.860 
there we go and now I'm going to
continue<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.040> pull<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.310> all<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.430> way<00:03:27.519> down

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
continue to pull it all the way down

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.720 
continue to pull it all the way down
to<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.769> swivel<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.590> once<00:03:33.190> again<00:03:33.340> I'm<00:03:33.640> going

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
to the swivel and once again I'm going

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.940 
to the swivel and once again I'm going
to<00:03:33.790> equalize<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:35.080> tension<00:03:35.470> on<00:03:35.590> these<00:03:35.709> two

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
to equalize the tension on these two

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.820 
to equalize the tension on these two
lines<00:03:36.129> and<00:03:36.959> maybe<00:03:37.959> give<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.290> just<00:03:38.440> one<00:03:38.680> more

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
lines and maybe give it just one more

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.960 
lines and maybe give it just one more
tug<00:03:39.599> and<00:03:40.599> I'm<00:03:41.110> gonna<00:03:41.549> cut<00:03:42.549> away<00:03:42.760> everything

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
tug and I'm gonna cut away everything

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:58.130 
tug and I'm gonna cut away everything
that<00:03:43.480> we<00:03:43.569> don't<00:03:43.750> need<00:03:52.260> okay<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:54.340> now<00:03:55.019> we<00:03:56.019> have

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
that we don't need okay and now we have

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.000 
that we don't need okay and now we have
the<00:03:59.140> perfect<00:04:00.569> doubled<00:04:01.569> line<00:04:01.810> five<00:04:02.290> turn<00:04:02.650> uni

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
the perfect doubled line five turn uni

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.000 
the perfect doubled line five turn uni
knot<00:04:03.160> this<00:04:03.849> will<00:04:03.910> test<00:04:04.239> out<00:04:04.450> almost<00:04:04.870> 100%<00:04:05.620> of

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
knot this will test out almost 100% of

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.309 
knot this will test out almost 100% of
the<00:04:06.160> labeled<00:04:06.489> braid<00:04:06.730> strength<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.510> found<00:04:08.170> that

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
the labeled braid strength I found that

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.650 
the labeled braid strength I found that
a<00:04:08.379> Palomar<00:04:08.859> knot<00:04:08.920> will<00:04:09.640> only<00:04:09.819> test<00:04:10.120> out<00:04:10.359> just

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
a Palomar knot will only test out just

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.650 
a Palomar knot will only test out just
slightly<00:04:10.780> over<00:04:11.049> 50%
