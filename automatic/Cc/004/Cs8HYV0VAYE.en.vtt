00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
300 grams of Primaloft one insulation

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.429 
300 grams of Primaloft one insulation
from<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.160> able<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.519> determine<00:00:27.439> about

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
from what I was able to determine about

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.400 
from what I was able to determine about
100<00:00:28.859> grams<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.340> Primaloft<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:30.179> would<00:00:30.810> equate

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
100 grams of Primaloft one would equate

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.430 
100 grams of Primaloft one would equate
to<00:00:31.470> about<00:00:32.210> 500<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.390> 600<00:00:34.399> fill<00:00:35.399> down<00:00:35.899> so<00:00:36.899> this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to about 500 to 600 fill down so this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.940 
to about 500 to 600 fill down so this
would<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:38.010> three<00:00:38.850> times<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
would be three times that so this is a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.410 
would be three times that so this is a
very<00:00:41.489> warm<00:00:41.820> jacket<00:00:43.309> ether<00:00:44.309> says<00:00:45.090> that

very warm jacket ether says that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.119 
very warm jacket ether says that
depending<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.079> layered<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.950> guess

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
depending on how you layered and I guess

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.790 
depending on how you layered and I guess
personal<00:00:47.520> preference<00:00:48.050> it's<00:00:49.050> good<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.620> about

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
personal preference it's good for about

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.279 
personal preference it's good for about
negative<00:00:50.670> 10<00:00:50.910> degrees<00:00:51.270> fahrenheit<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.050> about

negative 10 degrees fahrenheit to about

negative 10 degrees fahrenheit to about
20<00:00:52.620> degrees<00:00:52.920> Fahrenheit<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.260> it<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.770> very

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
warmer than that jacket and it seems

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.050 
warmer than that jacket and it seems
like<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.470> cut<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> jacket<00:02:38.030> has<00:02:39.030> been

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
like the cut of the jacket has been

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.610 
like the cut of the jacket has been
improved<00:02:40.130> compared<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.760> Aalto<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:43.319> allow

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
improved compared to the Aalto to allow

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.690 
improved compared to the Aalto to allow
greater<00:02:44.190> range<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.730> motion<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.400> still<00:02:47.670> a

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
greater range of motion it is still a

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.680 
greater range of motion it is still a
little<00:02:47.940> bit<00:02:48.060> restrictive<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.799> chest<00:02:50.370> area

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
little bit restrictive in the chest area

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.900 
little bit restrictive in the chest area
but<00:02:51.860> it's<00:02:52.860> not<00:02:53.040> mad<00:02:53.250> at<00:02:53.400> all

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.300 

so<00:02:56.910> I'm<00:02:57.660> gonna<00:02:57.810> keep<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.470> jacket<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.100> sure

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310

winter it is wind and water resistant

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.140 
winter it is wind and water resistant
but<00:03:10.500> not<00:03:10.620> waterproof<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.579> more<00:03:11.850> than<00:03:12.000> likely

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
so I just wanted to take a quick moment

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.970 
so I just wanted to take a quick moment
here<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:08.020> sort<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.260> explain<00:04:08.650> what<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:08.890> was

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
here to sort of explain what I was

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.570 
here to sort of explain what I was
talking<00:04:09.460> about<00:04:09.490> with<00:04:09.820> range<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.210> motion<00:04:10.270> on

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
talking about with range of motion on

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.490 
talking about with range of motion on
some<00:04:12.580> of<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.760> jackets<00:04:13.240> that<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:13.570> own<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:13.930> this

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
some of the jackets that I own so this

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.000 
some of the jackets that I own so this
top<00:04:14.950> one<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.340> architects<00:04:16.090> Adam<00:04:16.390> LT<00:04:17.010> you

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
top one is the architects Adam LT you

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.460 
top one is the architects Adam LT you
can<00:04:18.160> see<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.820> normal<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.870> normal<00:04:20.170> cut

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
can see the the normal the normal cut

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.520 
can see the the normal the normal cut
normal<00:04:21.100> bias<00:04:21.370> for<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:21.970> sleeve<00:04:22.270> is<00:04:22.540> much

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
normal bias for the sleeve is much

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.560 
normal bias for the sleeve is much
higher<00:04:23.800> than<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:24.220> is<00:04:24.250> for<00:04:24.610> any<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.180> jackets

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
higher than it is for any of the jackets

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.680 
higher than it is for any of the jackets
below<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.100> really<00:04:27.520> allows<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:28.180> great

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
below it so that really allows a great

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.310 
below it so that really allows a great
range<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.110> motion<00:04:32.040> next<00:04:33.040> one<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:34.720> ether

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
range of motion next one is the ether

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.670 
range of motion next one is the ether
boundary<00:04:36.190> jacket<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:37.170> sort<00:04:38.170> of<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.350> normal

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
boundary jacket and sort of the normal

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.340 
boundary jacket and sort of the normal
bias<00:04:38.920> of<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.310> sleeve<00:04:39.700> is<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.420> good<00:04:40.900> bit<00:04:41.080> lower

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
bias of the sleeve is a good bit lower

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.260 
bias of the sleeve is a good bit lower
and<00:04:41.790> it's<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:43.180> much<00:04:43.630> more<00:04:43.920> straight<00:04:45.150> sort<00:04:46.150> of

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
and it's a much more straight sort of

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:54.030 
and it's a much more straight sort of
cut<00:04:46.840> here<00:04:48.090> as<00:04:50.280> compared<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.580> Adam<00:04:51.940> LT<00:04:53.040> this

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
cut here as compared to the Adam LT this

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.980 
cut here as compared to the Adam LT this
one<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.940> ether<00:04:55.450> High<00:04:55.690> Line<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:57.990> it's

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
one is the ether High Line and it's

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.870 
one is the ether High Line and it's

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
compared to the ether Aalto so the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.680 
compared to the ether Aalto so the
normal<00:05:04.470> normal<00:05:05.470> bias<00:05:05.890> cut<00:05:06.610> of<00:05:06.880> this<00:05:07.120> sleeve<00:05:07.480> is

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
normal normal bias cut of this sleeve is

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.380 
normal normal bias cut of this sleeve is
more<00:05:10.690> straight<00:05:11.080> out<00:05:11.350> whereas<00:05:12.220> this<00:05:12.430> Alto<00:05:13.210> is

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
more straight out whereas this Alto is

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.390 
more straight out whereas this Alto is
almost<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:15.280> a<00:05:15.430> down<00:05:15.640> position<00:05:15.880> which<00:05:17.400> really

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
almost in a down position which really

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.750 
almost in a down position which really
restricts<00:05:18.970> range<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.360> motion
