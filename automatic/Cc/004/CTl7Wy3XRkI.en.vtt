00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:19.050 

you

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.790 

hi<00:00:20.060> Tom<00:00:20.360> shawl<00:00:20.630> here<00:00:20.870> we're<00:00:21.110> in<00:00:21.320> Allen

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
hi Tom shawl here we're in Allen

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.610 
hi Tom shawl here we're in Allen
Cooper's<00:00:22.130> basement<00:00:22.610> and<00:00:22.820> this<00:00:23.750> is<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.290> great

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
Cooper's basement and this is a great

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.040 
Cooper's basement and this is a great
example<00:00:25.190> of<00:00:25.340> a<00:00:25.460> duel<00:00:25.730> tank<00:00:26.060> system<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:26.750> what

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
example of a duel tank system so what

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.360 
example of a duel tank system so what
that<00:00:27.170> means<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.530> there's<00:00:27.710> two<00:00:27.890> tanks<00:00:28.220> you've

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
that means is there's two tanks you've

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:29.650 
that means is there's two tanks you've
got<00:00:28.520> your<00:00:28.670> solar<00:00:28.910> tank<00:00:29.270> here

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
got your solar tank here

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.770 
got your solar tank here
and<00:00:29.750> that<00:00:30.350> feeds<00:00:30.740> into<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.970> existing<00:00:32.510> tank

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
and that feeds into the existing tank

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.770 
and that feeds into the existing tank
you<00:00:33.470> can<00:00:33.620> see<00:00:33.860> that<00:00:34.100> this<00:00:34.730> existing<00:00:35.300> tank<00:00:35.570> has

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
you can see that this existing tank has

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.370 
you can see that this existing tank has
a<00:00:36.020> gas<00:00:36.350> back<00:00:36.739> up<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.630> this<00:00:38.630> solar<00:00:39.020> tank

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
a gas back up and this solar tank

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.080 
a gas back up and this solar tank
actually<00:00:39.920> has<00:00:40.309> an<00:00:40.430> electrical<00:00:40.850> heating

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
actually has an electrical heating

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.540 
actually has an electrical heating
component<00:00:41.660> but<00:00:42.140> this<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.500> not<00:00:42.650> tied<00:00:43.160> in<00:00:43.370> right

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
component but this is not tied in right

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.330 
component but this is not tied in right
now<00:00:43.700> this<00:00:43.910> is<00:00:44.090> not<00:00:44.120> active<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:45.800> tank<00:00:46.070> is

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
now this is not active so this tank is

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.210 
now this is not active so this tank is
acting<00:00:46.730> as<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:46.910> solar<00:00:47.330> tank<00:00:47.660> only<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.530> this

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
acting as a solar tank only and this

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.520 
acting as a solar tank only and this
tank<00:00:49.520> is<00:00:50.090> your<00:00:50.300> gas<00:00:50.480> backup<00:00:51.019> heater<00:00:51.199> so<00:00:51.410> you're

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
tank is your gas backup heater so you're

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.460 
tank is your gas backup heater so you're
never<00:00:51.680> going<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:51.890> be<00:00:52.010> without<00:00:52.280> hot<00:00:52.489> water<00:00:52.519> so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
never going to be without hot water so

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.920 
never going to be without hot water so
what<00:00:54.470> happens<00:00:54.830> is<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.699> have<00:00:55.750> your<00:00:56.750> water

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
what happens is you have your water

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.380 
what happens is you have your water
getting<00:00:57.230> heated<00:00:57.650> in<00:00:57.800> this<00:00:58.010> tank<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.550> when

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
getting heated in this tank and when

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.200 
getting heated in this tank and when
this<00:00:59.600> system<00:01:00.019> is<00:01:00.199> working<00:01:00.350> together<00:01:01.210> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
this system is working together the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.450 
this system is working together the
water<00:01:02.449> comes<00:01:02.839> out<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.530> hot<00:01:03.680> line<00:01:03.890> here<00:01:04.250> and

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
water comes out of the hot line here and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.520 
water comes out of the hot line here and
actually<00:01:04.640> feeds<00:01:05.120> into<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.630> cold<00:01:05.930> line<00:01:06.170> on

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
actually feeds into the cold line on

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.770 
actually feeds into the cold line on
this<00:01:07.010> tank<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.550> so<00:01:08.150> if<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.330> water<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:08.630> already

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
this tank and so if the water is already

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.690 
this tank and so if the water is already
up<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.110> temperature<00:01:09.560> then<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.220> gas<00:01:10.400> burner

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
up to temperature then the gas burner

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.060 
up to temperature then the gas burner
doesn't<00:01:11.120> turn<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:11.300> if<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.380> water<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.740> not<00:01:12.890> up

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
doesn't turn on if the water is not up

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.800 
doesn't turn on if the water is not up
to<00:01:13.159> temperature<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.790> whatever<00:01:14.540> that's

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
to temperature and whatever that's

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.410 
to temperature and whatever that's
thermostat<00:01:15.440> is<00:01:15.590> set<00:01:15.620> at<00:01:15.979> it'll<00:01:16.790> heat<00:01:17.270> the

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
thermostat is set at it'll heat the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.719 
thermostat is set at it'll heat the
water<00:01:17.600> up<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.870> that<00:01:18.140> amount<00:01:18.440> so<00:01:18.670> instead<00:01:19.670> of

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
water up to that amount so instead of

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.580 
water up to that amount so instead of
heating<00:01:20.090> your<00:01:20.180> ground<00:01:20.450> water<00:01:20.690> from<00:01:20.900> say<00:01:21.140> sixty

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
heating your ground water from say sixty

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.490 
heating your ground water from say sixty
degrees<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.340> 120<00:01:23.240> degrees<00:01:23.540> let's<00:01:24.110> say<00:01:24.229> it's<00:01:24.380> in

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
degrees to 120 degrees let's say it's in

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.109 
degrees to 120 degrees let's say it's in
the<00:01:24.590> winter<00:01:24.860> in<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.579> water<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:25.969> coming

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
the winter in this water is coming

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.209 
the winter in this water is coming
through<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.600> like<00:01:26.780> 90<00:01:27.110> degrees<00:01:27.439> you're<00:01:28.070> only

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
through it like 90 degrees you're only

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.120 
through it like 90 degrees you're only
heating<00:01:28.610> from<00:01:28.759> 90<00:01:29.180> to<00:01:29.210> 120<00:01:29.810> as<00:01:29.899> opposed<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.380> 60

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
heating from 90 to 120 as opposed to 60

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.310 
heating from 90 to 120 as opposed to 60
to<00:01:31.219> 120<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.880> even<00:01:32.780> if<00:01:32.899> you're<00:01:33.020> not<00:01:33.049> getting

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
to 120 so even if you're not getting

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.899 
to 120 so even if you're not getting
your<00:01:33.500> water<00:01:33.710> all<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.189> way<00:01:34.280> up<00:01:34.399> to<00:01:34.490> temperature

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
your water all the way up to temperature

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.730 
your water all the way up to temperature
with<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.180> solar<00:01:35.450> you're<00:01:36.110> still<00:01:36.380> getting<00:01:36.530> a

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
with the solar you're still getting a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.069 
with the solar you're still getting a
net<00:01:36.950> benefit<00:01:37.399> and<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.729> gas<00:01:37.939> you're<00:01:38.539> using<00:01:38.780> is

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
net benefit and the gas you're using is

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.539 
net benefit and the gas you're using is
less<00:01:39.969> Allen<00:01:40.969> has<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:42.500> see<00:01:42.710> these<00:01:42.950> ball

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
less Allen has you can see these ball

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.789 
less Allen has you can see these ball
valves<00:01:44.030> up<00:01:44.210> here<00:01:44.570> there's<00:01:44.810> quite<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.380> few<00:01:45.680> of

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
valves up here there's quite a few of

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.859 
valves up here there's quite a few of
them<00:01:45.950> throughout<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.670> system<00:01:47.030> what<00:01:47.689> this

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
them throughout the system what this

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.830 
them throughout the system what this
does<00:01:48.109> is<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.619> allows<00:01:48.920> Allen<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.840> isolate

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
does is it allows Allen to isolate

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.410 
does is it allows Allen to isolate
either<00:01:51.109> the<00:01:51.500> solar<00:01:51.770> tank<00:01:52.100> or<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.640> existing

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
either the solar tank or the existing

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.599 
either the solar tank or the existing
tank<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.840> conventional<00:01:54.320> take<00:01:54.560> or<00:01:55.130> use<00:01:55.369> two

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
tank the conventional take or use two

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.940 
tank the conventional take or use two
systems<00:01:56.030> together<00:01:56.210> he<00:01:57.140> told<00:01:57.320> us<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.530> just<00:01:57.859> a

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
systems together he told us that just a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.300 
systems together he told us that just a
few<00:01:58.100> days<00:01:58.159> ago<00:01:58.689> he<00:01:59.689> completely<00:02:00.259> bypassed<00:02:00.859> this

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
few days ago he completely bypassed this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.419 
few days ago he completely bypassed this
system<00:02:01.729> altogether<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.840> he<00:02:03.020> closed<00:02:03.380> off<00:02:03.619> some

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
system altogether so he closed off some

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:05.859 
system altogether so he closed off some
of<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.609> ball<00:02:04.789> valves<00:02:05.149> running<00:02:05.479> into<00:02:05.719> this

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
of the ball valves running into this

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.620 
of the ball valves running into this
tank<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.039> water<00:02:07.369> is<00:02:07.670> just<00:02:08.000> coming<00:02:08.210> out<00:02:08.420> of

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
tank so the water is just coming out of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.230 
tank so the water is just coming out of
the<00:02:08.720> solar<00:02:08.960> tank<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.500> up<00:02:09.830> into<00:02:10.220> his<00:02:10.369> house<00:02:10.550> so

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
the solar tank and up into his house so

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.330 
the solar tank and up into his house so
he's<00:02:11.450> just<00:02:11.750> on<00:02:11.960> solar<00:02:12.230> now<00:02:12.470> he<00:02:13.010> turned<00:02:13.220> the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
he's just on solar now he turned the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.730 
he's just on solar now he turned the
pilot<00:02:13.730> off<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.090> his<00:02:14.210> take<00:02:14.450> here<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.470> he's

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
pilot off of his take here and he's

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.080 
pilot off of his take here and he's
working<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:16.250> with<00:02:16.340> solar<00:02:16.640> energy

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
working just with solar energy

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.120 
working just with solar energy
now<00:02:17.990> just<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.290> talk<00:02:18.440> for<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.680> minute<00:02:18.770> about<00:02:18.980> how

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
now just to talk for a minute about how

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.540 
now just to talk for a minute about how
this<00:02:19.490> tank<00:02:19.790> works<00:02:20.060> you've<00:02:20.900> got<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.440> pipe<00:02:22.280> run

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
this tank works you've got a pipe run

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.800 
this tank works you've got a pipe run
coming<00:02:22.880> right<00:02:23.000> here<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.570> can<00:02:23.720> actually

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
coming right here and I can actually

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.920 
coming right here and I can actually
take<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.290> cover<00:02:24.530> off<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.250> control<00:02:25.640> box

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
take the cover off of this control box

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.440 
take the cover off of this control box
so<00:02:26.930> we<00:02:27.050> can<00:02:27.200> look<00:02:27.319> at<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.560> guts<00:02:27.769> of<00:02:27.950> it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
so we can look at the guts of it

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.100 
so we can look at the guts of it
beautiful<00:02:29.450> isn't<00:02:29.540> it

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
beautiful isn't it

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.310 
beautiful isn't it
we've<00:02:30.890> got<00:02:31.100> our<00:02:31.390> return<00:02:32.390> line<00:02:32.660> here<00:02:33.110> our

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
we've got our return line here our

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.310 
we've got our return line here our
supply<00:02:34.310> line<00:02:34.580> here<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.270> our<00:02:35.750> pressure<00:02:36.020> gage

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
supply line here and our pressure gage

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.680 
supply line here and our pressure gage
over<00:02:36.710> here<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.250> what's<00:02:37.490> happening<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.060> you

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
over here so what's happening is you

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.080 
over here so what's happening is you
have<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:39.050> propylene<00:02:39.530> glycol<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.640> pinkish

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
have a propylene glycol this pinkish

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.350 
have a propylene glycol this pinkish
fluid<00:02:41.540> right<00:02:41.690> here<00:02:42.400> circulating<00:02:43.400> up<00:02:43.580> by<00:02:44.300> this

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
fluid right here circulating up by this

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.260 
fluid right here circulating up by this
via<00:02:44.900> this<00:02:45.110> pump<00:02:45.470> up<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.820> panel<00:02:47.120> on<00:02:47.240> the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
via this pump up to the panel on the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.970 
via this pump up to the panel on the
roof<00:02:47.510> running<00:02:48.080> through<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.530> collector

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
roof running through the collector

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.860 
roof running through the collector
collecting<00:02:49.970> all<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.390> thermal<00:02:50.780> energy

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
collecting all of that thermal energy

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.980 
collecting all of that thermal energy
and<00:02:51.350> then<00:02:51.860> running<00:02:52.280> back<00:02:52.580> down<00:02:52.940> through<00:02:53.690> this

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
and then running back down through this

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.440 
and then running back down through this
line<00:02:54.290> into<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.460> heat<00:02:55.640> exchanger<00:02:55.670> that's<00:02:56.330> in

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
line into the heat exchanger that's in

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.780 
line into the heat exchanger that's in
the<00:02:56.540> tank<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:56.960> you<00:02:57.230> can<00:02:57.410> see<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:58.070> comes<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.580> at

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
the tank so you can see it comes in at

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.420 
the tank so you can see it comes in at
the<00:02:58.940> top<00:02:59.180> right<00:02:59.480> here<00:02:59.800> it's<00:03:00.800> at<00:03:01.100> about<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
the top right here it's at about the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.600 
the top right here it's at about the
middle<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.880> tank<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:03.350> has<00:03:03.860> coils<00:03:04.430> that

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
middle of the tank and it has coils that

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.520 
middle of the tank and it has coils that
are<00:03:04.730> wrapped<00:03:05.000> around<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.480> tank<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:06.380> are

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
are wrapped around the tank that are

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.960 
are wrapped around the tank that are
transferring<00:03:07.070> all<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.520> heat<00:03:07.760> that's

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
transferring all of that heat that's

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.210 
transferring all of that heat that's
gathered<00:03:08.330> in<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.510> panel<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.740> then<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:10.010> comes

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
gathered in the panel and then it comes

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.540 
gathered in the panel and then it comes
back<00:03:10.459> up<00:03:10.520> here<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.860> goes<00:03:12.860> back<00:03:13.070> up<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.340> the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
back up here and goes back up to the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.940 
back up here and goes back up to the
collector<00:03:13.970> so<00:03:14.300> this<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.440> a<00:03:15.470> pretty<00:03:15.680> standard

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
collector so this is a pretty standard

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.980 
collector so this is a pretty standard
configuration<00:03:16.820> for<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.209> closed-loop

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
configuration for a closed-loop

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.370 
configuration for a closed-loop
pressurized<00:03:18.740> glycol<00:03:19.480> system<00:03:20.480> if<00:03:21.020> you<00:03:21.200> had<00:03:21.350> a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
pressurized glycol system if you had a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.050 
pressurized glycol system if you had a
system<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:21.860> was<00:03:22.040> called<00:03:22.310> an<00:03:22.520> open-loop

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
system that was called an open-loop

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.600 
system that was called an open-loop
system<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:24.230> just<00:03:24.500> have<00:03:24.680> water<00:03:24.920> potable<00:03:25.550> water

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
system you just have water potable water

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.940 
system you just have water potable water
traveling<00:03:26.300> up<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.690> collector<00:03:27.110> collecting

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
traveling up to the collector collecting

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.980 
traveling up to the collector collecting
the<00:03:28.040> thermal<00:03:28.370> energy<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.910> running<00:03:29.570> back<00:03:29.750> into

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
the thermal energy and running back into

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.480 
the thermal energy and running back into
the<00:03:30.110> tank<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:30.709> that's<00:03:30.860> not<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.280> case<00:03:31.430> for

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
the tank but that's not the case for

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.970 
the tank but that's not the case for
this<00:03:31.850> system<00:03:32.300> one<00:03:33.200> other<00:03:33.350> thing<00:03:33.590> I'd<00:03:33.709> like<00:03:33.830> to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
this system one other thing I'd like to

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.790 
this system one other thing I'd like to
mention<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.489> this<00:03:35.209> guy<00:03:35.480> right<00:03:35.750> here<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:36.739> is

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
mention is this guy right here this is

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.800 
mention is this guy right here this is
what's<00:03:37.130> called<00:03:37.310> an<00:03:37.489> expansion<00:03:37.970> tank<00:03:38.390> now

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
what's called an expansion tank now

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.890 
what's called an expansion tank now
anything<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:39.980> gains<00:03:40.310> heat<00:03:40.730> gains<00:03:41.390> volume

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
anything that gains heat gains volume

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.250 
anything that gains heat gains volume
right<00:03:42.290> so<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.950> volume<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:44.630> gained<00:03:44.959> as

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
right so that volume that is gained as

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.580 
right so that volume that is gained as
this<00:03:46.070> propylene<00:03:46.580> glycol<00:03:46.970> gets<00:03:47.239> up<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.660> let's

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
this propylene glycol gets up to let's

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.400 
this propylene glycol gets up to let's
see<00:03:48.739> right<00:03:48.769> now<00:03:49.040> it's<00:03:49.310> at<00:03:49.519> about<00:03:50.390> 140<00:03:50.989> degrees

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
see right now it's at about 140 degrees

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.520 
see right now it's at about 140 degrees
it's<00:03:52.400> gaining<00:03:52.730> heat<00:03:53.120> it's<00:03:53.330> gaining<00:03:53.510> volume<00:03:53.989> it

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
it's gaining heat it's gaining volume it

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.170 
it's gaining heat it's gaining volume it
need<00:03:54.680> somewhere<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.040> go<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.580> fills<00:03:55.850> up<00:03:56.000> this

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
need somewhere to go so it fills up this

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.780 
need somewhere to go so it fills up this
expansion<00:03:56.780> tank<00:03:57.019> so<00:03:57.769> that<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.070> system<00:03:58.459> itself

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
expansion tank so that the system itself

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.540 
expansion tank so that the system itself
doesn't<00:03:59.330> gain<00:03:59.480> too<00:03:59.780> much<00:03:59.810> pressure<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:00.620> that's

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
doesn't gain too much pressure so that's

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.520 
doesn't gain too much pressure so that's
why<00:04:01.730> we<00:04:01.880> need<00:04:02.000> an<00:04:02.060> expansion<00:04:02.330> tank<00:04:02.780> for<00:04:03.350> this

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
why we need an expansion tank for this

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:11.840 
why we need an expansion tank for this
type<00:04:03.920> of<00:04:03.950> system

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850
