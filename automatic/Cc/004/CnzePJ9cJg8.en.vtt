like what you're good at what you've

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.530 
like what you're good at what you've
trained<00:03:49.810> with<00:03:50.100> etc<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.970> just<00:03:52.210> think<00:03:52.390> it's

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
trained with etc and I just think it's

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.810 
trained with etc and I just think it's
ridiculous<00:03:52.720> to<00:03:53.230> have<00:03:53.410> 12<00:03:54.070> playable

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
ridiculous to have 12 playable

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.700 
ridiculous to have 12 playable
characters<00:03:55.710> not<00:03:56.710> playable<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:58.560> that's<00:03:59.560> my

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
characters not playable and that's my

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.440 
characters not playable and that's my
take<00:03:59.950> on<00:04:00.130> it<00:04:00.190> hope<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:00.790> guys<00:04:00.910> enjoyed<00:04:01.180> today's
