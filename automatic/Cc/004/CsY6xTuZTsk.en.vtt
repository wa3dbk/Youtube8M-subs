00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
got it in pink and it says that it was

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.920 
got it in pink and it says that it was
made<00:06:43.289> by<00:06:43.320> dentists<00:06:43.919> so<00:06:44.460> it's<00:06:44.699> not<00:06:44.849> like<00:06:45.120> it's

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
made by dentists so it's not like it's
