welcome back in this video we'll be

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.780 
welcome back in this video we'll be
learning<00:00:03.149> how<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.510> draw<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.899> palm<00:00:04.350> tree<00:00:04.890> for<00:00:05.580> our

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
learning how to draw a palm tree for our

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.900 
learning how to draw a palm tree for our
Henri<00:00:06.330> Rousseau<00:00:06.810> picture<00:00:07.500> here's<00:00:08.429> that<00:00:08.610> palm

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
Henri Rousseau picture here's that palm

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.259 
Henri Rousseau picture here's that palm
tree<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.480> my<00:00:10.080> Henri<00:00:10.440> Rousseau<00:00:10.800> painting<00:00:11.580> and

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
tree in my Henri Rousseau painting and

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.209 
tree in my Henri Rousseau painting and
this<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.719> preparation<00:00:13.469> for<00:00:13.650> learning<00:00:13.860> how

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
this is the preparation for learning how

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.990 
this is the preparation for learning how
to<00:00:14.250> draw<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.560> here's<00:00:16.560> my<00:00:16.890> palm<00:00:17.520> tree<00:00:17.820> here

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
to draw that so here's my palm tree here

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.060 
to draw that so here's my palm tree here
on<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.270> side<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:19.529> gonna<00:00:19.650> do<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
on this side and what you're gonna do is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.700 
on this side and what you're gonna do is
you're<00:00:20.250> gonna<00:00:20.340> start<00:00:20.490> with<00:00:20.970> two<00:00:21.869> lines<00:00:22.350> that

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
you're gonna start with two lines that

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.710 
you're gonna start with two lines that
are<00:00:22.800> almost<00:00:22.949> parallel<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:24.359> they're<00:00:24.570> gonna

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
are almost parallel but they're gonna

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720 
are almost parallel but they're gonna
come<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.350> point<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.890> you're<00:00:25.980> gonna<00:00:26.099> curve<00:00:26.490> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
come to a point so you're gonna curve a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.070 
come to a point so you're gonna curve a
line<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.180> way<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.880> then<00:00:29.880> start<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> little

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
line this way and then start a little

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.799 
line this way and then start a little
bit<00:00:31.289> aways<00:00:31.560> from<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.340> curve<00:00:32.759> another<00:00:33.480> line

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
bit aways from it and curve another line

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.810 
bit aways from it and curve another line
straight<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.620> till<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.190> meets<00:00:36.170> like<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.820> okay

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
straight up till it meets like that okay

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.369 
straight up till it meets like that okay
and<00:00:38.940> that's<00:00:39.149> gonna<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.690> trunk<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.230> our

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
and that's gonna be the trunk for our

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.160 
and that's gonna be the trunk for our
tree<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:41.340> put<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> texture<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.870> trunk

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
tree to put the texture on the trunk

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.229 
tree to put the texture on the trunk
it's<00:00:43.680> super<00:00:44.160> easy<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.610> once<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.879> know<00:00:45.030> it's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it's super easy and once you know it's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.110 
it's super easy and once you know it's
pretty<00:00:45.570> fun<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.770> take<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> diagonal<00:00:47.820> line

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
pretty fun to do I take a diagonal line

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
pretty fun to do I take a diagonal line
from<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.510> side<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> other<00:00:49.410> like

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
from one side and go to the other like

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.490 
from one side and go to the other like
that<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> then<00:00:50.969> diagonal<00:00:51.660> line<00:00:51.870> from<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that and then diagonal line from the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.160 
that and then diagonal line from the
middle<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.399> diagonal<00:00:53.850> line<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
middle of that diagonal line out to the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.049 
middle of that diagonal line out to the
other<00:00:55.320> side<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.670> kind<00:00:56.969> of

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
other side and then you just kind of

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.380 
other side and then you just kind of
keep<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> pattern<00:00:59.090> going<00:01:00.090> from

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
keep going with that pattern going from

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.540 
keep going with that pattern going from
the<00:01:00.539> middle<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> other<00:01:01.800> side<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the middle out to the other side and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.299 
the middle out to the other side and
this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.449> gonna<00:01:03.809> give<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
this is gonna give you the kind of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.710 
this is gonna give you the kind of
braided<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.420> texture<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.340> palm<00:01:08.970> tree<00:01:09.000> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
braided like texture for a palm tree you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
braided like texture for a palm tree you
can<00:01:09.840> also<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.460> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
can also use this you know as you as you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.050 
can also use this you know as you as you
move<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.659> drawing<00:01:13.110> life<00:01:13.670> use<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.880> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
move on in your drawing life use this to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.020 
move on in your drawing life use this to
make<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.689> pattern<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.590> hair<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.030> braided

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
make the pattern for hair that's braided

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.340 
make the pattern for hair that's braided
on<00:01:18.210> somebody's<00:01:18.720> head<00:01:19.820> or<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.630> weaving

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
on somebody's head or like a weaving

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.510 
on somebody's head or like a weaving
pattern<00:01:23.130> on<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.000> basket<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:26.040> that's<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.340> really

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
pattern on a basket so that's a really

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.410 
pattern on a basket so that's a really
cool<00:01:26.759> pattern<00:01:27.000> once<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.630> learn<00:01:28.380> how<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:29.130> it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
cool pattern once you learn how to do it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.080 
cool pattern once you learn how to do it
then<00:01:30.420> notice<00:01:31.320> my<00:01:31.500> palm<00:01:31.770> tree<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
then notice my palm tree here now the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
then notice my palm tree here now the
palm<00:01:33.270> tree<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.570> looked<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.020> class<00:01:34.229> had<00:01:34.470> many

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
palm tree we looked at in class had many

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.969 
palm tree we looked at in class had many
more<00:01:35.509> branches<00:01:36.509> than<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:36.990> five<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
more branches than this but five is a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.539 
more branches than this but five is a
good<00:01:38.130> number<00:01:38.659> an<00:01:39.659> odd<00:01:39.960> number<00:01:40.560> artists<00:01:41.280> like

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
good number an odd number artists like

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
good number an odd number artists like
odd<00:01:41.820> numbers<00:01:42.360> because<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:42.899> kind<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
odd numbers because it just kind of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.359 
odd numbers because it just kind of
fills<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.770> paper

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
fills the paper

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.060 
fills the paper
nicely<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.689> I'm<00:01:45.780> gonna<00:01:45.899> make<00:01:46.110> five<00:01:46.439> branches

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
nicely so I'm gonna make five branches

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.160 
nicely so I'm gonna make five branches
coming<00:01:47.790> off<00:01:48.000> from<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.570> point<00:01:48.899> here<00:01:49.110> I'm

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
coming off from this one point here I'm

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.980 
coming off from this one point here I'm
gonna<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.710> curved<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.880> way<00:01:51.119> another

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
gonna do one curved this way another

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.580 
gonna do one curved this way another
curved<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.220> way<00:01:53.630> one<00:01:54.630> curved<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
curved back this way one curved kind of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.789 
curved back this way one curved kind of
up<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.100> way<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:57.270> down<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.469> one

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
up that way one down here and then one

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.929 
up that way one down here and then one
kind<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.729> up<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> middle

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
kind of up and in the middle

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.480 
kind of up and in the middle
okay<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.000> draw<00:02:03.360> those<00:02:03.570> five<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.340> our

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
okay so draw those five and then for our

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.690 
okay so draw those five and then for our
little<00:02:05.909> like<00:02:06.180> palm<00:02:06.509> fronds<00:02:07.099> you<00:02:08.099> gotta<00:02:08.310> make

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
little like palm fronds you gotta make

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.820 
little like palm fronds you gotta make
curved<00:02:09.330> lines<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.709> is

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
curved lines and what I like to do is

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.470 
curved lines and what I like to do is
kind<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.099> think<00:02:11.250> of

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
kind of think of

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.530 
kind of think of
curved<00:02:11.750> triangles<00:02:12.530> going<00:02:12.709> out<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:14.239> coming

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
curved triangles going out and coming

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.589 
curved triangles going out and coming
back<00:02:14.659> to<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:16.400> main<00:02:16.580> thing<00:02:16.909> and<00:02:17.180> then<00:02:17.299> what<00:02:17.480> you

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
back to the main thing and then what you

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.780 
back to the main thing and then what you
want<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.810> do<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.080> kind<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.440> get<00:02:19.069> them<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.640> that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
want to do is kind of get them so that

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.000 
want to do is kind of get them so that
they're<00:02:19.970> curving<00:02:20.540> down<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.409> looks<00:02:21.830> like

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
they're curving down so it looks like

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.339 
they're curving down so it looks like
gravity<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.209> pulling<00:02:23.959> on<00:02:24.260> them<00:02:29.049> okay<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:30.170> you

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
gravity is pulling on them okay so you

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.259 
gravity is pulling on them okay so you
can<00:02:30.470> kind<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.739> see<00:02:31.450> how<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.480> do<00:02:32.629> that

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
can kind of see how I do that

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.050 
can kind of see how I do that
and<00:02:35.269> I'm<00:02:35.569> using<00:02:35.870> kind<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.349> curved<00:02:37.060> triangle

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
and I'm using kind of curved triangle

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:52.930 
and I'm using kind of curved triangle
line

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.720 

and<00:02:53.510> then<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:54.620> for<00:02:54.800> thinking<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.310> warmer

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
and then just for thinking of warmer

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.050 
and then just for thinking of warmer
weather<00:02:55.760> or<00:02:56.150> nicer<00:02:56.540> places<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:58.880> not

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
weather or nicer places this is not

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.460 
weather or nicer places this is not
going<00:02:59.270> to<00:02:59.330> be<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.510> our<00:02:59.630> picture<00:02:59.960> but<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.140> like<00:03:00.380> to

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
going to be in our picture but I like to

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.710 
going to be in our picture but I like to
put<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.650> little<00:03:00.770> horizon<00:03:01.490> line<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:02.000> with<00:03:02.690> a

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
put a little horizon line in with a

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.620 
put a little horizon line in with a
little<00:03:03.020> Setting<00:03:03.470> Sun<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:05.090> beach<00:03:05.270> that

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
little Setting Sun and the beach that

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.160 
little Setting Sun and the beach that
you're<00:03:05.780> gonna<00:03:05.900> sit<00:03:06.230> on<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:08.270> little<00:03:08.540> sunset

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
you're gonna sit on and a little sunset

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.300 
you're gonna sit on and a little sunset
kind<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:11.050> across<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.110> water<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.010> you've<00:03:13.130> got<00:03:13.280> a

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
kind of across the water so you've got a

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.860 
kind of across the water so you've got a
little<00:03:13.550> palm<00:03:13.730> tree<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.240> course<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.690> last

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
little palm tree and of course the last

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.800 
little palm tree and of course the last
thing<00:03:15.610> since<00:03:16.610> we're<00:03:16.790> in<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:16.910> tropical<00:03:17.480> island

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
thing since we're in a tropical island

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.010 
thing since we're in a tropical island
it's<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.610> coconut<00:03:20.050> tree<00:03:21.820> not<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.850> date<00:03:23.180> palm<00:03:23.480> but

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
it's a coconut tree not a date palm but

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.310 
it's a coconut tree not a date palm but
a<00:03:24.080> coconut<00:03:24.560> palm<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:25.790> like<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.210> just<00:03:26.390> put

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
a coconut palm and I like to just put

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.780 
a coconut palm and I like to just put
three<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.620> them<00:03:27.830> because<00:03:28.070> again<00:03:28.310> it's<00:03:28.490> an<00:03:28.580> odd

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
three of them because again it's an odd

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.330 
three of them because again it's an odd
number<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.480> kind<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.810> like<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.770> odd<00:03:30.920> number

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
number and I kind of like the odd number

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.030 
number and I kind of like the odd number
look<00:03:31.490> so<00:03:31.670> there's<00:03:31.910> our<00:03:32.180> palm<00:03:32.810> tree<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.530> how<00:03:33.980> to

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
look so there's our palm tree and how to

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.610 
look so there's our palm tree and how to
draw<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.580> palm<00:03:35.120> tree<00:03:35.690> for<00:03:36.020> our<00:03:36.110> Henri

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
draw the palm tree for our Henri

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.000 
draw the palm tree for our Henri
Rousseau<00:03:37.130> picture
