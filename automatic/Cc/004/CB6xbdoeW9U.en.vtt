hi and welcome back to three sighs

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.620 
hi and welcome back to three sighs
lessons<00:00:06.629> Cole<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.410> K<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.760> video<00:00:09.120> we're

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
lessons Cole you K in this video we're

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.470 
lessons Cole you K in this video we're
going<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.870> look<00:00:09.960> at<00:00:10.110> how<00:00:10.260> we<00:00:10.320> recycle<00:00:11.040> metals

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
going to look at how we recycle metals

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.150 
going to look at how we recycle metals
you<00:00:12.480> should<00:00:12.750> be<00:00:12.900> able<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.110> explain<00:00:13.530> why

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
you should be able to explain why

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.790 
you should be able to explain why
titanium<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.150> aluminium<00:00:15.360> are<00:00:16.230> both<00:00:16.440> very

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
titanium and aluminium are both very

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.730 
titanium and aluminium are both very
expensive<00:00:17.640> metals<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.410> should<00:00:19.410> be<00:00:19.560> able

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
expensive metals and you should be able

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.859 
expensive metals and you should be able
to<00:00:19.800> describe<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> benefits<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:21.090> recycling

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
to describe the benefits of recycling

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.500 
to describe the benefits of recycling
metals<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.590> examiner's<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.760> love<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> second

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
metals and examiner's do love the second

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.779 
metals and examiner's do love the second
point<00:00:24.949> okay<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:25.980> let's<00:00:26.279> take<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> look<00:00:26.670> at

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
point okay so let's take a look at

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.240 
point okay so let's take a look at
titanium<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:28.230> titanium<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.949> really

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
titanium or titanium is a really

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.669 
titanium or titanium is a really
important<00:00:29.730> metal<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.359> that's<00:00:30.990> because<00:00:31.410> it's

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
important metal and that's because it's

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.069 
important metal and that's because it's
very<00:00:31.980> very<00:00:32.250> strong<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.390> does<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.840> corrode

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
very very strong and it does not corrode

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.340 
very very strong and it does not corrode
and<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.130> word<00:00:35.280> corrode<00:00:35.640> means<00:00:35.910> react<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:37.200> we

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and the word corrode means react so we

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350 
and the word corrode means react so we
can<00:00:37.500> use<00:00:37.710> titanium<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.610> make<00:00:38.760> medical

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
can use titanium to make medical

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.950 
can use titanium to make medical
implants<00:00:40.079> such<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.920> hip<00:00:41.129> implant<00:00:41.809> now<00:00:42.809> in

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
implants such as this hip implant now in

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200 
implants such as this hip implant now in
this<00:00:43.140> case<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.649> important<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
this case it's really important that the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
this case it's really important that the
implant<00:00:45.750> does<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.200> start<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.649> react<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
implant does not start to react with the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700 
implant does not start to react with the
body<00:00:47.360> otherwise<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.660> would<00:00:48.780> corrode<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.559> have

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
body otherwise it would corrode and have

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.790 
body otherwise it would corrode and have
to<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.950> removed<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.020> titanium<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> perfect

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
to be removed so titanium is a perfect

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.760 
to be removed so titanium is a perfect
metal<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:54.480> why<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.809> titanium<00:00:55.440> so

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
metal for this so why is titanium so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
metal for this so why is titanium so
expensive<00:00:56.399> well<00:00:57.390> first<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:57.899> when<00:00:58.109> we

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
expensive well first of all when we

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.529 
expensive well first of all when we
extract<00:00:58.590> titanium<00:00:59.309> from<00:00:59.489> its<00:00:59.670> ore<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
extract titanium from its ore this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.930 
extract titanium from its ore this
involves<00:01:00.930> many<00:01:01.199> stages<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.039> each<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> these

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
involves many stages and each of these

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.870 
involves many stages and each of these
stages<00:01:03.180> costs<00:01:03.660> money<00:01:04.729> secondly<00:01:05.729> when<00:01:05.850> we

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
stages costs money secondly when we

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.420 
stages costs money secondly when we
extract<00:01:06.390> titanium<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.979> use<00:01:08.130> other

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
extract titanium we have to use other

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.020 
extract titanium we have to use other
very<00:01:09.090> expensive<00:01:09.810> metals<00:01:10.200> such<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.470> magnesium

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
very expensive metals such as magnesium

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.359 
very expensive metals such as magnesium
so<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.270> these<00:01:12.420> two<00:01:12.720> reasons<00:01:13.040> titanium<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> an

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
so for these two reasons titanium is an

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.090 
so for these two reasons titanium is an
expensive<00:01:14.850> metal<00:01:15.500> okay<00:01:16.500> let's<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> look

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
expensive metal okay let's take a look

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.980 
expensive metal okay let's take a look
now<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.640> very<00:01:17.880> important<00:01:18.479> metal<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
now at a very important metal which is

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.219 
now at a very important metal which is
aluminium<00:01:19.640> now<00:01:20.640> aluminium<00:01:21.450> has<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> very<00:01:22.020> low

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
aluminium now aluminium has a very low

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.740 
aluminium now aluminium has a very low
density<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.820> means<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.540> if

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
density and what that means is that if

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.810 
density and what that means is that if
you<00:01:24.840> took<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> big<00:01:25.380> block<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.680> aluminium<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
you took a big block of aluminium it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.270 
you took a big block of aluminium it
wouldn't<00:01:27.180> weigh<00:01:27.299> very<00:01:27.330> much<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:28.950> ideal

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
wouldn't weigh very much so it's ideal

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.149 
wouldn't weigh very much so it's ideal
for<00:01:30.030> making<00:01:30.150> aircraft<00:01:30.630> frames<00:01:31.409> since<00:01:32.009> it's

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
for making aircraft frames since it's

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.580 
for making aircraft frames since it's
very<00:01:32.280> light<00:01:32.810> now<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.079> try<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.350> make

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
very light now if we try to make

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
very light now if we try to make
aircrafts<00:01:35.159> out<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.640> dense<00:01:35.939> metal<00:01:36.360> such<00:01:36.509> as

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
aircrafts out of a dense metal such as

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
aircrafts out of a dense metal such as
iron<00:01:37.110> they<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.710> too<00:01:38.070> heavy<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.700> off<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
iron they be too heavy to get off the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.690 
iron they be too heavy to get off the
ground<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:40.860> makes<00:01:41.070> aluminium<00:01:41.579> so

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
ground so what makes aluminium so

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.179 
ground so what makes aluminium so
expensive<00:01:42.060> well<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.350> critical<00:01:43.619> fact

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
expensive well the really critical fact

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.429 
expensive well the really critical fact
is<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.820> extract<00:01:45.240> aluminium<00:01:45.990> using

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
is that we extract aluminium using

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.249 
is that we extract aluminium using
electrolysis<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.780> electrolysis<00:01:48.780> uses<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
electrolysis and electrolysis uses a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.499 
electrolysis and electrolysis uses a
great<00:01:49.680> deal<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> electricity<00:01:50.430> which<00:01:51.119> makes<00:01:51.390> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
great deal of electricity which makes it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.469 
great deal of electricity which makes it
extremely<00:01:51.899> expensive<00:01:53.149> okay<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.450> should

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
extremely expensive okay so we should

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.200 
extremely expensive okay so we should
recycle<00:01:55.049> metals<00:01:55.649> where<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.759> there

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
recycle metals where we can and there

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.179 
recycle metals where we can and there
are<00:01:57.240> three<00:01:57.540> good<00:01:57.750> reasons<00:01:57.780> why<00:01:58.200> which<00:01:58.979> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
are three good reasons why which you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.850 
are three good reasons why which you
need<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.430> learn<00:01:59.899> first<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.079> all<00:02:01.200> metal<00:02:01.619> ores

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
need to learn first of all metal ores

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.010 
need to learn first of all metal ores
are<00:02:02.040> running<00:02:02.340> out<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:03.240> can't<00:02:03.509> make<00:02:03.719> new

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
are running out and we can't make new

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.730 
are running out and we can't make new
metal<00:02:04.380> ores

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
metal ores

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.370 
metal ores
so<00:02:05.280> once<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.790> ores<00:02:05.969> run<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.570> they're<00:02:07.110> gone

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
so once the ores run out they're gone

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.780 
so once the ores run out they're gone
forever<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.640> should<00:02:08.849> recycle<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.599> metals

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
forever so we should recycle the metals

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.680 
forever so we should recycle the metals
secondly<00:02:11.790> mining<00:02:12.360> for<00:02:12.510> metals<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.080> really

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
secondly mining for metals is really

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.900 
secondly mining for metals is really
damaging<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.320> environment<00:02:14.520> for<00:02:15.520> example

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
damaging to the environment for example

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.820 
damaging to the environment for example
it<00:02:15.970> destroys<00:02:16.360> habitats<00:02:17.020> for<00:02:17.230> animals<00:02:17.710> and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
it destroys habitats for animals and

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.100 
it destroys habitats for animals and
plants<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:19.090> creates<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.510> great<00:02:19.840> deal<00:02:19.870> of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
plants and it creates a great deal of

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.830 
plants and it creates a great deal of
pollution<00:02:20.710> such<00:02:20.950> as<00:02:21.070> toxic<00:02:21.520> wastes<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
pollution such as toxic wastes and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.800 
pollution such as toxic wastes and
thirdly<00:02:23.260> when<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.070> extract<00:02:24.580> metals<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.630> use<00:02:25.780> a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
thirdly when we extract metals we use a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.290 
thirdly when we extract metals we use a
lot<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.080> energy<00:02:26.530> whereas<00:02:27.220> recycling<00:02:27.880> metals

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
lot of energy whereas recycling metals

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.530 
lot of energy whereas recycling metals
takes<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.960> lot<00:02:29.170> less<00:02:29.500> energy<00:02:30.480> okay<00:02:31.480> so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
takes a lot less energy okay so

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.330 
takes a lot less energy okay so
hopefully<00:02:31.900> now<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.320> can<00:02:32.560> describe<00:02:32.890> why

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
hopefully now you can describe why

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.700 
hopefully now you can describe why
titanium<00:02:34.210> and<00:02:34.390> aluminium<00:02:34.570> are<00:02:35.230> both<00:02:35.410> very

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
titanium and aluminium are both very

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.460 
titanium and aluminium are both very
expensive<00:02:36.340> metals<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.210> why<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:37.840> important

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
expensive metals and why it's important

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.120 
expensive metals and why it's important
that<00:02:38.650> we<00:02:39.040> recycle<00:02:39.730> metals
