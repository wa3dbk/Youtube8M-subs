00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:15.289
We began the day at Harris Stowe State University
which was fantastic because we’re at a historically

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.539
black college where the University is really
taking great pains to keep down the cost of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.640
tuition, to increase college completion rates
for their students and to really ensure they’re

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.949
going to be prepared for meaningful jobs and
these are all the things we are talking about

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.949
in our agenda.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.090
To see it in real life and to see people who
not only understand the importance of it but

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.910
who are executing it, is just very exciting.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.541
It’s inspiring because you see that we’ve
got to work harder to make sure there are

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:48.250
more Harris Stowe’s out there.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.280
We left St. Louis and then we went to Mt.
Vernon, Illinois.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.120
There, it was a community college that was
partnering with the business community.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.759
There, it was incredible to think about what
really happens when you bring together all

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:13.369
sectors of a community and how that’s linked
education to jobs and job growth.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.610
So there, you have Rend Lake Community College
which, in partnership with industry, in this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.030
case a major employer – Continental Tire
Company – but also other employers to develop

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.950
a set of programs so this notion of career
academies, this notion of taking career ladders,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.979
how move earlier and earlier, to not just
send high schools.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.969
We talked about in some cases how we start
introducing our young folks as early as middle

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:38.969
school.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.119
I think again, are very consistent with the
kinds of solutions we are trying to promote,

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.539
and I think are going to be key to ensuring
that all of our folks are college and career

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.539
ready.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.689
We then left and made the drive into Evansville,
Indiana.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.850
Here in Evansville, what you’ve got is a
school turnaround that is exactly the kind

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.579
of school turnaround you want to see.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.139
Not too many years ago, people in the community
would have said, “There’s no hope.

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:05.939
There’s no hope for Glenwood Academy.

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.590
You need to shut Glenwood down and take those
students and send them somewhere else.”

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.290
But this is a case where it took the School
Improvement Grant, with partnership with the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.709
teacher’s union and with the school district,
they put in place a series of significant

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.290
reforms.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.711
They partnered with NEA and local organizations
bringing in resources designating it as one

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:35.730
of their priority schools and said, “How
do we combine data and data-based instruction?

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.780
How do we combine meaningful professional
development?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.349
How do we really bring a culture of caring
about the students but combined with high

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.400
expectations for student learning?”

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.240
All too often, you go around the country and
people say can you really turn around these

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.829
schools and here you’ve got a community
where the proof is in the pudding.

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.090
We have to, in fact, turn them around and
as hard as it’s going to be, it’s something

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.040
we must do and it’s possible to now prove
it is possible and again, this is very satisfying.
