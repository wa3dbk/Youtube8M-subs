00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.910
 How is that not the case? 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.799
 complicated right classy it takes 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.799
 I'm going to start a 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.900
 and it's already there, the locke's ready to be 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:35.170
 recorded 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:39.370
 So, guys, there it is, I'm going to leave here. 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.750
 Speaking that quick on the game of 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.280
 Our version that I have is that we came back 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.280
 the proof is quetta 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:58.470
 It 's a version with three disks in it. 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:00.340
 iso lenk format with a notepad 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.510
 teaching you how step by step how to 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.620
 then installing the installation termination is 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.760
 only you open the game without star players at all 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.150
 It's already going to be working. 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.280
 right 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.970
 I already tested the game is working 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.280
 I do not really remember asking door 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.580
 Crap this folder for you 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.800
 so I tested with the ace did not give 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.970
 right then the only way is to use only 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.320
 the three disks 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:35.080
 I do not remember which version but that's it. 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.470
 three discs is a gothic version 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:43.169
 I also hope you enjoyed it. 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.169
 the business is simple there and until the next
