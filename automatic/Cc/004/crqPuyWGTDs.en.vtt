would research thoroughly find out
everything<00:00:30.490> about<00:00:30.760> it<00:00:31.120> we<00:00:31.540> would<00:00:31.690> speak<00:00:31.930> with

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
everything about it we would speak with

everything about it we would speak with
doctors<00:00:32.800> or<00:00:33.010> researchers<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.660> then<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:35.200> would

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
doctors or researchers and then it would

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.430 
doctors or researchers and then it would
really<00:00:35.560> be<00:00:35.950> working<00:00:36.730> together<00:00:37.080> come<00:00:38.080> up<00:00:38.110> with

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
really be working together come up with

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.360 
really be working together come up with
sketches<00:00:39.340> based<00:00:39.820> on<00:00:40.060> the<00:00:40.150> research<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:41.370> then

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
sketches based on the research and then

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.620 
sketches based on the research and then
I<00:00:42.940> would<00:00:43.570> create<00:00:43.900> these<00:00:44.170> visuals<00:00:44.680> for<00:00:44.920> them

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
I would create these visuals for them

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.150 
I would create these visuals for them
starting<00:00:46.630> by<00:00:46.780> hand<00:00:47.020> and<00:00:47.260> then<00:00:47.350> eventually<00:00:47.800> it

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
starting by hand and then eventually it

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.890 
starting by hand and then eventually it
does<00:00:48.309> go<00:00:48.640> on<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.880> computer<00:00:49.330> and<00:00:49.480> everything's

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
does go on the computer and everything's

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.130 
does go on the computer and everything's
digital<00:00:50.760> once<00:00:51.760> I<00:00:51.850> have<00:00:51.970> a<00:00:52.000> sketch<00:00:52.330> ready<00:00:52.660> that

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
digital once I have a sketch ready that

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.130 
digital once I have a sketch ready that
I<00:00:53.530> finalized<00:00:54.400> with<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.360> people<00:00:55.660> I'm<00:00:55.780> working

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
I finalized with the people I'm working

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.130 
I finalized with the people I'm working
for<00:00:56.320> or<00:00:56.559> working<00:00:56.890> with<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:58.180> gets<00:00:58.570> scanned<00:00:58.930> into

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
for or working with it gets scanned into

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.729 
for or working with it gets scanned into
the<00:00:59.290> computer<00:00:59.379> and<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:01.059> use<00:01:01.930> programs<00:01:02.559> such<00:01:02.710> as

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
the computer and I use programs such as

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.250 
the computer and I use programs such as
Adobe<00:01:03.250> Illustrator<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:04.059> Adobe<00:01:04.510> Photoshop

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.160 
Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop
and<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:06.430> it<00:01:07.090> takes<00:01:07.390> quite<00:01:07.660> a<00:01:07.720> bit<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:07.960> time

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
and it it takes quite a bit of time

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.340 
and it it takes quite a bit of time
first<00:01:08.680> I<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:09.190> create<00:01:09.700> many<00:01:10.450> many<00:01:10.900> layers<00:01:11.110> in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
first I I create many many layers in

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.180 
first I I create many many layers in
Illustrator<00:01:12.310> I<00:01:13.409> outline<00:01:14.409> every<00:01:14.710> everything

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
Illustrator I outline every everything

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.670 
Illustrator I outline every everything
there<00:01:15.370> and<00:01:15.400> also<00:01:15.790> add<00:01:15.970> color<00:01:16.480> and<00:01:16.750> then<00:01:17.380> in

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
there and also add color and then in

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.490 
there and also add color and then in
Adobe<00:01:18.040> Photoshop<00:01:18.630> that's<00:01:19.630> when<00:01:19.840> I<00:01:19.870> really

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
Adobe Photoshop that's when I really

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.469 
Adobe Photoshop that's when I really
would<00:01:20.950> add<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.280> finishing<00:01:21.400> details<00:01:22.030> in<00:01:22.300> it

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
would add the finishing details in it

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.030 
would add the finishing details in it
and<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.810> shading<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.470> make<00:01:23.830> it<00:01:23.950> look

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
and the shading and make it look

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
and the shading and make it look
three-dimensional

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
three-dimensional

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.560 
three-dimensional
I've<00:01:26.250> worked<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.640> surgeons<00:01:27.090> from<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.359> past

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I've worked with surgeons from the past

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.300 
I've worked with surgeons from the past
who<00:01:27.810> developed<00:01:28.229> new<00:01:28.469> surgical<00:01:28.799> techniques

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
who developed new surgical techniques

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.149 
who developed new surgical techniques
and<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:30.390> would<00:01:30.630> go<00:01:31.289> in<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.439> them<00:01:31.710> observe

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and I would go in with them observe

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.859 
and I would go in with them observe
these<00:01:32.640> sketches<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.329> then<00:01:33.420> create

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
these sketches and then create

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.919 
these sketches and then create
