00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.980
 hello everyone good day my name is Joe and that 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:12.650
 it's my second video that I'm doing 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.240
 to improve or measure my level of 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.400
 Spanish while I'm studying 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:24.470
 here in buenos aires argentina and the subject 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.660
 for today that I'm going to talk about is the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.180
 University of Belgrano and the program 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.610
 for international students 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.690
 good 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.230
 the program is like that the university puts 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.730
 international students like me 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.730
 with other international students 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:55.090
 and that good on the one hand is good because 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:58.420
 it's easy for the teacher does not have what 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.890
 I do not know all the students are 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.210
 learning by improving Spanish 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.290
 then it is easier to 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:13.620
 I do not know how to serve the students but 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.470
 for the other side on the other side I say 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.590
 it is not a good way for 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.940
 students who are already a few years old 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.210
 of experience with Spanish as I 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.570
 because for us we want to come 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.750
 here to practice and improve the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.000
 Castilian with Argentines or with natives 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.410
 at least 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.280
 that's why it's harder to know 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.950
 people from here and learn more from the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.940
 culture / I do not know between friends or between 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.710
 others 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.070
 but 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.150
 We can take courses with natives with 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.970
 local diego with the Argentines and I'm 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.330
 doing two subjects I'm taking I say 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.929
 two subjects with local photography 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.840
 typography and two subjects in the program 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.800
 for international students 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.800
 then then it is 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.600
 different from what I was going from what I thought 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.780
 it was going to be but it's good it's good 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.870
 and I like I like college 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.800
 like the city I like the location of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:37.180
 University 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.290
 everything is fine everything is good and that's just 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.110
 for today's topic 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.959
 and if you have an opinion or something 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.689
 who want to share please 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.170
 share it and that's it until later 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.170
 bye
