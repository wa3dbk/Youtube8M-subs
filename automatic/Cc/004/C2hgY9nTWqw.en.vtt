out<00:00:36.360> right<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.989> cannot<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.469> inserted<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
out right here it cannot be inserted the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.560 
out right here it cannot be inserted the
incorrect<00:00:38.640> way<00:00:38.730> which<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.030> kind<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> nice<00:00:39.420> they

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
incorrect way which is kind of nice they

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.700 
incorrect way which is kind of nice they
did<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> thing<00:00:40.110> where<00:00:40.230> they've<00:00:40.440> got<00:00:40.590> these

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
did this thing where they've got these

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.799 
did this thing where they've got these
little<00:00:40.770> tongue<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.730> groove<00:00:41.969> mechanism<00:00:42.600> here

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
little tongue and groove mechanism here

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.750 
little tongue and groove mechanism here
so<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.739> kind<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:43.980> does<00:00:44.129> come<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> slight

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
so it kind of does come with a slight

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.170 
so it kind of does come with a slight
charge<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.600> tool<00:00:46.110> itself<00:00:46.500> has<00:00:46.879> two<00:00:47.879> speed

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180

a couple of nice things about lithium
batteries<00:01:21.990> um<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.520> compare<00:01:23.939> them<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
batteries um if you compare them to a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.660 
batteries um if you compare them to a
NiCad<00:01:24.720> battery<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> NiCad<00:01:26.220> battery

begins<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.390> lose<00:01:27.630> power<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.650> tool<00:01:28.890> gets

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
begins to lose power the tool gets

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
begins to lose power the tool gets
progressively<00:01:29.490> slower<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.509> less<00:01:30.689> powerful

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
progressively slower and less powerful

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.630 
progressively slower and less powerful
less<00:01:31.200> powerful<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:32.220> you're<00:01:32.340> working<00:01:32.610> with

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
less powerful when you're working with

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.179 
less powerful when you're working with
lithium<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.630> got<00:01:33.840> full<00:01:34.229> charge<00:01:34.560> or<00:01:34.890> no
