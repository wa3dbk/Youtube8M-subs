the competition list on xbox is filled

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.250 
the competition list on xbox is filled
with<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:20.299> know<00:03:20.420> much<00:03:20.600> higher<00:03:20.840> skilled

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
with you know much higher skilled

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.220 
with you know much higher skilled
players<00:03:21.530> than<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.920> ps3<00:03:22.780> because<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.900> know<00:03:24.019> we

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
players than the ps3 because you know we

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.140 
players than the ps3 because you know we
got<00:03:24.440> all<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.650> pros<00:03:24.980> transfer<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.519> ps3<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.120> i

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
got all the pros transfer the ps3 so i

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.729

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
guess the skill set is about the same

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.819 
guess the skill set is about the same
you<00:03:28.549> know<00:03:28.639> what's<00:03:28.910> what's<00:03:29.780> what's<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.590> main

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
you know what's what's what's the main

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.289 
you know what's what's what's the main
difference<00:03:30.859> you<00:03:31.430> know<00:03:31.489> even<00:03:31.700> just<00:03:31.940> regular

difference you know even just regular

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.710 
difference you know even just regular
lobbies<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:33.400> just<00:03:34.400> seems<00:03:34.609> weird<00:03:34.819> that<00:03:35.120> we

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
lobbies it just seems weird that we

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.930
