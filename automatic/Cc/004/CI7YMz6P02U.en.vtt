00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.899 

we<00:02:28.349> realized<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:28.980> because<00:02:29.579> it's<00:02:29.730> such<00:02:29.879> a

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
we realized that because it's such a

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.270 
we realized that because it's such a
lifelike<00:02:30.390> image<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.799> actually<00:02:31.920> play

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
lifelike image you can actually play

lifelike image you can actually play
with<00:02:32.459> reality<00:02:32.939> so<00:02:33.629> we<00:02:33.810> thought<00:02:34.379> you<00:02:34.620> could<00:02:34.799> put

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
with reality so we thought you could put

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.610 
with reality so we thought you could put
installations<00:02:36.569> we<00:02:36.749> could<00:02:36.870> take<00:02:37.019> over<00:02:37.170> sitting

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
installations we could take over sitting

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.369 
installations we could take over sitting
and<00:02:38.069> put<00:02:38.249> installations<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:38.939> a<00:02:39.030> city<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.599> put

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
and put installations in a city and put

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.070 
and put installations in a city and put
obstacle<00:02:40.829> oceans<00:02:41.249> or<00:02:41.639> oh<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.969> place

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.070 

we've<00:02:45.680> spent<00:02:46.070> three<00:02:46.490> days<00:02:46.700> going<00:02:47.450> around

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
we've spent three days going around

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.480 
we've spent three days going around
Brenna's<00:02:48.350> area<00:02:48.590> shooting<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.160> exterior

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.080 
Brenna's area shooting on the exterior
scenes<00:02:49.880> all<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.870> master<00:02:51.200> shots<00:02:51.760> where<00:02:52.760> we<00:02:52.910> see

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
scenes all the master shots where we see

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.200 
scenes all the master shots where we see
TV<00:02:53.450> screens<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.820> now<00:02:55.820> we're<00:02:55.970> going<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.120> be

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
TV screens and now we're going to be

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.860 
TV screens and now we're going to be
turning<00:02:56.800> three<00:02:57.800> days<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.130> studio<00:02:58.490> and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
turning three days in the studio and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
turning three days in the studio and
shooting<00:02:59.870> content<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:00.770> others<00:03:00.980> TV

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.340 

so<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.550> massive<00:03:09.850> challenge<00:03:10.180> was<00:03:10.390> how<00:03:10.660> do<00:03:11.080> you

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
so the massive challenge was how do you

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:22.470 
so the massive challenge was how do you
show<00:03:11.920> 3d<00:03:12.670> in<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.300> 2d<00:03:13.630> image

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.560 

technically<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:25.220> an<00:03:25.340> absolute<00:03:25.790> brain

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
technically it's an absolute brain

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.970 
technically it's an absolute brain
melter<00:03:28.150> we<00:03:29.150> would<00:03:29.360> mimic<00:03:29.630> any<00:03:30.110> move<00:03:30.560> we<00:03:30.770> did

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
melter we would mimic any move we did

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.950 
melter we would mimic any move we did
with<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.430> camera<00:03:32.150> richness<00:03:32.570> should<00:03:32.750> feel

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
with a camera richness should feel

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.740 
with a camera richness should feel
handheld<00:03:33.470> would<00:03:34.400> be<00:03:34.520> mimicked<00:03:34.880> in<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.150> TV<00:03:35.480> so

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
handheld would be mimicked in the TV so

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.420 
handheld would be mimicked in the TV so
if<00:03:35.870> you're<00:03:36.020> watching<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.320> 3d<00:03:36.350> TV<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.250> move

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
if you're watching a 3d TV and you move

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.030 
if you're watching a 3d TV and you move
around<00:03:37.550> it<00:03:37.940> you'd<00:03:38.750> hope<00:03:38.960> that<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.800> bits

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
around it you'd hope that the bits

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.740 
around it you'd hope that the bits
wouldn't<00:03:40.400> also<00:03:40.730> move<00:03:40.940> as<00:03:41.090> well<00:03:41.240> so<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.630> gives

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
wouldn't also move as well so it gives

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.560 
wouldn't also move as well so it gives
you<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:41.960> sense<00:03:42.200> of<00:03:42.520> relative<00:03:43.520> perspective<00:03:44.150> if

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
you a sense of relative perspective if

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.740 
you a sense of relative perspective if
you<00:03:45.110> match<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:46.220> parallaxes<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.450> direction

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
you match the parallaxes the direction

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.080 
you match the parallaxes the direction
you<00:03:48.050> shoot<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.440> content<00:03:48.920> on<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.130> telly<00:03:49.340> and

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
you shoot the content on the telly and

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.000 
you shoot the content on the telly and
the<00:03:50.180> direction<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.720> shoot<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.470> surrounding

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
the direction you shoot the surrounding

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.310 
the direction you shoot the surrounding
city<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.610> suddenly<00:03:52.940> get<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.210> depth<00:03:53.570> and<00:03:53.840> then

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
city you suddenly get the depth and then

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.410 
city you suddenly get the depth and then
the<00:03:54.440> 3d<00:03:54.830> effect<00:03:54.860> happening<00:03:55.490> we<00:03:56.000> took<00:03:56.150> all<00:03:56.330> the

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
the 3d effect happening we took all the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.240 
the 3d effect happening we took all the
mathematical<00:03:56.960> measurements<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.800> replicate

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
mathematical measurements to replicate

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.440 
mathematical measurements to replicate
the<00:03:58.370> waterfall

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:25.990 

we<00:04:10.590> needed<00:04:10.890> a<00:04:11.010> waterful<00:04:11.730> shot<00:04:12.060> which<00:04:12.270> was<00:04:12.540> huge

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.060 

it's<00:04:26.450> a<00:04:26.600> fun<00:04:26.810> commercial<00:04:27.380> where<00:04:27.680> people<00:04:27.980> are
