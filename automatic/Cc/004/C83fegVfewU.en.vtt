breached on the upper floors the flame I
came<00:00:51.879> through<00:00:52.090> there<00:00:52.270> and<00:00:52.510> get<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:54.280> get<00:00:54.400> a

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
came through there and get they get a

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.650 
came through there and get they get a
little<00:00:54.610> bit<00:00:54.700> close<00:00:54.879> that's<00:00:55.180> just<00:00:55.330> part<00:00:55.600> of

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
little bit close that's just part of

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.970 
little bit close that's just part of
what<00:00:55.720> they<00:00:55.900> do<00:00:55.960> and<00:00:56.440> we<00:00:56.590> just<00:00:56.739> got<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:56.920> be

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
what they do and we just got to be

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.670 
what they do and we just got to be
careful<00:00:57.129> for<00:00:57.400> that<00:00:57.580> but<00:00:58.410> they<00:00:59.410> were<00:00:59.470> in<00:00:59.559> good

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
careful for that but they were in good

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.410 
careful for that but they were in good
shape<00:00:59.739> out<00:01:00.100> here<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.340> this<00:01:00.400> area<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.880> hydrants

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
shape out here in this area the hydrants

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.720 
shape out here in this area the hydrants
are<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.540> lot<00:01:01.720> farther<00:01:01.870> apart<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.739> we<00:01:03.460> probably

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
are a lot farther apart and we probably

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.330 
are a lot farther apart and we probably
went<00:01:04.000> about<00:01:04.630> 600<00:01:05.229> feet<00:01:05.410> opposed<00:01:05.830> trying<00:01:06.280> to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
went about 600 feet opposed trying to

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.270 
went about 600 feet opposed trying to
get<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.550> one

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
get you one

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.890 
get you one
del<00:01:08.240> Falco

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
del Falco

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.910

farther<00:01:10.900> than<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.110> other<00:01:11.230> direction<00:01:11.380> but<00:01:11.710> yes

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
farther than the other direction but yes

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.970 
farther than the other direction but yes
it's<00:01:12.190> always<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.460> concern<00:01:12.820> in<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.740> sum<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.770> we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
it's always a concern in a sum that we

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.170 
it's always a concern in a sum that we
have<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.160> evaluate<00:01:15.340> them<00:01:15.640> around<00:01:15.790> this<00:01:15.970> area

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
have to evaluate them around this area

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.150 
have to evaluate them around this area
we<00:01:16.570> ended<00:01:16.780> up<00:01:16.840> throwing<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.170> second<00:01:17.500> alarm<00:01:17.650> just

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
we ended up throwing a second alarm just

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.250 
we ended up throwing a second alarm just
because<00:01:18.430> of<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.630> potential<00:01:19.630> that<00:01:19.840> we<00:01:19.960> had<00:01:20.110> for

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
because of the potential that we had for

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.110 
because of the potential that we had for
some<00:01:20.440> large<00:01:20.740> buildings<00:01:21.580> that<00:01:21.730> were<00:01:21.850> closed

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
some large buildings that were closed

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.880 
some large buildings that were closed
for<00:01:22.210> exposure<00:01:22.600> issues<00:01:22.930> as<00:01:23.110> those<00:01:23.290> who<00:01:23.320> started

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
for exposure issues as those who started

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.710 
for exposure issues as those who started
off<00:01:24.010> who<00:01:24.580> they<00:01:24.729> had<00:01:24.820> quite<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.060> mess<00:01:25.300> phone<00:01:25.510> here

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
off who they had quite a mess phone here

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.690 
off who they had quite a mess phone here
were<00:01:26.290> able<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.560> isolate<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.250> for<00:01:27.640> that

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
were able to isolate to it for that

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.120 
were able to isolate to it for that
level<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:28.030> I<00:01:28.150> was<00:01:28.240> able<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.510> reduce<00:01:29.110> or<00:01:29.320> cancel

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
level so I was able to reduce or cancel

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.370 
level so I was able to reduce or cancel
the<00:01:30.160> second<00:01:30.520> alarm<00:01:30.670> once<00:01:30.940> they<00:01:31.090> arrived<00:01:31.630> and

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
the second alarm once they arrived and

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.010 
the second alarm once they arrived and
we<00:01:32.650> end<00:01:32.800> up<00:01:32.890> with<00:01:33.070> like<00:01:33.610> four<00:01:34.390> and<00:01:34.630> four

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
we end up with like four and four

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.970 
we end up with like four and four
engines

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
engines

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.700 
engines
there<00:01:37.550> are<00:01:37.640> some<00:01:37.790> slight<00:01:38.420> damage<00:01:38.870> to<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.290> sum

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
there are some slight damage to the sum

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.230 
there are some slight damage to the sum
of<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.890> exposures<00:01:40.340> just<00:01:40.760> from<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.030> Arabian

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
of the exposures just from the Arabian

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.880 
of the exposures just from the Arabian
he'd<00:01:41.600> want<00:01:41.780> across<00:01:42.020> them<00:01:42.230> but<00:01:42.590> no<00:01:42.740> major

he'd want across them but no major

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.440 
he'd want across them but no major
damage<00:01:43.220> or<00:01:43.550> no<00:01:43.640> involvement<00:01:44.060> as<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.330> other
