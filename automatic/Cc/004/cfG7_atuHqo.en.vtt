Hi everyone! Welcome to Keith's Toy Box.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.200
Today's surprise toy is our favourite pig and her family.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.860
Can you guess what it is?

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.900
It's a knock-off Pepa Pig and her family playset.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.920
We bought this knock-off set for a little below $7

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.660
versus this original set by Fisher-Price for $17 at Amazon.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.840
This knock-off also comes with Pepa, George, Mummy, and Daddy Pig.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.780
So let's open the box and take a look.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.400
There's Daddy Pig.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.820
George

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.140
Mummy Pig

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.620
and Peppa

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.400
Let's take a closer look at Peppa.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.300
She has a lovely face.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.700
You can see her eyes, nose, and smiling mouth.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.320
rosy cheeks

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.520
And we can move her arms forwards and backwards.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.340
We can move her legs too.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.260
And we can also turn her head left and right.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.620
Now let's look at George.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.940
His arms and legs are movable too.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.900
Here's Daddy Pig.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.860
He's wearing glasses.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.140
And here's mommy pig.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.660
Now let's compare these knock-offs with the original Peppa Pig figures.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.040
These original figures came with the Grandpa Pig train set.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.220
The two Peppa's are exactly the same size.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.300
And look almost the same.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.260
Except for the original Peppa who is wearing a pink dress.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.980
Both their arms can be moved forwards and backwards.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.460
as well as their legs

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.500
The only difference is that the knock-off Pepa's legs are entirely black.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.100
The knock-off's head is made of soft plastic

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.740
while the original Peppa is made of tough plastic.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.960
Now let's look at the two George's.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.320
At first glance, they seem the same

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.540
but the original George is actually slightly smaller than Peppa

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.340
while the knock-off George is the same size as Peppa

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.240
Both their arms and legs can be moved forwards and backwards.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.640
This one is soft while the other one is hard.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.140
Daddy pig, Peppa's birthday is almost coming up.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.280
What are we going to do for her on her birthday?

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.500
Hmmm Mummy Pig, you're right. We should do something special for her.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.080
Let me give it some thought.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.800
Hello George.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.420
My birthday is coming up.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.440
What i would really like is a birthday party.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.220
Birthday party! Wow!

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.640
I hope Mummy and Daddy will agree to throw me one.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.520
Mummy Pig, I think we should throw Peppa a birthday party.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.940
A birthday party would be perfect!

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.460
Yehey!!! ahahahahaha!

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.980
Yehey!!! ahahahahaha!

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.280
So that's the knock off Peppa Pig's family playset.
