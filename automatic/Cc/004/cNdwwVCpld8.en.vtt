and right underneath the periosteum we

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.900 
and right underneath the periosteum we
would<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.290> circumferential<00:01:41.040> lamellae

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
would have the circumferential lamellae

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.250 
would have the circumferential lamellae
and<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:43.140> over<00:01:43.290> here<00:01:43.410> we<00:01:43.650> have<00:01:43.860> three<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.580> the

so that we can get a better look at them

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.720 
so that we can get a better look at them
so<00:01:50.640> let's<00:01:50.820> take<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> closer<00:01:51.270> look<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.830> lamellae

going to reduce the brittleness of bone
and<00:02:34.730> make<00:02:34.879> them<00:02:35.120> somewhat<00:02:35.540> more<00:02:35.719> tougher<00:02:36.200> so

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
and make them somewhat more tougher so

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.069 
and make them somewhat more tougher so
they<00:02:36.500> can<00:02:36.769> resist<00:02:37.310> twisting<00:02:38.180> forces<00:02:38.510> without

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
they can resist twisting forces without

they can resist twisting forces without
snapping<00:02:40.299> notice<00:02:41.299> that<00:02:41.480> these<00:02:41.719> collagen
