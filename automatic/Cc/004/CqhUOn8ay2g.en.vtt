00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 
Drakkar yeah
I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.640> he<00:01:32.850> said<00:01:33.030> using<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.390> assault<00:01:33.689> person

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
I think he said using the assault person

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
I think he said using the assault person
I<00:01:33.990> would<00:01:34.110> empathize<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.189> Draco

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
I would empathize with with the Draco

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.580 
I would empathize with with the Draco
something<00:01:35.820> yeah<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.960> know<00:01:37.170> his

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
something yeah I think you know his

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.950 
something yeah I think you know his
parents<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> best<00:01:38.820> yeah<00:01:39.600> yeah<00:01:39.810> it's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
parents are not the best yeah yeah it's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.359 
parents are not the best yeah yeah it's
a<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.170> unfortunate<00:01:40.439> his<00:01:40.770> upbringing<00:01:40.920> was

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
a bit unfortunate his upbringing was

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.789 
a bit unfortunate his upbringing was
there<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.420> was<00:01:42.540> an<00:01:42.630> NSPCC<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.439> think

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
there was if there was an NSPCC I think

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
there was if there was an NSPCC I think
he<00:01:44.130> drank<00:01:44.880> another<00:01:45.210> writer<00:01:45.450> cool<00:01:45.720> therefore

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
he drank another writer cool therefore

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.410 
he drank another writer cool therefore
you<00:01:46.259> could<00:01:46.350> divorce<00:01:46.710> them<00:01:46.979> legally<00:01:47.970> sure<00:01:48.240> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you could divorce them legally sure I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
you could divorce them legally sure I
think<00:01:48.689> yeah<00:01:48.930> he<00:01:49.229> doesn't<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.560> bad<00:01:49.740> time<00:01:50.040> for

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
think yeah he doesn't a bad time for

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.880 
think yeah he doesn't a bad time for
Draco<00:01:51.390> especially<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.990> old<00:01:52.110> man<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.619> mean

which is which is quite nicely we see a
bit<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.430> her<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.759> year

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
bit more of her this year

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060
