00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 On January 21, China's central bank injected an unprecedented amount of unprecedented funding into the market, more than 370 billion yuan, attracting the attention of international media for money shortages. in China 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:20.620
 Hong Thang Loi, a researcher, journalist in Beijing, and Tran Chi Phi, a professor and doctorate in economics at New York City University, will explain the reason for this money shortage. 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.120
 Invite viewers to follow. 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.120
 On January 21, the Central Bank pumped 255 billion yuan, or 42 billion dollars, into the financial system. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.180
 Including 7-day repurchase contract worth 75 billion and 21 days worth 180 billion. This is the strongest move in 11 months. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.250
 Until January 20, the Central Bank provided 120 billion yuan of short-term liquidity to major commercial banks through the SLF lending system. 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.560
 The repurchase contract means that the central bank increases the money supply to the market by buying securities from the main agents. 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:01.720
 This unprecedented big move from the central bank made the media pay attention to China's shortage of money, including the Wall Street Journal and CNN. 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.420
 Beijing-based scholar Gong Shengli analyzed that huge amounts of money pumped into the market are closely related to the recovery of the US dollar. The central bank is trying to prevent money shortage. 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 A strong contraction due to the loose monetary policy of the US. 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.920
 If the US dollar recovers, there will not be enough money in the money market 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:37.670
 China will be greatly affected when other currencies fill that gap. 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.080
 Dr. Tran Chi Phi, professor of economics at New York City University, analyzed that the US economy has begun to recover. 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.920
 Therefore, the US Federal Reserve Bank decided to cancel the loose monetary policy. 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.770
 If the US dollar has recovered, the RMB exchange rate may be lowered. 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.020
 On January 20, the interbank exchange rate in Shanghai simultaneously increased. 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.320
 Both the industry must be coal, the money is back. 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.570
 The stock market was hit by a rising market exchange rate. Shanghai's composite index fell below the 2,000-point mark, the lowest level in nearly six months. 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.120
 After news of repurchase agreements was announced, the interbank market was quite excited 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.920
 The interbank 7-day repurchase rate dropped to 5.5% on January 21, compared with 7.5% on January 20, and quickly stabilized. 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.360
 The central bank has focused on the main urgent need, which has no specific strategy for the long-term market, including easing the economy. 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.040
 This shows that China's economy is very fragile. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 The central bank knows that it is hard to resist a long-term risk. The only way is to provide short-term support. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.620
 The government stated that the purpose of injecting a large amount of money into the market was to enhance the liquidity of the banking system. 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:59.200
 The director of Peking University's Securities and Financial Research Center, Mr. Cao Fengqi, pointed out that, according to the actual needs, money scarcity is entirely possible regardless of whether it is a large or small currency. Issuing a large amount of money shows that capital efficiency becomes worse. 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.120
 The industry estimates that a 21-day repurchase contract is enough to go through the Lunar New Year, to ensure that the source of money enters the new year and halts concerns about money shortages. 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.000
 However, this repurchase agreement will expire after the Lunar New Year and the capital will be withdrawn. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.200
 Thus, loose monetary policy has never been changed. 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.720
 Tran Chi Phi believes that the situation after the Lunar New Year will not be optimistic. 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.320
 Besides, there may be greater worries in the issue of Chinese economic structure. 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:34.920
 After the economic crisis, the government provided a lot of money to invest in real estate and infrastructure projects with very low profits or little profit. 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:44.320
 Debts will expire and infrastructure projects, such as high-speed rail, are losing money. After that, it is these debts that will cause money shortage. 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.550
 Creditors are mainly central and local governments. 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.440
 According to a CNN TV report on the 21st, analysts worry that the new credit may not generate the expected economic benefits. 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.400
 Bubble debt can also undermine economic growth. 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.920
 The reports mentioned that, the central bank allowed periodic increases in interest rates significantly. Then I will inject cash to ease the credit crisis. 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.920
 This is a very dangerous step.
