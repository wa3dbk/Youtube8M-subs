00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.510
 stabbing 4 she had stabbing there right now 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:23.260
 not there is full assignment and if and full 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:29.050
 assignment is a bee population always whole 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:32.290
 sweet because holy magic is filled and what 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.840
 that it 's going to be almost people 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.300
 yes i always say when we have your kids 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.520
 on the stand if you want something 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.380
 from your father or your mother 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.280
 nice wait until they just ate 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.980
 to have 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.399
 and then you ask and not just before the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.399
 meal 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.600
 they are yes here on the lawn 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.420
 on what further work is done with people 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.280
 we're just eating next to the greenhouse 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.009
 if the weather is nice 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.299
 and that is also possible because they are only 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.460
 interested in flowers and neat and on 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.070
 the moment she came to me after the game 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.380
 honey come whatever i have on the table 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:35.369
 stand then I know that we have 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.369
 because earlier they are really 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.990
 it was you yourself to those in your yes 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:56.740
 what am I happy with 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:59.440
 i am i was 14 then with me 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.820
 I came back from school and it was whole 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.020
 a lot of 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.180
 situations were the back home 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.360
 the house we were very many neighbors and 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.010
 children and then there is a bee swarm 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:21.870
 in the sheep and I have those animals 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.870
 and I finally sold 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.110
 it was so fascinating that i was immediately 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.940
 I think they are well you are 14 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.830
 years old and you do n't have too much 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.680
 tell at home 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.750
 so my father said go from those beasts 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.580
 away because when stabbing and there comes the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.500
 a little while later the boy comes 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.870
 that was sixteen years the lower you are 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.450
 self 14 comes one of 16 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.060
 and that goes with you at the van by you 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.790
 that lamp that swear with it 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.410
 well and then it stayed that way well 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.930
 I'm on the move again during management 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.000
 got in touch 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.760
 but it was only when i knew i 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.090
 that I and consequently came to live here 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.810
 I then bought itself was though 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.910
 cat bee people cooked in a cupboard and 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.910
 I brought it home 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.190
 well at living well quite busy 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.950
 street 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.100
 So I like my sister to join the cabinet 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:36.549
 briefly through the house behind the 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:41.100
 garden and the door falls 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.100
 close behind us and suddenly you hear 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.940
 what my sisters sit at and I put 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.709
 hold you 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.420
 well we go garden my dad comes 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.110
 after us 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.110
 and we say that yes that 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.330
 is a cupboard with you yes but then you would 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.580
 after all, none of those animals come out 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.680
 I sit 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.640
 these beasts sting 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.819
 I put down the cupboards and 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.890
 am as really like to try 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.170
 and I actually have them whole 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:20.630
 gently and ask of would you be kind 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.850
 want to be do not want to put what 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.120
 Everything we have to say goodbye to 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.889
 each other and I would rather not have that 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.789
 well and i have thereby 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.789
 cupboard opened 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.250
 well then you see it when they first 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.190
 coming out she is a bee coming out 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.250
 walk and when it is set up it turns 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.910
 itself to look from where do I hear 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.430
 actually home and then he flies like that 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.270
 it goes a bit further away and then look at it 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.440
 as mean and to you it flies 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.800
 away 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.250
 make another one mh the hague in your bio 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.620
 the sky and then they fly away well it 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.349
 nice of all that was 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.800
 two days later the one was with us 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:13.910
 house that knew exactly that it was soft to the touch 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.740
 7 hours and they flew together at 11 am 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.419
 and were engaged that was my 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.919
 father who had the seat next to the cupboard 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:24.710
 set and that every free moment is fed up 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.460
 so look at them both with you 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.210
 actually found this very unfortunate 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.639
 when they left 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.010
 but well later it has here in this 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.860
 house behind the lived so can you 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.860
 fully enjoy with you again 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.240
 but that was my first my first 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.220
 acquaintance so was at 14 am and later 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.610
 I then started with this 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.660
 actually from the first moment 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.150
 so you also communicate with that bee 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.660
 have a bond with you i have i have one 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.260
 connected with the bee without me 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.950
 well i'm constantly saying 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:09.960
 I can actually go anywhere I am with 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:12.419
 with you also with peoples who 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.630
 so they are strange to me in nations 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.650
 from others yes there I can with you 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.630
 handle 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:24.990
 in the same way that I am here with 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:27.870
 it's all about this at home and that 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.250
 was was fourteen days ago or three 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.680
 weeks back 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.880
 those were two peoples then I got on one 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.350
 school 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.300
 I am at a school for a week 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.160
 been where we 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.490
 have looked at you for a week there 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.430
 were two cupboards and those two cupboards 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.890
 went three times a day 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.440
 why there to watch at the 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:54.200
 you with all those school children from 6 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.200
 year to 17 years 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:03.680
 So 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:06.590
 was only party so only on 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.780
 Friday at ten to eleven is a 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.889
 student deprived 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:15.470
 and then its after 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:18.470
 that was just one bee on the whole 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.080
 from the way a little excited 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:24.289
 touched the rest who just stayed whole 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.620
 quiet and so did the kids 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:31.190
 I also have that as normal then just look 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.870
 yes that could also do those kids and 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.610
 the younger the children, the better 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.360
 that when you know it is young 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.360
 children say
