00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.520 
hold it just right the screws will be
down<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.730> little<00:03:53.090> bit<00:03:53.239> from<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.510> top<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:54.380> the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
down a little bit from the top and the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:28.170 
down a little bit from the top and the
heads<00:03:54.739> will<00:03:54.920> hold<00:03:55.100> it<00:03:55.220> in<00:03:55.310> place

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:41.040 

that's<00:04:29.180> how<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.420> first<00:04:29.920> around<00:04:30.920> gets<00:04:31.250> started

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.500 

this<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.230> my<00:04:42.380> last<00:04:42.620> one<00:04:43.010> so<00:04:43.430> I'm<00:04:43.520> double<00:04:44.300> the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.710 

square<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:48.200> end<00:04:48.380> up<00:04:48.560> with<00:04:48.770> this<00:04:49.040> so<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:50.240> had

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
square to end up with this so I had

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.090 
square to end up with this so I had
plenty<00:04:50.930> of<00:04:51.080> room<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.940> might<00:04:52.940> add<00:04:53.120> another<00:04:53.150> coil

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
plenty of room I might add another coil

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.380 
plenty of room I might add another coil
but<00:04:55.100> I'm<00:04:55.160> going<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.370> place<00:04:55.580> it<00:04:55.760> flat<00:04:55.940> on<00:04:56.270> this

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
but I'm going to place it flat on this

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.060 
but I'm going to place it flat on this
concrete<00:04:56.870> because<00:04:57.230> it's<00:04:57.440> concrete<00:04:57.920> gets

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
concrete because it's concrete gets

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.640 
concrete because it's concrete gets
extremely<00:04:58.490> hot<00:04:59.200> it's<00:05:00.200> not<00:05:00.350> a<00:05:00.380> crazy

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
extremely hot it's not a crazy

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.040 
extremely hot it's not a crazy
impressive<00:05:01.340> lot<00:05:01.520> of<00:05:01.640> water<00:05:01.820> coming<00:05:02.120> out<00:05:02.300> it's

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
impressive lot of water coming out it's

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.350 
impressive lot of water coming out it's
all<00:05:03.170> right
