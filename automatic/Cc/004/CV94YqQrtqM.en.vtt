00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
more and more frustrating and I don't

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.220 
more and more frustrating and I don't
think<00:00:08.940> it's<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> obvious<00:00:09.240> reason<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.840> oh<00:00:10.019> it's

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
think it's the obvious reason of oh it's

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.690

just<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.530> same<00:00:10.740> game<00:00:11.040> because<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.490> more

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
it had a localized searching but it

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.970 
it had a localized searching but it
didn't<00:03:38.550> so<00:03:38.730> well<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.090> was<00:03:39.210> the<00:03:39.360> best<00:03:39.540> um<00:03:39.980> but

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
didn't so well it was the best um but

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.800 
didn't so well it was the best um but
just<00:03:41.190> go<00:03:41.310> back<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.820> that's<00:03:42.240> what<00:03:42.480> people

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810
