it's<00:04:39.560> not<00:04:39.710> about<00:04:39.919> that<00:04:40.010> poor<00:04:40.790> darkness<00:04:41.389> my<00:04:41.660> old

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
it's not about that poor darkness my old

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.670 
it's not about that poor darkness my old
friend<00:04:41.960> I've<00:04:42.410> come<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:43.460> talk<00:04:43.580> with<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:44.000> again

Simon and Garfunkel

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.840 
Simon and Garfunkel
living<00:04:47.320> very<00:04:47.620> impressive<00:04:48.310> but<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.550> got<00:04:48.730> the

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
living very impressive but you got the

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.490 
living very impressive but you got the
wheels<00:04:49.120> off<00:04:49.420> of<00:04:49.450> Basenji<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.290> you're<00:04:50.380> going

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
wheels off of Basenji but you're going

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.990 
wheels off of Basenji but you're going
up<00:04:50.620> against<00:04:50.830> rosie<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.220> riveter<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.790> who's

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
up against rosie the riveter that who's

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.910 
up against rosie the riveter that who's
been<00:04:52.180> very<00:04:52.480> impressive<00:04:52.870> do<00:04:53.410> you<00:04:53.500> think<00:04:53.740> that

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
been very impressive do you think that

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.740 
been very impressive do you think that
same<00:04:54.190> strategy<00:04:54.760> will<00:04:54.910> worked<00:04:55.090> in<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.360> finals

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
same strategy will worked in the finals

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.050 
same strategy will worked in the finals
you're<00:04:56.230> gonna<00:04:56.410> have<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.680> do<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.160> little<00:04:57.310> beefing

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
you're gonna have to do a little beefing

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.270 
you're gonna have to do a little beefing
up<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.540> charge<00:04:59.410> our<00:04:59.530> batteries<00:04:59.560> I<00:05:00.070> know<00:05:00.130> we

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
up and charge our batteries I know we

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.440 
up and charge our batteries I know we
had<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.430> little<00:05:00.610> bit<00:05:00.760> of<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:01.000> problem<00:05:01.210> with<00:05:01.360> the

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
had a little bit of a problem with the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.970 
had a little bit of a problem with the
batteries<00:05:01.750> they<00:05:01.840> slowed<00:05:02.110> down<00:05:02.320> quite<00:05:02.590> a<00:05:02.710> bit

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
batteries they slowed down quite a bit

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.590 
batteries they slowed down quite a bit
we<00:05:03.190> lost<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.490> lot<00:05:03.610> of<00:05:03.700> power<00:05:03.910> but<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.240> think<00:05:04.510> we're

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
we lost a lot of power but I think we're

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.940 
we lost a lot of power but I think we're
gonna<00:05:04.720> do<00:05:04.840> all<00:05:04.990> right<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.230> think<00:05:05.440> you'll<00:05:05.710> do<00:05:05.830> all

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
gonna do all right I think you'll do all

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.340 
gonna do all right I think you'll do all
right<00:05:06.130> -<00:05:06.340> let's<00:05:06.970> hear<00:05:07.150> it<00:05:07.210> for<00:05:07.480> all<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:08.020> robot

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
right - let's hear it for all the robot

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.010 
right - let's hear it for all the robot
ears

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.170 

so<00:05:16.020> there<00:05:16.260> it<00:05:16.410> is<00:05:16.440> Basenji<00:05:17.130> slipping<00:05:18.000> into

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
so there it is Basenji slipping into

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.230 
so there it is Basenji slipping into
darkness

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.510 

and<00:05:22.449> rosie<00:05:23.139> the<00:05:23.169> riveter<00:05:23.319> is<00:05:24.009> going<00:05:24.250> to<00:05:24.340> meet

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
and rosie the riveter is going to meet

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.850 
and rosie the riveter is going to meet
darkness<00:05:25.120> in<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.419> final<00:05:28.620> dingy<00:05:29.620> what

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
darkness in the final dingy what

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.980 
darkness in the final dingy what
happened<00:05:30.340> out<00:05:30.490> there<00:05:30.569> well<00:05:31.569> I<00:05:31.599> think<00:05:31.750> they

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
happened out there well I think they

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.900 
happened out there well I think they
call<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.199> catastrophic<00:05:33.039> failures<00:05:33.520> but<00:05:33.880> I

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
call it catastrophic failures but I

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.809 
call it catastrophic failures but I
think<00:05:34.270> it<00:05:34.360> is<00:05:34.479> he<00:05:34.720> lost<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:35.050> couple<00:05:35.229> wheels<00:05:35.819> yeah

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
think it is he lost a couple wheels yeah

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:38.969 
think it is he lost a couple wheels yeah
we<00:05:37.180> shared<00:05:37.449> off<00:05:37.630> some<00:05:37.900> bolts<00:05:38.259> there<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.470> was<00:05:38.800> my

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
we shared off some bolts there I was my

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.740 
we shared off some bolts there I was my
poor<00:05:39.250> engineering<00:05:39.819> I<00:05:39.910> think<00:05:39.940> when<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:40.419> was<00:05:40.449> on

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
poor engineering I think when I was on

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.909 
poor engineering I think when I was on
those<00:05:40.930> bolts<00:05:41.139> but<00:05:41.530> they<00:05:41.650> they

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
those bolts but they they

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.439 
those bolts but they they
choreographically<00:05:42.669> fell<00:05:42.970> off<00:05:43.120> at<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:43.300> same

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
choreographically fell off at the same

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.020 
choreographically fell off at the same
time<00:05:43.750> though<00:05:44.039> about<00:05:45.039> to<00:05:45.190> ask<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.580> if<00:05:45.729> you<00:05:45.880> had

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
time though about to ask you if you had

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.460 
time though about to ask you if you had
it<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.210> do<00:05:46.330> all<00:05:46.360> over<00:05:46.509> again<00:05:46.780> would<00:05:47.110> you<00:05:47.229> change

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
it to do all over again would you change

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.020 
it to do all over again would you change
anything<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.069> obviously<00:05:48.610> said<00:05:48.940> the

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
anything and obviously said the

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.400 
anything and obviously said the
engineering<00:05:49.599> would<00:05:49.750> be<00:05:49.930> one<00:05:50.110> of<00:05:50.139> them

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
engineering would be one of them

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.159 
engineering would be one of them
anything<00:05:51.039> else<00:05:51.220> well<00:05:51.940> I<00:05:51.970> like<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:52.599> titanium

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
anything else well I like the titanium

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.689 
anything else well I like the titanium
on<00:05:53.289> the<00:05:53.380> top<00:05:53.590> made<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.860> lot<00:05:54.039> of<00:05:54.160> nice<00:05:54.280> sparks

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
on the top made a lot of nice sparks

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.999 
on the top made a lot of nice sparks
when<00:05:54.880> dead<00:05:55.570> metal<00:05:55.900> hit<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.229> top<00:05:56.530> there

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 
when dead metal hit the top there

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:58.800 
when dead metal hit the top there
visually<00:05:57.400> cool<00:05:57.610> visually<00:05:58.180> cool<00:05:58.419> obviously

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
visually cool visually cool obviously

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.230 
visually cool visually cool obviously
bigger<00:05:59.259> axles<00:05:59.830> so<00:05:59.949> they<00:06:00.070> won't<00:06:00.190> Bend<00:06:00.490> change<00:06:01.150> a

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
bigger axles so they won't Bend change a

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.210 
bigger axles so they won't Bend change a
lot<00:06:01.330> of<00:06:01.389> things<00:06:01.690> okay<00:06:02.080> well<00:06:02.620> good<00:06:02.770> luck<00:06:02.949> next

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
lot of things okay well good luck next
