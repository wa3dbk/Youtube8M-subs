race<00:00:57.360> brakes<00:00:57.690> engine<00:00:57.960> maxed<00:00:58.949> now<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.550> car

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
race brakes engine maxed now this car

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.849 
race brakes engine maxed now this car
will<00:01:00.359> go<00:01:00.390> even<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> much<00:01:01.109> faster<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.680> right

now on the exhaust we just have the two
but<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.920> dual<00:01:05.309> exit<00:01:05.640> exhaust

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
but we can get dual exit exhaust

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.170 
but we can get dual exit exhaust
actually<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.600> looks<00:01:06.750> pretty<00:01:06.900> cool<00:01:07.229> um<00:01:08.180> yeah

they<00:01:09.330> kind<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.659> split<00:01:10.049> off<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.710> each<00:01:10.860> side

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
they kind of like split off to each side

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.490 
they kind of like split off to each side
I'll<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> dual<00:01:12.299> exhaust<00:01:12.450> sure<00:01:13.080> why<00:01:13.260> not

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
I'll get the dual exhaust sure why not

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.219 
I'll get the dual exhaust sure why not
now<00:01:13.799> onto<00:01:14.189> hood<00:01:14.790> since<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> muscle<00:01:15.450> car<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
now onto hood since it's a muscle car it

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
now onto hood since it's a muscle car it
always<00:01:16.380> has<00:01:16.619> epic<00:01:16.950> hoods<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.030> either

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.969 
feeling the carbon hood tripple intake
oh<00:01:33.360> yeah<00:01:33.930> always<00:01:34.140> looks<00:01:34.409> cool<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:34.860> the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
look good in Chrome just because the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.530

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
sunrise orange a bit darker I almost

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.280

go with the bright orange because it

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.070 
go with the bright orange because it

like<00:03:51.260> look<00:03:51.440> at<00:03:51.530> that<00:03:51.560> okay<00:03:52.489> so<00:03:52.730> this<00:03:53.390> is<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
like look at that okay so this is the

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
bar inside with the orange tires and the

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.070
