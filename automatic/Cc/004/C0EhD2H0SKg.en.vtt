it<00:00:03.760> was<00:00:03.909> so<00:00:04.180> demanding<00:00:04.750> because<00:00:04.900> you're

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:05.440 
it was so demanding because you're

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.289 
it was so demanding because you're
descending<00:00:05.980> and<00:00:06.160> you've<00:00:06.430> never<00:00:06.609> seen<00:00:06.730> it<00:00:07.090> and

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:07.299 
descending and you've never seen it and

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.750 
descending and you've never seen it and
it<00:00:08.020> just<00:00:08.200> keeps<00:00:08.380> coming<00:00:08.469> at<00:00:08.860> you<00:00:09.040> and<00:00:09.490> when<00:00:09.610> you

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
it just keeps coming at you and when you

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.970 
it just keeps coming at you and when you
drop<00:00:09.940> into<00:00:10.120> one<00:00:10.210> of<00:00:10.389> these<00:00:10.540> I<00:00:10.990> guess<00:00:11.710> you<00:00:11.830> could

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
drop into one of these I guess you could

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.560 
drop into one of these I guess you could
call<00:00:12.010> it<00:00:12.280> a<00:00:12.340> stair<00:00:12.610> section<00:00:12.910> you<00:00:13.240> literally

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
call it a stair section you literally

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.330 
call it a stair section you literally
are<00:00:13.870> committed<00:00:14.320> and<00:00:14.500> you<00:00:14.559> drop<00:00:14.800> in<00:00:15.070> and<00:00:15.099> it

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
are committed and you drop in and it

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.280 
are committed and you drop in and it
gets<00:00:15.519> harder<00:00:15.910> and<00:00:16.090> harder<00:00:16.450> and<00:00:16.720> there's<00:00:17.200> a

gets harder and harder and there's a

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.660 
gets harder and harder and there's a
corner<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:17.770> it<00:00:17.860> gets<00:00:18.009> harder<00:00:18.340> and<00:00:18.580> then

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
corner and it gets harder and then

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.630 
corner and it gets harder and then
there's<00:00:18.880> exposure<00:00:19.390> to<00:00:19.720> a<00:00:19.750> huge<00:00:20.050> fall<00:00:20.350> and<00:00:20.800> you
