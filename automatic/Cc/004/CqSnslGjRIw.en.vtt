00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
alright I call this one the multi style

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.560 
alright I call this one the multi style
run<00:00:19.860> it's<00:00:20.520> basically<00:00:20.970> trying<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.360> get<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
run it's basically trying to get the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.620 
run it's basically trying to get the
athletes<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.970> run<00:00:23.970> four<00:00:24.930> different<00:00:25.380> patterns

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
athletes to run four different patterns

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.160 
athletes to run four different patterns
through<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> 40<00:00:28.529> x<00:00:28.710> 20<00:00:29.279> course<00:00:29.689> now<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> scale

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
through a 40 x 20 course now the scale

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.470 
through a 40 x 20 course now the scale
on<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.500> drawing<00:00:31.770> is<00:00:31.950> a<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.310> off<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
on this drawing is a little off but the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.270 
on this drawing is a little off but the
way<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.750> set<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> start<00:00:35.070> line

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
way we set it up is we have a start line

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.700 
way we set it up is we have a start line
the<00:00:36.270> first<00:00:36.540> cone<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.170> 20<00:00:37.950> yards<00:00:38.280> away<00:00:39.710> this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the first cone is 20 yards away this

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.910 
the first cone is 20 yards away this
cone<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> 10<00:00:42.780> yards<00:00:43.170> away<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
cone here is 10 yards away from the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.180 
cone here is 10 yards away from the
middle<00:00:44.340> cone<00:00:44.750> this<00:00:45.750> cone<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.500> 20<00:00:46.890> yards

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
middle cone this cone here is 20 yards

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.410 
middle cone this cone here is 20 yards
away<00:00:47.309> from<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.850> cone<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:50.100> cone<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.970> 20

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
away from that cone this cone here is 20

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.050 
away from that cone this cone here is 20
yards<00:00:51.750> away<00:00:51.870> from<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.560> cone<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.220> then<00:00:53.760> this

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
yards away from this cone and then this

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.190 
yards away from this cone and then this
hole<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.960> 40<00:00:55.530> yard<00:00:55.740> run<00:00:56.130> so<00:00:57.060> it's<00:00:57.270> 40<00:00:57.810> yards

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
hole is a 40 yard run so it's 40 yards

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.190 
hole is a 40 yard run so it's 40 yards
long<00:00:58.610> 20<00:00:59.610> yards<00:00:59.970> wide<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.480> way<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.690> works<00:01:00.900> is

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
long 20 yards wide the way it works is

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.920 
long 20 yards wide the way it works is
the<00:01:01.890> athletes<00:01:02.310> run<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.700> one<00:01:02.850> at<00:01:02.970> a<00:01:03.030> time<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the athletes run it one at a time it's a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.649 
the athletes run it one at a time it's a
full<00:01:04.320> sprint<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.070> first<00:01:05.309> cone<00:01:05.579> a<00:01:05.820> side

sprint up to this cone backwards to this

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.840 
sprint up to this cone backwards to this
cone<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.790> then<00:01:15.240> carioca<00:01:15.990> down<00:01:16.979> through<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
cone and then carioca down through the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.540 
cone and then carioca down through the
start<00:01:18.180> line<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.590> athletes<00:01:20.010> go<00:01:20.190> one<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
start line and the athletes go one at a

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.700 
start line and the athletes go one at a
time<00:01:20.760> and<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.450> typically<00:01:21.780> tell<00:01:22.080> them<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.380> when

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
time and a typically tell them that when

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
time and a typically tell them that when
the<00:01:23.040> guy<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.430> front<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.850> gets<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.300> this

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the guy in front of you gets to this

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.140 
the guy in front of you gets to this
point<00:01:24.750> over<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:26.190> next<00:01:26.430> guy<00:01:26.700> should<00:01:26.729> go

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
point over here the next guy should go

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.210 
point over here the next guy should go
so<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.050> have<00:01:28.200> them<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.470> running<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
so you can have them all running at the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.690 
so you can have them all running at the
same<00:01:29.370> time<00:01:29.670> once<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.750> drill<00:01:31.020> gets<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.830> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
same time once the drill gets going it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
same time once the drill gets going it
flows<00:01:33.120> pretty<00:01:33.510> well<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.950> them<00:01:35.159> run

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
flows pretty well and I have them run

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.990 
flows pretty well and I have them run
the<00:01:36.060> course<00:01:36.420> four<00:01:36.990> times<00:01:37.290> each<00:01:37.620> so<00:01:38.549> again<00:01:38.820> it's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the course four times each so again it's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300 
the course four times each so again it's
a<00:01:39.090> full<00:01:39.390> sprint<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> first<00:01:40.229> cone<00:01:40.470> side

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
a full sprint to the first cone side

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.880 
a full sprint to the first cone side
step<00:01:41.790> or<00:01:42.030> side<00:01:42.270> shuffle<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.260> second<00:01:43.740> cone

to<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> end

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.500 

you

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.510 

alright<00:02:07.510> this<00:02:07.690> one<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.050> called<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.440> 42nd<00:02:09.250> run

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
alright this one is called the 42nd run

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.150 
alright this one is called the 42nd run
and<00:02:09.790> it's<00:02:10.570> basically<00:02:10.810> done<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.590> simulate<00:02:12.130> a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
and it's basically done to simulate a

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.520 
and it's basically done to simulate a
good<00:02:12.490> hard<00:02:12.790> shift<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.600> hockey<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:16.660> run<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.080> in

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
good hard shift of hockey we run it in

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.910 
good hard shift of hockey we run it in
three<00:02:18.460> groups<00:02:18.730> each<00:02:19.480> group<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:19.960> try<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.260> you

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
three groups each group we try to you

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.580 
three groups each group we try to you
know<00:02:20.950> break<00:02:21.280> up<00:02:21.520> in<00:02:21.730> even<00:02:22.690> numbers<00:02:22.720> maybe<00:02:23.290> five

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
know break up in even numbers maybe five

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.280 
know break up in even numbers maybe five
or<00:02:23.620> six<00:02:23.980> guys<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.220> each<00:02:24.580> group<00:02:24.790> we<00:02:25.690> always<00:02:25.900> run

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
or six guys in each group we always run

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.140 
or six guys in each group we always run
this<00:02:26.500> as<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.890> very<00:02:27.070> last<00:02:27.430> thing<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
this as the very last thing of the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.560 
this as the very last thing of the
conditioning<00:02:28.840> session<00:02:29.410> players<00:02:30.100> hate<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.700> but

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
conditioning session players hate it but

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.060 
conditioning session players hate it but
it<00:02:31.690> really<00:02:31.900> does<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.320> great<00:02:32.620> job<00:02:32.740> in

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
it really does a great job in

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.610 
it really does a great job in
conditioning<00:02:33.910> them<00:02:34.120> for<00:02:34.870> late<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.410> game

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
conditioning them for late in the game

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.310 
conditioning them for late in the game
type<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.280> situations<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.080> way<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.200> works

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
type of situations so the way it works

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.290 
type of situations so the way it works
is<00:02:39.480> three<00:02:40.480> groups<00:02:40.750> as<00:02:41.590> evenly<00:02:42.520> divided<00:02:43.090> as<00:02:43.180> you

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
is three groups as evenly divided as you

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.170 
is three groups as evenly divided as you
can<00:02:43.450> get<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:45.460> go<00:02:45.490> they<00:02:46.420> run<00:02:46.750> full<00:02:47.620> sprint

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
can get on the go they run full sprint

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.070 
can get on the go they run full sprint
to<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.300> end<00:02:49.330> it's<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.140> 40-yard<00:02:50.740> sprint<00:02:52.080> touch

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
to the end it's a 40-yard sprint touch

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.490 
to the end it's a 40-yard sprint touch
the<00:02:53.320> line<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.860> then<00:02:54.670> backwards<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.990> this<00:02:56.200> cone

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
the line and then backwards to this cone

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.560 
the line and then backwards to this cone
which<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:56.980> 10<00:02:57.280> yards<00:02:57.670> from<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.060> first<00:02:58.300> cone

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
which is 10 yards from the first cone

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.070 
which is 10 yards from the first cone
with<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.930> backward<00:02:59.560> 10-yard<00:03:00.310> run<00:03:00.720> they<00:03:01.720> turn

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
with a backward 10-yard run they turn

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.790 
with a backward 10-yard run they turn
and<00:03:02.580> sprint<00:03:03.580> back<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.360> start<00:03:04.960> line<00:03:05.050> touch

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
and sprint back to the start line touch

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.220 
and sprint back to the start line touch
the<00:03:06.040> line<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.580> then<00:03:06.850> do<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.180> again<00:03:07.240> full

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the line and then do it again full

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.920 
the line and then do it again full
sprint<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.070> end<00:03:09.360> backwards<00:03:10.360> for<00:03:10.510> 10<00:03:10.720> yards

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
sprint to the end backwards for 10 yards

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.590 
sprint to the end backwards for 10 yards
and<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:12.070> full<00:03:12.459> sprint<00:03:12.910> for<00:03:13.120> 30<00:03:13.330> yards

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
and then a full sprint for 30 yards

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.770 
and then a full sprint for 30 yards
touch<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.530> line<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.040> do<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.370> again<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:16.360> idea

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
touch the line and do it again the idea

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.100 
touch the line and do it again the idea
is<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.260> do<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.800> as<00:03:18.070> many<00:03:19.060> times<00:03:19.240> as<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.780> can

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
is to do this as many times as you can

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.610 
is to do this as many times as you can
in<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.650> 40-second<00:03:21.610> span<00:03:22.080> now<00:03:23.080> some<00:03:23.470> of<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
in a 40-second span now some of the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.170 
in a 40-second span now some of the
really<00:03:23.830> good<00:03:24.070> players<00:03:24.400> will<00:03:24.730> get<00:03:24.910> through

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
really good players will get through

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.710 
really good players will get through
this<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.720> three<00:03:26.560> times<00:03:26.860> very<00:03:27.640> rarely<00:03:27.970> will<00:03:28.180> they

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
this a three times very rarely will they

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.199 
this a three times very rarely will they
make<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.290> any<00:03:29.680> further<00:03:30.070> than<00:03:30.400> here<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.090> know

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
make it any further than here you know

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.449 
make it any further than here you know
most<00:03:31.720> players<00:03:32.050> make<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.739> about<00:03:32.980> this<00:03:33.190> area

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
most players make it to about this area

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.270 
most players make it to about this area
at<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.970> 40-second<00:03:34.690> mark<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.950> then<00:03:36.070> what<00:03:36.190> we

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
at the 40-second mark and then what we

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.940 
at the 40-second mark and then what we
do<00:03:36.459> is<00:03:36.489> at<00:03:37.000> about<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.780> 30-second<00:03:38.560> mark<00:03:38.590> we

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
do is at about the 30-second mark we

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.590 
do is at about the 30-second mark we
tell<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.370> next<00:03:39.550> group<00:03:39.850> of<00:03:39.970> players<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.510> get

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.870 
tell the next group of players to get
ready<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:41.050> get<00:03:41.170> up<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.530> line<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.459> we<00:03:42.730> give

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
ready to get up on the line and we give

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.000 
ready to get up on the line and we give
them<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.060> countdown<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.840> know<00:03:43.959> three<00:03:44.350> two<00:03:44.680> one

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
them a countdown you know three two one

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.729 
them a countdown you know three two one
and<00:03:45.370> then<00:03:45.910> they<00:03:46.150> start<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.690> run<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.500> group

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
and then they start to run the group

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.560 
and then they start to run the group
that<00:03:47.950> was<00:03:48.100> out<00:03:48.280> on<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.580> course<00:03:48.880> they<00:03:49.239> get<00:03:49.390> off

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
that was out on the course they get off

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.540 
that was out on the course they get off
the<00:03:49.750> course<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.320> second<00:03:50.739> group<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.100> running

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
the course the second group is running

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.690 
the course the second group is running
for<00:03:51.760> 40<00:03:52.090> seconds<00:03:52.680> when<00:03:53.680> their<00:03:53.860> time<00:03:54.130> is<00:03:54.190> up<00:03:54.370> the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
for 40 seconds when their time is up the

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.540 
for 40 seconds when their time is up the
third<00:03:54.970> group<00:03:55.209> runs<00:03:55.540> for<00:03:55.780> 40<00:03:56.080> seconds<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:56.800> then

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
third group runs for 40 seconds and then

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.640 
third group runs for 40 seconds and then
the<00:03:57.730> first<00:03:58.060> group<00:03:58.390> starts<00:03:58.840> again<00:03:59.140> so<00:03:59.410> each

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
the first group starts again so each

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.910 
the first group starts again so each
group<00:04:00.010> runs<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.790> 40<00:04:01.090> second<00:04:01.690> sprint<00:04:02.170> three

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
group runs the 40 second sprint three

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
group runs the 40 second sprint three
times<00:04:03.630> so<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.810> whole<00:04:05.020> drill<00:04:05.440> is<00:04:05.739> 40<00:04:06.520> seconds

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
times so the whole drill is 40 seconds

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.470 
times so the whole drill is 40 seconds
of<00:04:07.060> running<00:04:07.420> 80<00:04:08.170> seconds<00:04:08.830> of<00:04:09.130> relaxing<00:04:09.940> 40

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
of running 80 seconds of relaxing 40

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.540 
of running 80 seconds of relaxing 40
seconds<00:04:10.900> of<00:04:11.020> running<00:04:11.380> 80<00:04:11.890> seconds<00:04:12.400> and

seconds of running 80 seconds and
relaxing<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.300> then<00:04:13.420> 40<00:04:13.750> seconds<00:04:14.170> are<00:04:14.260> running

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
relaxing and then 40 seconds are running
