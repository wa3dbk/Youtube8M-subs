used some spray adhesive to give that to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.830 
used some spray adhesive to give that to
stay<00:03:06.680> where<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:06.920> wanted<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.610> what<00:03:08.390> inspired

the<00:03:14.750> little<00:03:15.260> quote<00:03:15.730> was<00:03:16.730> just<00:03:17.030> perfect<00:03:17.890> for<00:03:18.890> a

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
the little quote was just perfect for a

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.750 
the little quote was just perfect for a
Mother's<00:03:20.210> Day<00:03:20.470> layout<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.430> kind<00:03:22.700> of

Mother's Day layout so that kind of

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.810 
Mother's Day layout so that kind of
inspired<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.840> theme<00:03:24.130> behind<00:03:25.130> this<00:03:25.550> layout

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
inspired the theme behind this layout

to<00:04:02.120> use<00:04:02.240> some<00:04:02.450> vellum<00:04:02.660> to<00:04:02.900> just<00:04:03.140> kind<00:04:03.350> of<00:04:03.440> layer

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
to use some vellum to just kind of layer

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.520 
to use some vellum to just kind of layer
over<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.160> pattern<00:04:04.640> paper<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.780> tone<00:04:06.050> down<00:04:06.080> the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
over the pattern paper to tone down the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.190 
over the pattern paper to tone down the
flowers<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:06.950> little<00:04:07.280> bit<00:04:07.460> and<00:04:07.730> again<00:04:08.720> just<00:04:08.960> like

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
flowers a little bit and again just like

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.000 
flowers a little bit and again just like
with<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.800> doily<00:04:10.870> border<00:04:11.870> punch<00:04:12.110> I<00:04:12.500> thought

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
with the doily border punch I thought

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.250 
with the doily border punch I thought
the<00:04:13.130> flowers<00:04:13.580> added<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:14.000> nice<00:04:14.210> feminine<00:04:14.750> touch

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
the flowers added a nice feminine touch

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.890 
the flowers added a nice feminine touch
to<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.590> Mother's<00:04:15.950> Day<00:04:15.980> layout<00:04:16.820> just<00:04:17.690> going<00:04:17.840> to

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
to a Mother's Day layout just going to

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.990 
to a Mother's Day layout just going to
punch<00:04:18.140> up<00:04:18.290> our<00:04:18.500> pop<00:04:18.859> out<00:04:19.040> those<00:04:19.280> flowers<00:04:19.730> there

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
punch up our pop out those flowers there

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.420 
punch up our pop out those flowers there
and<00:04:20.239> then<00:04:21.170> I<00:04:21.200> thought<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.680> would<00:04:21.770> really<00:04:22.310> be

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
and then I thought it would really be

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.100 
and then I thought it would really be
fun<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:22.940> play<00:04:23.120> with<00:04:23.300> some<00:04:23.510> of<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.720> new<00:04:23.870> quick
