00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
alignment options and I wanna make sure

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.319 
alignment options and I wanna make sure
these<00:01:49.829> things<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> same<00:01:50.610> height<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.240> I'll

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
these things are the same height so I'll

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.870 
these things are the same height so I'll
do<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> match<00:01:51.810> size<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:53.040> now<00:01:53.430> they're<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> same

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
do a match size so now they're the same

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.980 
do a match size so now they're the same
height

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
height

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.130

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
log shape action going on and then I

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.499 
log shape action going on and then I
will<00:02:08.830> use<00:02:09.039> a<00:02:09.130> pencil<00:02:09.429> tool<00:02:09.789> I<00:02:10.060> still<00:02:10.300> have<00:02:10.479> a

little bit of animation keep in mind I'm

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.680 
little bit of animation keep in mind I'm
still<00:04:23.150> inside<00:04:23.450> of<00:04:23.750> my<00:04:23.900> campfire<00:04:25.480> movie<00:04:26.480> clip

symbol<00:04:27.010> so<00:04:28.010> I'm<00:04:28.160> gonna<00:04:28.310> go<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.460> my<00:04:28.520> flames<00:04:28.940> and

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
symbol so I'm gonna go to my flames and

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.780 
symbol so I'm gonna go to my flames and
let<00:04:30.170> me<00:04:30.230> go<00:04:30.320> ahead<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.530> lock<00:04:30.650> down<00:04:30.710> my<00:04:31.190> logs

let me go ahead and lock down my logs

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.850 
let me go ahead and lock down my logs
layers<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.600> just<00:04:33.290> want<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.470> kind<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.680> mess<00:04:33.830> with

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
layers I just want to kind of mess with

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.290 
layers I just want to kind of mess with
these<00:04:34.100> flames<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.550> little<00:04:34.580> bit<00:04:34.880> I'm<00:04:35.000> gonna<00:04:35.120> do<00:04:35.270> a

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
these flames a little bit I'm gonna do a

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.010 
these flames a little bit I'm gonna do a
really<00:04:35.570> simple<00:04:35.990> frame<00:04:36.650> by<00:04:36.830> frame<00:04:36.860> animation

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
really simple frame by frame animation

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.480 
really simple frame by frame animation
so<00:04:39.020> I'll<00:04:39.560> just<00:04:39.740> jump<00:04:40.610> over<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:40.970> frame<00:04:41.180> five<00:04:41.480> and

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
so I'll just jump over to frame five and

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.160 
so I'll just jump over to frame five and
in<00:04:43.490> fact<00:04:43.700> before<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.120> do<00:04:44.210> that<00:04:44.330> let<00:04:44.900> me<00:04:44.930> jump

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
in fact before I do that let me jump

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.000 
in fact before I do that let me jump
over<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.590> frame<00:04:45.920> 25<00:04:46.910> for<00:04:47.570> my<00:04:47.720> logs<00:04:47.990> layer<00:04:48.320> and

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
over to frame 25 for my logs layer and

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.670 
over to frame 25 for my logs layer and
I'm<00:04:49.130> gonna<00:04:49.220> go<00:04:49.370> and<00:04:49.550> press<00:04:49.700> f5<00:04:50.150> frame<00:04:50.960> 25<00:04:51.440> for

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
I'm gonna go and press f5 frame 25 for

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.230 
I'm gonna go and press f5 frame 25 for
my<00:04:51.800> logs<00:04:52.040> back<00:04:52.310> layer<00:04:52.540> press<00:04:53.540> f5<00:04:55.150> extend<00:04:56.150> those

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
my logs back layer press f5 extend those

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.510 
my logs back layer press f5 extend those
out<00:04:56.450> then<00:04:56.900> I<00:04:56.930> go<00:04:57.110> to<00:04:57.170> frame<00:04:57.380> 5<00:04:57.710> for<00:04:58.040> my<00:04:58.130> flames

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
out then I go to frame 5 for my flames

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.110 
out then I go to frame 5 for my flames
layer<00:04:58.820> I'm<00:04:59.480> gonna<00:04:59.660> do<00:04:59.750> an<00:04:59.870> f6<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:01.850> insert<00:05:02.090> a

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
layer I'm gonna do an f6 to insert a

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.850 
layer I'm gonna do an f6 to insert a
keyframe<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:03.140> then<00:05:03.410> basically<00:05:03.710> I'm<00:05:03.830> just

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
keyframe and then basically I'm just

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.260 
keyframe and then basically I'm just
gonna<00:05:04.040> mess<00:05:04.310> around<00:05:04.340> with<00:05:04.670> these<00:05:04.730> flames<00:05:05.090> a

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
gonna mess around with these flames a

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.780 
gonna mess around with these flames a
little<00:05:05.300> bit<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:06.290> have<00:05:06.770> my<00:05:06.890> transform<00:05:07.340> tool<00:05:07.430> on

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
little bit I have my transform tool on

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.280 
little bit I have my transform tool on
let<00:05:07.940> me<00:05:07.970> go<00:05:08.090> into<00:05:08.300> a<00:05:08.330> modify<00:05:10.930> transform<00:05:11.930> I'm

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
let me go into a modify transform I'm

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.720 
let me go into a modify transform I'm
gonna<00:05:12.440> do<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.560> flip<00:05:12.860> horizontal<00:05:13.430> just<00:05:13.550> kind<00:05:13.700> of

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
gonna do a flip horizontal just kind of

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.200 
gonna do a flip horizontal just kind of
flip<00:05:14.270> them<00:05:14.390> around<00:05:14.450> that<00:05:14.660> way<00:05:14.960> go<00:05:15.470> to<00:05:15.530> frame<00:05:15.710> 10

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
flip them around that way go to frame 10

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.630 
flip them around that way go to frame 10
press<00:05:17.210> f6<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:18.050> let<00:05:18.650> me<00:05:18.710> just<00:05:18.740> kind<00:05:19.070> of<00:05:19.100> skew

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
press f6 and let me just kind of skew

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.010 
press f6 and let me just kind of skew
them<00:05:19.790> a<00:05:19.820> little<00:05:20.060> bit<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.570> I<00:05:20.630> have<00:05:20.720> to<00:05:20.840> move<00:05:20.960> my

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
them a little bit and I have to move my

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.510 
them a little bit and I have to move my
flames<00:05:21.500> up<00:05:21.710> so<00:05:21.830> they're<00:05:21.950> not<00:05:22.040> sticking<00:05:22.340> out

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
flames up so they're not sticking out

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.690 
flames up so they're not sticking out
from<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.880> log<00:05:23.090> there<00:05:23.360> go<00:05:24.110> to<00:05:24.170> frame<00:05:24.350> 15<00:05:24.800> f6<00:05:25.370> and

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
from the log there go to frame 15 f6 and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.990 
from the log there go to frame 15 f6 and
I'll<00:05:26.240> see<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:26.900> it<00:05:27.050> down<00:05:27.230> that<00:05:27.500> way<00:05:27.760> move<00:05:28.760> it<00:05:28.880> on

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
I'll see you it down that way move it on

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.749 
I'll see you it down that way move it on
up<00:05:29.380> frame<00:05:30.380> 20<00:05:30.770> f6<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.790> let's<00:05:32.210> see<00:05:32.390> let<00:05:32.630> me<00:05:32.660> uh

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
up frame 20 f6 and let's see let me uh

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.809 
up frame 20 f6 and let's see let me uh
make<00:05:33.939> it<00:05:34.059> a<00:05:34.089> little<00:05:34.419> bit<00:05:34.599> more<00:05:34.749> narrow<00:05:35.020> looking

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
make it a little bit more narrow looking

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:41.670 
make it a little bit more narrow looking
and<00:05:36.819> skew<00:05:37.689> it<00:05:37.809> up<00:05:37.930> and<00:05:38.199> frame<00:05:39.189> 25<00:05:39.699> f6<00:05:40.509> and<00:05:40.809> this

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
and skew it up and frame 25 f6 and this

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.239 
and skew it up and frame 25 f6 and this
one<00:05:41.889> all

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:42.249 
one all

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:44.429 
one all
maybe<00:05:42.669> I'll<00:05:42.729> just<00:05:42.879> rotate<00:05:43.449> it<00:05:43.809> just<00:05:43.839> a<00:05:44.199> bit

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:44.439 
maybe I'll just rotate it just a bit

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.429 
maybe I'll just rotate it just a bit
make<00:05:45.400> it<00:05:45.430> a<00:05:45.520> little<00:05:45.550> bit<00:05:45.789> shorter<00:05:46.289> and<00:05:47.289> there

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
make it a little bit shorter and there

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.909 
make it a little bit shorter and there
we<00:05:47.589> go

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
we go

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.769 
we go
so<00:05:48.279> basically<00:05:48.580> I've<00:05:48.759> created<00:05:48.939> a<00:05:49.240> frame<00:05:49.629> by

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
so basically I've created a frame by

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.299 
so basically I've created a frame by
frame<00:05:49.809> animation<00:05:50.229> so<00:05:50.650> if<00:05:50.740> I<00:05:50.800> press<00:05:51.039> my<00:05:51.069> Enter

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:51.309 
frame animation so if I press my Enter

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.790 
frame animation so if I press my Enter
key<00:05:51.490> to<00:05:52.029> look<00:05:52.180> at<00:05:52.270> my<00:05:52.330> life<00:05:52.779> my<00:05:53.319> fire<00:05:53.559> is<00:05:53.770> just

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
key to look at my life my fire is just

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.290 
key to look at my life my fire is just
kind<00:05:54.069> of<00:05:54.099> flickering<00:05:54.550> around<00:05:54.759> a<00:05:55.029> little<00:05:55.120> bit

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
kind of flickering around a little bit

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.110 
kind of flickering around a little bit
there<00:05:55.509> but<00:05:56.189> this<00:05:57.189> is<00:05:57.370> my<00:05:57.550> movie<00:05:57.879> clip

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
there but this is my movie clip

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.399 
there but this is my movie clip
animation<00:05:58.719> it's<00:05:58.870> made<00:05:59.020> up<00:05:59.110> of<00:05:59.229> multiple

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
animation it's made up of multiple
