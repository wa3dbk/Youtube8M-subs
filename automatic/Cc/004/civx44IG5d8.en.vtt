00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
any side mark in general I think for a

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.089 
any side mark in general I think for a
fast<00:00:12.210> bowler<00:00:12.480> if<00:00:13.019> you're<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> fast<00:00:13.559> ball<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.860> if

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
fast bowler if you're a fast ball and if

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.519 
fast bowler if you're a fast ball and if
you<00:00:14.190> have<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> swing<00:00:14.790> that's<00:00:15.030> extra<00:00:15.570> that's

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
you have the swing that's extra that's

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.640 
you have the swing that's extra that's
plus<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.520> if<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:18.000> are<00:00:18.150> swing<00:00:18.600> bowler<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.410> can

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
plus but if you are swing bowler you can

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.529 
plus but if you are swing bowler you can
get<00:00:19.830> wickets<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.279> any<00:00:20.520> sort<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.880> track<00:00:21.150> against

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
confidence he's tried to bold quick but

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.750 
confidence he's tried to bold quick but
