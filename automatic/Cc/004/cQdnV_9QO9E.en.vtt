00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
basically the first kill I kind of like

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.990 
basically the first kill I kind of like
aimed<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.219> then<00:00:11.309> aimed<00:00:11.580> out<00:00:11.790> real<00:00:11.969> fast

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
aimed in and then aimed out real fast

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.999 
aimed in and then aimed out real fast
because<00:00:12.690> right<00:00:13.139> then<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.500> there<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.710> made<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
because right then and there I made a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.470 
because right then and there I made a
decision<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.700> wanted<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.030> go<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
decision that I wanted to go for the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.019 
decision that I wanted to go for the
hipfire<00:00:15.690> only<00:00:16.170> Moab<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.670> obviously<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
hipfire only Moab and obviously it's a

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.490 
hipfire only Moab and obviously it's a
little<00:00:18.390> bit<00:00:18.510> easier<00:00:18.690> when<00:00:19.020> you're<00:00:19.109> using<00:00:19.289> a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
little bit easier when you're using a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.470 
little bit easier when you're using a
gun<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.980> PP<00:00:20.279> 90<00:00:20.670> with<00:00:20.820> steady<00:00:21.119> aim<00:00:21.300> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
gun like the PP 90 with steady aim and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.060 
gun like the PP 90 with steady aim and
everything<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.230> did<00:00:22.470> want<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> change<00:00:22.949> it

fastest i think it was like 225 miles
per<00:01:02.910> hour<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> little

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
per hour now it's just like a little

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500 
per hour now it's just like a little
cards<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.860> five<00:01:05.309> inches<00:01:05.519> long<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.119> something

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
cards like five inches long or something

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.420
