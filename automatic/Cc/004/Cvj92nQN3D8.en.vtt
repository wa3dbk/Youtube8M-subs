monitoring<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.639> video<00:00:11.910> i'm<00:00:12.059> going<00:00:12.179> to

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
monitoring in this video i'm going to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.450 
monitoring in this video i'm going to
show<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.420> guys<00:00:12.630> how<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.960> avoid<00:00:13.380> latency<00:00:13.920> when

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
show you guys how to avoid latency when

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.039 
show you guys how to avoid latency when
it<00:00:14.549> comes<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.820> recording<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.509> an<00:00:15.630> instrument

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
it comes to recording with an instrument

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.630 
it comes to recording with an instrument
or<00:00:16.139> microphone<00:00:16.830> alright

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
or microphone alright

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.679 
or microphone alright
so<00:00:18.600> my<00:00:19.080> FL<00:00:19.920> has<00:00:20.130> been<00:00:20.460> set<00:00:20.820> up<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.119> simulate<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
so my FL has been set up to simulate a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.779 
so my FL has been set up to simulate a
really<00:00:21.990> big<00:00:22.140> project<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.010> go<00:00:23.160> into<00:00:23.369> my

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
really big project if I go into my

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.000 
really big project if I go into my
buffer<00:00:24.060> settings<00:00:24.510> options<00:00:25.170> audio<00:00:25.650> settings

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
buffer settings options audio settings

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.040 
buffer settings options audio settings
and<00:00:26.250> my<00:00:26.910> buffer<00:00:27.180> length<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> way<00:00:27.869> up

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
and my buffer length is all the way up

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.940 
and my buffer length is all the way up
to<00:00:28.289> its<00:00:28.410> max<00:00:29.960> 2048<00:00:30.960> samples<00:00:31.890> right<00:00:32.730> or<00:00:33.950> 47

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
to its max 2048 samples right or 47

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.639 
to its max 2048 samples right or 47
milliseconds<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.270> pretty<00:00:37.079> big<00:00:37.350> when

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
milliseconds and that's pretty big when

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.040 
milliseconds and that's pretty big when
it<00:00:37.739> comes<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.360> recording<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.750> you'll<00:00:39.870> hear

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
it comes to recording and you'll hear

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.319 
it comes to recording and you'll hear
you<00:00:40.350> know<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> big<00:00:40.710> slap<00:00:40.950> delay<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.120> very

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
you know a big slap delay and it's very

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.360 
you know a big slap delay and it's very
hard<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.930> timing<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.190> let<00:00:44.309> me

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
hard to get that timing right so let me

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
hard to get that timing right so let me
give<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.670> example<00:00:44.910> I'll<00:00:45.329> highlight<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:46.020> my

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
give you an example I'll highlight my my

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.459 
give you an example I'll highlight my my
first<00:00:47.039> track<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.020> then<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
first track here and then I'm going to

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.369 
first track here and then I'm going to
insert<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:50.660> microphone<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:51.899> using<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
insert my microphone that I'm using and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.990 
insert my microphone that I'm using and
what<00:00:52.739> you're<00:00:52.860> hearing<00:00:53.039> right<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.489> direct

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
monitoring so there's no delay between

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.450 
monitoring so there's no delay between
my<00:00:57.030> microphone<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.840> ears<00:00:58.170> okay<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:59.430> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
microphone you go to the master because

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440 
microphone you go to the master because
that's<00:01:28.380> where<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.650> being<00:01:28.829> sent<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that's where it's being sent to and you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.830 
that's where it's being sent to and you
take<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> off<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.979> we're<00:01:32.520> back<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.420> direct

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
take it off and we're back to direct

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.060 
take it off and we're back to direct
monitoring<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:36.000> go<00:01:36.119> ahead<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.479> your

monitoring now you can go ahead in your
your<00:01:38.070> sound<00:01:38.369> card<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.960> enable<00:01:39.960> those

your sound card and enable those
built-in<00:01:40.500> effects<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.130> reverb<00:01:41.369> compression

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
built-in effects like reverb compression

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.280 
built-in effects like reverb compression
delay<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> timing<00:01:44.130> right<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
delay if you have the timing right and

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.620 
delay if you have the timing right and
if<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:47.009> those<00:01:47.299> built-in<00:01:48.299> effects

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
if you don't have those built-in effects

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.899 
if you don't have those built-in effects
that's<00:01:48.960> unfortunate<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.520> kidding

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that's unfortunate for you just kidding

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.300 
that's unfortunate for you just kidding
but<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.320> FL<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.829> still<00:01:53.130> have

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
but you can go in FL and still have

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.030 
but you can go in FL and still have
those<00:01:53.460> effects<00:01:53.880> enabled<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.020> right<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.350> I'll

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
those effects enabled all right so I'll

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.550 
those effects enabled all right so I'll
highlight<00:01:56.250> my<00:01:56.670> track<00:01:56.939> I'll<00:01:57.240> bust<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.350> to
