 I am what I am that forgets 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.430
 on September 4 sony presented the sony 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.890
 xperia z 1 using the best of the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.520
 sony technology in photography image 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.880
 and audio in the camera of the xperia z 1 is 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.939
 of 20 7 megapixels with exmor rs sensor 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 1/2 point 3 inches with a lens 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.399
 spherical g of sony opening f 2.0 and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.720
 the image processing engine 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.750
 bionz for mobile 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.730
 the front camera is 2 megapixels and 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.860
 just like the rear camera is capable 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.820
 to record full HD quality video to 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.160
 1080p in the xperia z1 we will have 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.770
 autofocus and touch hdr mode 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.710
 for photography and video detection of 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.650
 faces and smiles sweep burst 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.989
 panoramic effects of knowledge of 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.110
 scenes quick start from the screen 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.390
 blocking image stabilization and 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.670
 video stabilization with the streak 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.770
 shot of sony while performing the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.840
 Video recording is possible 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.500
 photographs being of a quality of 2 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.500
 megapixels 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.300
 one of the novelties of the camera of the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 xperia z1 are the applications of the 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.380
 camera they relay to the modes that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.160
 we knew in previous models to these 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.300
 the superior automatic application 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.370
 select the optimal configuration 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.320
 under current conditions do not 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.420
 allowing the selection of the majority 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.270
 of options leaving it in the hands of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.640
 software in this mode the resolution 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.100
 maximum will be 8 megapixels since the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.780
 hdr mode and the selection of scenes only 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.240
 They can be used when we select 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.270
 this resolution or a lower 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.979
 with the manual application the resolution to 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.159
 four thirds will reach 20 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.950
 megapixels in mode 16 ninth will be 8 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.360
 megapixels here we can adjust all 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.200
 and each of the options from which 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.200
 you have the phone 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.799
 one day 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.370
 for him 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.370
 i 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.010
 the image effects applications and 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.239
 Panoramic sweeping replaced the mode 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.459
 effects and sweep mode 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.480
 respectively the options are 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.620
 quite similar to those 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.209
 We found in the xperia z 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.209
 what a chabÃ¡n 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.150
 I'm a little 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.500
 does not vary 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.500
 what a man 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.590
 in the application time shift burst 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.540
 capture 61 images in 2 seconds and we 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.610
 will allow to select the image that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.080
 better has been according to your criteria or 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.080
 simply save them all 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.860
 the effect application adds effects of 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.420
 augmented reality based on the image 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.140
 that is being captured 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.700
 configure the elements shown 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.700
 so take 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.200
 and 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.200
 although I slept 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.909
 place 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.909
 and me 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.880
 in this expo 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.880
 yes 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.090
 to me 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.090
 efe 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.099
 do not go 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.270
 the ninth 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.830
 the info application and will recognize that 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.090
 that we capture with the xperia camera 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.880
 z1 providing information 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.010
 related to the instant when supporting 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.760
 qr codes will not be necessary any 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.760
 extra application 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.760
 the social live application will broadcast video 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.590
 live from our mobile to our 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.790
 facebook profile being possible 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.200
 receive comments from our 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.200
 Real-time contacts 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.570
 or 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.529
 many 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.850
 in fact the application wikitude places 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.360
 will show places of interest to our 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.350
 around 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.350
 using augmented reality 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.900
 in this former country 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.630
 here 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.780
 make 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.850
 the motion graf application by xperia 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.320
 integrates the functionality of the 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.420
 motorcycle independent application on graph 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.700
 for android this application will allow 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.580
 create animated gifs inside an image 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.210
 static 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.210
 from jong

 for him 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.270
 in me 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.100

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.539
 This is me because I'm a little sleep 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.539
