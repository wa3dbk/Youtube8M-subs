00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello again regretted the delay but 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.080
 I've been a bit busy with the start 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.570
 of the good school today's video is a 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.450
 cream until I invented it myself so 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.639
 the sdr itself is completely false 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.830
 CREEPYPASTA woking there pokemon 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.109
 a lot of creepy pastas and the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.210
 most are pretty good but the one 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.250
 Today I bring you something like a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.289
 explanation and unification of some 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.210
 stories of the greatest legends like 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 sacred water nica and opal kia de 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.140
 alga and jira tina good let's stop 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.270
 silly stuff 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.340
 before I start I just want to do 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 mention to something many we have 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.110
 asked the reason why the ceus 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.480
 I think humans after all the ceus 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.550
 is a pokémon the creator of everything because 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.739
 being a Pokémon would create beings like 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.540
 humans in order that you will dominate in the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.360
 pokemon species so that it does not 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.310
 are they I believe the humans so that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.560
 they lived with the pokemon as 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.530
 friends just like the teacher did 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.390
 legendary network he believes my pasta what 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.560
 I'll call ceus and the jewel of life 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.740
 plagiarism where x of what ok not what 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.680
 I'll call network or a legend a savior 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.700
 where I am because I am in this 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 Maybe I was betrayed if I went 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.509
 betrayed that person in whom 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.030
 trust that person to whom you 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.369
 I handed my power betrayed me now 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.189
 I find here locked in this prison 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.409
 everything is dark I was a fool to trust 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.350
 in humans I should never have created them 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.299
 because because I was so blind it's time to 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.490
 I wake up from my dream it's time that 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.500
 copper revenge destroy what you believe 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.380
 I will cleanse the evil that I myself 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.299
 origin at that time the body of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.250
 alceus began to shine and with the little 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.200
 energy that was left gave rise to two 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.220
 pokemon which would take care of 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.319
 Destroy the world 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.310
 in fact he talked about that pokemon that 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.140
 raised the earth 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.140
 grau don and the pokemon that extended the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.119
 oceans fell greg to the ceus wise that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.920
 these two pokemon could destroy the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.530
 world and thereby do away with humans 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.810
 during the long sleep of the maples 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.729
 things had changed that king a lot 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.950
 who had betrayed him had died 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.200
 long ago those lands that 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.269
 he wanted to destroy they had disappeared 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.610
 because of the seas during this 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.830
 time a young man started his adventure in 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.860
 small singing village spoke of the future 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.750
 league champion pokemon little network 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.550
 after red had won the league 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.860
 pokemon and defeated the organization 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.960
 of the rocket team was when he woke up 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.180
 ceus and created this pokemon like all 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.730
 you know network was in many parts of the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.740
 world traveling and training for after 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.380
 go to the silver mount and spend the rest of 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.810
 his days training in that place network in 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.730
 one of his trips happened through the region of 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.020
 young and saw grau don already callobre in his 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.150
 combat to see them 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.520
 network felt sorry for them since 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.670
 I knew that if that continued, both would be 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.830
 destroyed not only that would destroy the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.140
 world so network decided to stop them 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.510
 even though I knew how destructive 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.459
 They could be ceus when they saw the cigar 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.590
 heart of reid in trying to stop the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.540
 fight not only for the sake of humans 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.150
 but also for the pokemon 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.070
 alceus decided to believe again handed his 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.660
 confidence that the young coach of 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.390
 Pallet Town 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.120
 perhaps that human thinks to face 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.600
 those pokemon does he plan to stop them 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.700
 because because he is so determined I thought 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.070
 that humans did not deserve to live but 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.150
 this young man is different from them 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.430
 I made a mistake 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.820
 perhaps I should not have tried to destroy the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.250
 humans to the ceus with the little energy that 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.110
 had originated a new species the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.300
 which would help the network stop the fight 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.220
 between grau done and dropped greg it's about 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.770
 rail guasa which came down from heaven 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.900
 to stop the fight at that moment the 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.820
 last pokemon of the young teacher fell to 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.740
 defeated floor those pokemon 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.230
 they defeated the network pokemon one after 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.120
 another by the power of his attacks not only 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.700
 they weakened them took the life of 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.040
 network equipment when there was nothing left 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.140
 to do was defending something similar to 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.060
 a meteorite from the atmosphere it 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.920
 I was trying to rail, which was 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.230
 would endeavor to stop the battle between 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.270
 these two network pokemon saw as the iguana 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.850
 ended with grau done and made it fall to 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.690
 ground shortly after it fell greg suffered the 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.060
 same destiny 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.280
 with both pokemon defeated the world 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.020
 I was saved but red I still knew that 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.470
 his days as a coach had 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.870
 finished 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.970
 oh that's what he thought king quasar 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.570
 disappeared in the sky but the same 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.300
 place descended to your human zeus which 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.040
 are your ideals because you fought you knew the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.290
 power of those pokemon but without 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.090
 matter to them you made them face never 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.360
 I had seen that determination in a 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.400
 human for you that are the pokemon the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.620
 pokemon are our friends many 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.320
 people see them as tools or 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.750
 as objects but not so the pokemon 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.240
 our partners are our allies 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.980
 they are always by our side that 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.170
 is the reason why he fought for 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.260
 achieve perfection with my loyal 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.180
 comrades but now they to the ceus 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.340
 watching the dead network equipment and the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.500
 young boy in front of saying this 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.420
 he was convinced of the boy's worth 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.000
 so he decided to bring it back to the 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.590
 life to the fallen pokemon of the boy you 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.930
 have you proven your worth have you demonstrated 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.120
 that humans deserve another chance 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.139
 trust you as I did in that 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.349
 then saying this to ceus disappeared 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.419
 good guys I'm cold xd I'll continue 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.639
 this later since I only talk about the 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.680
 legends of young but this goes beyond 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.659
 this also explains about the 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.879
 legends of sign and how to see influenced 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:37.650
 in other important things with the world 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.650
 pokemon until next time
