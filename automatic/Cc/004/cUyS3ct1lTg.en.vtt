00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.449 
like it I had to get it because I feel
like<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.209> was<00:02:29.450> my<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.380> my<00:02:30.470> name<00:02:30.650> on<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.040> so

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
like it was my and my name on it so

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.190 
like it was my and my name on it so
there's<00:02:31.670> not<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:31.910> hundred<00:02:32.239> percent<00:02:32.360> virgin

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
there's not a hundred percent virgin

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.170 
there's not a hundred percent virgin
basically<00:02:33.650> because<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.130> had<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.520> chemical

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
basically because it had a chemical

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.000 
basically because it had a chemical
process<00:02:35.330> those<00:02:35.750> who<00:02:35.959> are<00:02:36.050> already<00:02:36.260> which<00:02:36.980> is

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
process those who are already which is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.620 
process those who are already which is
fine<00:02:37.370> because<00:02:37.580> that's<00:02:37.790> one<00:02:38.180> less<00:02:38.360> thing<00:02:38.390> that

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
fine because that's one less thing that

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.690 
fine because that's one less thing that
I<00:02:38.840> have<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.910> also<00:02:41.570> have<00:02:42.050> this<00:02:42.459> 20<00:02:43.459> I

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
I have to do so I also have this 20 I

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.740 
I have to do so I also have this 20 I
believe<00:02:43.940> 22<00:02:44.840> 22<00:02:45.020> inch<00:02:45.620> bundle<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.239> wavy

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
believe 22 22 inch bundle this is a wavy

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.240 
believe 22 22 inch bundle this is a wavy
of<00:02:47.870> course<00:02:48.140> once<00:02:48.410> Australian<00:02:48.860> not<00:02:48.980> sure<00:02:49.130> to

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
of course once Australian not sure to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.840 
of course once Australian not sure to
see<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.459> true<00:02:49.640> lift<00:02:49.880> now<00:02:50.299> it's<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.660> bit<00:02:50.900> darker

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
see the true lift now it's a bit darker

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.539 
see the true lift now it's a bit darker
but<00:02:52.850> I'm<00:02:53.060> assuming<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.959> what<00:02:54.739> color<00:02:55.010> that

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
but I'm assuming this is what color that

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.370 
but I'm assuming this is what color that
brown<00:02:55.850> hair<00:02:56.150> was<00:02:56.330> before<00:02:57.070> they<00:02:58.070> lifted<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.640> up

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
brown hair was before they lifted it up

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.060 
brown hair was before they lifted it up
so<00:03:01.000> no<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.269> do<00:03:02.720> like<00:03:02.989> working<00:03:03.260> out<00:03:03.380> like<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.769> I
