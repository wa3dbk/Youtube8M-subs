from it astonishing as as per usual and

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.480 
from it astonishing as as per usual and
there<00:02:42.410> stands<00:02:42.650> two<00:02:42.860> times<00:02:43.040> more<00:02:43.130> powerful

bass almost as if it were a role photo
file<00:04:10.090> that<00:04:11.090> would<00:04:11.330> be<00:04:11.510> good<00:04:11.660> because<00:04:11.750> they<00:04:11.959> can

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
file that would be good because they can

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.440 
file that would be good because they can
export<00:04:12.890> each<00:04:13.130> individual<00:04:13.670> frame<00:04:13.700> at<00:04:14.150> its<00:04:14.270> full

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
export each individual frame at its full

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.790 
export each individual frame at its full
resolution<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:15.200> you're<00:04:15.290> like<00:04:15.410> that's<00:04:15.590> as

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
resolution and you're like that's as

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.920 
resolution and you're like that's as
good<00:04:15.980> as<00:04:16.160> a<00:04:16.190> photo<00:04:16.820> from

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
good as a photo from

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.479 
good as a photo from
professional<00:04:18.410> /<00:04:18.470> ditional<00:04:18.739> camera<00:04:19.100> there<00:04:19.310> and

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
professional / ditional camera there and

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.949 
professional / ditional camera there and
you've<00:04:19.609> got<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.729> ability<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.209> crop<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.630> quite

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
you've got the ability to crop and quite

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.830 
you've got the ability to crop and quite
that<00:04:21.410> chunk<00:04:21.739> as<00:04:21.949> well<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.910> i<00:04:22.940> think<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.360> is<00:04:23.600> is

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
that chunk as well so i think that is is

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.870 
that chunk as well so i think that is is
a<00:04:23.900> great<00:04:24.590> benefit<00:04:24.889> and<00:04:25.070> then<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.430> have<00:04:25.669> that

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
a great benefit and then to have that

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.279 
a great benefit and then to have that
exactly<00:04:26.210> what<00:04:26.270> I'm<00:04:26.660> doing<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:26.990> I'm<00:04:27.080> obviously

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
exactly what I'm doing is I'm obviously

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.830 
exactly what I'm doing is I'm obviously
doing<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:27.650> at<00:04:27.830> 1080p<00:04:28.340> 30<00:04:29.090> frames<00:04:29.389> a<00:04:29.449> second

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
doing this at 1080p 30 frames a second

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.340 
doing this at 1080p 30 frames a second
and<00:04:29.990> with<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.500> hero<00:04:31.130> 3<00:04:31.580> plus<00:04:31.970> first<00:04:32.690> black<00:04:33.050> and

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
and with the hero 3 plus first black and

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.560 
and with the hero 3 plus first black and
you've<00:04:34.130> got<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.340> ability<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.820> it<00:04:34.940> takes<00:04:35.150> seven

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
you've got the ability so it takes seven

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.629 
you've got the ability so it takes seven
megapixels<00:04:36.259> still<00:04:36.590> images<00:04:37.009> every<00:04:37.400> five

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639

megapixels still images every five
seconds<00:04:38.090> at<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.300> same<00:04:38.509> time<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:39.139> I<00:04:39.949> need<00:04:40.550> to

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
seconds at the same time and I need to

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.150 
seconds at the same time and I need to
be<00:04:40.669> a<00:04:40.699> trick<00:04:40.910> for<00:04:41.000> in<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.150> second<00:04:41.509> I'm<00:04:41.860> but<00:04:42.860> not

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
be a trick for in a second I'm but not

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.340 
be a trick for in a second I'm but not
if<00:04:43.370> it's<00:04:43.520> in<00:04:43.639> protein<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:44.780> that's<00:04:44.990> really<00:04:45.169> like

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
if it's in protein so that's really like

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.340 
if it's in protein so that's really like
I<00:04:45.410> can't<00:04:45.919> have<00:04:46.400> that<00:04:46.639> power<00:04:46.970> of<00:04:47.210> editing<00:04:48.169> the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
I can't have that power of editing the

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.589 
I can't have that power of editing the
image<00:04:48.380> at<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:48.949> video<00:04:49.400> it<00:04:49.669> either<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.330> video

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599

or in the photo whatever you do at that

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.270 
or in the photo whatever you do at that
setting<00:04:52.789> so<00:04:52.910> that's<00:04:53.120> what<00:04:53.300> I'm<00:04:53.449> quite<00:04:53.660> keen<00:04:53.900> on

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
setting so that's what I'm quite keen on

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.490 
setting so that's what I'm quite keen on
doing<00:04:55.280> here<00:04:55.880> how<00:04:56.570> everyone<00:04:56.780> would<00:04:57.050> say<00:04:57.289> is

doing here how everyone would say is

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.350 
doing here how everyone would say is
that<00:04:57.770> for<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:57.949> majority<00:04:58.099> of<00:04:58.789> people<00:04:59.150> let's

probably will get a little bit better

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.250 
probably will get a little bit better
stuff<00:05:24.680> at<00:05:25.010> night<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.750> but<00:05:26.750> in<00:05:26.900> terms<00:05:27.110> of
