00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 tight control is introduced and at the border 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 customs officers seriously 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.010
 undermined their credibility and one thing 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.990
 when smugglers try to circle 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.660
 around the thumb of customs but when themselves 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.660
 inspectors helps the intruder this already 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.400
 beyond the edge and here 's another loud example 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.920
 exposure at the border with kyrgyzstan 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.260
 detained unclean employees 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.880
 customs cord and this turned on 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.130
 Transit operations have not 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.660
 authentic declaring is when 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.269
 instead of one product is indicated 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.619
 completely different damage to the state 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.870
 by estimate only 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.870
 passes for 600 million tenge 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.370
 but these are not the final numbers assel 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.469
 Nazirova went to the post and 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.180
 tried to figure out why some 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.180
 helpers take good 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.770
 at customs proud recently changed 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.930
 signs on the bosses offices however 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.690
 for such changes here have become accustomed 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.840
 This 3 serious personnel reshuffle 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.750
 in the last 15 months this time 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.460
 cause economic crimes by this 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.550
 engaged in customs officers 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.450
 i.e. customs officers 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.500
 posts that had an electronic key to 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.470
 registration is possible transit system 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.270
 for passing vehicles 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.300
 through granite you can border the republic 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.460
 canvas fraud scheme just inspectors 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.250
 turned a blind eye to a clear mismatch 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.619
 Real Cargo Declaration 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.690
 for a fee of course by others 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.520
 the operator's words indicated that for example 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.830
 carry small parts 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 and actually fury exploded 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.950
 cars 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.200
 exposed their own experts 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.720
 customs officers true 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.740
 pulling one thread they unraveled 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.950
 one more tangle 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.520
 serious crime we went out on 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.220
 what completeness can transit system 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.959
 committee operational control center 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.079
 customs control on the scheme 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.250
 presumably 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:18.160
 already transit and having studied it already on the route 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.490
 on through 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.740
 Our other posts are possible and made 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.660
 request of the border guard committee 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.830
 national security is easy to stay 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.580
 we realized that it happened the scheme already 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.820
 transit 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.020
 individual cars on these customs 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.410
 posts, that is, at the customs post 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.570
 ok well this is a man of cord and others 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.610
 in words of the same some kind of chemists also with 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.770
 documents were drawn up cargo as 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.050
 transit analogue which should have been 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.990
 go to the country's budget put in your pocket and 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.660
 such facts revealed over 130 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.390
 mole relatively new customs post 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.510
 he is not even a year old yet, but in such a short 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.380
 the term here were kinda ups and 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.630
 the fall 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.180
 last year lingered lingering large 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.940
 lot of drugs and just recently became 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.880
 it is known that the customs post passes by 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.150
 loud criminal case analyze us 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.159
 already 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.569
 why did the car happen 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.640
 delay as far as it was 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.799
 reasonably here only violators do not 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.799
 have taken into account the customs posts by the management as 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.329
 in the palm of the whole design system 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.489
 automated and any mismatch 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.129
 data can cause serious 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.530
 suspicions moreover work items 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.689
 the passes are transmitted online 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.969
 central office task new 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.400
 Kurdish bosses and take the team under 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:40.159
 tighten on control today 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.719
 those capacities and resources of this can 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.760
 delivery to cram formational 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.260
 the system allows you to expand daily 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.099
 effective control of everything here 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.139
 moves 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.209
 there seems to be some kind of weak 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.849
 control was this control to us 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.949
 tasked with the daily monitor and 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.280
 analyze the entire transport pass 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:57.280
 funds 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.810
 intelligent technology to help with 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.239
 using such scanner bags 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.939
 found weapons drugs and large 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.760
 amounts of money an individual come 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.699
 puts the bag in here and she gradually 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.519
 passes and we see what's inside and 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:18.799
 no need to consider opening it 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.780
 immediately detects and here the red is lit 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.110
 what if a suspicious item 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.060
 objects stop inspect 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.710
 additional and this giant technique 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.419
 ruined the lives of drug couriers 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.340
 inspection complex intercepted 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.250
 several large quantities of heroin 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.889
 last september lit up a hiding place 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.780
 in a truck about 200 kilograms 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.780
 opium hid in the roof of a wagon 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:49.480
 will not miss the smart car and counterfeit 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.360
 more comedy life science 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.370
 it turns out five years circle doubt 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.290
 customs can cause and weight of cargo 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.350
 sometimes an economic operator indicates 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.080
 in the declaration one figure she is hanging 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.470
 the device shows an excess parameter 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.480
 usually finish you 2 working if 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:13.670
 Overload is about the machine right immediately 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:16.160
 indicator is another popular 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.900
 violations inaccurate declaration 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.990
 on this lost cargo owner 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.000
 detained the other day customs beauty van 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.530
 under the document was supposed to transport 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.460
 Chinese goods and at inspection 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.560
 found serious discrepancies will be 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.150
 recalculation of goods by 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.120
 by quantity 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:39.410
 and display the amount of unpaid 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.870
 customs payments for unreliable 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:46.480
 declaring a worthwhile moment we think 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:52.630
 what is already clearly visible that the goods 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:55.460
 exceeds the allowable rate and i think 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.410
 Jordan will be prosecuted 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.590
 Imankulov has been dangling for seven years 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.120
 Kazakhstan to Kyrgyzstan and back 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.820
 businessman carries furniture 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.820
 the former other checkpoint he already 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.470
 rated says everything is much stricter 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:13.000
 check every comma in the official 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.550
 papers and severely fined for overloading 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.820
 Here, in principle, you take turns 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.360
 ok but it happens yes all cars are here 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.540
 twist 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.960
 in this after the meal that is, too, if from 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.480
 cargo traffic if big then 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:32.170
 accordingly, we have waited for two 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:35.280
 of the day goal but have it from the turn for now 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.570
 water is okay like a draft 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.850
 changes in the work felt the team 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.950
 customs control has increased in all 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.590
 directions two special workers 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.620
 groups follow the process and check all 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.270
 the facts are all persons who are now within 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.010
 criminal cases will be brought to 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.630
 hungry 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:56.740
 will be punished besides 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.210
 work continues on those possible 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.010
 offenses and offenses 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.200
 who may see in the future 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.240
 This work is carried out last year in 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.880
 economic smuggling were implicated 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.040
 11 more employees are waiting 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.980
 the end of the investigation are combined in 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.180
 abuse of office 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.060
 the investigation suspects that they had 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.430
 accomplices in the ranks of customs officers but this 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.650
 yet to prove one thing is clear already 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.430
 now will be judged to the fullest extent 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.290
 of the law
