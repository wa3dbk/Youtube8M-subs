00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.170
 in the subject of automatic transmission you have to 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:27.390
 be sure to mention a gearbox type 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.619
 and that's the dsg gear or too 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.920
 double clutch transmission dsg stands for 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.650
 Direct shift transmission it is so in 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.589
 farthest senses similar to how 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.680
 our manual gearbox that always 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.809
 gears are engaged and a 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.790
 torque can only be transmitted 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.559
 if both gears on the 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.780
 different waves turn firmly with 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.839
 these are connected 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:57.580
 the special is on dsg gearbox that 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:01:00.879
 always two courses at the same time inserted 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.949
 but are not yet switched on 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.379
 one wave is the one gear 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.200
 not rotatably connected to the shaft 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.240
 that against rad already and often for the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.790
 The next step is exactly the opposite 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.860
 and the special thing about this gear is 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.990
 now that's through two clutches 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.030
 friction couplings a bit different 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.680
 constructed as our membrane spring 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.930
 Coupling because they are hydraulic 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.210
 always drives a clutch 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.610
 opens and one closes and that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.900
 make synchronous so that the one gang 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.590
 is taken out and the other 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.990
 is inserted 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.810
 which here in turn is the theory itself 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.820
 quite easy to explain is in the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.000
 determining the gears for example a 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.219
 the most demanding tasks 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.259
 I'm here an animation and a 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.439
 You also find this animation as big 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.219
 pose in our channel just like that 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.640
 by the way 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:55.310
 she is one of the most clicked 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.289
 contributing in our channel row itself 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.969
 if someone has a sketch and 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.709
 say look that a dsg driven 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.950
 and tell me where it's going 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.289
 will be switched then I say stop 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.720
 I have to stop there for ten minutes 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.579
 immerse myself to see where it is 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.579
 Company's own large-scale output 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:17.989
 the switching operations are really 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:20.299
 without jerking myself I have such a gear 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.120
 for i think in one for four years 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:27.079
 drove tour and was thrilled 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.819
 and in the audi vw group is establishing itself 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.680
 this gear is getting more and more 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.510
 compared to normal conventional 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.910
 automatically driven and others 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.269
 manufacturers have long since followed suit 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.359
 So this gear has been great 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.130
 advantages that make driving even more enjoyable 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.200
 do 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.709
 that's a disadvantage, anyway 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.989
 was also felt that within 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.170
 of the rescue service I agree 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.269
 remember that after 40,000 kilometers 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.030
 gear had to be exchanged 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.260
 other automatic transmissions, too 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.160
 maybe it happens in the rhythm 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.840
 but it was pretty expensive here 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.700
 and I asked, I think it came like that 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.930
 around 200 euro rum I asked why 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.599
 that is actually so expensive 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.250
 ok answer was the gear oil itself 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.040
 faithful whatever you underneath 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.720
 but understand the change is just 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.510
 do not just leave it off and new 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.829
 fill up but there must be the tester 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.880
 be connected and one 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.829
 certain rhythm the 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.250
 be received operating temperature must 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.989
 and and and so no such actions 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.970
 which can be done in five minutes but 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.250
 it already demanding and that costs 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.919
 I have to pay money for myself though 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.989
 say at this dsg gear have the 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.989
 benefits were clearly outweighed
