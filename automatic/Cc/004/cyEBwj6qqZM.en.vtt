00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
never straightens at all so you got to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.229 
never straightens at all so you got to
straighten<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> little<00:00:50.460> bit<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.969> hit<00:00:51.120> out

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
straighten it a little bit to hit out

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.209 
straighten it a little bit to hit out
through<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> ball<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.649> maybe<00:00:52.920> try

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
through the ball that's it and maybe try

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
through the ball that's it and maybe try
to<00:00:53.280> come<00:00:53.520> look<00:00:53.789> see<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> angle<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> racket

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to come look see the angle of the racket

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
to come look see the angle of the racket
like<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> angle<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> racket<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
like this and the angle the racket is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.630 
like this and the angle the racket is
still<00:00:57.570> he's<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.530> rotating<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.219> much<00:00:59.430> so

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
still he's not rotating very much so

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.860 
still he's not rotating very much so
it's<00:00:59.760> not<00:00:59.879> look<00:01:00.210> see<00:01:00.390> how<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.570> comes<00:01:00.690> across

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it's not look see how it comes across

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.380 
it's not look see how it comes across
you<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:01.980> happens<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.730> it's

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you see what happens here is that it's

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
you see what happens here is that it's
like<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.870> wrist<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.500> being<00:01:04.739> pulled<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.100> way

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
like the wrist is being pulled this way

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.890 
like the wrist is being pulled this way
so<00:01:05.760> you're<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.000> getting<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> tremendous

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so you're not getting a tremendous

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.090 
so you're not getting a tremendous
amount<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> topspin<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.680> hit<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:07.920> ball

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
amount of topspin you hit this ball

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
amount of topspin you hit this ball
rather<00:01:08.340> well<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.909> still<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.900> release

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
rather well but still if you can release

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.859 
rather well but still if you can release
out<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.189> go<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.390> it'd<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.630> much

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
out and go up I think it'd be that much

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.530 
out and go up I think it'd be that much
better<00:01:13.049> however<00:01:13.680> let's<00:01:14.280> not<00:01:14.520> forget<00:01:14.909> very

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
better however let's not forget very

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.260 
better however let's not forget very
very<00:01:15.990> good<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> backswing<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.270> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
very good with the backswing and you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.240 
very good with the backswing and you
still<00:01:18.600> had<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> power<00:01:19.140> okay<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.130> at

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
still had the power okay going out at

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.520 
still had the power okay going out at
the<00:01:20.369> ball<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:21.270> we'll<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:22.020> we'll

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the ball what we'll do then is we'll

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.109 
the ball what we'll do then is we'll
take<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.460> hand<00:01:23.729> side<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
