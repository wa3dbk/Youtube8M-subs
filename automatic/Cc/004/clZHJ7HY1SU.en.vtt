there's<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.170> lot<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.939> similarities<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.179> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
there's a lot of similarities in a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.330 
there's a lot of similarities in a
football<00:00:31.260> football<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.830> only<00:00:31.980> thing<00:00:32.160> now

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
football football the only thing now

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.290 
football football the only thing now
that<00:00:32.520> I'm<00:00:32.610> trying<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> learn<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that I'm trying to learn is the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.180 
that I'm trying to learn is the
terminology<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.350> was<00:00:34.440> like<00:00:34.590> no

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
terminology you know I was like no

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.370 
terminology you know I was like no
speaking<00:00:35.579> another<00:00:35.730> whole<00:00:35.910> nother<00:00:36.120> language

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
speaking another whole nother language

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.600 
speaking another whole nother language
so<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.890> that's<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:38.250> trying<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.489> adjust

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
so and that's what I'm trying to adjust

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.130 
so and that's what I'm trying to adjust
to<00:00:38.850> where<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:44.360> it<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.480> enough<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> learn

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to where I know it was enough to learn

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.810 
to where I know it was enough to learn
how<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.500> take<00:00:46.940> that's<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> foreign<00:00:48.629> concept

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
how to take that's not a foreign concept

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.420 
how to take that's not a foreign concept
what's<00:00:50.820> been<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.149> biggest

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.910 

biggest<00:00:57.090> mechanical<00:00:57.630> adjustable<00:00:58.320> huh<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
biggest mechanical adjustable huh I

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.660 
biggest mechanical adjustable huh I
don't<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.910> mean<00:01:00.630> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.470> going<00:01:02.010> just

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
don't know I mean you know going just

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.240 
don't know I mean you know going just
going<00:01:02.880> through<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> different<00:01:03.150> mechanics<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
going through the different mechanics of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.950 
going through the different mechanics of
blood<00:01:05.250> nuances<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.910> place<00:01:06.120> just<00:01:06.690> little

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
blood nuances in place just little

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.180 
blood nuances in place just little
things<00:01:07.050> that<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.500> us<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.620> do<00:01:07.770> our

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
things that they want us to do our

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.440 
things that they want us to do our
coaches<00:01:08.550> have<00:01:08.580> different<00:01:09.060> things<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.330> they

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
coaches have different things that they

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.880 
coaches have different things that they
focus<00:01:09.810> on

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.100
