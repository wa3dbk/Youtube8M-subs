or hi YouTube today I'm just doing a
really<00:00:02.850> quick<00:00:03.090> review<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.840> new<00:00:04.049> lens<00:00:04.259> I<00:00:04.470> got

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
really quick review on a new lens I got

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.790 
really quick review on a new lens I got
for<00:00:05.339> my<00:00:05.609> DSLR<00:00:06.299> video<00:00:06.529> and<00:00:07.529> it's<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.929> 18<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.110> 135

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
for my DSLR video and it's the 18 to 135

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.629 
for my DSLR video and it's the 18 to 135
STM<00:00:11.639> lens<00:00:12.000> from<00:00:12.540> Canon<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:13.230> used<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
STM lens from Canon I used to have the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.109 
STM lens from Canon I used to have the
non<00:00:15.420> STM<00:00:16.020> version<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.710> lens<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.279> it's

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
non STM version of this lens and it's

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.640 
non STM version of this lens and it's
one<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> first<00:00:18.539> lenses<00:00:18.960> are<00:00:19.080> used<00:00:19.260> when<00:00:19.619> I

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
one of the first lenses are used when I

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.380 
one of the first lenses are used when I
got<00:00:19.830> an<00:00:19.920> idea<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.460> our<00:00:20.640> filmmaking<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
got an idea so our filmmaking and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.259 
got an idea so our filmmaking and
photography<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.640> was<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:24.000> was<00:00:24.150> an

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
photography a and it was it was an

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.720 
photography a and it was it was an
excellent<00:00:24.570> lens<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.859> had<00:00:26.189> no<00:00:26.340> problems

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
excellent lens and I had no problems

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.320 
excellent lens and I had no problems
with<00:00:26.820> it

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
with it

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.109 
with it
probably<00:00:27.900> not<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> sharpest<00:00:28.680> after<00:00:29.490> year<00:00:29.730> 70

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
probably not the sharpest after year 70

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.030 
probably not the sharpest after year 70
or<00:00:30.240> 200<00:00:30.660> planes<00:00:30.840> everything<00:00:31.590> else<00:00:31.679> just

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
or 200 planes everything else just

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.979 
or 200 planes everything else just
doesn't<00:00:32.790> seem<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.090> good<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.360> comparison<00:00:33.690> but

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
doesn't seem as good in comparison but

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.889 
doesn't seem as good in comparison but
and<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.520> always<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> good<00:00:36.000> lens<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
and it's always a good lens so the

look<00:01:01.109> at<00:01:01.469> some<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> physics<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.820> lens

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
look at some of the physics of this lens

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.789 
look at some of the physics of this lens
here<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.979> focal<00:01:05.700> ring<00:01:07.610> focal<00:01:08.610> ring

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
here we have the focal ring focal ring

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.000 
here we have the focal ring focal ring
which<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:11.130> your<00:01:11.670> spin<00:01:12.229> makes<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.439> lens<00:01:13.619> go

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
which as your spin makes the lens go

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.230 
which as your spin makes the lens go
from<00:01:14.280> 18<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> 135<00:01:15.799> look<00:01:16.799> at<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> motion<00:01:17.400> look

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
from 18 to 135 look at that motion look

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.289 
from 18 to 135 look at that motion look
at<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.700> front<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.119> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
at that and just in front of that you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.090 
at that and just in front of that you
have<00:01:21.479> your<00:01:21.659> very<00:01:21.840> nice<00:01:23.240> focus<00:01:24.240> ring<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
have your very nice focus ring so that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.249 
have your very nice focus ring so that
was<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> focal<00:01:28.130> or<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.430> zoom<00:01:29.700> ring<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
was the focal or the zoom ring and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.649 
was the focal or the zoom ring and
though<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> focus<00:01:32.189> ring<00:01:33.110> zoom<00:01:34.110> focus<00:01:35.659> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
though the focus ring zoom focus and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.039 
though the focus ring zoom focus and

when<00:04:31.730> I<00:04:31.760> first<00:04:31.940> got<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.360> turned<00:04:32.630> it<00:04:32.750> on<00:04:32.840> I

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
when I first got it and turned it on I

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.450 
when I first got it and turned it on I
thought<00:04:33.200> I<00:04:33.260> thought<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:33.920> didn't<00:04:34.100> work<00:04:34.250> I

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
thought I thought it didn't work I

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.160 
thought I thought it didn't work I
thought<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.670> was<00:04:34.760> broke<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.450> I<00:04:35.510> had<00:04:35.870> to<00:04:36.020> do

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
thought it was broke and I had to do

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.920 
thought it was broke and I had to do
tests<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:36.950> with<00:04:37.760> on<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.180> off<00:04:38.270> handheld<00:04:38.810> and

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
tests and with on and off handheld and

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.900 
tests and with on and off handheld and
then<00:04:39.020> watch<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.410> video<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.520> did<00:04:40.670> actually

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
then watch the video and it did actually

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.910 
then watch the video and it did actually
provide<00:04:41.570> stabilization<00:04:42.080> if<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.650> do<00:04:42.770> the

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
provide stabilization if I do the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.620 
provide stabilization if I do the
stabilization<00:04:43.580> it<00:04:43.700> more<00:04:43.910> or<00:04:44.030> less<00:04:44.060> completely

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630
