 defect that is uniform with colors 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:47.920
 related but that in the design 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:49.880
 basic let's see design number 4 it 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.420
 will have the village 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.420
 outward 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.550

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.690
 base let's create a red 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.690
 Characteristic of the goats 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.880
 what are we going to say here we have unemployed 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.270
 of that white and we will create the color 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.490
 a first line 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:23.540
 let's leave the value 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.870
 a little bit and 43 in the second line 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.110
 let's leave the value 5 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.140
 as going down 5 is fine in the third 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.630
 line let's leave the value 5 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.960
 equally 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.290
 the view 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.580
 the color of the base we return and 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.580
 as always 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.670
 we're going to eliminate color 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.210
 of or oil like to create that comes 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.810
 extended 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.810
 13 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.100
 there are those who make queues saying 4 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.310
 let's look for a different style of 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.239
 neck I do not like we do not like me 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.910
 I do not like the real manuel either, so I'm going 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.470
 to leave the number 6 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.530
 I'm really going to change that color 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.500
 white by default to a blue color 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.650
 ready that blue color or you are going to 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.390
 create with the stick 6 up 9 in the middle 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.690
 and 37 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.350
 and the last value 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.560
 It's in 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.500
 the shirt we will go to print for 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 remove from that Chilean flag that comes 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.489
 default 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.690
 because it does not correspond to the flag 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.490
 we are ready to go 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.840

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.510

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.510

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.580

 white they just created 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.380
