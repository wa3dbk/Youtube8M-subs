coloring<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.010> painting<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:48.510> makes<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
coloring on the painting that makes it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.569 
coloring on the painting that makes it
like<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.079> judging<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> painting

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
like I'm judging like a painting

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
like I'm judging like a painting
painting<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.420> chest<00:00:51.660> also<00:00:51.870> i<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.289> well

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
painting the chest also i think is well

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
painting the chest also i think is well
done<00:00:52.649> nice<00:00:53.070> bright<00:00:53.370> colors<00:00:53.760> nice<00:00:54.449> details

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
done nice bright colors nice details

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.029 
done nice bright colors nice details
there<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> chest<00:00:55.410> piece<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.829> all

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
there on the chest piece it's all

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.130 
there on the chest piece it's all
there's<00:00:56.940> no<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.149> couple<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> other<00:00:57.719> figures<00:00:58.109> i

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
there's no a couple of other figures i

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
there's no a couple of other figures i
think<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> feature<00:00:59.340> ones<00:00:59.670> don't<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
think like the feature ones don't have a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.939 
think like the feature ones don't have a
whole<00:01:00.629> dinosaur<00:01:01.079> design<00:01:01.320> fully<00:01:01.530> painted<00:01:01.710> in

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
whole dinosaur design fully painted in

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.290 
whole dinosaur design fully painted in
so<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.250> nice<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.850> painted<00:01:03.180> in

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
so it's nice to see all that painted in

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.969 
so it's nice to see all that painted in
got<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:03.989> i<00:01:04.140> painted<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.799> i'll

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
got a little i painted here i'll

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.350 
got a little i painted here i'll
probably<00:01:05.159> go<00:01:05.339> over<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.519> articulation<00:01:06.030> again

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
probably go over this articulation again

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.690 
probably go over this articulation again
but<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.630> does<00:01:07.049> lift<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
but this does lift up you have the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
but this does lift up you have the
differentiation<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> colors<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.200> from

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
differentiation and the colors here from

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.740 
differentiation and the colors here from
the<00:01:10.500> arms<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> chest<00:01:12.090> which<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> should<00:01:12.600> be

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the arms to the chest which it should be

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
the arms to the chest which it should be
and<00:01:12.990> there's<00:01:13.110> also<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.530> texture<00:01:13.890> details

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and there's also little texture details

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
and there's also little texture details
in<00:01:14.430> there<00:01:14.580> we've<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.540> built<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:16.020> which

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
in there we've got is built here which

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
in there we've got is built here which
you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.439> has<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:17.100> an<00:01:17.820> indentation

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you can see has like an indentation

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.770 
you can see has like an indentation
because<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> presses<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.610> feel<00:01:21.479> weird<00:01:21.659> saying

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
because it presses I feel weird saying

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.630 
because it presses I feel weird saying
oppressors<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.470> doing<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.520> then

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
oppressors and then doing that and then

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
oppressors and then doing that and then
his<00:01:23.759> legs<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.270> boring<00:01:24.570> red<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.710> pretty

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
his legs are just boring red but pretty

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.130 
his legs are just boring red but pretty
good<00:01:26.790> looking<00:01:27.030> detail<00:01:27.360> wise<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.720> think<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
good looking detail wise I think like I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.109 
good looking detail wise I think like I
said<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.009> pain<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.490> me<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:29.970> looks

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
said the pain for me I think looks

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
said the pain for me I think looks
pretty<00:01:30.329> good<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> backs<00:01:30.990> pretty<00:01:31.320> basic

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
pretty good on the backs pretty basic

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
pretty good on the backs pretty basic
and<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.430> no<00:01:32.520> on/off<00:01:32.700> switch<00:01:33.060> for

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and you have you no on/off switch for

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.469 
and you have you no on/off switch for
the<00:01:33.299> sounds<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.210> makes<00:01:36.390> an

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the sounds we can so you know makes an

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.380 
the sounds we can so you know makes an
activation<00:01:36.780> noise<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.700> but<00:01:38.700> yeah<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
activation noise we but yeah I think it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.170 
activation noise we but yeah I think it
looks<00:01:39.420> good<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.100> don't<00:01:41.400> have

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
pretty nice range of movement here

top of his legs which is pretty annoying

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.430 
top of his legs which is pretty annoying
just<00:02:16.190> because<00:02:16.430> his<00:02:16.550> legs<00:02:16.849> can't<00:02:17.180> bend<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:18.290> like

just because his legs can't bend so like

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.589 
just because his legs can't bend so like
if<00:02:18.620> his<00:02:18.860> knees<00:02:19.159> could<00:02:19.489> bend<00:02:19.819> he<00:02:20.299> could<00:02:20.480> be<00:02:20.569> a

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
if his knees could bend he could be a

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.059 
if his knees could bend he could be a
really<00:02:20.810> cool<00:02:21.110> articulated<00:02:21.650> figure<00:02:21.860> but<00:02:22.010> at

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
really cool articulated figure but at

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.789 
really cool articulated figure but at
the<00:02:22.220> stands<00:02:22.489> he<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.909> be<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:23.150> hey<00:02:23.799> I

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
the stands he can just be like hey I

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.070 
the stands he can just be like hey I
don't<00:02:25.159> know<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.519> that's<00:02:25.730> just<00:02:25.849> weird<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.750> can

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
don't know so that's just weird I can

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.750 
don't know so that's just weird I can
swivel<00:02:27.260> here<00:02:27.500> as<00:02:27.590> well<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:28.430> can<00:02:28.549> move<00:02:28.640> his

swivel here as well you can move his
head<00:02:28.849> around<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.480> pretty<00:02:29.959> basic<00:02:30.349> um<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.099> believe

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
head around so pretty basic um I believe

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.729 
head around so pretty basic um I believe
I<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:32.180> probably<00:02:32.660> I've<00:02:33.049> rested<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
I I probably I've rested this in the

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.259 
I I probably I've rested this in the
Nutcracker<00:02:33.920> reviews<00:02:34.430> too<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:34.940> think<00:02:35.150> I've

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
Nutcracker reviews too but I think I've

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.839 
Nutcracker reviews too but I think I've
said<00:02:35.450> said<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.519> reviews<00:02:37.519> for<00:02:37.640> like<00:02:37.730> the

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
said said it in the reviews for like the

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.610 
said said it in the reviews for like the
mega<00:02:38.030> force<00:02:38.269> or<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.720> super<00:02:38.989> Megaforce<00:02:39.379> ones

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
mega force or the super Megaforce ones

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.650 
mega force or the super Megaforce ones
and<00:02:39.799> what<00:02:39.920> not<00:02:40.099> is<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:40.579> these<00:02:41.060> can<00:02:41.299> be<00:02:41.420> really

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
and what not is that these can be really

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.729 
and what not is that these can be really
awesome<00:02:41.810> if<00:02:42.110> they<00:02:42.230> were<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.500> little<00:02:42.650> more

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
awesome if they were just a little more

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.649 
awesome if they were just a little more
articulated<00:02:43.220> like<00:02:43.489> all<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.879> have<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.269> do<00:02:44.450> is

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
articulated like all you have to do is

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.750 
articulated like all you have to do is
make<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.110> elbows<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.829> knees<00:02:46.099> bendable

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
make the elbows and the knees bendable

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.449 
make the elbows and the knees bendable
and<00:02:46.879> they<00:02:47.480> could<00:02:47.660> be<00:02:47.810> even<00:02:48.049> cooler<00:02:48.459> because

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
you can get some cool sort of martial

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.990 
you can get some cool sort of martial
arts<00:03:12.170> opposed<00:03:12.560> but<00:03:12.890> like<00:03:13.459> right<00:03:13.640> now<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:13.970> just

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
arts opposed but like right now it just

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.729 
arts opposed but like right now it just
seems<00:03:14.209> awkward<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:14.930> hate<00:03:15.290> when<00:03:15.560> they're

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
seems awkward and I hate when they're

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.500 
seems awkward and I hate when they're
fixed<00:03:16.040> posed<00:03:16.220> like<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.609> especially<00:03:16.910> when

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
fixed posed like that especially when

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.659 
fixed posed like that especially when
it's<00:03:17.660> just<00:03:18.530> an<00:03:18.680> arm<00:03:18.859> like<00:03:19.099> that<00:03:19.160> like<00:03:19.489> there's

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
it's just an arm like that like there's

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.940 
it's just an arm like that like there's
some<00:03:19.849> figures<00:03:20.150> it'll<00:03:20.299> be<00:03:20.419> fixed<00:03:20.720> posed<00:03:20.959> in<00:03:21.410> a

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
some figures it'll be fixed posed in a

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.580 
some figures it'll be fixed posed in a
clearly<00:03:22.489> posed<00:03:23.389> pose<00:03:23.959> if<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.319> makes<00:03:24.500> any

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
clearly posed pose if that makes any

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.620 
clearly posed pose if that makes any
sense<00:03:24.709> but<00:03:25.099> this<00:03:25.250> one<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:25.760> just<00:03:25.819> don't<00:03:26.359> like

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
sense but this one I just don't like

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.140 
sense but this one I just don't like
that<00:03:26.870> at<00:03:27.079> all<00:03:27.200> but<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.889> does<00:03:28.069> that<00:03:28.340> obviously

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
that at all but it does that obviously

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.430 
that at all but it does that obviously
since<00:03:29.419> the<00:03:29.569> ones<00:03:29.690> called<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.959> Battle<00:03:30.109> sound

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440

bag<00:05:15.930> for<00:05:16.470> me<00:05:16.620> I<00:05:16.800> think<00:05:17.400> detail<00:05:17.820> wise<00:05:18.060> like<00:05:18.300> I

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
bag for me I think detail wise like I

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.520 
bag for me I think detail wise like I
mentioned<00:05:18.600> at<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.840> beginning<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.320> review

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
mentioned at the beginning of the review

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.260 
mentioned at the beginning of the review
like<00:05:19.680> 20<00:05:20.070> times<00:05:20.280> I<00:05:20.550> think<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:21.060> looks<00:05:21.090> pretty

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
like 20 times I think it looks pretty

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.240 
like 20 times I think it looks pretty
good<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:22.080> paint<00:05:22.320> on<00:05:22.440> it<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.680> pretty<00:05:22.889> well<00:05:23.039> done

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
good the paint on it is pretty well done

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.960 
good the paint on it is pretty well done
for<00:05:23.520> this<00:05:23.610> figure<00:05:23.970> oh<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:26.310> completely<00:05:26.520> forgot

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
for this figure oh I completely forgot

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.430 
for this figure oh I completely forgot
to<00:05:27.090> mention<00:05:27.389> because<00:05:27.479> i'm<00:05:27.660> an<00:05:27.780> idiot<00:05:27.990> why<00:05:28.380> do

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440

should come with an eight inch figure or

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.409 
should come with an eight inch figure or
something<00:05:41.039> like<00:05:41.220> those<00:05:41.430> are<00:05:41.729> those<00:05:41.880> you<00:05:42.330> know

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
something like those are those you know

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.260 
something like those are those you know
armored<00:05:42.750> figures<00:05:42.930> it<00:05:43.440> is<00:05:44.280> proportionally<00:05:45.120> is

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
armored figures it is proportionally is

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.750 
armored figures it is proportionally is
way<00:05:45.660> too<00:05:45.720> small<00:05:46.020> for<00:05:46.979> this<00:05:47.099> figure<00:05:47.280> that<00:05:47.580> is

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
way too small for this figure that is

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.850 
way too small for this figure that is
another<00:05:47.940> nitpick<00:05:48.330> but<00:05:48.510> anyway<00:05:49.110> now<00:05:49.830> that

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
another nitpick but anyway now that

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.520 
another nitpick but anyway now that
we're<00:05:50.250> we<00:05:51.000> remember<00:05:51.720> to<00:05:51.840> do<00:05:51.960> everything<00:05:52.200> like

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
we're we remember to do everything like

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.750 
we're we remember to do everything like
I<00:05:52.680> said<00:05:52.830> this<00:05:52.889> is<00:05:52.950> a<00:05:53.039> mixed<00:05:53.310> bag<00:05:53.400> for<00:05:53.639> me<00:05:53.729> I

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
I said this is a mixed bag for me I

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.330 
I said this is a mixed bag for me I
think<00:05:54.060> it<00:05:54.150> looks<00:05:54.360> pretty<00:05:54.419> decent<00:05:54.919> um<00:05:55.919> I<00:05:56.010> don't

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340

have<00:05:56.490> any<00:05:56.610> proportion<00:05:56.880> issues<00:05:57.330> but<00:05:57.599> I'm

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.529 
have any proportion issues but I'm
bothered<00:05:58.139> by<00:05:58.580> the<00:05:59.580> sword<00:05:59.820> being<00:06:00.090> what<00:06:00.450> the
