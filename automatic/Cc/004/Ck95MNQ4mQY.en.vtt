00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.310 

for<00:00:40.640> me<00:00:40.730> personally<00:00:40.940> I<00:00:41.210> picked<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.810> glass<00:00:41.990> slide

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320

metal<00:00:47.000> slides<00:00:47.450> both<00:00:48.410> are<00:00:48.620> good<00:00:49.360> metal<00:00:50.360> slides

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
metal slides both are good metal slides

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.420 
metal slides both are good metal slides
don't<00:00:50.870> break<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.440> shatter<00:00:51.710> like<00:00:51.920> glass<00:00:51.980> ones

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
don't break and shatter like glass ones

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.430 
don't break and shatter like glass ones
which<00:00:52.640> has<00:00:52.820> happened<00:00:53.150> to<00:00:53.210> me<00:00:53.330> before<00:00:53.450> but<00:00:53.900> I

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
which has happened to me before but I

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.040 
which has happened to me before but I
like<00:00:55.130> the<00:00:55.280> sound<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:56.090> glass<00:00:56.540> slide<00:00:56.840> if<00:00:56.960> you

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
like the sound of the glass slide if you

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.610 
like the sound of the glass slide if you
guys<00:00:57.170> up<00:00:57.350> I<00:00:58.750> think<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.810> has<00:00:59.900> a<00:00:59.930> warmer<00:01:00.350> sound

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
guys up I think it has a warmer sound

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.440 
guys up I think it has a warmer sound
than<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.070> metal<00:01:01.460> slide<00:01:01.730> I<00:01:01.760> think<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.180> metal

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
than the metal slide I think the metal

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.500 
than the metal slide I think the metal
slide<00:01:02.630> is<00:01:02.750> a<00:01:02.780> little<00:01:03.050> bit<00:01:03.170> more<00:01:03.290> tinny<00:01:03.650> and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
slide is a little bit more tinny and

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.080 
slide is a little bit more tinny and
aluminum<00:01:05.510> sounding<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:06.820> picked<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:07.910> glass

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
aluminum sounding so I picked a glass

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.210 
aluminum sounding so I picked a glass
slide<00:01:08.380> they<00:01:09.380> have<00:01:09.530> they<00:01:09.710> come<00:01:09.830> in<00:01:09.920> all<00:01:10.040> sizes

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
slide they have they come in all sizes

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.860 
slide they have they come in all sizes

for a gig and yet I ended up trying a
beer<00:03:02.880> bottle<00:03:03.090> because<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.690> thought<00:03:03.870> well<00:03:04.050> that

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
beer bottle because I thought well that

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
know I had to dump the excess liquid out

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.780 
know I had to dump the excess liquid out
and<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.110> got<00:03:10.380> my<00:03:10.530> beer<00:03:10.740> bottle<00:03:11.040> figured<00:03:11.670> I

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
couldn't hold it this way so I ended up

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.350 
couldn't hold it this way so I ended up
pulling<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:13.800> way<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.340> didn't<00:03:15.090> work<00:03:15.210> too

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
pulling it this way and didn't work too

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.120 
pulling it this way and didn't work too
well<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.690> way<00:03:16.050> too<00:03:16.110> wide<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.470> know<00:03:16.860> for

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
well to this way too wide you know for

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.090 
well to this way too wide you know for
the<00:03:17.160> for<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.550> frets<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.960> ended<00:03:19.440> up<00:03:19.560> going<00:03:19.710> in

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
the for the frets so I ended up going in

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.040 
the for the frets so I ended up going in
the<00:03:20.460> back<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.850> pulling<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:21.180> my<00:03:21.300> my<00:03:21.630> lipstick

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
the back and pulling up my my lipstick

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.440 
the back and pulling up my my lipstick
case<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.650> pulled<00:03:23.490> out<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.820> tube<00:03:24.030> from<00:03:24.330> my

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
case and I pulled out the tube from my

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.270 
case and I pulled out the tube from my
lipstick<00:03:24.870> container<00:03:25.260> which<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.740> I<00:03:25.980> think

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
lipstick container which is I think

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.370 
lipstick container which is I think
plastic<00:03:26.700> but<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.300> fit<00:03:27.510> around<00:03:27.600> my<00:03:27.750> finger<00:03:28.140> and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
plastic but it fit around my finger and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.870 
plastic but it fit around my finger and
I<00:03:28.440> was<00:03:28.590> able<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.830> use<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:28.950> as<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> slide<00:03:29.610> and

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
I was able to use that as a slide and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.430 
I was able to use that as a slide and
I've<00:03:30.240> actually<00:03:30.420> heard<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.990> other<00:03:31.140> guitar

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
I've actually heard of other guitar

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.220 
I've actually heard of other guitar
players<00:03:31.470> doing<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.130> before<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.020> I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
players doing that before so that it I

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.840 
players doing that before so that it I
actually<00:03:34.380> got<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.190> think<00:03:35.460> I<00:03:35.520> got<00:03:35.700> that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
actually got that I think I got that

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.790 
actually got that I think I got that
idea<00:03:36.030> from<00:03:36.240> alex<00:03:36.660> lifeson<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.200> don't<00:03:37.680> remember

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
idea from alex lifeson I don't remember

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.620 
idea from alex lifeson I don't remember
exactly<00:03:38.130> who<00:03:38.550> use<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.030> first<00:03:39.240> time<00:03:39.420> but

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
exactly who use that the first time but

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.140 
exactly who use that the first time but
I<00:03:39.840> know<00:03:39.990> I<00:03:40.170> read<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:40.950> somewhere

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.259 

so<00:03:45.140> when<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.769> come<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.159> playing<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.939> slide

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
so when you come to playing the slide

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.899 
so when you come to playing the slide
you<00:03:47.810> want<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.140> play<00:03:48.349> on<00:03:48.530> strings<00:03:48.920> where<00:03:49.220> you

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
you want to play on strings where you

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.850 
you want to play on strings where you
could<00:03:50.060> play<00:03:50.209> one<00:03:50.989> or<00:03:51.019> two<00:03:51.140> or<00:03:51.409> three<00:03:51.620> notes

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
could play one or two or three notes

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.949 
could play one or two or three notes
together<00:03:52.159> because<00:03:52.760> you're<00:03:52.939> basically<00:03:53.689> stuck

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
together because you're basically stuck

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.929 
together because you're basically stuck
