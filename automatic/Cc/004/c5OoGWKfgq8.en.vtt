inside<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.509> scrubber<00:01:35.750> canister<00:01:35.840> because<00:01:36.770> at

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
inside the scrubber canister because at

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.400 
inside the scrubber canister because at
the<00:01:37.009> bottom<00:01:37.190> might<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.270> little<00:01:38.509> dusty<00:01:38.930> but

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
the bottom might be a little dusty but

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.660 
the bottom might be a little dusty but
it's<00:01:39.590> not<00:01:39.770> too<00:01:39.920> bad<00:01:39.950> if<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.430> know<00:01:40.520> that's

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
it's not too bad if you know that's

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.660 
it's not too bad if you know that's
pretty<00:01:40.880> good<00:01:47.649> yeah<00:01:48.649> I<00:01:48.680> think<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.190> have<00:01:49.340> enough

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
pretty good yeah I think I have enough

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.660 
pretty good yeah I think I have enough
I'm<00:01:50.660> going<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.840> close<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.259> bucket<00:01:51.560> again<00:01:51.670> for

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
I'm going to close the bucket again for

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.219 
I'm going to close the bucket again for
future<00:01:52.850> use<00:01:53.240> or<00:01:53.479> in<00:01:53.570> this<00:01:53.690> case<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.170> is

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
future use or in this case this is

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:07.330 
future use or in this case this is
pretty<00:01:54.530> empty<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.250> we<00:01:55.369> can<00:01:55.550> discard<00:01:55.940> it<00:02:06.220> in<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
pretty empty so we can discard it in the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.889 
pretty empty so we can discard it in the
radio<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.910> could<00:02:08.060> be<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> little<00:02:08.390> tricky<00:02:08.509> it

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
radio that could be a little tricky it

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.419 
radio that could be a little tricky it
may<00:02:09.140> be<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.289> little<00:02:09.380> time-consuming<00:02:09.740> at<00:02:10.340> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
may be a little time-consuming at the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.490 
may be a little time-consuming at the
beginning<00:02:10.849> but<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.540> want<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.140> really

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
beginning but you want to have a really

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.710 
beginning but you want to have a really
tightly<00:02:12.770> packed<00:02:13.190> scrubber<00:02:13.490> because<00:02:14.390> if<00:02:14.569> it's

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
tightly packed scrubber because if it's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.620 
tightly packed scrubber because if it's
not<00:02:14.780> packed<00:02:15.470> tight<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:16.550> driving<00:02:17.060> down<00:02:17.240> a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
not packed tight you driving down a

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.440 
not packed tight you driving down a
bumpy<00:02:18.020> road<00:02:18.200> go<00:02:18.620> cave<00:02:18.860> diving<00:02:19.160> or<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.730> having

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
bumpy road go cave diving or you having

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.660 
bumpy road go cave diving or you having
a<00:02:20.569> long<00:02:20.780> bumpy<00:02:21.110> boat<00:02:21.739> ride<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.250> front<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.520> you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
a long bumpy boat ride in front of you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.540 
a long bumpy boat ride in front of you
the<00:02:23.540> materially<00:02:24.500> absorbent<00:02:24.950> material<00:02:25.370> will

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
the materially absorbent material will

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.720 
the materially absorbent material will
compact<00:02:26.030> inside<00:02:26.599> the<00:02:26.959> scrubber<00:02:27.530> canister<00:02:27.730> on

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
compact inside the scrubber canister on

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.880 
compact inside the scrubber canister on
the<00:02:28.940> right<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.450> die<00:02:29.599> side<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.739> may

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
the right to the die side and you may

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.470 
the right to the die side and you may
have<00:02:31.069> a<00:02:31.130> channeling<00:02:31.640> effect<00:02:32.030> there<00:02:32.239> so

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
have a channeling effect there so

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.330 
have a channeling effect there so
packing<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.230> really<00:02:33.500> tight<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:33.950> taking<00:02:34.250> your

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
packing it really tight and taking your

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:43.230 
packing it really tight and taking your
time<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:34.880> really<00:02:35.120> important

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:53.530 

cleaning<00:02:44.240> it<00:02:44.330> up<00:02:44.420> a<00:02:44.569> little<00:02:44.750> bit<00:02:44.959> here<00:02:52.540> now

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
cleaning it up a little bit here now

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.270 
cleaning it up a little bit here now
we're<00:02:53.660> going<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.870> put<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.200> button<00:02:54.830> plate<00:02:55.040> on

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
we're going to put the button plate on

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.460 
we're going to put the button plate on
it<00:02:56.000> is<00:02:56.150> spring-loaded<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:57.020> don't<00:02:57.230> know<00:02:57.290> if<00:02:57.380> you

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
it is spring-loaded I don't know if you

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.040 
it is spring-loaded I don't know if you
can<00:02:57.620> see<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.640> I'm<00:02:58.970> going<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.180> put<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.690> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
we're going to get listen to it and see

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.750 
we're going to get listen to it and see
if<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.440> granule<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.650> tightly<00:03:27.920> packed<00:03:28.040> if<00:03:28.640> you

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
if the granule is tightly packed if you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.340 
if the granule is tightly packed if you
put<00:03:28.940> our<00:03:29.120> ear<00:03:29.360> right<00:03:29.510> next<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.230> we<00:03:30.319> can

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
put our ear right next to it and we can

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.070 
put our ear right next to it and we can
hear<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.280> by<00:03:31.400> moving<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:32.540> head<00:03:32.780> back<00:03:33.050> and

hear it by moving the head back and

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:42.490 
hear it by moving the head back and
forth<00:03:33.610> it's<00:03:34.610> not<00:03:34.850> packed<00:03:35.390> properly<00:03:41.500> that's

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
forth it's not packed properly that's

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.780 
forth it's not packed properly that's
what<00:03:42.830> I<00:03:42.860> would<00:03:43.040> call<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.280> tightly<00:03:43.760> packed

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
what I would call a tightly packed

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.080 
what I would call a tightly packed
canister<00:03:45.280> next<00:03:46.280> thing<00:03:46.459> back<00:03:46.850> to<00:03:47.030> the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
canister next thing back to the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.780 
canister next thing back to the
checklist<00:03:47.360> make<00:03:47.900> sure<00:03:48.140> we<00:03:48.470> take<00:03:49.220> off<00:03:49.430> what<00:03:49.640> we
