00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 how about friends how are mex here and 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.109
 rené in a tutorial more for you this 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.540
 glitch is dedicated to all people 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.210
 they just started playing minecraft 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.889
 for the xbox 360 version and that therefore 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.650
 they did not think that if we could duplicate 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.720
 diamond blocks this glitch the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.430
 I really like it a lot and well, this one 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.580
 we already have what is the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.170
 update of 14 and then we do not 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 they removed this church or we can 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.970
 enjoy some people do not like 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.520
 but then I 'm a cheater and so 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 well let's multiply I'll say 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.410
 some important qualities I'm going to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 multiply it later I'll start to 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.610
 give the guide step by step so that 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.219
 have problems and then some things 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.520
 that they should not do so 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.800
 this glitch is difficult for you first 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.840
 what I did was a structure like that see 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.300
 as the block I put it on the shore and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.079
 here is my glass structure 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.969
 now I will comment on why 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.030
 and see how the structure is going to 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.729
 break the block let's grab it and 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.580
 Well, we're going to put it in here, let's go 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.890
 to break it see how I'm going to break the 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.840
 block and look how is the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.539
 behavior of this one can go to the 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.690
 left to the right back today 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.960
 you can stay 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.870
 in this case he stayed there a little 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.990
 Let's put it again 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.880
 in this case it went very far back almost 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.270
 almost the other block arrived 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.920
 and well because this because one of 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.649
 the important aspects to be able 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.780
 multiply the blocks is that once 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.020
 that we break what is this stay there 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.229
 same that we are not far behind and for 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.619
 that I put this structure we're going to do 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.619
 the glitch 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.270
 matt fox 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.530
 there is 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.210
 this block is the original the origin and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.410
 the one I have here in my hand is the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.420
 glitch block edo 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.070
 take note because this can not be 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.800
 do you can not place the 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.840
 block eclipsed here in when 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.690
 we press the lt button because it is 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.850
 will disappear if I pressed the button 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.760
 yellow and we go to the menu and I want 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.530
 select this one will disappear not 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.140
 we can impose it in a chest not not 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.140
 can see in the living example I 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.140
 locked 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.780
 Just notice right away once I 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.879
 he selected what is the button is going to 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.569
 disappear everything where everything was left 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.569
 there is magic 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.710
 the only way in which we 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.350
 we can get what are the 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.880
 diamonds with the diamond block and 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.380
 glaze is pressing the x button after 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.900
 let's press what is the button 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.300
 elevate we go to decorations that already 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.730
 we are here we look for the ingot of 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.410
 iron and we go down there goes to 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.740
 be what is the diamond we press 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.840
 the button and will give us 9 day matrix and 6 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.000
 is the trick after this 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.110
 I recommend that you put it here to be able 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.110
 keep multiplying 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.590
 remember press x press the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.840
 button lift for decorations 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.519
 we look for the gold ingot we're going 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.620
 down and we look for the diamond and 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.840
 we press the button 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.400
 now we are going to make the guide step to 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.680
 step so you can multiply this 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.560
 block remember that this apply what 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.440
 is the update of eu 14 and then we 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.319
 they removed this this trick and well let's 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.549
 let's start I recommend you to 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.530
 make this structure so that the 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.319
 block do not leave them and they can return 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.209
 to grab routed here until the 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.879
 stop I can not walk anymore see how I do not 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.590
 leave after this I'm going to a 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.329
 little bit backwards like I'm going to 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.390
 return not a lot not up here would be 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.150
 impossible to make the cliché is a little 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.769
 nothing else is going to break up with the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.329
 network button 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.160
 after this we will select what 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.560
 which is the r &amp; b button that is the one that changes 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.539
 the squares see how I get back with 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.750
 the back button goes to the right and 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.630
 with the raise button I'm going to the left 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.150
 but we'll break the button 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.520
 r &amp; b and then we're going to press what 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.630
 is the lt button that is to place some 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.220
 block we break and change 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.039
 we break change and place 6 the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.820
 glitch just came out very very easily 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.970
 after this press x 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.249
 week decorations and they go mayor 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.409
 love tito press the button 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:53.719
 and that number is 27 of me 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.769
 birthday and well we are going to 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:56.769
 multiply again 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.240
 well I'm going to put it here so that 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.280
 disappear because I tell you that when 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.670
 walk a stake to both go 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.980
 back because we can break it look like 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.720
 I'm going to break it I 'm going to want to place the 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.009
 block and it does not let me or it does not let me 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.629
 because I'm taking up space 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.050
 that's why I tell you that you know so much about this 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.050
 backwards 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.850
 there is already I can already place it once 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.430
 that I put the block that means 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.870
 I can already do but click goes 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.570
 again it goes again so that I do not know 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.090
 confuse we break change 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.610
 squares and we put the block so 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.510
 easy we break we change 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.140
 we break we change we break 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:46.140
 we change we do not come out to this 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:49.680
 we have multiplied and here is the cube 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.930
 glitch ya and well then this has been the 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.990
 tutorial I hope you liked it 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.130
 Remember that this block can not 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.350
 manipulate as you want 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.240
 you can not put it here on the grass or 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.060
 put it here on your menu because it's going to 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.490
 disappear and well the only option 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.400
 is to tell us the menu we have and the 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.949
 decoration is and press the button 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.960
 I hope you like this video remember 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.330
 which can be used in iron and others 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.000
 minerals like gold and well then 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.070
