00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
after but it's very rare K so difficult

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.270 
after but it's very rare K so difficult
to<00:00:54.680> be<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> CEO<00:00:56.370> by<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.660> 30<00:00:58.020> years<00:00:58.260> old<00:00:58.500> 40

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
charge I have to evaluate how much we

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.770 
charge I have to evaluate how much we
could<00:03:12.410> pay<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.709> acquire<00:03:13.130> this<00:03:13.340> gases<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.570> in

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
could pay to acquire this gases it so in

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.890 
could pay to acquire this gases it so in
that<00:03:14.989> sense<00:03:15.350> I<00:03:15.620> mean<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.579> have<00:03:17.390> a<00:03:17.420> very<00:03:17.720> much

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.270 
access to such kind of the business
which<00:03:20.450> requires<00:03:20.900> quantitative<00:03:21.799> skills<00:03:21.980> I

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
which requires quantitative skills I

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.090 
which requires quantitative skills I
have<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:23.030> evaluate<00:03:23.440> what<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.650> reserve<00:03:25.070> of

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
have to evaluate what is the reserve of

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.310 
have to evaluate what is the reserve of
the<00:03:25.549> gases<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.209> on<00:03:26.420> what<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.049> flow<00:03:27.290> rate

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
the gases it on what is the flow rate

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.640 
the gases it on what is the flow rate
how<00:03:28.250> much<00:03:28.400> we<00:03:28.610> could<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:29.510> how<00:03:29.720> much<00:03:29.930> how<00:03:30.260> price

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
how much we could in how much how price

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.770 
how much we could in how much how price
we<00:03:30.860> could<00:03:31.040> sell<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.610> market<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.360> what's

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
we could sell to the market and what's

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.420 
we could sell to the market and what's
the<00:03:32.930> revenue<00:03:33.079> what's<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.799> cost<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.130> build

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
the revenue what's the cost to build

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.810 
the revenue what's the cost to build
those<00:03:34.700> all<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.180> facilities<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.110> then<00:03:36.820> like

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
those all the facilities and then like

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.900 
those all the facilities and then like
evaluate<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.019> gases<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:39.799> I<00:03:39.829> think<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.370> have<00:03:40.880> a

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
evaluate the gases so I think I have a

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.220 
evaluate the gases so I think I have a
quantitative<00:03:41.390> skills<00:03:41.720> which

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
quantitative skills which

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.710 
quantitative skills which
be<00:03:42.440> required<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.760> participate<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.599> the

to speak well your English skills seem

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.320 
to speak well your English skills seem
good<00:03:56.930> but<00:03:57.530> why<00:03:58.129> why<00:03:58.610> couldn't<00:03:58.670> you<00:03:59.030> get<00:03:59.150> up

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
good but why why couldn't you get up

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.900 
good but why why couldn't you get up
higher<00:03:59.599> than<00:04:00.110> 31<00:04:00.650> in<00:04:00.799> jima<00:04:01.129> you

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
higher than 31 in jima you

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.110 
higher than 31 in jima you
I<00:04:01.940> think<00:04:02.450> 31<00:04:03.049> is<00:04:03.230> not<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:03.980> low<00:04:04.340> in<00:04:04.640> my<00:04:04.819> sense

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
I think 31 is not so low in my sense

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.690 
I think 31 is not so low in my sense
because<00:04:05.629> I<00:04:05.930> believe<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:07.160> total<00:04:07.549> of<00:04:07.580> my

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
because I believe that the total of my

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.800 
because I believe that the total of my
total<00:04:08.420> ending<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:09.079> GMAT<00:04:09.470> scores<00:04:10.090> 670<00:04:11.090> which<00:04:11.629> is

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
total ending of GMAT scores 670 which is

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.789 
total ending of GMAT scores 670 which is
in<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.560> eve<00:04:12.829> of<00:04:13.510> 80%<00:04:14.510> who<00:04:15.019> was<00:04:15.170> admitted<00:04:15.470> to

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
in the eve of 80% who was admitted to

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.069 
in the eve of 80% who was admitted to
your<00:04:16.070> school<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.000> felt<00:04:17.419> that<00:04:17.510> this<00:04:17.930> is

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
your school so I felt that this is

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.740 
your school so I felt that this is
enough<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.620> that's<00:04:19.010> why<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.220> quit<00:04:19.880> my<00:04:20.299> GMAT

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
there's a two reasons

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.290 
there's a two reasons
first<00:05:21.699> I<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.389> think<00:05:22.900> your<00:05:23.349> school's<00:05:24.060> system<00:05:25.060> of

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
first I I think your school's system of

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.629 
first I I think your school's system of
fostering<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.259> future<00:05:26.590> leader<00:05:26.919> is<00:05:27.130> decent

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
fostering the future leader is decent

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.260 
fostering the future leader is decent
because<00:05:28.120> this<00:05:29.050> is<00:05:29.919> based<00:05:30.250> on<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.520> 100<00:05:30.970> person

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
because this is based on the 100 person

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.040 
because this is based on the 100 person
case<00:05:31.479> study<00:05:31.870> like<00:05:32.860> any<00:05:33.370> other<00:05:33.639> case<00:05:33.849> studies
