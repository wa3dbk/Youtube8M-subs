attach for extending the whisker pole by

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.890 
attach for extending the whisker pole by
climbing<00:01:33.979> up<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.190> spire<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.520> little<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.000> just

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
climbing up the spire a little and just

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.890 
climbing up the spire a little and just
pulling<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.650> furling<00:01:37.130> line<00:01:37.690> extend<00:01:38.690> it

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
pulling on the furling line extend it

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.609 
pulling on the furling line extend it
and<00:01:39.080> tie<00:01:40.040> it<00:01:40.070> up<00:01:40.280> like<00:01:40.550> this<00:01:40.960> figure<00:01:41.960> eight<00:01:42.229> and

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
and tie it up like this figure eight and

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.890 
and tie it up like this figure eight and
the<00:01:43.430> rest<00:01:43.670> will<00:01:43.909> do<00:01:44.060> when<00:01:44.240> we<00:01:44.360> fill<00:01:44.570> out<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
the rest will do when we fill out the

it's simple we just ease the filling
line<00:01:54.200> out<00:01:54.580> line<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.789> jib<00:01:56.000> sheet<00:01:56.030> in<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.660> set

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
line out line the jib sheet in and set

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.109 
line out line the jib sheet in and set
it<00:01:57.560> because<00:01:57.800> we<00:01:57.920> want<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.160> head<00:01:58.340> down<00:01:58.369> win<00:01:58.910> with

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
it because we want to head down win with

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.300 
it because we want to head down win with
a<00:01:59.149> whisker<00:01:59.509> pole<00:01:59.720> the<00:02:00.229> shortest<00:02:00.710> destination

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
a whisker pole the shortest destination

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.830 
a whisker pole the shortest destination
we're<00:02:01.430> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.820> Rickenbacker<00:02:02.210> Bridger

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
we're going to the Rickenbacker Bridger

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.320 
we're going to the Rickenbacker Bridger
and<00:02:03.050> we<00:02:03.770> need<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.039> get<00:02:04.160> there<00:02:04.340> fast<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:05.149> just

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
and we need to get there fast so we just

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.420 
and we need to get there fast so we just
wind<00:02:05.570> out<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.840> jib<00:02:06.080> here<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:06.619> go

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.709 

okay

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.719 
okay

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:22.770 
okay
just<00:02:14.719> grind<00:02:15.049> it<00:02:15.200> out<00:02:16.719> holes<00:02:17.719> kind<00:02:18.379> of<00:02:18.560> level

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.110 

and<00:02:23.320> that's<00:02:23.680> pretty<00:02:23.950> good<00:02:24.160> right<00:02:24.460> there<00:02:24.910> I'd

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
and that's pretty good right there I'd

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.530 
and that's pretty good right there I'd
say

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.500 

that's<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.080> stable<00:02:31.730> steady<00:02:32.730> wing<00:02:33.299> on

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
that's it it's a stable steady wing on

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.720 
that's it it's a stable steady wing on
wing<00:02:33.769> situation<00:02:34.769> here<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.129> just<00:02:35.220> straight

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
wing situation here it's just straight

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.110 
wing situation here it's just straight
to<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:35.970> bridge<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:37.370> in<00:02:38.370> our<00:02:38.610> boat<00:02:38.819> speeds

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
to the bridge but in our boat speeds

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.960 
to the bridge but in our boat speeds
uh-oh<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.989> climbing<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:41.340> probably<00:02:41.670> doubled

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
uh-oh it's climbing we probably doubled

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.589 
uh-oh it's climbing we probably doubled
our<00:02:42.060> speed<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:43.200> with<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.409> mean<00:02:43.620> up<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:44.670> we<00:02:45.450> on

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
our speed just with a mean up so we on

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.300 
our speed just with a mean up so we on
link<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:45.959> very<00:02:46.170> simple<00:02:46.560> very<00:02:47.360> stable<00:02:48.360> and

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
link it's very simple very stable and

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.979 
link it's very simple very stable and
what<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.370> pilot<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.060> go<00:02:51.180> do<00:02:51.569> what<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.720> need<00:02:51.840> to

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
what a pilot you go do what you need to

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.440 
what a pilot you go do what you need to
do<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.319> can<00:02:52.349> single<00:02:52.769> handle<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.299> way

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
do you can single handle but it's a way

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:06.970 
do you can single handle but it's a way
to<00:02:54.480> go

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.040 

you
