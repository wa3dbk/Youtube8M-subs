00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.879 
oh and when the helicopter arrives
usually<00:03:13.630> what<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> do<00:03:14.079> is<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.350> lay<00:03:14.530> down<00:03:14.680> right

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
usually what I do is I lay down right

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.129 
usually what I do is I lay down right
here<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.579> if<00:03:15.700> it's<00:03:15.850> like<00:03:15.970> over<00:03:16.269> there<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.780> then

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
here so if it's like over there and then

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.080 
here so if it's like over there and then
when<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.350> comes<00:03:17.380> around<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:18.010> just<00:03:18.040> get<00:03:18.310> up<00:03:18.459> shoot

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
when it comes around I just get up shoot

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.629 
when it comes around I just get up shoot
it<00:03:19.239> for<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.359> little<00:03:19.450> bit<00:03:19.569> come<00:03:19.930> over<00:03:20.139> here<00:03:20.639> get

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
it for a little bit come over here get

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.789 
it for a little bit come over here get
it<00:03:21.730> on<00:03:21.819> over<00:03:22.209> here<00:03:22.540> um<00:03:23.489> yeah<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.730> then<00:03:25.799> and

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
it on over here um yeah and then and

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.330 
it on over here um yeah and then and
then<00:03:26.859> yeah<00:03:28.260> i<00:03:29.260> know<00:03:29.410> i'm<00:03:29.680> horrible<00:03:29.889> at<00:03:30.160> this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
then yeah i know i'm horrible at this

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:41.160 
then yeah i know i'm horrible at this
it's<00:03:31.150> my<00:03:31.209> first<00:03:31.540> time<00:03:31.630> um<00:03:32.609> so<00:03:33.609> yeah

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.660 

so<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.200> guess<00:03:42.439> I'm<00:03:42.590> just<00:03:42.709> focusing<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.459> trying

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
so I guess I'm just focusing in trying

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.059 
so I guess I'm just focusing in trying
to<00:03:43.730> concentrate<00:03:44.090> all<00:03:44.930> right<00:03:45.079> so<00:03:45.319> that's<00:03:45.530> your

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
to concentrate all right so that's your

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.160 
to concentrate all right so that's your
up<00:03:46.250> be<00:03:46.519> careful<00:03:46.970> don't<00:03:47.180> look<00:03:47.450> over<00:03:47.629> like<00:03:47.959> this

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
up be careful don't look over like this

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.110 
up be careful don't look over like this
because<00:03:48.379> then<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.769> dog<00:03:48.950> which<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.549> watch<00:03:49.970> I'll

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
because then the dog which up watch I'll

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.979 
because then the dog which up watch I'll
show<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.409> hold<00:03:51.409> on<00:03:51.530> dog<00:03:51.980> get<00:03:52.310> up<00:03:52.400> here<00:03:52.549> come<00:03:52.849> on

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
show you hold on dog get up here come on

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.420 
show you hold on dog get up here come on
okay<00:03:53.989> maybe<00:03:54.230> not<00:03:56.110> no<00:03:57.110> okay<00:03:57.650> yeah<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:57.980> can<00:03:58.220> do<00:03:58.400> it

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
okay maybe not no okay yeah I can do it

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.819 
okay maybe not no okay yeah I can do it
but<00:03:59.390> usually<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.989> dogs<00:04:00.200> they<00:04:00.470> wait<00:04:00.650> right

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
but usually the dogs they wait right

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.110 
but usually the dogs they wait right
there<00:04:00.860> and<00:04:01.190> then<00:04:01.250> they<00:04:01.370> glitch<00:04:01.610> up<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.030> then

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
there and then they glitch up and then

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.819 
there and then they glitch up and then
they<00:04:02.269> kill<00:04:03.079> you<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:03.440> then<00:04:03.470> you'll<00:04:03.650> probably

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
they kill you and then you'll probably

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.259 
they kill you and then you'll probably
like<00:04:04.069> fall<00:04:04.280> down<00:04:04.489> there<00:04:04.700> but<00:04:04.879> then<00:04:05.030> you'll<00:04:05.150> get

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
like fall down there but then you'll get

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.780 
like fall down there but then you'll get
glitch<00:04:05.569> like<00:04:06.379> right<00:04:06.530> there<00:04:06.739> so<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.489> gotta<00:04:07.670> be

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
glitch like right there so you gotta be

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.819 
glitch like right there so you gotta be
careful<00:04:07.970> on<00:04:08.390> if<00:04:08.900> you're<00:04:09.049> up<00:04:09.200> here<00:04:09.230> though<00:04:09.560> if

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
careful on if you're up here though if

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.339 
careful on if you're up here though if
you<00:04:09.980> lay<00:04:10.129> down<00:04:10.159> they<00:04:10.489> can't<00:04:10.700> get<00:04:10.849> you<00:04:11.090> on

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
you lay down they can't get you on

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.569 
you lay down they can't get you on
unless<00:04:12.349> there<00:04:12.560> may<00:04:12.769> be<00:04:12.799> over<00:04:13.099> there<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.489> then

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
unless there may be over there and then

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.879 
unless there may be over there and then
you<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:13.819> just<00:04:13.970> lay<00:04:14.359> down<00:04:14.390> um<00:04:15.319> this<00:04:15.709> is

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
you can just lay down um this is

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.069 
you can just lay down um this is
actually<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.489> good<00:04:17.060> glitch<00:04:17.389> because<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.959> can

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
actually a good glitch because you can

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.229 
actually a good glitch because you can
get<00:04:18.229> really<00:04:18.380> far<00:04:18.739> on<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.760> only<00:04:19.970> thing<00:04:20.120> I'm

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
get really far on the only thing I'm

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.580 
get really far on the only thing I'm
worried<00:04:20.419> about<00:04:20.449> is<00:04:20.600> just<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.019> helicopters

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
worried about is just the helicopters

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.830 
worried about is just the helicopters
but<00:04:21.889> it's<00:04:22.010> really<00:04:22.190> easy<00:04:22.460> because<00:04:23.389> all<00:04:23.690> you

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
but it's really easy because all you

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.540 
but it's really easy because all you
have<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:24.080> do<00:04:24.199> is<00:04:24.410> just<00:04:24.440> hide<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.460> the

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.610 
have to do is just hide and the

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
propellers so um yeah okay now that's

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.830 
propellers so um yeah okay now that's
