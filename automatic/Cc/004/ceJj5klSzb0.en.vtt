today<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.939> are<00:00:24.029> talking<00:00:24.150> about<00:00:24.330> solar<00:00:24.779> power

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
today we are talking about solar power

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.170 
today we are talking about solar power
the<00:00:25.650> Sun<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.980> constantly<00:00:26.250> bombarding<00:00:27.119> our

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
the Sun is constantly bombarding our

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
the Sun is constantly bombarding our
planet<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.019> solar<00:00:28.500> energy<00:00:29.010> it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
planet with all this solar energy it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.279 
planet with all this solar energy it
heats<00:00:29.609> our<00:00:29.789> world<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.390> plants<00:00:30.929> use<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
heats our world and plants use it to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.950 
heats our world and plants use it to
feed<00:00:31.529> themselves<00:00:31.769> via<00:00:32.719> photosynthesis<00:00:33.719> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
feed themselves via photosynthesis so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.389 
feed themselves via photosynthesis so
we're<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> take<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> closer<00:00:34.890> look<00:00:35.010> at

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
we're going to take a closer look at

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.459 
we're going to take a closer look at
this<00:00:35.610> with<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.059> solar<00:00:36.360> power<00:00:36.690> experiment

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
glass and set them out in the Sun for a

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.400 
glass and set them out in the Sun for a
couple<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.850> hours<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:48.870> retrieve<00:00:49.170> these

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
couple of hours we just retrieve these

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.290 
couple of hours we just retrieve these
from<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> Sun<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.370> put<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> thermometer<00:00:50.820> into

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
from the Sun we put a thermometer into

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.060 
from the Sun we put a thermometer into
each<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.410> actually<00:00:52.680> observe

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
each one and we can actually observe

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.850 
each one and we can actually observe
that<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> water<00:00:54.180> inside<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> dark<00:00:55.379> cup<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that the water inside of the dark cup is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.650 
that the water inside of the dark cup is
a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.550> hotter<00:00:56.760> than<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> water<00:00:57.300> inside

a little hotter than the water inside
the<00:00:57.840> white<00:00:58.020> cup<00:00:58.289> what's<00:00:58.859> happening<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.489> is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the white cup what's happening here is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.520 
the white cup what's happening here is
that<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.149> cup<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.629> wrapped<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.199> black<00:01:01.379> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that the cup that's wrapped in black is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.130 
that the cup that's wrapped in black is
actually<00:01:01.649> absorbing<00:01:02.489> more<00:01:02.789> heat<00:01:03.239> more<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
actually absorbing more heat more of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.770 
actually absorbing more heat more of
that<00:01:04.290> sunlight<00:01:04.710> whereas<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.729> water<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
cup that is wrapped in white is

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.480 
cup that is wrapped in white is
reflecting<00:01:09.810> off<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.260> sunlight<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
reflecting off that sunlight this is the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.280 
reflecting off that sunlight this is the
same<00:01:11.790> principle<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.570> use<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.960> solar

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
same principle that we use in solar

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.499 
same principle that we use in solar
collection<00:01:13.740> technologies<00:01:14.549> such<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.119> solar

collection technologies such as solar
cells<00:01:15.950> in<00:01:16.950> our<00:01:17.070> experiment<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:17.759> were<00:01:17.820> able<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
cells in our experiment we were able to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.600 
cells in our experiment we were able to
witness<00:01:18.420> how<00:01:18.659> dark<00:01:19.259> objects<00:01:19.710> absorb<00:01:20.159> light

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
witness how dark objects absorb light

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.420 
witness how dark objects absorb light
more<00:01:20.880> readily<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.450> emit<00:01:22.200> more<00:01:22.590> thermal

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
more readily and emit more thermal

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.910 
more readily and emit more thermal
energy<00:01:23.549> than<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> lighter<00:01:24.600> objects<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.799> all

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
energy than a lighter objects and it all

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.340 
energy than a lighter objects and it all
comes<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> color<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.390> same<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.320> true

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
comes down to color and the same is true

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
comes down to color and the same is true
in<00:01:28.890> any<00:01:29.549> city<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.150> look<00:01:30.299> around<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.780> you'll

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
in any city just look around you you'll

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.440 
in any city just look around you you'll
find<00:01:31.530> yourself<00:01:31.860> completely<00:01:32.579> surrounded<00:01:33.329> by

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
find yourself completely surrounded by

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.929 
find yourself completely surrounded by
generally<00:01:33.930> dark<00:01:34.200> buildings<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.009> very<00:01:35.729> dark

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
generally dark buildings and very dark

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359 
generally dark buildings and very dark
surfaces<00:01:36.540> underfoot<00:01:37.079> yes<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.250> all

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
surfaces underfoot yes I think of all

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.429 
surfaces underfoot yes I think of all
that<00:01:38.549> cement<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> asphalt<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.110> add

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
that cement in the asphalt and then add

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.560 
that cement in the asphalt and then add
to<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> equation<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.390> kind

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
to the equation that you have this kind

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.200 
to the equation that you have this kind
of<00:01:42.689> maize<00:01:43.079> configuration<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.280> buildings<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of maize configuration of buildings and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090 
of maize configuration of buildings and
that<00:01:45.659> makes<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.229> difficult<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that makes it really difficult for the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.819 
that makes it really difficult for the
heat<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.700> escape<00:01:48.240> which<00:01:48.869> actually<00:01:49.439> means<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
heat to escape which actually means that

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.039 
heat to escape which actually means that
you're<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.820> have<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> two<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.810> five

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you're now going to have a two to five

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.350 
you're now going to have a two to five
degree<00:01:52.560> increase<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.220> temperature<00:01:53.430> which<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
degree increase in temperature which is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.389 
degree increase in temperature which is
pretty<00:01:54.689> significant<00:01:55.380> especially<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
pretty significant especially if it's a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.160 
pretty significant especially if it's a
hot<00:01:56.729> summer<00:01:56.969> day<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.659> there's<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.899> heatwave

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
hot summer day or if there's a heatwave

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.139 
hot summer day or if there's a heatwave
it<00:01:59.009> may<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.250> sound<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.640> lot<00:01:59.880> but

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it may not sound like a lot but

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.450 
it may not sound like a lot but
everybody<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.290> gets<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.740> warmer<00:02:02.189> is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
everybody that gets a little warmer is

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.410 
everybody that gets a little warmer is
gonna<00:02:02.700> reach<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
gonna reach out for that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
gonna reach out for that
air-conditioning<00:02:04.049> knob<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.009> turn<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.250> up

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
air-conditioning knob and turn it up

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
air-conditioning knob and turn it up
just<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.759> little<00:02:05.790> bit<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.270> then<00:02:06.810> that's<00:02:06.990> going

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
just a little bit and then that's going

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.990 
just a little bit and then that's going
to<00:02:07.170> consume<00:02:07.530> more<00:02:07.710> energy<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.520> there's<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.789> very

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to consume more energy so there's a very

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.669 
to consume more energy so there's a very
real<00:02:09.300> cost<00:02:09.599> involved

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
real cost involved

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.119 
real cost involved
with<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.099> increase<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.700> city<00:02:12.239> heat<00:02:12.709> but<00:02:13.709> it

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
with this increase in city heat but it

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.199 
with this increase in city heat but it
seems<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.430> we<00:02:14.519> might<00:02:14.640> be<00:02:14.760> able<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.970> solve

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
seems like we might be able to solve

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.180 
seems like we might be able to solve
that<00:02:15.360> maybe<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.709> bucket<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.069> white

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
that maybe with just a bucket of white

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.729 
that maybe with just a bucket of white
paint<00:02:17.400> yeah<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.940> really<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.720> easy<00:02:18.930> all

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
paint yeah it really is that easy all

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.380 
paint yeah it really is that easy all
you<00:02:19.890> would<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.159> to<00:02:20.220> do<00:02:20.549> is<00:02:20.849> paint<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
you would have to do is paint the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.350 
you would have to do is paint the
rooftops<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.290> city<00:02:22.500> white<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:24.209> would

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
rooftops of a city white and you would

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.149 
rooftops of a city white and you would
be<00:02:24.569> absorbing<00:02:25.049> less<00:02:25.260> light<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.890> would<00:02:26.040> be

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
be absorbing less light you would be

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.490 
be absorbing less light you would be
emitting<00:02:26.610> less<00:02:27.150> heat<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.349> would

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
emitting less heat and that would

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.009 
emitting less heat and that would
probably<00:02:28.769> be<00:02:28.890> about<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.220> 1<00:02:29.489> degree<00:02:29.959> drop<00:02:30.959> in

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
probably be about a 1 degree drop in

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.960 
probably be about a 1 degree drop in
temperature<00:02:31.260> which<00:02:32.069> I<00:02:32.310> mean<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:32.489> could<00:02:32.730> save

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
temperature which I mean that could save

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.729 
temperature which I mean that could save
millions<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.629> dollars<00:02:33.690> right<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.590> doesn't

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
millions of dollars right it doesn't

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.080 
millions of dollars right it doesn't
sound<00:02:35.040> like<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> lot<00:02:35.459> but<00:02:35.519> when<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.819> start

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
sound like a lot but when you start

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.550 
sound like a lot but when you start
looking<00:02:36.120> at<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> energy<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:36.989> takes<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.260> cool<00:02:37.530> a

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
looking at the energy it takes to cool a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.000 
looking at the energy it takes to cool a
city<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.099> really<00:02:38.670> has<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> huge<00:02:39.269> impact<00:02:39.860> here<00:02:40.860> on

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
city it really has a huge impact here on

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.350 
city it really has a huge impact here on
earth<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.340> little<00:02:41.579> white<00:02:41.760> paint<00:02:42.120> could

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
earth a little white paint could

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.210 
earth a little white paint could
potentially<00:02:42.810> cool<00:02:43.019> down<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> city<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:44.099> out

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
potentially cool down a city but out

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.490 
potentially cool down a city but out
here<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.459> space<00:02:44.879> it<00:02:45.390> might<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.780> save<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
here in space it might just save the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.050 
here in space it might just save the
planet<00:02:46.769> yeah<00:02:47.190> but<00:02:47.370> before<00:02:47.519> we<00:02:47.819> talk<00:02:47.970> about

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
planet yeah but before we talk about

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.759 
planet yeah but before we talk about
saving<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.510> planet<00:02:48.629> let's<00:02:48.930> talk<00:02:49.200> about<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
saving the planet let's talk about the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.949 
saving the planet let's talk about the
way<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.160> light<00:02:50.459> behaves<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.569> void<00:02:51.780> of

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
way that light behaves in the void of

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:52.670 
way that light behaves in the void of
space

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
space

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.130 
space
sunlight<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.400> made<00:02:53.640> up<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.879> photons<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.930> when

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
sunlight is made up of photons so when

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.470 
sunlight is made up of photons so when
sunlight<00:02:55.349> hits<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.890> reflective<00:02:56.430> surface<00:02:56.480> it

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
sunlight hits a reflective surface it

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.509 
sunlight hits a reflective surface it
bounces<00:02:58.019> those<00:02:58.230> photons<00:02:58.709> off<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.280> actually

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
bounces those photons off and actually

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.550 
bounces those photons off and actually
exerts<00:02:59.819> a<00:03:00.000> force<00:03:00.209> not<00:03:00.840> unlike<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.319> wind

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
exerts a force not unlike the wind

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.830 
exerts a force not unlike the wind
behind<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:02.040> sail<00:03:02.310> right<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.359> is<00:03:03.569> called

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
behind a sail right and this is called

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.800 
behind a sail right and this is called
solar<00:03:04.230> sail<00:03:04.709> technology<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.909> idea<00:03:06.480> is

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
solar sail technology and the idea is

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.780 
solar sail technology and the idea is
that<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:07.379> could<00:03:07.530> use<00:03:07.829> this<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.159> propel

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
that we could use this to propel

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.030 
that we could use this to propel
spacecraft<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:10.019> we<00:03:10.290> could<00:03:10.440> save<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.769> planet

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
spacecraft and we could save the planet

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.759 
spacecraft and we could save the planet
and<00:03:11.370> here's<00:03:11.609> how<00:03:11.819> imagine<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> earth<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.349> now

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
and here's how imagine the earth and now

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.009 
and here's how imagine the earth and now
imagine<00:03:14.250> an<00:03:14.400> asteroid<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.880> deadly<00:03:15.359> asteroid<00:03:15.750> on

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
imagine an asteroid a deadly asteroid on

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.379 
imagine an asteroid a deadly asteroid on
a<00:03:16.049> collision<00:03:16.109> course<00:03:16.650> with<00:03:17.160> our<00:03:17.340> planet<00:03:17.489> what

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
a collision course with our planet what

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.180 
a collision course with our planet what
we<00:03:18.510> want<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.109> nudge<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.560> slightly<00:03:19.950> off

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
we want to do is nudge it slightly off

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.729 
we want to do is nudge it slightly off
course<00:03:20.700> so<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.389> doesn't<00:03:21.720> hit<00:03:21.840> us<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.200> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
course so that it doesn't hit us and the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.500 
course so that it doesn't hit us and the
way<00:03:22.859> that<00:03:23.040> we<00:03:23.130> could<00:03:23.280> do<00:03:23.459> this<00:03:23.639> one<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.299> several

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
way that we could do this one of several

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.780 
way that we could do this one of several
ways<00:03:24.720> we<00:03:24.900> could<00:03:25.019> do<00:03:25.139> this<00:03:25.349> would<00:03:25.829> be<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:26.040> code

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
ways we could do this would be to code

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.869 
ways we could do this would be to code
it<00:03:26.940> with<00:03:27.120> white<00:03:27.389> paint<00:03:27.660> or<00:03:27.930> some<00:03:28.379> sort<00:03:28.560> of

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
it with white paint or some sort of

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.000 
it with white paint or some sort of
reflective<00:03:29.879> substance<00:03:30.690> so<00:03:31.260> then<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.620> photons

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
reflective substance so then the photons

reflective substance so then the photons
would<00:03:32.190> hit<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.639> substance<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.419> bounce<00:03:34.230> off

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
would hit this substance and bounce off

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.220 
would hit this substance and bounce off
pushing<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> asteroid<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.239> an<00:03:36.690> off<00:03:36.870> course

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
pushing the asteroid just an off course

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.890 
pushing the asteroid just an off course
enough<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.799> wear<00:03:37.950> with<00:03:38.190> missus<00:03:38.639> now<00:03:39.569> think

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
enough to wear with missus now think

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.360 
enough to wear with missus now think
back<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.379> simple<00:03:40.530> experiment<00:03:41.129> that<00:03:41.160> we

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
back to that simple experiment that we

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.970 
back to that simple experiment that we
did<00:03:41.579> put<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.090> glass<00:03:42.449> of<00:03:42.629> water<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.290> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
did put that glass of water and the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.189 
did put that glass of water and the
sunlight<00:03:44.280> streaming<00:03:44.790> through<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.449> and<00:03:45.660> now

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
sunlight streaming through it and now

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.990 
sunlight streaming through it and now
think<00:03:46.470> about<00:03:46.560> how<00:03:46.709> we<00:03:46.919> can<00:03:47.190> actually<00:03:47.220> harness

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
think about how we can actually harness

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.809 
think about how we can actually harness
that<00:03:48.180> light<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:49.079> do<00:03:49.230> amazing<00:03:49.620> things<00:03:50.160> here<00:03:50.669> on

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
that light to do amazing things here on

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.780 
that light to do amazing things here on
earth<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.329> in<00:03:51.599> space
