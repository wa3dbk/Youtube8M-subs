also for electric car with this size and
therefore<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.729> some

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
therefore we have to have some

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
therefore we have to have some

this<00:01:37.830> model<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.700> would<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> take<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
this model we would like to take this

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.190 
this model we would like to take this

how<00:01:43.650> electric<00:01:44.370> cars<00:01:44.640> works<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.390> therefore<00:01:46.020> we

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
how electric cars works and therefore we

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.380 
how electric cars works and therefore we
have<00:01:47.370> an<00:01:47.490> insight<00:01:47.970> into<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.630> whole

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
have an insight into the whole

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.969 
have an insight into the whole
components<00:01:51.390> which<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> necessary<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.770> an

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
components which is necessary for an

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
components which is necessary for an
electric<00:01:53.430> car<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.240> specific<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.140> see

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
electric car and in specific you can see

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.039 
electric car and in specific you can see
how<00:01:55.979> large<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.610> high<00:01:57.030> wattage<00:01:57.240> battery<00:01:57.750> is

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
how large the high wattage battery is

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.750 
how large the high wattage battery is
which<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.590> fitted<00:01:58.860> underneath<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.580> cap

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
which is fitted underneath of the cap

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.179 
which is fitted underneath of the cap
and<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.750> how<00:02:00.960> does<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.290> electric<00:02:01.680> drive<00:02:01.799> work

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and so how does the electric drive work

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.030 
and so how does the electric drive work
the<00:02:03.000> electric<00:02:03.330> drive<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.140> v2e<00:02:04.409> cell<00:02:04.740> works

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the electric drive of the v2e cell works

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.280 
the electric drive of the v2e cell works
in<00:02:05.220> this<00:02:05.340> case<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.600> store<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.080> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
in this case so we store all of the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.259 
in this case so we store all of the
energy<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> high<00:02:08.039> voltage<00:02:08.369> battery<00:02:08.549> we<00:02:09.060> go

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
energy in the high voltage battery we go

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.210 
energy in the high voltage battery we go
through<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> inverter<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.769> electrical

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
through the inverter to the electrical

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.800 
through the inverter to the electrical
engine<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:12.769> drive<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.980> car

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
engine to drive the car

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.590 
engine to drive the car
and<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.230> another<00:02:15.560> case<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:16.340> use<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.940> braking

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
and in another case to use the braking

and in another case to use the braking
energy<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:18.410> generate<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.130> recuperation<00:02:19.450> to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
energy to generate the recuperation to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.390 
energy to generate the recuperation to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
battery we have served as a way to came

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.580 
battery we have served as a way to came
from<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.209> electrical<00:02:26.780> engine<00:02:27.140> over<00:02:27.470> the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
inverter back to the better now I'd love

inverter back to the better now I'd love
to<00:02:33.530> give<00:02:33.770> it<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.890> test<00:02:34.069> drive<00:02:34.160> come<00:02:34.640> on<00:02:34.760> let's<00:02:34.970> go

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.520 

the<00:02:52.190> vita<00:02:52.550> e<00:02:52.910> cell<00:02:53.150> crew<00:02:53.450> bus<00:02:53.630> is<00:02:53.900> really

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
the vita e cell crew bus is really

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.180 
the vita e cell crew bus is really
first-rate

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
first-rate

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.630 
first-rate
it's<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:56.000> quiet<00:02:56.269> is<00:02:56.750> serene<00:02:57.260> it's<00:02:58.010> just<00:02:58.489> what

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
it's so quiet is serene it's just what

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.670 
it's so quiet is serene it's just what
you<00:02:58.760> need<00:02:58.970> after<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.720> long<00:03:00.050> day<00:03:00.260> at<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.410> Motor

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
you need after a long day at the Motor

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.559 
you need after a long day at the Motor
Show

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569
