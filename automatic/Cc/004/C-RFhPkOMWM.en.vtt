I upgrade hecker rims abilities first I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.789 
I upgrade hecker rims abilities first I
start<00:01:25.610> with<00:01:25.700> my<00:01:25.759> W<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.869> deals<00:01:27.140> better<00:01:27.380> damage

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
start with my W it deals better damage

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.859

to<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.070> starting<00:01:28.400> creeps<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.909> helps<00:01:29.570> return

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
to the starting creeps and helps return

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.530 
to the starting creeps and helps return
health<00:01:30.170> back<00:01:30.439> to<00:01:30.650> heck<00:01:31.090> after<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:32.299> usually

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
health back to heck after that I usually

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.080 
health back to heck after that I usually
build<00:01:32.990> my<00:01:33.140> cue<00:01:33.470> as<00:01:33.590> often<00:01:33.950> as<00:01:34.070> possible<00:01:34.159> saving

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
build my cue as often as possible saving

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:45.280 
build my cue as often as possible saving
my<00:01:36.670> e46<00:01:42.430> for<00:01:43.430> ganks<00:01:43.759> and<00:01:43.939> doing<00:01:44.540> this<00:01:44.720> actually

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
my e46 for ganks and doing this actually

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.590 
my e46 for ganks and doing this actually
allows<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:46.040> take<00:01:46.250> your<00:01:46.460> cue<00:01:46.820> twice<00:01:47.299> before

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
allows you to take your cue twice before

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.469 
allows you to take your cue twice before
you<00:01:47.899> even<00:01:48.079> need<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.530> take<00:01:48.740> your<00:01:48.890> E<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.820> I<00:01:50.270> found

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
you even need to take your E and I found

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.960 
you even need to take your E and I found
that<00:01:50.659> that<00:01:50.840> helps<00:01:51.259> with<00:01:51.619> early<00:01:52.100> jungling<00:01:52.700> and

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
that that helps with early jungling and

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.090 
that that helps with early jungling and
mana<00:01:53.570> management<00:01:54.170> next<00:01:54.680> let's<00:01:54.829> talk<00:01:54.950> about

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
mana management next let's talk about

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.030
