00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
to set those times at and you could also

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.910 
to set those times at and you could also
have<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> warmup<00:02:00.600> time<00:02:00.810> which<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:01.259> how

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
have it have a warmup time which is how

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.090 
have it have a warmup time which is how
long<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:02.100> takes<00:02:02.399> before<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.819> goes<00:02:03.149> off<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.380> this

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
long it takes before it goes off so this

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.340 
long it takes before it goes off so this
is<00:02:05.130> pretty<00:02:05.340> nice<00:02:06.200> that's<00:02:07.429> my<00:02:08.429> brief
