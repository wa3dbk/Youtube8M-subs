dark green rare color most notably I'd
say<00:01:02.239> would<00:01:02.480> be<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:02.659> wheel<00:01:02.929> arches<00:01:03.230> which<00:01:03.559> some

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
say would be the wheel arches which some

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.740 
say would be the wheel arches which some
of<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:03.949> may<00:01:04.159> recognize<00:01:04.699> as<00:01:05.269> being<00:01:05.300> a

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
of you may recognize as being a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.820 
of you may recognize as being a
windscreen<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:06.470> we've<00:01:06.560> done<00:01:06.680> in

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
way from the back to the front we've

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.429 
way from the back to the front we've
actually<00:01:50.420> used<00:01:50.659> an<00:01:50.750> interesting<00:01:51.109> building

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
actually used an interesting building

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.469 
actually used an interesting building
technique<00:01:51.799> down<00:01:52.009> here<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:53.030> some<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:53.329> guys

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
technique down here but some of you guys

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.880 
technique down here but some of you guys
will<00:01:53.689> understand<00:01:54.259> that<00:01:54.439> when<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.619> build<00:01:54.740> that

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
will understand that when you build that

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.219 
will understand that when you build that
