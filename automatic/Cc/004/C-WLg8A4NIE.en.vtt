00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.530
 and here we are with the going 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.230
 well with material the shooting of our pipeline conditions 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.370
 the quality of the fairly exceptional Emilian image certainly Milan 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.660
 and then this usually still sets a roof for other sports a 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.869
 the hypothesis for example 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.460
 and I need more renders 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.710
 this final image will be a monster monster 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.599
 and let's go save. photo and we could thus create 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.470
 let's say the on-board structure shield now anyway the fool as nice 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.810
 created 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.760
 to be able to hypothesize 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.100
 wind meets connelly mastiffs in the shadows 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.700
 don't go create 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.490
 other outputs 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.410
 to do this let's go to the rendering section 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.790
 we sell create 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.120
 another 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.240
 holland rock photo 3 special special passes 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.750
 in that case what would definitely not be nearly tonight anyway 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.900
 all render we're going to create internal and external CDs or whatever 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.820
 via projects and constructions 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.620
 will be that 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.500
 the open 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.710
 allow 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.630
 the ambient occlusion 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.460
 to do this but 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.960
 manga first to select from ros but they are disciplines on the preview 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.860
 ample topical use site environment you will see 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.290
 the result 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 maybe let's go mint make more days together 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 nitro shuttles decidedly too much 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.720
 1 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.970
 football penis I don't know about you but 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.970
 pretty exaggerated creatures then 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.300
 meter to comment a little on the gel 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.070
 in this case 50 could also be fine 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.729
 100 we quietly hide other 2 appart. to carry out 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.480
 ours is our vender of this 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.480
 precisely that of the put 15 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.510
 certainly very fast in this case we have not even commented 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.439
 the quality of the saint asquini 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.209
 we will have a very torn but still image 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.209
 that's enough to make the idea short 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.779
 having done this we will save these imagined parts of the world apart 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:38.140
 and we're going to create 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.969
 and others 2 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.999
 output 1 re assoc. that you get there then for 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.469
 create masks 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.859
 to avoid 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.930
 also affect the contrast on lighting on the footage of 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.849
 our plan that must be completely bare salt 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.849
 but here it goes to simply change our object 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.069
 she and I have already created this from saved in this case they close 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.730
 activo park photo ucpa best with our mind of 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.730
 hide the plan 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.009
 because I am only interested in the screen so scrubs so much the 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:19.229
 our agent's mask I can take the boobs. simple 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.969
 when I'm this too 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:26.109
 then there are other cars all very interesting and very useful for 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.669
 aams tend to inactivity only these simple projects as in this one 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:31.499
 case 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.479
 we could also go to use them anyway 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.829
 inter but above all with regards to 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.079
 the reflections I like kluson present or 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:47.809
 but in this case later with or is a reflex file sharing and so on 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.049
 we cannot do what I earn for now, I just create my own 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:53.740
 bed 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.259
 a consultant for this horrendous 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:59.259
 perfection facebook sharing 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.859
 we are a bit 'this point I hope to connect 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.959
 And with you 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.939
 question was to emphasize the reflections 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.299
 here we play to make our certain. perfectly much more 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.079
 in short, there is a montottone side dish 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.019
 resulting mini diamantino. with comment 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.530
 in short, all these these under our will go 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.219
 import all our photoshop hair images 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:31.429
 and therefore andre dead to finalize our image 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.030
 here we are now in the photo shop so we have only made one way to the 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.879
 shiena as well as 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:46.300
 not even out of our way of rendering engine 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.240
 we created 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.240
 a render place suitable for shading dinner 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.719
 an alpha proof is horrible great doc luciani 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.580
 let's start by giving maybe 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.240
 the scene is somewhat contrasted 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.870
 for this thing we will not use the alpha irflex imperfection shelling 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.569
 and select 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.029
 we copy it and paste it into our choice 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.039
 as you can see we also have a background in this case I do not care for me 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.439
 only interested in using the object 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:19.270
 let's see how to create a mask 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.659
 to do this we have it in the oven 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.759
 let's copy our alpha channel 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.860
 let's create a mask on our level 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.949
 in the channels we go to mother-in-law to paste 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.559
 what we have achieved 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:37.189
 we return 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:39.639
 in our main scene with you see 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.020
 red has been applied to its object 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.809
 let's go to 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:46.180
 to set 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.559
 up over her 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:52.379
 a true story we are going to dance hard opacity 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.750
 in this case we will be able to stay around 46% 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
 if we see giarre effect it changes considerably 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:05.009
 now let's go to give even more we don't reduce a cube a little because too much 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.589
 for now even more character and don't hesitate to shell 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:14.369
 in its entirety we take copy 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.290
 silver to which they send it past it 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:21.909
 in this case we apply 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.039
 or mahogany - multiplayer respect 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.949
 good morning to me anyway 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.279
 does not mention moncler house 8 March. everything 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.509
 it may interest you more than you want to characterize 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:37.379
 image 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.219
 slowly dies 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.249
 the place so also reduce slightly low intensity 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.830
 this year, as they left 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:53.029
 the remaining territory 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:58.530
 printing naturally in the image and beauty to render from the character 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:00.069
 purely longare 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:05.439
 increasing the brightness contrast picnik an instrument an extra seat 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.009
 whatever else exposure so on 

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:14.580
 well% of the word will be able to save the finished splendor 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.029
 thank you for having 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:22.199
 viewed soldier this video yesterday I remind you to join the channel and there 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:22.589
 let's see the next one
