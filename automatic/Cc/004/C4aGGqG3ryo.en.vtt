00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
like I wasn't paying attention at all

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.660 
like I wasn't paying attention at all
but<00:01:08.930> I<00:01:09.140> think<00:01:09.260> it's<00:01:10.010> shiny<00:01:12.010> if<00:01:13.010> it's<00:01:13.190> not<00:01:13.340> shiny

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
but I think it's shiny if it's not shiny

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.290 
but I think it's shiny if it's not shiny
then<00:01:15.040> then<00:01:16.040> I<00:01:16.190> I'm<00:01:16.580> an<00:01:16.820> idiot<00:01:16.940> but<00:01:19.000> III<00:01:20.000> think

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
then then I I'm an idiot but III think

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.950 
then then I I'm an idiot but III think
it's<00:01:20.690> shiny<00:01:21.730> togepi<00:01:22.730> is<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.030> hard<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.360> tell<00:01:23.570> I

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's shiny togepi is so hard to tell I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.920 
it's shiny togepi is so hard to tell I
think<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.190> blue<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.700> reds<00:01:25.940> are<00:01:26.210> like<00:01:26.480> old

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
think the blue and the reds are like old

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.270 
think the blue and the reds are like old
the<00:01:27.080> blue<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.500> red<00:01:27.530> triangles<00:01:28.160> and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
the blue and the red triangles and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.150 
the blue and the red triangles and
squares<00:01:28.370> on<00:01:28.760> its<00:01:28.910> body<00:01:29.120> so<00:01:29.840> like<00:01:30.620> switch<00:01:30.950> out

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
squares on its body so like switch out

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.820 
squares on its body so like switch out
with<00:01:31.460> each<00:01:31.580> other<00:01:31.870> as<00:01:32.870> far<00:01:33.110> as<00:01:33.260> coloration<00:01:33.770> is

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
with each other as far as coloration is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.080 
with each other as far as coloration is
concerned<00:01:34.190> and<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:35.570> think<00:01:36.560> its<00:01:37.220> skin<00:01:37.760> becomes

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
concerned and I think its skin becomes

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.770 
concerned and I think its skin becomes
like<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.360> little<00:01:38.810> bit<00:01:39.020> Pinker<00:01:39.530> or<00:01:39.740> Tanner<00:01:40.070> and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
like a little bit Pinker or Tanner and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.740 
like a little bit Pinker or Tanner and
it<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:42.050> looks<00:01:42.290> shiny<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.370> I<00:01:43.880> don't<00:01:43.940> know<00:01:44.510> and

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
it just looks shiny and I don't know and

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.200 
it just looks shiny and I don't know and
I<00:01:44.840> feel<00:01:45.050> like<00:01:45.200> an<00:01:45.350> idiot<00:01:45.530> but<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.280> wasn't<00:01:46.940> paying

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
I feel like an idiot but I wasn't paying

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.300 
I feel like an idiot but I wasn't paying
attention<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.900> wasn't<00:01:48.620> expecting<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:49.160> showing

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310
