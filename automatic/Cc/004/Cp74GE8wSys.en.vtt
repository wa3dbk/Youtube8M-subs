bars in this case here turning up in
Manhattan<00:02:51.590> they're<00:02:52.220> supposed<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.849> be

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
Manhattan they're supposed to be

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.660 
Manhattan they're supposed to be
legitimate<00:02:53.569> they<00:02:54.109> have<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.680> same<00:02:55.040> weight<00:02:55.370> so

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
legitimate they have that same weight so

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.720 
legitimate they have that same weight so
it's<00:02:55.819> really<00:02:56.150> tricky<00:02:56.629> but<00:02:57.470> here<00:02:58.159> we<00:02:58.340> are<00:02:58.370> and

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
it's really tricky but here we are and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.809 
it's really tricky but here we are and
this<00:02:59.329> is<00:02:59.569> basically<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:01.040> goes<00:03:01.190> on<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.579> on<00:03:01.670> you

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
this is basically it goes on and on you

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.420 
this is basically it goes on and on you
can<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.150> search<00:03:02.420> in<00:03:02.599> tungsten<00:03:03.230> gold<00:03:03.260> bar<00:03:03.920> and

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
can just search in tungsten gold bar and

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.670 
can just search in tungsten gold bar and
you<00:03:04.519> get<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.730> whole<00:03:05.209> bunch<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:06.019> incidents<00:03:06.500> where

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
you get a whole bunch of incidents where

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.759 
you get a whole bunch of incidents where
this<00:03:06.829> has<00:03:07.010> happened<00:03:07.040> in<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.639> recent<00:03:08.060> past

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
this has happened in the recent past

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.860 
this has happened in the recent past
this<00:03:09.769> is<00:03:10.069> part<00:03:10.519> of<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.670> world<00:03:10.879> old<00:03:11.299> council

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
this is part of the world old council

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.210 
this is part of the world old council
have<00:03:11.989> talked<00:03:12.230> about<00:03:12.349> them<00:03:12.620> before<00:03:12.769> but

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
have talked about them before but

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.990 
have talked about them before but
basically<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.940> can<00:03:14.090> go<00:03:14.299> in<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.720> can<00:03:14.870> set<00:03:15.200> up

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
basically you can go in you can set up

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.059 
basically you can go in you can set up
you<00:03:17.000> know<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.269> they<00:03:17.389> email<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:18.109> every<00:03:18.349> quarter

you know so they email you every quarter
they<00:03:19.220> send<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.639> gold<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.419> man<00:03:20.660> that's

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
they send you the gold the man that's

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.569 
they send you the gold the man that's
happening<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:21.590> can<00:03:21.739> see<00:03:21.769> right<00:03:22.129> here<00:03:22.160> for

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
happening you can see right here for

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.539 
happening you can see right here for
yourself<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.510> have<00:03:23.620> every<00:03:24.620> single<00:03:25.220> quarter

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
yourself you have every single quarter

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.879 
yourself you have every single quarter
after<00:03:25.849> quarter<00:03:26.680> physical<00:03:27.680> demand<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.819> just

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
after quarter physical demand is just

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.939 
after quarter physical demand is just
continuous<00:03:30.889> continuous<00:03:31.400> now<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.780> may<00:03:33.049> vary

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
continuous continuous now it may vary

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.250 
continuous continuous now it may vary
from<00:03:34.579> quarter<00:03:35.329> to<00:03:35.480> quarter<00:03:35.690> but<00:03:36.049> there's

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
from quarter to quarter but there's

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.259 
from quarter to quarter but there's
always<00:03:36.799> demand<00:03:37.190> there<00:03:37.459> while<00:03:37.699> the<00:03:37.819> price<00:03:38.090> may

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
always demand there while the price may

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.210 
always demand there while the price may
drop<00:03:38.540> significantly<00:03:38.859> you'll<00:03:39.859> see<00:03:40.069> the

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
drop significantly you'll see the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.430 
drop significantly you'll see the
physical<00:03:40.639> demand<00:03:41.000> may<00:03:41.629> actually<00:03:41.870> go<00:03:42.199> up

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
physical demand may actually go up

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.800 
physical demand may actually go up
sometimes<00:03:43.069> so<00:03:43.549> it's<00:03:43.730> pretty<00:03:43.940> tricky<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.629> way

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
sometimes so it's pretty tricky the way

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.020 
sometimes so it's pretty tricky the way
they<00:03:45.019> do<00:03:45.079> this<00:03:45.440> they<00:03:45.859> manipulate<00:03:46.579> that<00:03:46.699> price

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
they do this they manipulate that price

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.210 
they do this they manipulate that price
it<00:03:47.239> is<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.629> futures<00:03:48.379> market<00:03:48.919> not<00:03:49.190> the

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
it is the futures market not the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.500

this<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.530> reality<00:03:58.250> here<00:03:58.699> is<00:03:58.879> that<00:03:59.120> mines

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
this is the reality here is that mines

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.259 
this is the reality here is that mines
are<00:04:00.049> closing<00:04:00.739> I'll<00:04:01.069> get<00:04:01.310> into<00:04:01.430> more<00:04:01.730> examples

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
are closing I'll get into more examples

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.409 
are closing I'll get into more examples
but<00:04:02.449> mines<00:04:03.199> are<00:04:03.470> closing<00:04:04.099> simply<00:04:05.030> because

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
but mines are closing simply because

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.530 
but mines are closing simply because
they<00:04:05.690> cannot<00:04:06.169> be<00:04:06.470> they<00:04:06.919> can't<00:04:07.159> afford<00:04:07.310> them<00:04:08.299> to

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
they cannot be they can't afford them to

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.750 
they cannot be they can't afford them to
stay<00:04:08.780> open<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:09.829> they're<00:04:10.010> gonna<00:04:10.159> close<00:04:10.549> the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
stay open so they're gonna close the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.369 
stay open so they're gonna close the
mines<00:04:11.000> mines<00:04:11.299> you're<00:04:11.449> gonna<00:04:11.569> dry<00:04:11.930> up<00:04:11.959> they're

mines mines you're gonna dry up they're

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:13.899 
mines mines you're gonna dry up they're
just<00:04:12.530> going<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.680> shut<00:04:12.949> them<00:04:13.159> down<00:04:13.190> instead<00:04:13.819> of

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
just going to shut them down instead of

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.360 
just going to shut them down instead of
opening<00:04:14.389> up<00:04:14.540> new<00:04:14.780> ones<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.260> if<00:04:15.739> you<00:04:15.949> don't<00:04:16.159> see

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
opening up new ones and if you don't see

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.520 
opening up new ones and if you don't see
an<00:04:16.489> issue<00:04:16.669> with<00:04:17.060> this<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:18.049> know<00:04:18.139> you<00:04:18.229> really

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
an issue with this you know you really

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.699 
an issue with this you know you really
have<00:04:18.769> to<00:04:18.889> look<00:04:19.010> into<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.459> when<00:04:19.609> you<00:04:19.699> have

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
have to look into it when you have

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.560 
have to look into it when you have
thousands<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.799> tons<00:04:22.159> every<00:04:22.430> single<00:04:23.300> year

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
thousands of tons every single year

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.750 
thousands of tons every single year
being<00:04:24.050> purchased<00:04:24.320> by<00:04:24.500> central<00:04:25.010> banks<00:04:25.039> being

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
being purchased by central banks being

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.920 
being purchased by central banks being
purchased<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.419> be

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
purchased to be

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.230 
purchased to be
consumed<00:04:27.620> like<00:04:28.160> in<00:04:28.310> China<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.850> India<00:04:29.150> for

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
consumed like in China and India for

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.710 
consumed like in China and India for
example<00:04:29.860> then<00:04:30.860> this<00:04:31.760> really<00:04:32.150> becomes<00:04:32.630> a

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
example then this really becomes a

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.510 
example then this really becomes a
problem<00:04:32.750> has<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.740> mines<00:04:33.950> are<00:04:34.130> shutting<00:04:34.370> down

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
problem has the mines are shutting down

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.210 
problem has the mines are shutting down
as<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.330> ones<00:04:35.600> are<00:04:35.780> drying<00:04:36.080> up<00:04:36.410> they're<00:04:36.920> not

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
as the ones are drying up they're not

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.520 
as the ones are drying up they're not
opening<00:04:37.940> up<00:04:38.090> new<00:04:38.300> mines<00:04:38.570> because<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.230> price

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
opening up new mines because the price

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.590 
opening up new mines because the price
is<00:04:39.770> just<00:04:40.010> too<00:04:40.520> low<00:04:40.760> right<00:04:41.060> now<00:04:41.270> they're<00:04:41.510> at

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
is just too low right now they're at

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.080 
is just too low right now they're at
that<00:04:41.780> price<00:04:42.140> right<00:04:42.890> around<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.310> range<00:04:43.610> where

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
that price right around that range where

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.730 
that price right around that range where
basically<00:04:44.690> they're<00:04:45.050> not<00:04:45.080> going<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.470> make<00:04:45.590> any

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
basically they're not going to make any

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.220 
basically they're not going to make any
profit<00:04:46.250> so<00:04:46.430> why<00:04:46.730> would<00:04:47.060> they<00:04:47.240> continue<00:04:48.170> to

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
profit so why would they continue to

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.540 
profit so why would they continue to
open<00:04:48.620> up<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.890> mines<00:04:50.350> right<00:04:51.350> here<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:52.250> is<00:04:52.400> the

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
open up the mines right here this is the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.850 
open up the mines right here this is the
mining<00:04:53.270> Canada<00:04:54.020> talking<00:04:54.470> about<00:04:54.650> several

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
mining Canada talking about several

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.610 
mining Canada talking about several
mines<00:04:55.190> of<00:04:55.990> Canadian<00:04:56.990> gold<00:04:57.110> mines<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.560> have

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
mines of Canadian gold mines that have

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.890 
mines of Canadian gold mines that have
closed<00:04:58.070> as<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.340> result<00:04:58.760> of<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:58.970> low<00:04:59.210> gold<00:04:59.540> price

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
closed as a result of the low gold price

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.440 
closed as a result of the low gold price
and<00:05:00.230> exhausted<00:05:00.860> over<00:05:01.100> reserves<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:02.060> can<00:05:02.270> go

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
and exhausted over reserves you can go

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.060 
and exhausted over reserves you can go
on<00:05:02.630> further<00:05:03.080> if<00:05:03.230> you<00:05:03.320> want<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.650> take<00:05:03.740> a<00:05:03.770> look<00:05:03.950> at

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
on further if you want to take a look at

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.330 
on further if you want to take a look at
this

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
this

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.580 
this
but<00:05:04.670> essentially<00:05:05.090> mines<00:05:05.780> are<00:05:06.050> closing<00:05:06.470> down

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
but essentially mines are closing down

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.250 
but essentially mines are closing down
it's<00:05:06.860> been<00:05:07.040> going<00:05:07.430> on<00:05:07.730> throughout<00:05:08.540> this<00:05:08.930> bull

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
it's been going on throughout this bull

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.940 
it's been going on throughout this bull
market<00:05:09.290> so<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.890> price<00:05:10.160> can<00:05:10.580> be<00:05:10.610> pushed<00:05:11.180> up<00:05:11.450> in

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
market so the price can be pushed up in

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.130 
market so the price can be pushed up in
reality<00:05:12.950> if<00:05:13.520> you're<00:05:14.000> talking<00:05:14.450> about<00:05:14.570> just<00:05:15.020> a

you have mines closing down that's just

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.920 
you have mines closing down that's just

is<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:45.740> computer<00:05:46.280> algorithms<00:05:47.030> that's

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
is the computer algorithms that's

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.570 
is the computer algorithms that's
something<00:05:48.080> I<00:05:48.169> talked<00:05:48.410> about<00:05:48.530> in<00:05:48.950> the<00:05:49.430> money

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
something I talked about in the money

something I talked about in the money
GPS<00:05:50.090> insiders<00:05:50.750> where<00:05:51.410> basically<00:05:51.919> this<00:05:52.790> is<00:05:53.090> the

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
GPS insiders where basically this is the

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.980 
GPS insiders where basically this is the
flash<00:05:54.200> crash<00:05:54.710> where<00:05:55.040> they<00:05:55.160> can<00:05:55.400> just<00:05:55.750> set<00:05:56.750> off

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
flash crash where they can just set off

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.710 
flash crash where they can just set off
a<00:05:57.380> trigger<00:05:57.800> and<00:05:58.100> all<00:05:58.460> of<00:05:58.940> a<00:05:59.030> sudden<00:05:59.060> they<00:05:59.540> can

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
a trigger and all of a sudden they can

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.870 
a trigger and all of a sudden they can
evaporate<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.650> stock<00:06:00.890> market<00:06:01.310> they<00:06:01.400> can<00:06:01.520> buy

evaporate the stock market they can buy

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.570 
evaporate the stock market they can buy
it<00:06:01.940> back<00:06:02.240> up<00:06:02.510> so<00:06:02.540> quickly<00:06:03.200> this<00:06:04.040> is<00:06:04.250> what<00:06:04.460> the

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
it back up so quickly this is what the

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.640 
it back up so quickly this is what the
paper<00:06:04.820> markets<00:06:05.300> are<00:06:05.450> but<00:06:05.690> if<00:06:05.810> you<00:06:05.990> hold<00:06:06.320> real

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
paper markets are but if you hold real

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.430 
paper markets are but if you hold real
