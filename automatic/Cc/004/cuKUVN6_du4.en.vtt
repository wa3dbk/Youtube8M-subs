00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hi, how are you? I'm very happy 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.139
 to be here again with you in 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.120
 we really missed a lot then 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.639
 then week I was super busy 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.890
 I finished I prepared then I'm 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.900
 super super happy and good too 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.840
 I was super busy because like some 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 that you will know my son is going to fulfill three 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 years the other week then we are 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.170
 well rushed it sounds like very 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.880
 simple but it really takes you 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.619
 enough time then I come 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.059
 preparing from three months 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.949
 and good if you want to know a little more about 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.420
 that I visit to leave my blog channel 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.390
 in case you want to go see why be 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.339
 uploading blogs there that day but good 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.110
 I'm here and today I bring you a video 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.180
 that I know will help you a lot 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.159
 these ideas take them out of pinter is 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.930
 because I know some ask you 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.420
 where that comedy was here and I saw it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.760
 hisham is a super cool idea because 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.949
 do if it's just me or you too 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.830
 it happened to them that the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.330
 horrible cell phone headsets no longer 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.670
 you realize and they are done steering wheel 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.159
 It takes a thousand years to unravel them 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.260
 and it's a good thing but I bring you a 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.969
 super father idea so you do not get tangled 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.150
 our hearing aids and we stop suffering 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.090
 that they like very much because they come here 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.410
 and females are using a lot and they 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.270
 I won over my social networks because there 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.520
 is where I am as most in touch with 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.110
 you talked a little more to 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.390
 you are asking me about the raffle 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.150
 of the backpacks soon I'll do it 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.040
 at the beginning of August I already believe what 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.500
 I'm planning very well because I want 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.240
 that is international and national 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.970
 so I'm seeing that so 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.710
 I'll wait a little longer and I swear to you 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.020
 be very soon so then yes 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.020
 they want to see this video you can see 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.439
 good as we all know hearing aids 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.960
 they are some of the ugliest things in the world 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.210
 and the most difficult thing is like they get entangled 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.340
 are you ready you can go to sleep at 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.100
 take it super well and the next day 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.640
 awakening and facts are published 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.110
 they are super tangled 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.729
 this is really a disaster and the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.149
 truth is that it is something that stresses me 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.130
 very much that just now awake 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.680
 some ideas that will save your life and 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.160
 that they are going to avoid this kind of thing 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.160
 unpleasant 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.549
 let's fix with the first idea and this 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.500
 is for when we charge our cell phone 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.080
 and it's not all bulky everywhere 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.049
 you are going to need a bottle that has 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.209
 this way and make it more or less more 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.879
 large that the size of your phone is 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.310
 the one of a detergent also need 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.930
 a decorated ribbon is I bought it a 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.299
 very large stationery that is called 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.920
 addabbo and is here in Mexico and the 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.370
 truth is that super cheap and there are many 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.370
 designs 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.480
 and bar since we have this let's trace 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.240
 in the bottle a line pretty much like that 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.120
 that we're going to cut that line and that's what 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.430
 to be to put our cell phone 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.349
 and so be very careful when cutting it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.390
 because as it is plastic it is super hard 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.140
 so if you're very small ask for help 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.140
 to an adult 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.750
 also remember to cut off the part of 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.990
 up and something like that we have to stay 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.750
 to take the decorated ribbon and we're going to 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.310
 paste it currando the whole bottle if it is 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.070
 that you do not like the color because you can 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.600
 until painting it with paint or with leaves 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.210
 You can also erase it but it was done to me 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.210
 super simple with this idea of the tape 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.210
 Remember to cover all the bits for 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.580
 that looks more beautiful you can put 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.650
 what you want little flowers 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.650
 but I just left it that simple 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.410
 Remember to also cover it inside 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.570
 so you do not see everything we have 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.430
 all this we are going to mark in the part of 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.380
 up a little square here my pens 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.760
 they took me off but well something like that 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.200
 It has to stay, you're going to cut it with 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.200
 much care with the knife 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.939
 and you're going to put on cell phone because they have 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.980
 to stay higher than where you are 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.680
 cell in this way so look at the 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.170
 super good and nothing else we connect and 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.150
 we put the cell phone with the cable and female 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.549
 it will not inform us at all and it's going to 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.660
 be an easier idea to be able to load 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.880
 our things 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.580
 the time this idea I loved because 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.940
 apart you know where solar does not 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.940
 you lose 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.760
 we move on to the second idea and if it is already 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.680
 for our hearing aids what are you going to 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.080
 need to make smaller ribbons 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.940
 decorative there are many and thousands of 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.460
 colors I chose this hot silicone 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.750
 and think so that the color that more 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.490
 I liked it and that's how it looks 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.470
 let's take our clamps and the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.240
 let's put one on one side and one 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.560
 looking towards the other and we're going to paste it 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.560
 with silicon in this way 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.880
 Now I'm going to put the decorative ribbon on 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.010
 the top part for this is so that 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.570
 do not look like that simple but you 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.280
 You can decorate it with paint 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.440
 you can put flowers what you 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.020
 you want me to just put on this tape 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.010
 so that it looks a little cuter and the 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.010
 thing of the two sides 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.970
 since we have finished decorating them 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.990
 Now we are going to deliver our 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.360
 headphones 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.060
 let's put in a part of the clamp 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.460
 from above the hearing aids and we're going to 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:50.660
 cable drafted in this way as 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:52.820
 they are fine and the other part of the clamp 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.040
 you have to take you have to take the 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.320
 another bit has to be left of this 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.290
 way and you can really save it in your 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.010
 bag you take out and alone will not be pin 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.010
 tangled up 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.110
 and good for this third idea you need 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.830
 a needle and thread agree that you 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.230
 want 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.810
 and also a closure in the size of your 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.420
 hearing aids get it in any 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.040
 the paler√≠a I chose this white but 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.720
 you can choose what you want and what 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.910
 you can decorate the color you want and 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.220
 with many nicer things and good 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.440
 let's aim in this way to be able 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.050
 know it is not the expert in 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.360
 sew or is it really super simple 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.940
 we're just going to put it together like this 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.100
 and we're going to sew like that and I'm super 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.620
 simple you just pass the needle through 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.720
 up and then down and up 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.620
 and below and that's all you have to 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.620
 to make you stay 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.320
 and you have to do it in the whole closing 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.410
 already finished sewing everything 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.690
 everything will happen the cost of the 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.970
 hearing aids I do not know what's called by the 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.860
 top part since you've opened it 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:21.220
 is all the closing of this form and 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.800
 only going to close the closure again 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.740
 and soloists are keeping the cable 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:30.030
 the eyes 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.919
 at the end you have to spare the data and 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.180
 really ready this idea I like 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:36.380
 very much because you can also 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.380
 save in cakes 

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:45.689
 and good for today's video is true 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:47.669
 I hope you liked it very much that 

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:49.199
 they do it and they demand their pics 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:51.060
 because I really want to see her so 

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.889
 it's going to work a lot , see you 

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.840
 in the next video with more new things 

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:56.249
 I love them with all my soul thanks 

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.749
 for staying here with me for your 

00:07:56.249 --> 00:08:00.419
 comments and for everything really that 

00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:02.430
 everything I read and everything take into account so 

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:05.779
 I love you very much the next video and 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.779
 the command a kiss bye
