00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.190
 youngsters from the Alkmaar neighborhood overdie who mess up everything and the recently one 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.670
 received a visit from alderman gert jan leerink 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.930
 the alderman wants to talk about the nuisance of young people and the 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.940
 improve atmosphere in the neighborhood both times fit but time was there 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.390
 A lot of bicycles were also stolen and boom and there was a scooter 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.189
 semi then end up here in the water 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.470
 and now those with the bushes have been removed so that those of them are hidden 

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:28.559
 places and where it all happens and no longer are indeed decided is just 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:32.239
 Lee dredged and a lot came out, in part bored 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.610
 go here and there is nothing to do well I would really like to play football again 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.390
 not only in these cages smoking 6 play in the evening there is too 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.379
 little room for that and then they might have a point we have on that 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.050
 she agreed that we are going to see if there is anything that can be done about it nothing prologue it 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.619
 platoon do our best but more than that they do their best over for 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.589
 making sure that it stops what goes for nothing the sun sets out is crazy henkie 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.620
 try to arrange your affairs for them if they have a forest here 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 adorn ireen was on the agenda team 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.200
 tackle the n35 from germany spain 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.770
 through conversation hence there are half a million decreased two 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.130
 He has things that indicate that what they do cannot be a pilgrimage I am 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.190
 wondering where it comes from it is not normal that you do that behavior 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.790
 It is also not normal that you know every night until I know what was awakened later 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.830
 the striker took last week to go the youth school they are also working on though 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.310
 things like that also know who they are if they want to know 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.619
 and the moment you have spoken to people you can have contacts for that 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.350
 see what you are going to do we have the young responded when point to the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.460
 sidewalk was what I thought s were surprised about that very bad and that 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.950
 I find a good signal again 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.230
 and we just made a police state water and what follow-up appointment 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.820
 that they will next time with us 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.979
 I am there we are going to see what we can do and meanwhile we want to 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.880
 that you also tell all the boy who you are not now and what to do about it 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.890
 because if we do our best 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.390
 you must also do your best very often young are very approachable and 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.890
 often it does not get out of hand at all and a little giving endemol is there 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.760
 just at but where it really gets out of hand you must also show 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.890
 that he that you when you act and when you go together with residents to get one 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.450
 to end because 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.760
 there are limits and young people to the g5 game
