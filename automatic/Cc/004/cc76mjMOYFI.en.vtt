00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.559
 the method that they had before was a 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:12.980
 traditional teaching did not look anything 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.019
 innovative spaces very small students 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.119
 uncomfortable because the authorities of the 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.490
 school it was impossible to see them they were like 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.820
 that you miss the methodology were very 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.890
 conservative centered on the teacher and not 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.079
 in the truth student I wanted 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.819
 change school I felt that 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.800
 I learned to force not because I 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.440
 he liked already felt that school was not 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.670
 for me the truth I felt that the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.670
 things could be better 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.390
 for a while the Peruvians 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.730
 they have a new educational option 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.070
 initial primary and secondary is 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.530
 of the successful school network innovates 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.199
 schools that already has 11 centers 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.940
 education in metropolitan Lima and that 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.430
 today continues its expansion in the great 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.860
 city and in provinces with the support of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.380
 inter - American development bank 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.190
 through the opportunities initiative 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.190
 for most 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.119
 and the treatment given to children is 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.750
 completely horizontal the teachers what 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.890
 what they do is give them strategies 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.439
 accompany them so that they build 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.380
 their learnings our methodology 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.390
 is based on the constructivist partner 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.119
 this means that if we work in 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.520
 team, we get the student to develop 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.380
 his communication skills I think that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.470
 for an experience teacher like me 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.060
 It's a great opportunity to see the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.210
 great change that can be made in 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.210
 education 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.300
 touch 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.960
 all right 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.270
 our education is values ​​and it is given 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.539
 in a tutorial plan that has four 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.330
 basic axes one of them is self-esteem 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.790
 other social skills the other axes 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.010
 learning and leadership strategies and 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.840
 social responsibility I think that what 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.000
 important is that the development of 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.310
 capabilities but also that they 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.760
 really here in innova school are 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.760
 happy 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.740
 and new schools is a network of schools 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.450
 with a superior educational quality whose 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.820
 cost is within reach of the sectors 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.500
 emerging from the country that for a long 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.020
 have had to settle for 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.940
 schools of an infrastructure 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.420
 inappropriate and very low standards of 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.420
 education 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.690
 yes 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.069
 here they worry about our development 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.530
 professional and that's why we 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.270
 we attend trainings that take 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.310
 out and mussi that the corporate unit 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.050
 of interbank group that allows us to 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.239
 we have greater tools the 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.550
 which are we going to chop during the 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.959
 development of classes in mathematics 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.959
 we learn playing do not make us 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.730
 they work in groups in pairs each 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.220
 child is different and he respects his 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.190
 potentialities the methodology is good 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.989
 and applicable for them we work a lot 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.150
 as a team the relationship with 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.560
 authorities with the director with the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.540
 tutors with the teachers is very 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.150
 Direct class sessions are 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.040
 dynamic and participatory activities and 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.959
 made in English they love in 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.959
 this school is easy to learn already 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.150
 I feel that without demanding more I could give more 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.760
 for parents we have workshops for 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.310
 parents interviews with the psychologist what 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.049
 which helps us maintain education 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.269
 of our children in an integral way 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.560
 both on the side of the parents as the 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.500
 school side 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.760
 teachers treat us very well and we 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.239
 Pay attention 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.150
 I feel expressive I can share my 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.489
 ideas regarding the security that I 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.350
 I find calm because I know you 're 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.350
 in a safe school and in good hands 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.990
 and improving the quality of education is 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.910
 one of the priority issues in the country 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.010
 fastest growing South American 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.139
 economic growth during the first decade of 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.870
 21st century 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.180
 and no schools is positioned to 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.939
 become an agent of change of the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.520
 Peruvian reality of education sector 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:44.560
 benefit the socioeconomic class with 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.260
 greater potential for impact on 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.720
 transformation of the country 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.130
 the low quality of education is one 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.320
 of the main problems so that 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.350
 our country to achieve development by 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.050
 that the novaschool we are committed 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.030

 use of technology as well as an education 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.050
 based on values where the student 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.540
 can develop their capabilities do 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.010
 of these colleges a model for the 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.010
 training of successful Peruvians 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.660
 I would not change this school for nothing 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.490
 of the world I love this school and I do not 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.440
