a<00:02:04.830> car<00:02:05.100> with<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.550> much<00:02:05.789> power<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
a car with this much power is really a

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.290 
a car with this much power is really a
given<00:02:07.080> this<00:02:08.039> meister<00:02:08.459> shaft<00:02:08.700> system<00:02:08.880> with<00:02:09.179> the

higher<00:02:09.479> flow<00:02:09.780> components<00:02:10.289> really<00:02:10.470> aids<00:02:10.830> in

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
higher flow components really aids in

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.340 
higher flow components really aids in
the<00:02:11.100> TTS<00:02:11.520> breathing<00:02:11.940> out<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.170> fully

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
the TTS breathing out so to fully

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
understand the GTC valving it's

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.750 
understand the GTC valving it's
essentially<00:02:15.840> an<00:02:15.930> electronic<00:02:16.500> cutoff<00:02:16.830> when

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
essentially an electronic cutoff when

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.640 
essentially an electronic cutoff when
the<00:02:17.850> car<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.330> what<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.510> call<00:02:18.840> civil<00:02:19.440> mode

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the car is in what I call civil mode

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.930 
the car is in what I call civil mode
which<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.100> about<00:02:20.280> three-quarters<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
which is about three-quarters of the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.030 
which is about three-quarters of the
time<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.750> exhaust<00:02:22.080> passes<00:02:22.500> through<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.770> series

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
time the exhaust passes through a series

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.770 
time the exhaust passes through a series
of<00:02:23.070> two<00:02:23.340> mufflers<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.060> then<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
passenger side twin tips this happens

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.570 
passenger side twin tips this happens
because<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.510> valve<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.989> closed<00:02:28.320> as<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:29.400> passes

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
because the valve is closed as it passes

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.400 
because the valve is closed as it passes
through<00:02:29.730> each<00:02:30.000> chamber<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.750> muffles<00:02:31.230> and
