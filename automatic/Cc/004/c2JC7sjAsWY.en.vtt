in this heater so the brushes are heated
up<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.769> perfect<00:02:39.430> shape<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.660> they<00:02:40.780> retain<00:02:41.230> a

you wet them and they just go because

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.270 
you wet them and they just go because
there's<00:02:55.120> no<00:02:55.269> memory<00:02:55.600> it's<00:02:56.139> just<00:02:56.350> here<00:02:56.560> you

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
there's no memory it's just here you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.150 
there's no memory it's just here you
know<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.030> that's<00:02:58.500> one<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.680> secrets<00:03:00.069> of

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
know so that's one of the secrets of

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.539 
know so that's one of the secrets of
their<00:03:00.400> process<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.900> way<00:03:02.019> they<00:03:02.200> made<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:03.040> the

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
their process the way they made is the

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.180 
their process the way they made is the
brush<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.940> pointy<00:03:04.389> the<00:03:05.019> mold<00:03:05.290> underneath<00:03:05.859> is

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
brush is pointy the mold underneath is

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.550 
brush is pointy the mold underneath is
also<00:03:06.489> pointed<00:03:06.910> just<00:03:07.269> as<00:03:07.359> a<00:03:07.389> brush<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.200> all<00:03:08.410> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
also pointed just as a brush so all the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.259 
also pointed just as a brush so all the
hairs<00:03:08.739> are<00:03:08.889> pushed<00:03:09.130> up<00:03:09.280> into<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.639> point<00:03:09.970> and

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
hairs are pushed up into a point and

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.750 
hairs are pushed up into a point and
then<00:03:10.840> cut<00:03:11.109> off<00:03:11.200> at<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.380> bottom<00:03:11.650> where<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.519> lot

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
then cut off at the bottom where a lot

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.180 
then cut off at the bottom where a lot
of<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.000> other<00:03:13.120> people<00:03:13.329> cut<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.950> brushes<00:03:14.950> into

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
of the other people cut the brushes into

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.740 
of the other people cut the brushes into
the<00:03:15.310> point<00:03:15.639> which<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.599> meaningless

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
the point which is meaningless

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.559 
the point which is meaningless
they<00:03:18.650> don't<00:03:18.890> retain<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.550> water<00:03:19.760> they're<00:03:20.390> just

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
they don't retain the water they're just

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.690 
they don't retain the water they're just
not
