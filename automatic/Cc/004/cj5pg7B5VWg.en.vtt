trees<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.690> living<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.800> looked<00:01:02.460> more<00:01:03.380> what

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
trees as living and I looked more what

trees as living and I looked more what
had<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> most<00:01:04.830> interest<00:01:05.339> ultimately<00:01:06.240> I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
had the most interest ultimately I

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
had the most interest ultimately I
picked<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.140> College<00:01:07.860> Street<00:01:07.890> there

that's<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.479> section<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:16.200> created<00:01:16.470> a

those two massive limbs and they were
they're<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.600> massive<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:27.080> worked<00:01:28.080> with

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
they're really massive I worked with

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.719 
they're really massive I worked with
wood<00:01:28.470> from<00:01:28.979> trees<00:01:29.130> from<00:01:29.430> all<00:01:29.520> over<00:01:29.550> the

reasons they have a cycle of life
the<00:01:37.759> interest<00:01:38.060> came<00:01:38.450> from<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.869> fact<00:01:39.079> that

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the interest came from the fact that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.700 
the interest came from the fact that
grew<00:01:39.320> in<00:01:39.380> this<00:01:39.740> urban<00:01:40.130> environment<00:01:40.270> I'm<00:01:41.710> sure

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
grew in this urban environment I'm sure

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.770 
grew in this urban environment I'm sure
they<00:01:42.950> went<00:01:43.399> through<00:01:43.549> some<00:01:43.789> rough<00:01:44.060> love<00:01:44.390> from

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
they went through some rough love from

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.800 
they went through some rough love from
the<00:01:45.250> generations<00:01:46.250> of<00:01:46.369> students<00:01:47.829> in

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
the generations of students in

woodturning as an art form you're only

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.419 
woodturning as an art form you're only
given<00:01:53.360> what<00:01:53.600> nature<00:01:54.020> provides<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:55.159> don't

given what nature provides you don't

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.289 
given what nature provides you don't
have<00:01:55.789> any<00:01:56.500> indecent<00:01:57.500> sculpting<00:01:58.069> that<00:01:58.100> I<00:01:58.219> do<00:01:58.340> we

I want to uncover and reveal what's
underneath<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:07.310> best<00:02:07.549> way<00:02:07.670> possible<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.360> you

underneath the best way possible and you

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.150 
underneath the best way possible and you
have<00:02:09.170> one<00:02:09.349> shot<00:02:09.590> at<00:02:09.649> that

have one shot at that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.339 
have one shot at that
that's<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.459> artistry<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.360> dissecting

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
that's the artistry of it is dissecting

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.670 
that's the artistry of it is dissecting
this<00:02:12.760> before<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.849> begin<00:02:14.150> because<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:15.500> can

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
this before you begin because you can

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.069 
this before you begin because you can
miss<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.069> pieces<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:17.569> character<00:02:18.049> and

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
miss on pieces and the character and

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.740 
miss on pieces and the character and
interest<00:02:18.470> can<00:02:18.620> be<00:02:18.650> not<00:02:19.130> as<00:02:19.280> main<00:02:19.579> or<00:02:19.790> focal<00:02:20.209> on

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.080 

with<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:28.060> piece<00:02:28.870> for<00:02:29.080> Auburn<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.090> attention

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
with the piece for Auburn the attention

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.330 
with the piece for Auburn the attention
to<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.330> was<00:02:31.569> greater<00:02:31.810> than<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.410> would<00:02:33.069> receive

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
to it was greater than I would receive

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.839 
to it was greater than I would receive
from<00:02:33.580> normal<00:02:34.150> pieces<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.750> done<00:02:35.550> brings<00:02:36.550> in<00:02:36.760> a

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
from normal pieces that done brings in a

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.059 
from normal pieces that done brings in a
different<00:02:37.300> audience<00:02:37.680> because<00:02:38.680> there's<00:02:38.860> not

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
different audience because there's not

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.059 
different audience because there's not
only<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.819> namesake<00:02:40.120> as<00:02:40.630> an<00:02:40.930> artist<00:02:41.349> but<00:02:41.739> it

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
only my namesake as an artist but it

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.300 
only my namesake as an artist but it
incorporates<00:02:42.940> all<00:02:43.330> into<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:43.930> as<00:02:44.080> well<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.620> tried

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
incorporates all into it as well I tried

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.970 
incorporates all into it as well I tried
to<00:02:45.340> keep<00:02:45.610> perspective<00:02:46.569> on<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:47.140> as<00:02:47.319> I<00:02:47.560> went

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
to keep perspective on that as I went

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.850 
to keep perspective on that as I went
through<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.280> creative<00:02:48.610> forming<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.239> it<00:02:49.390> and

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
through the creative forming of it and

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.930 
through the creative forming of it and
one<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.010> things<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.280> did<00:02:51.459> intentionally

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
one of the things I did intentionally

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.070 
one of the things I did intentionally
leave<00:02:52.269> bark<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:53.700> both<00:02:54.700> sides<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.870> piece

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
leave bark on both sides of the piece

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.780 
leave bark on both sides of the piece
and<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:58.120> two<00:02:59.019> reasons<00:02:59.260> one<00:02:59.769> was<00:02:59.800> to<00:03:00.160> maximize

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
and to two reasons one was to maximize

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.210 
and to two reasons one was to maximize
the<00:03:01.239> size<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:03.310> final<00:03:03.760> bowl<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.720> also

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
the size of the the final bowl but also

tree to have kind of that outside inward

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.910 
tree to have kind of that outside inward
perspective<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.900> tree<00:03:14.200> there's<00:03:14.620> also

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
perspective to the tree there's also

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.979 
perspective to the tree there's also
what's<00:03:15.700> called<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:16.030> bar<00:03:16.239> conclusion<00:03:16.810> at<00:03:16.900> the

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
what's called a bar conclusion at the

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.630 
what's called a bar conclusion at the
very<00:03:17.170> top<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> piece<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.310> that's<00:03:18.370> where

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
very top of the piece and that's where

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.600 
very top of the piece and that's where
the<00:03:18.840> two<00:03:19.840> major<00:03:20.200> limbs<00:03:20.650> were<00:03:20.890> reaching<00:03:21.310> that

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
the two major limbs were reaching that

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.240 
the two major limbs were reaching that
was<00:03:22.170> significant<00:03:23.170> fell<00:03:23.530> into<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.860> character

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
was significant fell into the character

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.520 
was significant fell into the character
of<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.370> piece<00:03:24.610> but<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.810> historical

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
of the piece but to the historical

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.479 
of the piece but to the historical
context<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:27.790> it's<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:29.859> was<00:03:30.010> interesting

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
context and so it's it was interesting

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.569 
context and so it's it was interesting
piece<00:03:31.329> where<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.500> sum<00:03:32.799> is<00:03:33.040> greater<00:03:33.220> than

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
piece where this the sum is greater than

00:03:33.579 --> 00:04:05.360 
piece where this the sum is greater than
its<00:03:33.700> parts

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
