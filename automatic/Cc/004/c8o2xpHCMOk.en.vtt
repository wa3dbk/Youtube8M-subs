and<00:00:48.719> if<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.559> go<00:00:49.770> ahead<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.129> try<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> activate<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
nothing you can't activate on your you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.090 
nothing you can't activate on your you
just<00:00:56.460> can't<00:00:56.730> activate<00:00:57.329> nothing<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.890> just

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.870 
can't activate the the nether portal
right<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:04.680> other<00:01:05.250> portals<00:01:05.700> are

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
right now because other portals are

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.520 
right now because other portals are
still<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> lot<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.600> implemented<00:01:07.290> feature

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
still a lot of the implemented feature

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.899 
still a lot of the implemented feature
now<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:09.299> wanted<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.520> guys

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
now I just wanted to do this so you guys

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.300 
now I just wanted to do this so you guys
may<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.240> easier<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.049> find<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:13.979> again

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
may be easier to find so if I go again

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.539 
may be easier to find so if I go again
and<00:01:14.549> try<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.240> light<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.430> do

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and try to light it up you know I can do

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.420 
and try to light it up you know I can do
it<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.820> um<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.290> impossible<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.250> go

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it so um this is impossible to go

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.520 
it so um this is impossible to go
another<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.299> way<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.840> need<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
another this way you need to do it the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.230 
another this way you need to do it the
other<00:01:22.619> way<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:23.549> I'm<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.000> show<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
other way and now I'm going to show you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.050 
other way and now I'm going to show you
how<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.960> actually<00:01:25.500> find<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.670> cool<00:01:26.729> way<00:01:27.210> of

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
how I actually find a really cool way of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.340 
how I actually find a really cool way of
actually<00:01:30.060> using<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.450> stuff<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.110> from

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
actually using the stuff you get from

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
actually using the stuff you get from
another<00:01:31.710> reactor<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.400> stuff<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
another reactor and stuff like that to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.319 
another reactor and stuff like that to
make<00:01:33.240> nether<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.900> go<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> another<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.210> here<00:01:36.210> as

and<00:02:01.610> see<00:02:02.610> how<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:03.000> made<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.450> basically<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
and see how it's made it's basically a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.510 
and see how it's made it's basically a
three<00:02:05.070> block

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
three block

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.080 
three block
think<00:02:07.390> I<00:02:07.720> could<00:02:08.470> have<00:02:08.590> actually<00:02:08.770> put<00:02:09.489> one<00:02:09.849> more

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
think I could have actually put one more

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.780 
think I could have actually put one more
there<00:02:10.929> but<00:02:11.290> as<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.530> can<00:02:12.069> see<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.459> is<00:02:12.640> how<00:02:12.760> it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
there but as you can see this is how it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.150 
there but as you can see this is how it
looks<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.300> could<00:02:13.690> actually<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:14.470> wait<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> second

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
looks I could actually on wait a second

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.890 
looks I could actually on wait a second
let<00:02:15.459> me<00:02:15.489> get<00:02:15.670> out<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.819> split<00:02:16.180> that's<00:02:16.390> really

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
let me get out of split that's really

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.440 
let me get out of split that's really
our<00:02:17.410> unusual<00:02:18.130> plan<00:02:18.370> split<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:19.060> it's<00:02:19.180> like

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
our unusual plan split that so it's like

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.350 
our unusual plan split that so it's like
really<00:02:19.660> oh<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:21.040> what<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.550> could<00:02:21.790> have<00:02:21.849> done<00:02:22.120> is

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
really oh but what we could have done is

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.960 
really oh but what we could have done is
that<00:02:22.390> we<00:02:22.599> could<00:02:23.080> have<00:02:23.230> even<00:02:23.500> moved<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.700> way

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
that we could have even moved this way

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.850 
that we could have even moved this way
don't<00:02:25.239> relegate<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:26.110> think<00:02:26.410> that's<00:02:26.590> how<00:02:26.830> I

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
don't relegate it I think that's how I

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.420 
don't relegate it I think that's how I
did<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.880> first<00:02:28.150> one<00:02:28.569> so<00:02:29.019> yeah<00:02:29.560> we<00:02:29.769> could<00:02:29.980> do<00:02:30.130> we

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
did the first one so yeah we could do we

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.370 
did the first one so yeah we could do we
look<00:02:30.730> at<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.390> way<00:02:31.599> so<00:02:31.870> basically<00:02:32.019> just

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
look at the this way so basically just

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.949 
look at the this way so basically just
remove<00:02:32.950> this<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:34.000> add<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.959> then

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
remove this and this add this and then

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.670 
remove this and this add this and then
put<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.380> here<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.190> like<00:02:39.519> there<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.060> another<00:02:40.680> so

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
put it here so like there is another so

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.320 
put it here so like there is another so
it's<00:02:41.920> kind<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.250> digging<00:02:42.519> into<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.880> ground<00:02:42.910> so

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
it's kind of digging into the ground so

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.360 
it's kind of digging into the ground so
but<00:02:43.690> those<00:02:44.019> are<00:02:44.260> all<00:02:44.410> designed<00:02:44.769> so<00:02:45.040> basically

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
but those are all designed so basically

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.570 
but those are all designed so basically
this<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.030> replacement<00:02:46.420> for<00:02:47.310> mapmakers<00:02:48.310> and

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580
