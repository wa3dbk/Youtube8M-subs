00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
like a seventh I think of the people

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.809 
like a seventh I think of the people
same<00:02:23.739> black<00:02:23.950> bow<00:02:24.099> which<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.430> quite<00:02:24.580> high

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
there are and for those who don't know

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.440 
there are and for those who don't know

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
it worked unless you know you had really

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.900 
it worked unless you know you had really
shit<00:02:43.780> teams<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.590> their<00:02:44.830> their<00:02:44.860> associate<00:02:45.760> I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910

mean<00:02:46.090> but<00:02:46.630> you<00:02:46.840> know<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.410> does<00:02:47.620> help<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.100> much

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
mean but you know it does help so much

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.040 
mean but you know it does help so much
like<00:02:48.519> everyone<00:02:48.880> on<00:02:49.030> your<00:02:49.120> team<00:02:49.180> gets<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.750> so

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
like everyone on your team gets it so

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.860 
like everyone on your team gets it so
you<00:02:50.769> know<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.459> just<00:02:51.730> decides<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.450> game<00:02:52.630> and

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
you know it just decides the game and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.750 
you know it just decides the game and
I'm<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.440> good<00:02:53.560> they're<00:02:53.709> moving<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.130> 12<00:02:54.370> so

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
I'm it's good they're moving up to 12 so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.160 
I'm it's good they're moving up to 12 so
it's<00:02:55.030> kind<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.239> like<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.390> nuke<00:02:55.690> in<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.989> way

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
it's kind of like a nuke in a way

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.930 
it's kind of like a nuke in a way
because<00:02:56.440> it's<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.100> game<00:02:57.280> designer<00:02:57.700> who

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
because it's just a game designer who

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.090 
because it's just a game designer who
wins<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.420> why<00:02:58.750> not<00:02:58.959> well<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.799> know<00:02:59.920> obviously

not<00:03:15.489> exactly<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:16.209> long<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.540> mean<00:03:16.660> they're

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
not exactly that long I mean they're

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.050 
not exactly that long I mean they're
like<00:03:16.989> around<00:03:17.560> eight<00:03:18.130> minutes<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:18.700> all<00:03:18.850> that

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
like around eight minutes and all that

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.460 
like around eight minutes and all that
but<00:03:19.269> it's<00:03:19.480> just<00:03:19.630> too<00:03:19.690> long<00:03:19.959> for<00:03:20.109> my<00:03:20.230> channel

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
to be less than six minutes then you

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.750 
to be less than six minutes then you
know<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.769> needs<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.220> be<00:03:27.310> less<00:03:27.459> than<00:03:27.489> six

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760
