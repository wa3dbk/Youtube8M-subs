00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.140

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.710
 or I'll say two things today to 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.560
 you two subjects one I ended up both 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.500
 Obviously, I found out today. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.930
 May, and after so long, my 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.170
 but it was like this so I looked 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.060
 I just said this weather forecast 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.539
 I'm seeing you see nothing but normal 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.390
 If you do it here, what you notice 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.270
 the personal cloud clouds they 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.410
 place is equal to that of the screen. 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.270
 ipad and iphone ipad and iphone 5 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.940
 of the se7e makes a good three-dimensional effect 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:54.960
 very weak and very light you can 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:00.449
 realize this star here oh there he 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:05.850
 make an effect will fiddle here, come on 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.790
 balance that has an accelerometer here ok 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:18.090
 without the stars 5 stars I think the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.799
 next is with the stars here too 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.770
 I do not think it's the fabric here. 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.140
 partly cloudy cloud Rho she 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.420

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.270
 3d effect verity is very cool you see 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.810
 it seems that the cloud is behind what is 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.360
 written in front here mine is very 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.520
 cool I saw it here I said we 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.030
 I have to pass this curiosity there pro 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.000
 staff the other is this one is a 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.979
 advertising that you use the more or less 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.950
 this does not even know the person discovers 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.439
 today no more and no less help in the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.960
 increase the letter and you can do this 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:08.220

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.910

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.390
 message's letter 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.030
 Before I even did the following I did the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.970
 So these tests were two curiosities 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.700
 Then I found out then I 'll move on to 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.560
 You can even know more personal 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.010
 This here is also much more for who 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.840
