00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.360

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 Case but to get something like on 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:59.000

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:03.949
 shade in general here it is all know it 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.949

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:28.460
 Case reinforced to one super light box 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.320
 Yesterday I just transferred money 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.430
 already the package is very nice 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.979
 I also ordered this kind of protection 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.179
 pen 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:44.080
 shimano pen protection 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:49.070
 here but we will see what the package 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:02:01.360
 so that the package itself I do not know here m 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:02:07.210
 packing is not broken, we can take 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.210
 neatly cut 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.530
 good packaging 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.150
 here even everything is written own 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.150
 phone 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.140
 holiday and everything is packed 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:55.270
 how interesting how interesting here 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:59.150
 proper numbers k1 store name 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:03.260
 The link will be duplicated again. 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:08.570
 the store here is pen protection very very 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:13.700
 such an interesting and high quality reference 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.680
 on the case will be let down so but the case 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.890
 Most likely we will unpack not 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.380
 the table but will be right now 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:27.280
 look at the bike so go 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:36.610
 friend well here's the bike case itself 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.610
 we will now unpack it 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.520
 but there he is what he is 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:04.599
 such a convenient handle 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:11.420
 the sizes I have it on the bike it's obvious 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:14.319
 protection for the plug but for now let's try 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.319
 to wrap up 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:01.759
 Well, actually, and of course I have everything 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.610
 big doubts about the correctness of how 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.649
 I packed the bike takes course in 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.779
 minute 4 

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:15.680
 how is she there that well enough for me 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:17.919
 very comfortable saddle likely 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:23.889
 it is necessary to lower but here I have 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.889
 a flashlight that will also have to unfasten 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:38.330
 so she most likely and look together 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:44.119
 us and on the shoulder then that's actually well 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:48.589
 and it looks like this is how to change this 

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:52.509
 Thing I do not quite understand well, probably 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:56.289
 as it puts on a fork well thanks 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:59.830
 I will understand thanks all bye 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.830
 a link will be under the video
