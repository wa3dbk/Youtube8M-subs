00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
and as you can tell by his videos I was

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.859 
and as you can tell by his videos I was
less<00:02:00.170> lagging<00:02:00.619> on<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.800> second<00:02:01.130> video<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:03.700> so

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
less lagging on the second video and so

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.200 
less lagging on the second video and so
this<00:02:05.869> myth<00:02:06.080> concludes<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.069> as<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:07.970> matter

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
this myth concludes that and as a matter

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.150 
this myth concludes that and as a matter
of<00:02:08.300> fact<00:02:08.380> game<00:02:09.380> booster<00:02:09.649> does<00:02:10.429> actually<00:02:10.759> work
