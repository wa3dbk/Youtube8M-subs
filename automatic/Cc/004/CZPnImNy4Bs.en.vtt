00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
with the look clean on the bottom in the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.539 
with the look clean on the bottom in the
90-degree<00:01:05.369> float<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.979> apples<00:01:07.979> apples<00:01:08.100> it's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
90-degree float so apples apples it's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.310 
90-degree float so apples apples it's
about<00:01:08.760> same<00:01:09.030> weight<00:01:09.270> these<00:01:09.630> are<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:10.110> bit

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
about same weight these are a little bit

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
about same weight these are a little bit
heavier<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.030> half<00:01:12.030> an<00:01:12.180> ounce<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.630> pole<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
heavier but half an ounce is in pole I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.690 
heavier but half an ounce is in pole I
think<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.380> 14<00:01:13.770> grams<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.340> something

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
think it's like 14 grams or something

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.109 
think it's like 14 grams or something
okay<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:16.259> terms<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.530> fit<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.860> finish

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
okay so in terms of fit and finish

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.670 
okay so in terms of fit and finish
they're<00:01:18.119> beautiful<00:01:18.270> they're<00:01:18.750> nice<00:01:19.350> they're

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
they're beautiful they're nice they're

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.469 
they're beautiful they're nice they're
obviously<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:20.490> crafted<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> look<00:01:21.360> at

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
obviously well crafted if you look at

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.350 
obviously well crafted if you look at
all<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.840> scene<00:01:22.080> work<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.500> all<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
all the scene work and all and the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.090 
all the scene work and all and the
details<00:01:24.720> gone<00:01:24.930> into<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> machine<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
details gone into with the machine and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.340 
details gone into with the machine and
so<00:01:26.189> forth<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:26.820> nice<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.900> inside<00:01:28.320> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so forth it's really nice the inside is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.719 
so forth it's really nice the inside is
not<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.829> smooth<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.340> would<00:01:29.490> hope<00:01:29.700> for

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
not as smooth as I would hope for

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.060 
not as smooth as I would hope for
actually<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.869> feel<00:01:31.200> inside<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.920> feel

actually when you feel inside and feel

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.100 
actually when you feel inside and feel
the<00:01:32.189> seams<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.850> little<00:01:33.600> bit<00:01:33.720> concerned<00:01:33.840> about

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the seams a little bit concerned about

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.569 
the seams a little bit concerned about
racing<00:01:34.500> without<00:01:34.680> socks<00:01:34.979> which<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.280> will<00:01:35.430> attend

the stuff you need there to get them fit
to<00:02:31.470> your<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:31.980> feet<00:02:32.220> basically<00:02:33.209> if<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.360> got

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
to your your feet basically if you got

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.150

the<00:02:33.630> oven<00:02:34.020> which<00:02:34.350> has<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.740> heat<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.920> till<00:02:35.100> i

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
the oven which has to heat it till i

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.190 
the oven which has to heat it till i
think<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.670> 225<00:02:36.330> degrees<00:02:36.660> not<00:02:36.870> more<00:02:37.170> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
think just 225 degrees not more and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.750 
think just 225 degrees not more and
probably<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:37.890> less<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.280> get<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.490> just<00:02:38.670> right

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
probably not less to get it just right

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.390 
probably not less to get it just right
and<00:02:39.060> they've<00:02:39.690> got<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.050> vacuum<00:02:40.530> thing<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.250> so

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
let me explain that process the first

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.860 
let me explain that process the first
thing<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.739> do<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:45.030> take<00:02:45.060> out<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.660> soul

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
thing you do is you take out the soul

minutes<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.709> then<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.730> place<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
minutes and then you place it in the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
around for like five minutes we're going

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.350 
around for like five minutes we're going
to<00:02:58.860> walk<00:02:58.950> around<00:02:59.100> with<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.430> actually<00:02:59.640> move

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
to walk around with you actually move

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.699 
to walk around with you actually move
around<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.630> little<00:03:00.720> bit<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.050> basically<00:03:01.350> stand

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
around a little bit but basically stand

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.740 
around a little bit but basically stand
in<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.950> soul<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.459> once<00:03:03.150> those<00:03:03.360> are<00:03:03.420> set

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
in the soul and once those are set

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.290 
in the soul and once those are set
they're<00:03:04.050> taken<00:03:04.500> out<00:03:04.590> then<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.820> whole<00:03:06.030> shoe

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
they're taken out then the whole shoe

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.590 
they're taken out then the whole shoe
goes<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.959> oven<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.040> baked<00:03:08.600> for

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
goes in the oven and it is baked for

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.300 
goes in the oven and it is baked for
about<00:03:09.660> ten<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.440> two<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.770> half<00:03:10.860> minutes<00:03:11.070> and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
about ten to two and a half minutes and

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
about ten to two and a half minutes and
not<00:03:11.370> sure<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:11.790> might<00:03:11.910> be<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> little<00:03:12.180> bit

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
not sure that might be a little bit

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.820 
not sure that might be a little bit
longer<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:13.080> basically<00:03:13.290> what<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.560> does<00:03:13.799> is

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
longer and basically what that does is

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.030 
longer and basically what that does is
if<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.459> makes<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.390> heel<00:03:16.019> region<00:03:16.709> up<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
if it makes the heel region up to the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.110 
if it makes the heel region up to the
four<00:03:17.280> up<00:03:17.459> through<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.750> arch<00:03:19.100> soft

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
four up through the the arch soft

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.120 
four up through the the arch soft
relatively<00:03:21.120> speaking<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.950> after<00:03:22.950> shoes

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
relatively speaking and after shoes

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.880 
relatively speaking and after shoes
removed<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.910> then<00:03:24.120> put<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:25.230> soul<00:03:25.470> back<00:03:25.650> in

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
removed you then put this soul back in

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.640 
removed you then put this soul back in
step<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.940> then<00:03:27.630> they<00:03:27.840> quickly<00:03:28.080> put

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
step in it and then they quickly put

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.500 
step in it and then they quickly put
this<00:03:29.040> bag<00:03:29.340> thing<00:03:29.730> over<00:03:29.910> your<00:03:30.030> foot<00:03:30.209> it's<00:03:30.420> like

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
this bag thing over your foot it's like

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.060 
this bag thing over your foot it's like
a<00:03:30.540> ziploc<00:03:31.080> bag<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.530> when<00:03:31.680> there's<00:03:31.860> two<00:03:32.040> of

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
a ziploc bag but when there's two of

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.210 
a ziploc bag but when there's two of
them<00:03:32.220> cinch<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.209> down<00:03:33.269> with<00:03:33.600> velcro<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.380> all

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
them cinch it down with velcro and all

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.670 
them cinch it down with velcro and all
the<00:03:35.370> while<00:03:35.489> you've<00:03:35.730> got<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:37.380> too

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
the while you've got this this too

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.729 
the while you've got this this too
that's<00:03:38.010> been<00:03:38.190> inserted<00:03:38.730> here<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:40.560> right

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
that's been inserted here so it's right

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.860 
that's been inserted here so it's right
up<00:03:40.890> your<00:03:40.920> shin<00:03:41.850> at<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.030> same<00:03:42.180> time<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.750> then

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
up your shin at the same time and then

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.600 
up your shin at the same time and then
they<00:03:43.019> suck<00:03:43.260> all<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.440> air<00:03:43.560> out<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.340> it's

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
they suck all the air out and it's

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.970 
they suck all the air out and it's
basically<00:03:45.150> like<00:03:45.330> getting<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.690> getting<00:03:46.260> zip

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
basically like getting a getting zip

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.680 
basically like getting a getting zip
lock<00:03:47.190> down<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.459> mean<00:03:47.640> it's<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.030> real<00:03:48.269> tight

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
lock down I mean it's a real tight

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.240 
lock down I mean it's a real tight
squeeze<00:03:49.019> if<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.260> can<00:03:49.410> imagine<00:03:49.500> taking<00:03:50.070> your

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
squeeze if you can imagine taking your

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.860 
squeeze if you can imagine taking your
blood<00:03:50.430> pressure<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.880> since<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.180> down<00:03:51.390> it's

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
blood pressure and since you down it's

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.300 
blood pressure and since you down it's
probably<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.200> little<00:03:52.290> tighter<00:03:52.620> than<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:52.890> is

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
probably a little tighter than that is

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.460 
probably a little tighter than that is
my<00:03:53.610> impression<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.780> stays<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.049> way<00:03:55.320> for

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
my impression and it stays that way for

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.860 
my impression and it stays that way for
I<00:03:56.250> guess<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:56.940> about<00:03:57.030> two<00:03:57.299> minutes<00:03:57.480> same

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
I guess it's about two minutes same

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.050 
I guess it's about two minutes same
thing<00:03:58.170> like<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.440> time<00:03:58.850> during<00:03:59.850> which<00:03:59.940> time

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
thing like the time during which time

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.360 
thing like the time during which time
you<00:04:00.510> are<00:04:00.720> seated<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.350> don't<00:04:01.860> think<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.100> decide

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
you are seated I don't think you decide

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.030 
you are seated I don't think you decide
to<00:04:02.519> stand<00:04:02.790> at<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.060> form<00:04:03.390> but<00:04:04.019> after<00:04:04.890> that

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
to stand at that form but after that

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.540 
to stand at that form but after that
what<00:04:05.430> happens<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:05.910> they<00:04:06.180> release<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.110> then

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
what happens is they release it and then

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.910 
what happens is they release it and then
or<00:04:07.820> relatively<00:04:08.810> speaking<00:04:09.050> custom<00:04:09.590> molded<00:04:09.890> to

turned out that my my speed player
relatively<00:04:43.460> well<00:04:43.610> fit<00:04:43.790> and<00:04:43.970> out<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.150> course

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
relatively well fit and out of course

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.450 
relatively well fit and out of course
these<00:04:44.480> are<00:04:44.540> you<00:04:44.960> know<00:04:45.080> dead-on<00:04:45.710> fit<00:04:46.130> in<00:04:46.250> terms

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
these are you know dead-on fit in terms

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.040 
these are you know dead-on fit in terms
of<00:04:46.550> both<00:04:46.730> angles<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.480> 30<00:04:47.750> degree<00:04:47.870> angle

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
of both angles and the 30 degree angle

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.370 
of both angles and the 30 degree angle
and<00:04:48.590> all<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:49.840> overall<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:51.080> would<00:04:51.140> describe

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
and all that so overall I would describe

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.560 
and all that so overall I would describe
shoot<00:04:51.770> as<00:04:51.980> being<00:04:52.250> stiff<00:04:52.730> stiffer<00:04:53.300> than<00:04:53.510> the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
shoot as being stiff stiffer than the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.380 
shoot as being stiff stiffer than the
cds<00:04:53.930> for<00:04:54.500> what<00:04:54.590> i<00:04:54.650> can<00:04:54.770> tell<00:04:54.950> my<00:04:55.790> secret<00:04:56.240> hopes

fitness<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.980> have<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.280> standards<00:05:01.730> so<00:05:02.270> part<00:05:02.510> of

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
fitness is have the standards so part of

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.440 
fitness is have the standards so part of
the<00:05:02.660> season<00:05:02.870> being<00:05:03.380> april<00:05:03.860> but<00:05:04.550> i<00:05:04.910> did<00:05:05.300> notice

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
the season being april but i did notice

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.600 
the season being april but i did notice
some<00:05:05.660> stronger<00:05:05.960> rides<00:05:06.260> on<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.740> 40<00:05:07.040> 45<00:05:07.400> mile

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
some stronger rides on the 40 45 mile

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.010 
some stronger rides on the 40 45 mile
distance<00:05:08.000> my<00:05:08.120> time<00:05:08.360> seemed<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.750> come<00:05:08.840> down

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
distance my time seemed to come down

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.230 
distance my time seemed to come down
just<00:05:09.050> a<00:05:09.260> tiny<00:05:09.440> bit<00:05:09.620> again<00:05:10.430> it's<00:05:10.670> not<00:05:10.910> an<00:05:11.000> exact

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
just a tiny bit again it's not an exact

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.270 
just a tiny bit again it's not an exact
science<00:05:11.300> but<00:05:11.690> i<00:05:12.169> do<00:05:12.380> feel<00:05:12.680> like<00:05:12.830> it's<00:05:12.980> making<00:05:13.220> a

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
science but i do feel like it's making a

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.760 
science but i do feel like it's making a
little<00:05:13.430> bit<00:05:13.520> of<00:05:13.580> difference<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.990> bottom<00:05:15.590> line

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
little bit of difference the bottom line

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.760 
little bit of difference the bottom line
in<00:05:16.010> terms<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.400> what<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.330> was<00:05:17.660> led<00:05:17.930> to<00:05:17.960> expect<00:05:18.320> was

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
in terms of what I was led to expect was

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.740 
in terms of what I was led to expect was
compared<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.280> my<00:05:19.430> C's<00:05:19.669> to<00:05:19.940> these<00:05:20.150> with<00:05:20.540> the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
compared to my C's to these with the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.500 
compared to my C's to these with the
much<00:05:21.260> stiffer<00:05:21.560> much<00:05:22.010> stiffer<00:05:22.280> soul<00:05:22.610> was

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
much stiffer much stiffer soul was

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.260 
much stiffer much stiffer soul was
ending<00:05:24.200> with<00:05:24.350> a<00:05:24.380> bigger<00:05:25.280> platform<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.910> pedal

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
ending with a bigger platform the pedal

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.840 
ending with a bigger platform the pedal
that<00:05:27.169> I<00:05:27.200> might<00:05:27.560> expect<00:05:27.890> to<00:05:28.010> pick<00:05:28.130> up<00:05:28.220> 15<00:05:28.520> or<00:05:28.640> 20

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
that I might expect to pick up 15 or 20

that I might expect to pick up 15 or 20
watts<00:05:29.000> of<00:05:29.120> power<00:05:29.230> again<00:05:30.230> it's<00:05:30.710> pie-in-the-sky

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
watts of power again it's pie-in-the-sky

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.890 
watts of power again it's pie-in-the-sky
estimates<00:05:31.940> but<00:05:32.120> I<00:05:32.180> think<00:05:32.510> there's<00:05:32.720> something

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
estimates but I think there's something

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.480 
estimates but I think there's something
there<00:05:33.230> there<00:05:33.770> probably<00:05:34.070> is<00:05:34.220> a<00:05:34.250> little<00:05:34.430> more

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
there there probably is a little more

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.430 
there there probably is a little more
efficiency<00:05:35.000> a<00:05:35.030> little<00:05:35.270> more<00:05:35.390> power<00:05:35.600> be<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.320> be

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
efficiency a little more power be to be

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.090 
efficiency a little more power be to be

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
said it's got the loop back here and I

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.330 
said it's got the loop back here and I
don't<00:06:02.780> use<00:06:02.900> to<00:06:03.050> get<00:06:03.169> into<00:06:03.320> race<00:06:03.470> but<00:06:03.740> it's<00:06:03.919> same
