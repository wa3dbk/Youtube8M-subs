00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.810
 The theme of the World Rubber Market is this one 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:17.330
 How to play back table software 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:21.260
 So I think this time I will do for the other party's long serve 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:26.810
 It is how to play when the receive will continue to do here. 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:31.800
 It is blamed put out a lot of still long Saab and has a pretty talk with people of the back table 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:37.890
 I'm listening very well to talk Tteyuu Toka I'm pretty tight by Neto or hate riding 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.519
 After all, I was back on the post, but in the same way the form of the table is after long serve blame 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:48.180
 It is so many because I feel a little disgusting to be given long serve 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:49.379
 It seems like you're here, so this time it's how you play the table, so it's time for the long serve 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.820
 I think I want to go 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.360
 If you have similar trouble 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:02.090
 I think I want you to be able to watch this video 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:05.070
 In I think let's doing immediately to Tteyuu the how to play for this long serve 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:11.520
 First of all it is is one eye 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:13.810
 It's a bit more than a two-tier setting, so it's about a step from the big 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.829
 Please try 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.960
 If you go too far, you will get stuck for a deep long serve 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:27.729
 Say shot in the third pitch is only to return against in Nari mountain can not return well clogged Rutte 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:32.530
 The other party comes out with a lot of long serve because it is the most scary thing 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.800
 If it looks like you're aiming for a long serve, I'll set it a little lower than usual 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.480
 Please be so 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.640
 Whoa 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.780
 If you take a long serve in front of you, you can not go well if you hit the ball too low. 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.420
 There are many 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.850
 Shoot with room 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.570
 Because it is easier to hit at first if you sell at a high hit ball store in order to hit calmly, it is a little different 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.340
 I was bound to wait for a while 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.990
 So little put out firmly You're their impact is better to strike at say so 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.530
 Please go down and wait 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:08.509
 The second point is to make a flat surface 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.180
 It is that not laid a racket this is I-yan commonplace Once you have from the form of a table software 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:17.550
 It feels like that, but that 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:23.040
 That if it is pretty fast ball would dabbled Dari breath when've been package 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:28.109
 Because suddenly, it is very often that would put on an anti-surface and dabble 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.480
 It's just a little to get the ball to be consciously flat 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:35.609
 A sense of stability has changed a lot 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.189
 The angle majority is here to say who does not work for the long Saab has he thought 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:42.120
 There are so many things I 've covered 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:43.060
 I thought because of Tteyuu the form of their own is not Ika flying ball as I Table 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.880
 To play flat 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.680
 I think most people are good at 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.140
 I was asked to be more conscious about flat flat than ever 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.350
 I think it will work better 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.030
 The third point of the 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.200
 Force out from there is a compact swing in a compact swing 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.460
 It is to say 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.600
 Yes 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:11.480
 This is a big swing 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:14.959
 I think you are big while your soul is coming 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:19.650
 Toka or ended up in front of than I thought it is the point rash easy to hit 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:23.459
 Because I'm attracted too much than I thought and I'm going to be behind 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:29.250
 Feel like spring out only is it compact swing can 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:35.010
 Consciousness Tteyuu I feel that say depression to protect as much as possible their most easy to hit point 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:37.930
 I think that it will be more stable if you have to have 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:43.689
 If you are not good at long serve 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.640
 The consciousness of making firmly on the flat surface from now the platform that it can say to take a little distance 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:49.569
 It is that Tteyuu have more strongly 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:56.500
 Knuckles and bread in a compact swing after 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:57.920
 If you are conscious of these three points, it is likely to work better now 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.490
 So I actually went 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.490
 Please see
