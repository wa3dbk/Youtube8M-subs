00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.410
 what happens players welcome back 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.510
 here the star wars battlefront 2 we are going to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.490
 play with the rebels in the star of 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.999
 death one of the new maps that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 brings this the second installment of the saga 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:24.239
 of star wars battlefront and how good is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.710
 one of my favorites I do not know you know what 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.169
 I prefer this part the front 1 but 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.109
 good if you have to choose but also 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.000
 I can talk many flaws about this me 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.770
 I like it and the truth is that what 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.260
 I enjoy because I do not know it's fun and I 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.750
 I see very new let's see around here I'm going to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.790
 charge me that because I have bad aim 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.510
 that accustom to more of the front one already 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.800
 is ready what pussies are down already 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.700
 the most obvious surprise that yes we are going 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.640
 we continue forward pim pam pim pam 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.990
 or yes or yes what I like most about this 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.870
 game is that it accepts a better resolution 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:05.180
 or if you take pomegranate for you bastard shit 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.220
 dodge or good does not dodge or really 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.760
 He has given and rebounded in his head 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.360
 almost 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:17.410
 ojito ojito all behind me there is 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.310
 come on come on let's go see here 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.290
 I already remember I do not believe as much as 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.370
 previously but the truth is that I 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.020
 advance through the map is practically 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.720
 instinctive was played so much that I do not need 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.940
 remember me or if it's simply led me to 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.760
 myself for the map all there arrange 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.150
 this to death 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:46.980
 it sounded but in the end it did not shoot itself 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.980
 yes yes now yes what is cool or jo jo jo jo 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.100

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.600
 what is the prison area 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.950
 because you can shoot one of the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.079
 drain pipes and get into it and 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.250
 escape like in the movie but good 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.750
 you have to be careful 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.900
 because you can also die 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.429

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.250
