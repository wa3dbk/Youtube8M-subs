completely naked all the time from bears

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.910 
completely naked all the time from bears
even<00:01:08.520> now<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.000> saying<00:01:09.240> I'm<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
even now as you saying I'm good right I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.109 
even now as you saying I'm good right I
don't<00:01:11.159> know<00:01:11.280> why<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.580> let<00:01:11.729> me<00:01:11.820> run<00:01:12.000> around

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
don't know why they let me run around

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.539 
don't know why they let me run around
like<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> feral<00:01:12.810> child<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.439> went<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.159> over<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
like a feral child it went on for over a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.560 
like a feral child it went on for over a
year<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> think<00:01:15.210> about<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.450> maybe

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
year now that I think about it maybe

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
year now that I think about it maybe
that's<00:01:16.080> why<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.470> mom<00:01:16.650> started<00:01:17.009> reading<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that's why my mom started reading me the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.859 
that's why my mom started reading me the
paper<00:01:17.759> bag<00:01:17.970> princess<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.570> maybe<00:01:18.750> she

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
paper bag princess because maybe she

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.480 
paper bag princess because maybe she
figured<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.380> she<00:01:19.439> could<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.740> least<00:01:19.860> give<00:01:20.340> me<00:01:20.369> in

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
figured if she could at least give me in

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.219 
figured if she could at least give me in
a<00:01:20.549> paper<00:01:20.670> bag<00:01:20.790> we<00:01:21.360> could<00:01:21.509> work<00:01:21.659> our<00:01:21.810> way<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
a paper bag we could work our way up to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.630 
a paper bag we could work our way up to
the<00:01:22.259> princess<00:01:22.650> dresses<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.220> guess<00:01:23.430> there's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the princess dresses but I guess there's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.460 
the princess dresses but I guess there's
an<00:01:23.729> upside<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> everything<00:01:24.299> right<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.080> during

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
an upside to everything right so during

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.649 
an upside to everything right so during
this<00:01:25.590> period<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:26.009> nudeness<00:01:26.400> i<00:01:26.610> embarked<00:01:27.509> on

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
this period of nudeness i embarked on

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
this period of nudeness i embarked on

out of floorboards that ended up

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.780

becoming<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.909> raccoon<00:01:57.390> sanctuary<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.790> can

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
becoming a raccoon sanctuary so I can
