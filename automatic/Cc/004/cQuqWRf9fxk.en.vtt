00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
I can use the pan to do to a nice

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.090 
I can use the pan to do to a nice
picture<00:00:40.149> and<00:00:40.780> pay<00:00:41.050> attention<00:00:41.079> that<00:00:41.800> is<00:00:42.870> no

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
picture and pay attention that is no

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.670 
picture and pay attention that is no
pressure<00:00:45.180> sensitive<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.480> so<00:00:46.660> you<00:00:46.719> can<00:00:46.960> draw

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
pressure sensitive and so you can draw

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.709 
pressure sensitive and so you can draw
either<00:00:47.920> lighter<00:00:48.460> or<00:00:48.820> darker<00:00:49.030> you<00:00:49.600> know

either lighter or darker you know

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.940 
either lighter or darker you know
depends<00:00:50.230> on<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.680> pressure<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:53.680> of<00:00:53.710> the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
depends on the pressure so one of the

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.430 
depends on the pressure so one of the
other<00:00:54.100> cool<00:00:54.370> things<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.750> also<00:00:56.020> comes<00:00:56.320> with
