he'll own our internet crack here and I
thought<00:00:05.040> I'd<00:00:05.279> go<00:00:05.580> ahead<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.029> go<00:00:06.150> over

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180

thundering pandaren spirit today you

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.730 
thundering pandaren spirit today you
might<00:00:09.420> notice<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.809> microphones<00:00:10.260> better<00:00:10.530> on

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
might notice the microphones better on

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.160 
might notice the microphones better on
this<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.340> was<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.330> old<00:00:12.540> channel<00:00:12.840> and

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
this and it was on the old channel and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.990 
this and it was on the old channel and
that's<00:00:13.320> because<00:00:13.500> i'm<00:00:13.769> recording<00:00:14.519> this<00:00:14.960> you<00:00:15.960> my

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
that's because i'm recording this you my

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.060 
that's because i'm recording this you my
all<00:00:18.000> now<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.779> much<00:00:18.990> better<00:00:19.020> microphone<00:00:19.529> and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
all now in a much better microphone and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.859 
all now in a much better microphone and
the<00:00:20.130> answer<00:00:20.580> will<00:00:20.789> be<00:00:20.850> no<00:00:21.330> because<00:00:21.689> that's

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the answer will be no because that's

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.830 
the answer will be no because that's
just<00:00:22.080> too<00:00:22.380> much<00:00:22.410> goddamn<00:00:22.769> work<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:24.180> i<00:00:24.480> did

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
just too much goddamn work but i did

just too much goddamn work but i did
screw<00:00:25.199> up<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.500> video<00:00:25.859> i<00:00:25.920> didn't<00:00:26.340> go<00:00:26.490> over<00:00:26.730> v

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
screw up this video i didn't go over v

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.300 
screw up this video i didn't go over v
pet<00:00:27.480> builds<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.500> i<00:00:28.529> thought<00:00:28.890> i'd<00:00:29.039> take<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
pet builds so i thought i'd take a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.420 
pet builds so i thought i'd take a
moment<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.699> go<00:00:29.789> ahead<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.150> do<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> for

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
moment to go ahead and do that so for

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.950 
moment to go ahead and do that so for

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
to want to get a red cricket and you're

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.780 
to want to get a red cricket and you're
going<00:00:38.790> way<00:00:39.030> well<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.890> st.<00:00:40.890> grasshopper<00:00:41.489> will

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
going way well I st. grasshopper will

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.760 
going way well I st. grasshopper will
work<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.719> I'll<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:43.050> over<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.350> strategy

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
work and I'll go over the strategy

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.590 
work and I'll go over the strategy
around<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.520> second<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.300> want<00:00:45.450> that

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
around it in a second but you want that

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.670 
around it in a second but you want that
grasshopper<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.289> Skeeter<00:00:47.059> goon<00:00:48.059> strike

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
grasshopper to have Skeeter goon strike

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.290 
grasshopper to have Skeeter goon strike
nature's<00:00:49.680> touch<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.270> your

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
nature's touch and then you have your

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.650 
nature's touch and then you have your
leveling<00:00:51.750> pet<00:00:51.989> doesn't<00:00:52.350> matter<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.920> he<00:00:53.010> has

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
leveling pet doesn't matter what he has

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.150 
leveling pet doesn't matter what he has
level<00:00:54.660> 10<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.020> probably<00:00:55.289> good<00:00:55.500> levels<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.039> you

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
level 10 is probably good levels so you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.529 
level 10 is probably good levels so you
can<00:00:56.280> survive<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> hit<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.059> something<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
can survive a hit or something like that

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.560 
can survive a hit or something like that
and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.219> usually<00:00:59.579> throw<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.120> Dark<00:01:00.390> Moon

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and then I usually throw in Dark Moon

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.640 
and then I usually throw in Dark Moon
Zeppelin<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.940> missile<00:01:03.229> bombing<00:01:04.229> run<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
Zeppelin with missile bombing run and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.770 
Zeppelin with missile bombing run and
decoy<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.210> very<00:01:06.270> important

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
decoy it's going to be very important

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.270 
decoy it's going to be very important
you<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:07.020> your<00:01:07.200> grasshopper<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.010> first

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you want your grasshopper in the first

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940 
you want your grasshopper in the first
spot<00:01:08.400> you're<00:01:09.330> leveling<00:01:10.229> play<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> second

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
spot you're leveling play in the second

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190 
spot you're leveling play in the second
and<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.760> Zeppelin<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> third<00:01:12.990> spot

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
and then your Zeppelin in the third spot

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.410 
and then your Zeppelin in the third spot
and<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:15.150> importance<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:16.640> your<00:01:17.640> grasshopper

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.789 

bring<00:01:21.420> them<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.630> you're<00:01:22.530> gonna<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
bring them up here you're gonna have to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.300 
bring them up here you're gonna have to
look<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.100> speed<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:25.259> want<00:01:25.380> his<00:01:25.590> speed<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.189> be

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
look at speed you want his speed to be

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.710 
look at speed you want his speed to be
over<00:01:26.610> certain<00:01:26.880> value<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> don't<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.600> is

off top of my head Bob bringing up
during<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> fight<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.930> your<00:01:31.259> grasshopper

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
during the fight but if your grasshopper
