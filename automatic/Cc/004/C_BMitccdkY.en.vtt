soon as I found out about this and as
soon<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:32.180> played<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> bit<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.960> thought

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
soon as I played a bit of this I thought

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.959 
soon as I played a bit of this I thought
I<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.489> show<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.760> guys<00:00:36.530> because<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.969> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
I have to show you guys because is it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.970 
I have to show you guys because is it
has<00:00:39.239> got<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> lot<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.809> potential<00:00:40.320> let's<00:00:40.739> put

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
has got a lot of potential let's put

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.340 
has got a lot of potential let's put
this<00:00:41.129> way<00:00:41.370> now<00:00:41.750> why<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> looking<00:00:43.079> at

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this way now why are you looking at

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.260 
this way now why are you looking at
destroyed<00:00:43.739> vehicle<00:00:44.250> ok<00:00:44.670> I'm<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> reset

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
destroyed vehicle ok I'm going to reset

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.740 
destroyed vehicle ok I'm going to reset
the<00:00:45.390> vehicle<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.899> then<00:00:46.260> you'll<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.710> why<00:00:47.750> ok

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the vehicle and then you'll see why ok

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.200 
the vehicle and then you'll see why ok
now<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.770> impossible<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.520> save<00:00:50.910> this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
now it's impossible for you to save this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.080 
now it's impossible for you to save this
Honda<00:00:51.629> Civic<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.110> keep<00:00:52.530> trying<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.850> can't

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
Honda Civic I keep trying but you can't

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.580 
Honda Civic I keep trying but you can't
this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> scenario<00:00:55.500> called<00:00:56.780> cliff<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:58.559> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
this is a scenario called cliff which is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.900 
this is a scenario called cliff which is
a<00:00:58.739> cliff<00:01:00.230> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.829> really<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> show<00:01:02.699> off

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
a cliff this is just really to show off

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.140 
a cliff this is just really to show off
the<00:01:03.149> major<00:01:03.420> feature<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:05.430> engine<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.060> this

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the major feature of this engine in this

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.960 
the major feature of this engine in this
game<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:07.830> call<00:01:08.010> soft<00:01:08.460> body

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
game which is what they call soft body

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.050 
game which is what they call soft body
physics<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.880> going

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
physics so as you can see or is it going

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.420 
physics so as you can see or is it going
to<00:01:12.119> stop<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> stop<00:01:13.350> nope<00:01:13.860> still

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to stop is it going to stop nope still

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.480 
to stop is it going to stop nope still
going<00:01:15.560> now<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.340> this

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
going now as you can see what this

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.130 
going now as you can see what this
driving<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.990> most

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
driving for is to have the most

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.740 
driving for is to have the most
realistic<00:01:20.930> physics<00:01:22.100> when<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> comes<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.820> cars

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
realistic physics when it comes to cars

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.149 
realistic physics when it comes to cars
and<00:01:25.320> how<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.130> crash<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:27.890> don't<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:29.070> I've

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and how they crash I don't think I've

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.789 
and how they crash I don't think I've
ever<00:01:29.189> seen<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.150> game<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.750> part<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.619> obviously

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
ever seen in a game a part of obviously

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.890 
ever seen in a game a part of obviously
wiggle<00:01:32.460> rods<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.119> made<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.659> well

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
wiggle rods because they made it as well

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.260 
wiggle rods because they made it as well
i<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.710> i've<00:01:34.950> ever<00:01:35.009> seen<00:01:35.490> again<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.030> has

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
i think i've ever seen again that has

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.749 
i think i've ever seen again that has
this<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.320> amount<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.130> kind<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
this and this amount of kind of

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.050 
this and this amount of kind of
realistic<00:01:39.270> soft

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
realistic soft

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.490 
realistic soft
damage<00:01:42.159> let's<00:01:43.159> see<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.640> again<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.350> I'm

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
damage let's see that again and I'm

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.260 
damage let's see that again and I'm
going<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.680> try<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:45.920> save<00:01:46.159> it<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:46.700> every<00:01:47.090> time

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
going to try and save it but every time

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.020 
going to try and save it but every time
you<00:01:47.540> can't<00:01:47.780> say<00:01:48.049> that<00:01:48.290> see<00:01:49.280> I'm<00:01:49.549> trying<00:01:49.789> to

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
you can't say that see I'm trying to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.260 
you can't say that see I'm trying to
like<00:01:50.210> verse

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
like verse

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.999 
like verse
and<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.570> just<00:01:52.600> will<00:01:53.409> put<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.710> in<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.890> place

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
and it just will put you in a place

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.230 
and it just will put you in a place
where<00:01:54.369> you<00:01:54.429> can't<00:01:54.759> save<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.119> at<00:01:55.420> all<00:01:55.600> what<00:01:56.200> oh

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
where you can't save it at all what oh

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.569 
where you can't save it at all what oh
so<00:01:58.240> obviously<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.990> just<00:01:59.259> like<00:01:59.579> almost

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
so obviously this is just like almost

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.880 
so obviously this is just like almost
like<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:00.850> demo<00:02:01.360> video<00:02:01.600> just<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.110> introduce<00:02:02.439> you

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
like a demo video just to introduce you

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.490 
like a demo video just to introduce you
guys<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.250> this<00:02:03.610> but<00:02:03.909> they<00:02:04.869> also<00:02:05.049> have<00:02:05.289> other

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
guys to this but they also have other

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.499 
guys to this but they also have other
scenarios<00:02:06.280> where<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.579> can<00:02:06.729> actually<00:02:06.880> drive

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
scenarios where you can actually drive

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.259 
scenarios where you can actually drive
they've<00:02:08.259> got<00:02:08.500> like<00:02:08.769> stunt<00:02:09.340> tracks<00:02:09.819> I<00:02:10.149> mean

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
they've got like stunt tracks I mean

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.789 
they've got like stunt tracks I mean
it's<00:02:10.420> very<00:02:10.720> early<00:02:10.989> you<00:02:11.319> have<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.590> remember

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
it's very early you have to remember

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's very early you have to remember
this<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.160> an<00:02:12.280> hour<00:02:12.400> for<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.090> really<00:02:13.390> early

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
this is an hour for this is really early

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.530 
this is an hour for this is really early
but<00:02:14.709> from<00:02:14.950> what<00:02:15.010> I've<00:02:15.430> seen<00:02:15.459> already<00:02:15.879> i<00:02:16.209> can

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
but from what I've seen already i can

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.530 
but from what I've seen already i can
already<00:02:17.129> envisaged<00:02:18.129> i<00:02:18.549> can<00:02:18.910> make<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> lot<00:02:19.510> of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
already envisaged i can make a lot of

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.390 
already envisaged i can make a lot of
videos<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.920> various<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:21.879> scenarios<00:02:23.400> driving

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
videos of various like scenarios driving

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.069 
videos of various like scenarios driving
with<00:02:24.700> crashing<00:02:25.410> with<00:02:26.410> i<00:02:27.840> believe<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.959> can

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
with crashing with i believe you can

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.650 
with crashing with i believe you can
spawn<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.650> vehicles<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.610> recreate<00:02:31.299> your<00:02:31.510> own

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
spawn in vehicles and recreate your own

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.900 
spawn in vehicles and recreate your own
like<00:02:32.140> crashes<00:02:32.860> oh<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.310> going<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.549> stop<00:02:33.760> it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
like crashes oh is it going to stop it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.680 
like crashes oh is it going to stop it
before<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.599> gets<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.989> end<00:02:35.280> no<00:02:36.280> then<00:02:37.000> this

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
before it gets to the end no then this

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.850 
before it gets to the end no then this
is<00:02:37.900> kind<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.230> what<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.440> saw<00:02:38.650> at<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.739> beginning

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
is kind of what you saw at the beginning

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.199 
is kind of what you saw at the beginning
so<00:02:39.340> yeah<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.660> obviously<00:02:40.780> make<00:02:41.049> your<00:02:41.799> own

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.430 

setups<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.930> see<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.709> can<00:02:48.400> set<00:02:48.760> up

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
setups so you see you can set up

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.680 
setups so you see you can set up
you<00:02:51.040> can<00:02:51.220> set<00:02:51.430> up<00:02:51.550> other<00:02:51.760> vehicles<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.660> stuff

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
you can set up other vehicles and stuff

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.860 
you can set up other vehicles and stuff
and<00:02:53.670> orchestrate<00:02:54.670> accidents<00:02:55.300> I'm<00:02:55.480> gonna<00:02:55.630> be

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
and orchestrate accidents I'm gonna be

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.530 
and orchestrate accidents I'm gonna be
work<00:02:56.340> working<00:02:57.340> this<00:02:57.430> out<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.940> try<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.330> make

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
work working this out and try to make

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.870 
work working this out and try to make
lots<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.140> fun<00:02:59.320> videos<00:02:59.710> with<00:03:00.070> lots<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.610> cars

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
lots of fun videos with lots of cars

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.080 
lots of fun videos with lots of cars
crashing<00:03:01.630> stunt<00:03:02.590> tracks<00:03:03.010> all<00:03:03.370> kind<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.880> stuff

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
crashing stunt tracks all kind of stuff

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.180 
crashing stunt tracks all kind of stuff
and<00:03:04.390> it's<00:03:04.750> it's<00:03:04.990> exciting<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.770> mean<00:03:05.890> imagine

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
and it's it's exciting I mean imagine

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.180 
and it's it's exciting I mean imagine
what<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:07.060> mean<00:03:07.510> this<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:07.930> why<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.230> add<00:03:08.620> at

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
what I mean this is why I add at

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.010 
what I mean this is why I add at
beginning<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.090> video<00:03:10.210> I<00:03:10.390> said<00:03:10.720> it's<00:03:10.900> gonna

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
beginning of the video I said it's gonna

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.960 
beginning of the video I said it's gonna
be<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.230> game<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.890> they're<00:03:12.160> actually<00:03:12.310> making<00:03:12.730> a

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
be a game that they're actually making a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.630 
be a game that they're actually making a
game<00:03:13.180> that's<00:03:13.600> called<00:03:13.840> drive<00:03:14.230> but<00:03:14.980> not<00:03:15.490> only

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
game that's called drive but not only

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.750 
game that's called drive but not only
that<00:03:15.820> they're<00:03:16.270> trying<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:17.230> make<00:03:17.920> an<00:03:18.160> engine

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
that they're trying to make an engine

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.730 
that they're trying to make an engine
which<00:03:19.060> they<00:03:19.300> can<00:03:19.570> then<00:03:19.600> license<00:03:20.410> to<00:03:20.620> other

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
which they can then license to other

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.650 
which they can then license to other
people<00:03:21.280> who<00:03:21.490> when<00:03:21.730> they<00:03:21.760> are<00:03:22.060> making<00:03:22.240> other

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
people who when they are making other

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.130 
people who when they are making other
other<00:03:23.440> games<00:03:24.220> will<00:03:25.120> be<00:03:25.240> able<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.480> use<00:03:25.810> these

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
other games will be able to use these

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.010 
other games will be able to use these
kind<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.950> physics<00:03:27.460> in<00:03:27.760> games<00:03:28.090> like<00:03:28.300> imagine<00:03:28.840> a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
kind of physics in games like imagine a

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.460 
kind of physics in games like imagine a
game<00:03:29.770> like<00:03:30.190> city<00:03:30.610> car<00:03:30.910> driving<00:03:30.940> with<00:03:31.810> these

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
game like city car driving with these

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.010 
game like city car driving with these
kind<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:32.980> physics<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.520> when<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.060> crash<00:03:34.360> then

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
kind of physics that when you crash then

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.220 
kind of physics that when you crash then
the<00:03:35.320> car<00:03:35.590> will<00:03:35.830> actually<00:03:36.370> like<00:03:36.790> get<00:03:37.330> destroyed

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
the car will actually like get destroyed

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.340 
the car will actually like get destroyed
in<00:03:38.770> a<00:03:39.400> relatively<00:03:40.000> realistic<00:03:40.420> way<00:03:40.960> I<00:03:40.990> mean

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
in a relatively realistic way I mean

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.040 
in a relatively realistic way I mean
maybe<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:41.800> is<00:03:42.010> not<00:03:42.220> totally<00:03:43.180> realistic<00:03:43.780> but

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
maybe this is not totally realistic but

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.840 
maybe this is not totally realistic but
it's<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.350> most<00:03:44.560> realistic<00:03:44.800> I've<00:03:45.430> ever<00:03:45.610> seen

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
it's the most realistic I've ever seen

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.180 
it's the most realistic I've ever seen
okay<00:03:46.630> before<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.020> end<00:03:47.170> this<00:03:47.320> video<00:03:47.470> guys<00:03:47.800> I'm

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
okay before I end this video guys I'm

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.740 
okay before I end this video guys I'm
going<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> do<00:03:48.520> one<00:03:48.730> more<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.270> ready<00:03:49.420> for<00:03:49.660> one
