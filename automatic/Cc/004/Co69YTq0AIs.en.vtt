00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
it's because I did not want this to

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.650 
it's because I did not want this to
start<00:00:16.869> happening<00:00:17.490> where<00:00:18.490> your<00:00:19.390> attention

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
goes to the incoming weapon and you

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.190 
goes to the incoming weapon and you
start<00:00:22.990> using<00:00:23.320> your<00:00:23.619> hands<00:00:24.070> for<00:00:24.279> defense<00:00:24.900> okay
