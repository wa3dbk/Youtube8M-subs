00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.260 

so<00:00:40.020> yeah<00:00:40.230> natural<00:00:40.740> talent<00:00:41.130> I<00:00:41.250> mean<00:00:41.400> I<00:00:41.610> don't<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
so yeah natural talent I mean I don't I

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.880 
so yeah natural talent I mean I don't I
don't<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.720> guess<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.380> people<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.650> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
don't know I guess some people have it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.770 
don't know I guess some people have it
naturally<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:44.670> people<00:00:44.970> don't<00:00:45.150> but<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
naturally and some people don't but I

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.660 
naturally and some people don't but I
think<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.230> definitely<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.950> sport<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> lot

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
think it's definitely the sport is a lot

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
think it's definitely the sport is a lot
mental<00:00:48.120> he<00:00:48.300> goes<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.140> believe<00:00:49.410> in

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
mental he goes like you believe in

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
mental he goes like you believe in
yourself<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.100> pretty<00:00:50.370> much<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.760> anything

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
yourself you can pretty much do anything

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.450 
yourself you can pretty much do anything
like<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> think<00:00:52.410> that's<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.950> it<00:00:53.040> is<00:00:53.130> I

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
like so I think that's what it is I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.860 
like so I think that's what it is I
don't<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.150> I<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.480> think<00:00:54.630> it's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
don't know if I I don't think it's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.479 
don't know if I I don't think it's
completely<00:00:55.379> natural<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.220> first

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
completely natural because when I first

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.010 
completely natural because when I first
got<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:56.820> snowboard<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.330> flew<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> way

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
got on the snowboard I flew on the way

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.010 
got on the snowboard I flew on the way
back<00:00:58.170> because<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:59.040> was<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.370> slippery<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.120> just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
back because it was so slippery but just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810 
back because it was so slippery but just
after<00:01:01.320> time<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.890> everything<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.640> think

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
after time and everything I think

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.300 
after time and everything I think
everyone<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.330> learn<00:01:03.570> how<00:01:03.720> to<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.900> it<00:01:04.050> you<00:01:04.140> know

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
well I think definitely boardercross has

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.240 
well I think definitely boardercross has
helped<00:04:03.720> me<00:04:03.870> be<00:04:04.350> able<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.710> gain<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.920> lot<00:04:05.220> more

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
helped me be able to gain a lot more

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.180 
helped me be able to gain a lot more
speed<00:04:05.760> for<00:04:06.150> like<00:04:06.330> certain<00:04:06.690> courses<00:04:06.990> a<00:04:07.410> lot<00:04:07.890> of

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
speed for like certain courses a lot of

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.890 
speed for like certain courses a lot of
times<00:04:08.400> girls<00:04:08.640> have<00:04:08.970> problems<00:04:09.420> like<00:04:09.600> getting

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
times girls have problems like getting

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.140 
times girls have problems like getting
speed<00:04:10.140> for<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.500> big<00:04:10.680> jumps<00:04:11.070> but<00:04:11.310> I'm<00:04:11.850> pretty

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
speed for the big jumps but I'm pretty

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.420 
speed for the big jumps but I'm pretty
good<00:04:12.390> at<00:04:12.510> like<00:04:12.690> like<00:04:13.320> just<00:04:13.620> using<00:04:13.950> whatever<00:04:14.250> I

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
good at like like just using whatever I

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.130 
good at like like just using whatever I
can<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.850> get<00:04:14.970> speed<00:04:15.240> from<00:04:15.450> boardercross<00:04:15.900> you

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
can to get speed from boardercross you

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.900 
can to get speed from boardercross you
know<00:04:16.260> because<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.560> have<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.800> like<00:04:16.950> pump<00:04:17.520> every

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
know because you have to like pump every

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.570 
know because you have to like pump every
little<00:04:18.150> like<00:04:18.360> bump<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.140> can<00:04:19.290> find<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:20.190> think

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
little like bump you can find so I think

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.400 
little like bump you can find so I think
boardercross<00:04:21.060> definitely<00:04:21.690> helps<00:04:21.959> with<00:04:22.170> slope

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
boardercross definitely helps with slope

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.680 
boardercross definitely helps with slope
style<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:23.100> I<00:04:23.310> think<00:04:23.550> slope<00:04:24.060> style<00:04:24.240> helps<00:04:24.570> you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
style and I think slope style helps you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.240 
style and I think slope style helps you
with<00:04:24.810> halfpipe<00:04:25.320> because<00:04:25.710> it's<00:04:25.920> kind<00:04:26.160> of

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
rewarding than any contest I did

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.050 
rewarding than any contest I did
definitely<00:04:49.140> it's<00:04:49.860> just<00:04:50.040> like<00:04:50.190> so<00:04:50.430> much<00:04:50.490> effort

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
definitely it's just like so much effort

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.060 
definitely it's just like so much effort
and<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:51.720> remember<00:04:52.170> like<00:04:52.350> how<00:04:52.560> hard<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.920> was<00:04:53.010> to

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
and you remember like how hard it was to

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.890 
and you remember like how hard it was to
hit<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.460> one<00:04:53.670> trick<00:04:53.970> but<00:04:54.210> once<00:04:54.420> he<00:04:54.570> got<00:04:54.720> it

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
hit that one trick but once he got it

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.080 
hit that one trick but once he got it
it's<00:04:55.050> awesome

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.210 

I<00:04:59.120> think<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.960> Olympics<00:05:00.380> would<00:05:00.500> be<00:05:00.650> super<00:05:01.040> cool

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
I think the Olympics would be super cool

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.730 
I think the Olympics would be super cool
I<00:05:01.520> mean<00:05:01.700> I'm<00:05:02.210> not<00:05:02.360> gonna<00:05:02.510> be<00:05:02.690> like<00:05:02.840> I<00:05:02.900> gotta<00:05:03.530> go

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
I mean I'm not gonna be like I gotta go

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.170 
I mean I'm not gonna be like I gotta go
to<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.950> Olympics<00:05:04.400> but<00:05:04.700> I<00:05:04.760> mean<00:05:04.940> it<00:05:05.030> would<00:05:05.150> be

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
to the Olympics but I mean it would be

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.420 
to the Olympics but I mean it would be
cool<00:05:05.450> I'm<00:05:06.080> not<00:05:06.140> much<00:05:06.500> of<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.710> halfpipe<00:05:07.130> rider

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
cool I'm not much of a halfpipe rider

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.250 
cool I'm not much of a halfpipe rider
but<00:05:07.700> I'd<00:05:07.820> like<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.150> learn<00:05:08.330> it's<00:05:08.570> really<00:05:08.840> fun

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260
