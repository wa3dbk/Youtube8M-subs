00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.490
 So, if you know what's going on in Munich 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 actually lead card I had games 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.029
 you actually still have in the reserve 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.480
 without the injured 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.490
 there was Munich with security of those 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.859
 paint as we have so played the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.260
 last year probably personell on 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.539
 weakest worst but busy 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.790
 Nonetheless, that's tremendous quality 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.250
 anyway in the square who has to 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.239
 Of course many hopes he has a good one 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.280
 match plan but we do not have it 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.440
 really very well done to still 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.050
 We are also in the lead too 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.250
 go and where possible with one 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.960
 another arbitrator decision too 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.940
 in the first half you have too 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.989
 get an eleven meter for us 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.410
 maybe even a red or 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.489
 yellow-red card for the opponent but 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.750
 Nonetheless, that was not the case 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.610
 as we imagined 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 In any case he went even further against 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.910
 the opponent that was a pity because of 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.620
 opponents already a bit struck 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.890
 was also through the game during the week 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.689
 and also looking ahead with the game 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.490
 what he has on tuesday, they have that 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.619
 Play slowly made very controlled 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.760
 tried to play very little 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.490
 to make mistakes and we wanted 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.869
 actually reinbringen as more trubel 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.060
 more in the battles come that 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.250
 piece by piece our stamp on it 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.820
 to press but the opponent has very much 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 well done 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.530
 no matter who you are with always arriving 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 still the best team in germany 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.979
 are the whole yesterday again 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.670
 shown that their qualities have that 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.479
 the players all play on the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 bring space 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.420
 and if I have those three or two three 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.490
 she uses good possibilities 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.170
 you will always be able to give 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 A game to win the Bundesliga 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.229
 you do not know that you are against the bavaria 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.659
 I get too many chances 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.210
 portals 45 goals from three goals 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.740
 made and luck was not too 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 maybe husum at times then 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.520
 through through his new foot into the gate 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.079
 Normally , the referee gives affair 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.399
 who admitted himself that one 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.490
 eleven meters and a clear mistake 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.810
 from him this game happiness of the need 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.200
 times also be against his opponents 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.479
 win 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.710
 not win four times in succession 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.170
 is certainly not easy 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.129
 this is a task we are now 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.680
 have to deal with 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.879
 but it's not like us 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.840
 have played continuously bad 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.370
 it was all games in the top model 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.959
 trophy game we can just as well 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.040
 also win the other games up 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.959
 gladbach think I was always one 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.440
 Possibility to do it differently 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.739
 sometimes you have everything you need 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.870
 Determination needed luck 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.660
 in the end, we have to be new again 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.340
 set up again go in the game 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.340
 get started with zero zero and we will 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.900
 so big with big power and big 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.239
 self-confidence also in Hanover again 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.069
 occur enormously important and somewhere 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.480
 Also a blueprint feed will be there 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.430
 a similar constellation that or 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.800
 forums a form hanover game faith 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.930
 I could not win four games 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.480
 and hanover were such a thing for us 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.459
 turnaround game 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.840
 There are never really nice games 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.190
 all in the conception far 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.390
 Also, we are both not very happy now 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.890
 The Hanoverians were successful 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.260
 I believe in the whole second half 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.530
 no victory have retracted the shrine 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.300
 will date again 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.800
 to get to us, we have to implement 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.390
 not necessarily with them now 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.790
 have to do nice things but go 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.350
 it's really about naked survival too 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.260
 for the hanoveraner also for us goes 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.010
 We have reason to in this spielereien 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.630
 fight 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.630
 certainly a hot fight
