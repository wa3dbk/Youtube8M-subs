00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 everyone must be exposed is the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.759
 comment of the first trailer of terminator 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.550
 genesis films to be released in 2015 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.219
 direct from scratch then this trader 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.639
 despite being broken in front of why 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.680
 I don't think I won't say it's a good one 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.970
 he still directs the work I did with 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.210
 thorne dark organ liked 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.660
 minimally for three reasons why 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.949
 we have a thor that should be 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.080
 fantasy and has been made even more 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.939
 science fiction even more than 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.250
 first movie then we see fighters 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.070
 seats assigned to the star wars but ne 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.670
 star wars and nation pie let me go back 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.500
 second reason very low comedy 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.149
 level there is very epic action scenes 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 as the final tractor combat 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.890
 male kit comes this is interrupted 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.340
 epic almost this 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.879
 take care of this tension 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.190
 to the action of si stupid stupid kind 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.960
 two characters who slip on to see them 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.600
 a building and the staff look like 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.640
 two of everything that I sincerely 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.840
 then maybe not many laugh 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.780
 other upcoming forms to laugh at and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.810
 they didn't like third reason why 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.010
 then this would have to be really 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.229
 interesting because mana character 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.530
 everything needs to be developed better and 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.659
 we have a script directing a film 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 which he cannot in the least describe 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.259
 the second me markit and character 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.009
 interpreted worse is described written 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.720
 worst of all, less thorough 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.850
 the marvel movie universe 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.100
 studios really less written character 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.229
 we have characterized him in my opinion 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.659
 not there despite the actor seemed 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.619
 that is it was one of the top including the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.299
 nation 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.250
 other thing than the script that doesn't 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.130
 I liked it and also the direction 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.549
 its mother died of the film itself 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.159
 thor trinca and this scene was not 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.979
 able to elicit anything 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.319
 his funeral is really nothing 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.179
 perna was something that I have 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.439
 since they really did stir up 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.880
 nothing therefore with films that sincerely 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.220
 left me nothing but that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.370
 this will return again despite this 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.090
 trailer looks very much to you 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.420
 interesting so I have good expectations 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.480
 path film because why the story e 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.640
 brave what this saga wants to do 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.489
 has decided to undertake this 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.160
 brave will be or how it happened 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.170
 knicks in the days of the past may 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.510
 wants to reset the continuation of the films 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.150
 precedents and starting a new story is 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.780
 a new narrative arc because why 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.010
 as is known in the supported and terminated 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.959
 there was this judgment day 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.599
 those machines have become aware and 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.310
 check and there is a war from this 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.879
 judgment day three engine men 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.269
 in the future the machines are winning e 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.340
 men what they want to do since 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.829
 the machines sent a terminator 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.920
 in the past to kill sarah with who she is 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.319
 the mother of the leader of human resistance 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.590
 humans decide to take and send 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.040
 a soldier to save sarah's life 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.200
 connor and this is sent to a 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.359
 period in which he knows with besides being 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.700
 a scared girl in weak defense 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.919
 and instead this soldier who go into 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.959
 past find to saving cazzutissima 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:22.260
 just who fights that shoots high 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.299
 a thousand and one customer also saves life is 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.720
 what much to count on that has a lot 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.419
 funny sarah connor allies to amal 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.690
 dysfunction but that the terminator 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.970
 800 action is really that I or golden of 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.669
 this schwarzenegger trailer that does 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.739
 himself out himself just 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:42.959
 arrived in the present era indeed 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.329
 as a scene in iii it had been fantastic 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.639
 in the film I think it will be even more 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.030
 because there will be a complete assembly e 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.850
 the soundtrack that I believe anyway 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.190
 I hope that characterizes this scene 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.650
 and then another fantastic piece in which 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.780
 this great fantastic actor who 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.090
 despite having 70 years still there 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.370
 acting in chris action movies 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.290
 morgan partner takes it from a 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.330
 helicopter you know there are four more e 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.700
 sends him into a thousand pieces 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.690
 despite this then aviation ce 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.380
 there really is so much 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.000
 the square cast ie mila clark 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.220
 very famous very important character 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.690
 by kemal thrones there is arm dual sim egger 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.180
 cezanne planck fell with 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.680
 very important part in the apes revolution 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.620
 and planet of the apes as of the movies 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.330
 this year's best of this 2014 the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.940
 cast there is to the story must be 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.630
 very very interesting because it erases 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.850
 everything to the past and from a development 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.470
 free and totally new this saga 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.160
 lose that point there will also be two 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.560
 his two sequels of this film the action 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.780
 there will be and the only thing will be beautiful 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.370
 that I didn't like about this take 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.250
 the only flaw of this air trend is 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.110
 the evening really special effects 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.390
 look carefully you can see 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.500
 also quietly from the character 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.600
 of t 1000 that while it shoots imperia 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.860
 liquid metal sailing ships that sends the 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.140
 I have a special effect 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.990
 badly done 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.760
 then I say how a movie is a saga 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.960
 very important so for sure there 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.700
 will have been a budget above 100 120 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.050
 millions believe in the notes notes of this 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.960
 type will have a project of this type 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.270
 here is magik so that high still good 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.430
 I do not understand where some has been spent 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.200
 I hope these special effects of 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.270
 low quality that less liked for 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.160
 nothing is simply due to 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.980
 done because they haven't been yet 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.250
 completed because signatures in 2015 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.080
 I believe unity 2015 is in 2014 in short 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.670
 in many months of work 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.450
 I hope that is why 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:46.760
 an example of the tv spot was presented 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.580
 as 4 had special effects that 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.770
 they had to be totally updated 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.140
 modernized and completed I hope that 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.140
 also in this case the situation is 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.060
 this is because I really do indeed 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.710
 specials of this type in the cinema 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.870
 it could really be really 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:08.510
 of the element because in short it will be a 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.980
 and there have been previous films 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.540
 some in the 2000s others over the years 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.330
 previous pros however are always 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.730
 movie statuses with good effects 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.060
 special and really in 2015 hours of 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.770
 special effects indicative of thickness 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.330
 that look like a movie from ten years ago 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.060
 it would be really disappointing especially 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.310
 for a budget that is still modest and good 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:31.220
 which should therefore have nothing 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.740
 this is condemned here will be a good movie 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.930
 funny impeller fiction 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.820
 connotation excellent cases 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.210
 the only thing I hope these three that 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:44.090
 these special effects really come 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.580
 improved because in my opinion not 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.920
 so I say hello see you 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.350
 video impressions and liked the 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.060
 video put me like commentate do me

 know what you think of this trailer 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.100
 of this cinematic saga and if 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.070
 you consider me making me any type 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.600
