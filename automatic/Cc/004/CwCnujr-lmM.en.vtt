00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
volume than I'm getting and then I'm

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.410 
volume than I'm getting and then I'm
just<00:03:19.709> gonna<00:03:19.950> start<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.640> other<00:03:20.940> side<00:03:21.239> of<00:03:21.360> my

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
just gonna start on the other side of my

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.710 
just gonna start on the other side of my
head<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:22.020> usually<00:03:22.860> do<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.430> deeper<00:03:24.209> part<00:03:24.480> than

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
head I usually do a deeper part than

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.540 
head I usually do a deeper part than
this<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.320> my<00:03:25.590> hair<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.070> naturally<00:03:26.370> felt

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
this but my hair just naturally felt

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.850 
this but my hair just naturally felt
like<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.850> today<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.380> it's<00:03:28.380> not<00:03:28.470> gonna<00:03:28.650> really

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
like this today so it's not gonna really

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.350 
like this today so it's not gonna really
matter<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.610> end<00:03:29.730> you're<00:03:29.850> gonna<00:03:29.940> pull<00:03:30.180> most

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
matter in the end you're gonna pull most

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.810 
matter in the end you're gonna pull most
of<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.690> towards<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.560> back<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:32.190> your<00:03:32.640> hair

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
of it towards the back of your hair

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.870 
of it towards the back of your hair
anyhow<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:35.690> on<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.980> side<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.220> you're<00:03:38.580> going

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
anyhow so on the side that you're going

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.790 
anyhow so on the side that you're going
to<00:03:38.940> have<00:03:39.420> more<00:03:39.780> hair<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:40.410> want<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.680> go<00:03:40.770> a

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
to have more hair you want to go a

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.780 
to have more hair you want to go a
little<00:03:40.920> bit<00:03:41.340> deeper<00:03:42.920> down<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.160> side<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.640> your

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
little bit deeper down the side of your

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.500 
little bit deeper down the side of your
head<00:03:45.200> with<00:03:46.200> your<00:03:46.230> layers<00:03:46.820> just<00:03:47.820> so<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.450> you

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
head with your layers just so that you

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.180 
head with your layers just so that you
have<00:03:48.660> more<00:03:48.810> volume<00:03:49.290> because<00:03:49.770> it's<00:03:50.010> going<00:03:50.130> to

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
have more volume because it's going to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.740 
have more volume because it's going to
be<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.310> lot<00:03:50.430> heavier<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.420> side<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.690> your

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
be a lot heavier on that side of your

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.350 
be a lot heavier on that side of your
head<00:03:51.930> because<00:03:52.050> you<00:03:52.200> have<00:03:52.290> more<00:03:52.440> hair<00:03:52.680> falling

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
head because you have more hair falling

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.199 
head because you have more hair falling
down<00:03:54.360> on<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.080> rest<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.530> your<00:03:55.940> beehive<00:03:56.940> I

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
down on to the rest of your beehive I

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.110 
down on to the rest of your beehive I
guess<00:03:57.390> if<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.780> want<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.050> say<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:59.820> I'm<00:03:59.940> just

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
guess if you want to say and I'm just

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.560 
guess if you want to say and I'm just
continuing<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.750> backcomb<00:04:01.170> here<00:04:05.480> shooting<00:04:06.480> a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
continuing to backcomb here shooting a

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:13.600 
continuing to backcomb here shooting a
little<00:04:06.840> more<00:04:06.989> hairspray

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.229 

this<00:04:14.610> one<00:04:14.820> I<00:04:14.850> go<00:04:15.090> about<00:04:15.360> four<00:04:15.870> layers<00:04:16.260> down

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
this one I go about four layers down

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.640 
this one I go about four layers down
sometimes<00:04:18.239> they<00:04:18.360> go<00:04:18.480> about<00:04:18.690> five<00:04:18.959> layers<00:04:19.320> down

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
sometimes they go about five layers down

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.510 
sometimes they go about five layers down
and<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.010> usually<00:04:20.340> take<00:04:20.520> about<00:04:20.550> one-inch

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
and I usually take about one-inch

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:30.370 
and I usually take about one-inch
sections

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.730 

and<00:04:30.890> then<00:04:31.130> I<00:04:31.280> flip<00:04:31.610> that<00:04:31.760> back<00:04:31.970> over<00:04:32.240> and<00:04:32.810> look

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
and then I flip that back over and look

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.790 
and then I flip that back over and look
like<00:04:33.980> a<00:04:34.040> hot<00:04:34.460> hot<00:04:34.490> mess<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:36.440> then<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.650> usually

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
like a hot hot mess and then I usually

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.970 
like a hot hot mess and then I usually
only<00:04:37.070> do<00:04:37.280> like<00:04:37.490> one<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:38.750> two<00:04:38.960> in<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.290> back<00:04:39.500> just

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
only do like one to two in the back just

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.080 
only do like one to two in the back just
because<00:04:40.160> all<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.550> hair<00:04:40.730> that<00:04:40.760> we're<00:04:41.000> gonna

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
because all the hair that we're gonna

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.600 
because all the hair that we're gonna
pull<00:04:41.390> back<00:04:41.660> anyhow<00:04:42.500> it's<00:04:42.860> gonna<00:04:42.980> go<00:04:43.220> over<00:04:43.520> and

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
pull back anyhow it's gonna go over and

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.420 
pull back anyhow it's gonna go over and
add<00:04:43.760> a<00:04:43.790> lot<00:04:43.970> of<00:04:44.000> volume<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:44.980> plus<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.220> can't

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
add a lot of volume so plus you can't

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.530 
add a lot of volume so plus you can't
really<00:04:46.580> see<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.910> back<00:04:47.060> of<00:04:47.180> your<00:04:47.240> head<00:04:47.420> very

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
really see the back of your head very

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.270 
really see the back of your head very
well<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:48.020> it's<00:04:48.230> just<00:04:48.530> easier<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:48.890> just<00:04:49.190> see

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
well and it's just easier to just see

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.840 
well and it's just easier to just see
one<00:04:49.490> or<00:04:49.610> two<00:04:49.640> layers<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:52.250> here<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:52.520> think<00:04:52.580> I'm

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
one or two layers so here I think I'm

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.140 
one or two layers so here I think I'm
just<00:04:53.030> gonna<00:04:53.120> do<00:04:53.330> two<00:04:53.540> layers<00:04:54.910> spray<00:04:55.910> some

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
just gonna do two layers spray some
