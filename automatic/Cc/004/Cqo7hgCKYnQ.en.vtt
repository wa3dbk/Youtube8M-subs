the screen is closed actually doing

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.330 
the screen is closed actually doing
character<00:00:56.809> input<00:00:56.989> as<00:00:57.320> well<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:57.890> that's<00:00:58.039> a

the device there's a mini USB full USB

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.580 
the device there's a mini USB full USB
so<00:01:39.399> in<00:01:39.819> comparison<00:01:40.119> with<00:01:40.810> for<00:01:41.500> example

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
so in comparison with for example

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.520 
so in comparison with for example
android-based<00:01:42.340> devices<00:01:42.939> full<00:01:43.600> USB<00:01:44.200> host

android-based devices full USB host

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.870 
android-based devices full USB host
capability<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.399> this<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.640> one<00:01:45.759> of<00:01:45.789> the

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
capability so this is one of the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.050 
capability so this is one of the
advantages<00:01:46.179> of<00:01:46.630> oak<00:01:47.590> trail<00:01:47.860> platform<00:01:48.429> here<00:01:48.909> we

more<00:02:23.139> of<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.889> vote<00:02:24.100> trial<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:24.910> what<00:02:25.120> will

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
more of a vote trial so what will

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.030 
more of a vote trial so what will
probably<00:02:25.389> happen<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:26.019> once<00:02:26.200> oak<00:02:26.530> trail<00:02:26.799> is

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
probably happen is once oak trail is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.949 
probably happen is once oak trail is

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
refined once the software as we find

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.539 
refined once the software as we find
that<00:02:29.230> will<00:02:29.680> actually<00:02:29.829> be<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.069> flat<00:02:30.340> battery

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
that will actually be a flat battery

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.580 
that will actually be a flat battery
pack<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.120> much<00:02:31.359> smaller<00:02:31.540> than<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.109> i'm

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
pack and much smaller than that i'm

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.140 
pack and much smaller than that i'm
guessing<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.100> could<00:02:33.220> probably<00:02:33.370> put<00:02:33.579> a<00:02:33.609> 10<00:02:33.910> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
guessing you could probably put a 10 to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.210 
guessing you could probably put a 10 to
12<00:02:34.389> hour<00:02:34.690> battery<00:02:34.930> in<00:02:35.290> here<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.799> may<00:02:36.040> not

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
12 hour battery in here so this may not

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.550 
12 hour battery in here so this may not
be<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.970> know<00:02:37.090> you're<00:02:37.209> all<00:02:37.329> day<00:02:37.569> device<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.350> it

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
be you know you're all day device but it

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.930 
be you know you're all day device but it
could<00:02:38.709> be<00:02:38.829> an<00:02:38.920> interesting<00:02:39.220> maybe<00:02:39.609> three

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
could be an interesting maybe three

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.800 
could be an interesting maybe three
four-hour<00:02:40.650> device<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.180> not<00:02:43.389> nice<00:02:43.630> and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
four-hour device kind of not nice and

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.860 
four-hour device kind of not nice and
light<00:02:44.019> probably<00:02:44.889> around<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.549> 300<00:02:46.239> grams<00:02:46.480> mark

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
light probably around the 300 grams mark

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.670 
light probably around the 300 grams mark
at<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.560> guess<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:48.430> will<00:02:49.420> be<00:02:49.989> interested<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.470> see

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
at a guess and will be interested to see

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.809 
at a guess and will be interested to see
how<00:02:50.799> these<00:02:51.510> almost<00:02:52.510> keys<00:02:52.810> work<00:02:53.170> its<00:02:53.590> is

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
how these almost keys work its is

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.800 
how these almost keys work its is
something<00:02:54.819> that<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.150> we<00:02:55.269> watch<00:02:55.389> the<00:02:55.540> video<00:02:55.780> on

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
something that so we watch the video on

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.539 
something that so we watch the video on
it<00:02:56.290> looks<00:02:56.470> very<00:02:56.709> interesting<00:02:56.859> can<00:02:57.280> i<00:02:57.340> close

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
it looks very interesting can i close
