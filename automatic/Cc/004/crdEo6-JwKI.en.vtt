00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.530
 everyone is magic 2 obviously for 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.300
 just logical only is the 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.000
 rune payment that m about if it does not explain 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.380
 ok but it does not matter then what are we going 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.180
 to do practically we are going to show 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.250
 how magic as the following sale 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.680
 one and then this is full here 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.800
 in addition is accompanying my partner is 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.430
 what a mine that is here I think 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.900
 that there is something there 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.530
 praised the courage began to make up 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.530
 warn 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:51.680
 because it is full 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.680
 and let's start with rings right away 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.170
 so I can put this on 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.420
 ok we start 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.100
 and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.530
 or not 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.289
 it takes us 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.240
 yes 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.320
 yes 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.320
 yes 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.640
 yes 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.830
 yes 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.210
 or not 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.270
 to 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.920
 yes 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.840
 yes 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.829
 but 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:17.290
 and none will come out so so so 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:21.209
 no last ong came out that I'm very 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.209
 happy and the last and 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.730
 this did not come out 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.659
 sometimes confused in reality 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.659
 grazes 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.900
 well now if you think there's you 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.719
 because because this video was also going on 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.760
 video was not just to show you 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.099
 how they simply made these 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.269
 easy I also wanted to show you what 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.439
 that a lot of people have been bothering me 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.010
 By facebook 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:51.680
 the facebook has been bothering 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.909
 what has been bothering you 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.680
 because because they have seen that I 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.000
 quite sixths always say that what 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.150
 I do this way that has to do 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.799
 what happens if you want to show him if you do not 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.360
 leaves none as more and more pass 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.400
 now that I show you that this is not 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.319
 easy that just because we suppose several 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.690
 objects are not going to come out of 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.840
 way 100 objects and no one has come out 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.209
 just that you have this many people 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.850
 he tells me and many times have done that 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.789
 they have remained relatively poor 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.989
 because no single fact has come out 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.750
 then I want to get there, you have to say that 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.930
 this is not easy that they do not do that 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.060
 do these can come can be easy 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.130
 seeing is true it can be easy but it is not 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.740
 so that everyone can do it and 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.160
 encourage them to stop doing it because 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.870
 because these crazy things are crazy and 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.190
 it is not known if it will come out or not because 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.010
 remember 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.140
 he does not know what he does not know is what one 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.030
 is learning by doing them there is no 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.010
 a relative way that in this is 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.960
 come out but there are guidelines for you 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.550
 get to come out as well as come as well 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.170
 what is laughing right now is not 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.170
 I know what but then he goes to see me 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.510
 then the video was finished if this is the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.699
 first video of the channel may have 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.660
 been a total file but it does not matter 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.660
 I mainly wanted 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.100
 first of all he makes the video so that 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.600
 all right that this is not easy for you 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.760
 the more than 100 messages that I have 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.500
 sent by facebook know that this 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.510
 it 's easy for me and that only by mayer several 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.940
 objects it is good that you will leave with 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.830
 this culminated with this I say goodbye and 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.520
 with this I tell you until next time 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.510
 greeting 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.510
 kisses bye bye
