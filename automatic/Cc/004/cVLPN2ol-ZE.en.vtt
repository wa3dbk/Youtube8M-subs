00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.390
 the car was positioned as a suite all and 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.040
 able to give pleasure 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.590
 to the driver as a city crush 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.739
 and on the highway and on the lung 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.739
 off road 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.310
 six months later in '98 car 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.320
 went into mass production under 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.390
 trademark lexus rx300 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.740
 the car is built on a sedan platform 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.120
 lexus es300 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.580
 or what is it called in its homeland 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.060
 toyota windom Belonging 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.140
 luxury car line 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.290
 powertrain is a 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.260
 three-liter valve 24 and 220 strong 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.110
 v-shaped six that crowns 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.060
 4-speed automatic I myself 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.100
 personally never paid attention to everything 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.960
 the above roller but except for 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.970
 engine size is more important to me 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.160
 the emotional component that is 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.770
 how friendly is being with me 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.750
 this or that car machine despite 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.100
 your weight all-wheel drive option is 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.470
 about two tons behaves enough 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.869
 briskly thanks to a custom intake and 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.619
 the exhaust path to the precise operation of the machine 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.619
 in the brake system 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.520
 many say that for three liter 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.830
 engine and the mass of the car 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.259
 four steps box automatic 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.130
 very little and rush down machine 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.680
 slows down 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.479
 guys this is not a sports car at the very 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.930
 In fact, the car is designed to 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.270
 ride 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.820
 but this one is the second failure 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.350
 this is a very clever design 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.729
 development on the subject of 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.729
 what if u change your mind 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.440
 the car in its time collected in itself 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.950
 qualities would seem unthinkable and for 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.780
 at times 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.450
 unique very balanced 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.250
 design rapid forms powerful motors 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.020
 four-wheel drive by the way there and 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.030
 front natural version but not 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.550
 get scared they are extremely rare and 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.890
 listed in the red book and of course 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.590
 magnificent salon absolutely ergonomic 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.790
 equipped with the latest technology 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.800
 the word say the Japanese are always 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.200
 equip your car and how for people 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.040
 These are buns that the Japanese have 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.019
 standard 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.910
 from a car manufacturer with others 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.090
 countries are additional options 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.620
 for which you need to pay extra 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.510
 and now in the secondary market to him 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.370
 virtually no equal because neither 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.220
 one crossover cannot offer 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.540
 to his master what rx300 can 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.540
 its price segment
