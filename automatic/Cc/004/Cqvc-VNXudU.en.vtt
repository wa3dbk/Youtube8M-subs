setting up a tank is conservative I'm a

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.390 
setting up a tank is conservative I'm a
conservative<00:00:09.889> but<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:11.040> want<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.309> be

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
conservative but we want to be

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.009 
conservative but we want to be
conservative<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.120> how<00:00:12.480> we<00:00:12.540> do<00:00:12.750> all<00:00:12.900> these

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
conservative and how we do all these

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.859 
conservative and how we do all these
things<00:00:14.240> in<00:00:15.350> transporting<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> fish<00:00:17.720> to<00:00:18.720> your

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
things in transporting the fish to your

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.820 
things in transporting the fish to your
tank<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.949> conservative<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:21.600> don't<00:00:21.830> want

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
tank think conservative you don't want

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.859 
tank think conservative you don't want
to<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> fish<00:00:24.029> obviously<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.660> dump

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
to just get the fish obviously and dump

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.980 
to just get the fish obviously and dump
them<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.140> there<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.590> couple<00:00:25.769> reasons<00:00:26.660> main<00:00:27.660> one

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
them in there a couple reasons main one

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.769 
them in there a couple reasons main one
being<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:29.730> temperatures<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.660> be

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
being that the temperatures have to be

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.749 
being that the temperatures have to be
the<00:00:30.960> same<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.740> we're<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.219> we're

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the same so what we're going to do we're

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.110 
the same so what we're going to do we're
going<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> take<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.380> fish<00:00:34.380> bag<00:00:34.760> float<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.940> in

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
going to take that fish bag float it in

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.860 
going to take that fish bag float it in
your<00:00:36.690> tank<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:39.110> one<00:00:40.110> quality<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:41.660> water<00:00:42.660> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
your tank and one quality about water is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.930 
your tank and one quality about water is
it<00:00:43.050> changes<00:00:43.500> temperature<00:00:43.920> very<00:00:44.160> slowly<00:00:44.579> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it changes temperature very slowly so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.569 
it changes temperature very slowly so
that<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.329> works<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.719> our<00:00:45.840> advantage<00:00:46.370> in<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
that that works in our advantage in this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.270 
that that works in our advantage in this
in<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.480> hobby<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.379> we're<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:49.920> take<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
in this hobby so we're gonna take the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.560 
in this hobby so we're gonna take the
fish<00:00:50.940> bag<00:00:51.210> float<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.230> open<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:54.329> do

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
fish bag float it open it up and do

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.600 
fish bag float it open it up and do
nothing<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:55.110> than<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.590> let<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.309> bag

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
nothing other than just let that bag

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
nothing other than just let that bag
with<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.149> fish<00:00:57.390> inside<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.079> bag<00:00:58.350> float<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
with the fish inside this bag float in

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.889 
with the fish inside this bag float in
your<00:00:59.730> tank<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> water<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.570> they're<00:01:00.719> gonna

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
your tank the water that they're gonna

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.789 
your tank the water that they're gonna
go<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.800> about<00:01:02.370> 20<00:01:02.820> minutes<00:01:02.969> now

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
go into for about 20 minutes now

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.260 
go into for about 20 minutes now
obviously<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> lot<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:06.060> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
obviously if you have a lot of if you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.780 
obviously if you have a lot of if you
have<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> much<00:01:06.869> larger<00:01:07.490> amount<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.580> water

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
have a much larger amount of water

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.789 
have a much larger amount of water
you're<00:01:08.939> gonna<00:01:09.000> maybe<00:01:09.540> make<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.840> 45<00:01:10.770> minutes

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
you're gonna maybe make that 45 minutes

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.250 
you're gonna maybe make that 45 minutes
because<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.670> more<00:01:11.909> water<00:01:12.119> but<00:01:12.450> for

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
because that's just more water but for

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.530 
because that's just more water but for
most<00:01:13.409> purposes<00:01:13.700> 15<00:01:14.700> 20<00:01:15.090> minutes<00:01:15.330> you're<00:01:15.450> gonna

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
most purposes 15 20 minutes you're gonna

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.429 
most purposes 15 20 minutes you're gonna
want<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> float<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> bag<00:01:17.549> right<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.439> what

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
want to float that bag right there what

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.200 
want to float that bag right there what
will<00:01:19.590> happen<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.220> 15<00:01:20.580> 20<00:01:20.850> minutes<00:01:21.119> is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
will happen in that 15 20 minutes is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.670 
will happen in that 15 20 minutes is
this<00:01:21.390> temperature<00:01:21.689> inside<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> bag<00:01:22.439> we'll

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
this temperature inside the bag we'll

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
this temperature inside the bag we'll
get<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> same<00:01:23.159> temperature<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.150> water

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
get the same temperature as the water

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.320 
get the same temperature as the water
it's<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.170> into<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:26.220> after<00:01:26.580> about<00:01:26.670> 15<00:01:27.150> 20

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
it's going into now after about 15 20

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.640 
it's going into now after about 15 20
minutes<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.990> good<00:01:28.170> idea<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:29.840> take<00:01:30.840> some<00:01:31.200> of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
minutes it's a good idea to take some of

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.160 
minutes it's a good idea to take some of
your<00:01:31.770> water<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.479> into<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.020> just

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
your water that it's going into and just

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.800 
your water that it's going into and just
put<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> put<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.909> might<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.540> better<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
put it put it in I might be better to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.690 
put it put it in I might be better to
have<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.990> cup<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.650> I'm<00:01:38.040> gonna<00:01:38.220> use<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.490> hand

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
have a cup of I'm gonna use your hand

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.100 
have a cup of I'm gonna use your hand
like<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:39.030> doing<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.659> make<00:01:39.750> sure<00:01:39.990> your

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
like I'm doing here just make sure your

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.499 
like I'm doing here just make sure your
hands<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.439> clean<00:01:40.619> obviously<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.119> allows

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
hands are clean obviously so that allows

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
hands are clean obviously so that allows
the<00:01:43.229> fish<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.799> used<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> water<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the fish to get used to the water that

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.480 
the fish to get used to the water that
they're<00:01:44.850> actually<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.960> into

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
they're actually going to be going into

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
they're actually going to be going into
again<00:01:47.490> we're<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.729> doing<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.509> conservative

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
again we're just doing the conservative

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.679 
again we're just doing the conservative
thing<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.640> breaking<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
thing here and kind of breaking the the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.310 
thing here and kind of breaking the the
transition<00:01:52.680> down<00:01:52.829> into<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.250> pieces<00:01:53.579> here

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
transition down into little pieces here

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.670 
transition down into little pieces here
so<00:01:55.320> after<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:57.180> has<00:01:57.869> been<00:01:58.049> floating<00:01:58.469> about<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so after this has been floating about a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.410 
so after this has been floating about a
half<00:01:58.920> hour<00:01:59.159> very<00:01:59.460> important<00:02:00.030> point

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
half hour very important point

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.899 
half hour very important point
get<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> little<00:02:01.229> net<00:02:01.500> don't<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.490> dump<00:02:02.700> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
get a little net don't just dump the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.310 
get a little net don't just dump the
water<00:02:03.090> into<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> tank

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
water into the tank

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.109 
water into the tank
this<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.770> especially<00:02:05.070> crucial<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:05.969> you're

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
this is especially crucial if you're

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.779 
this is especially crucial if you're
just<00:02:06.390> starting<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.990> because<00:02:07.610> while<00:02:08.610> those

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
just starting out because while those

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.520 
just starting out because while those
fish<00:02:09.090> were<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.569> bag

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
fish were in that bag

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.510 
fish were in that bag
ammonia's<00:02:12.530> building<00:02:12.890> up<00:02:13.040> some<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.430> their

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
ammonia's building up some of their

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.940 
ammonia's building up some of their
slime<00:02:14.270> was<00:02:14.480> coming<00:02:14.840> off<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.320> that's<00:02:15.590> probably

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
slime was coming off so that's probably

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.430 
slime was coming off so that's probably
not<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.220> good<00:02:16.340> idea<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:17.600> just<00:02:17.810> dump<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.200> water

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
not a good idea to just dump the water

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.000 
not a good idea to just dump the water
and<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:18.860> what<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.160> really<00:02:19.640> recommend<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.270> just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
and so what we really recommend is just

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.550 
and so what we really recommend is just
getting<00:02:22.010> your<00:02:22.040> net<00:02:22.280> out<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:23.060> again<00:02:23.560> key

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
getting your net out and and again key

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.920 
getting your net out and and again key
conservative<00:02:25.400> just<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.300> then<00:02:26.420> I'm<00:02:26.570> in<00:02:26.720> there

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
conservative just and then I'm in there

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.660 
conservative just and then I'm in there
and<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.530> as<00:02:27.680> quickly<00:02:27.950> as<00:02:28.160> possible<00:02:28.220> just

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
and and as quickly as possible just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.590 
and and as quickly as possible just
right<00:02:29.090> into<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.540> water<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:30.050> like<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:31.600> it's

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
right into the water just like that it's

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.330 
right into the water just like that it's
okay<00:02:32.870> if<00:02:32.960> you<00:02:33.080> get<00:02:33.170> two<00:02:33.380> or<00:02:33.530> three<00:02:33.560> two<00:02:33.890> fishes

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
okay if you get two or three two fishes

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.880 
okay if you get two or three two fishes
in<00:02:34.460> that's<00:02:34.670> fine<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.090> course<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.740> there<00:02:36.740> we've

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
in that's fine of course and there we've

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.800 
in that's fine of course and there we've
got<00:02:36.920> some<00:02:37.160> happy<00:02:37.340> fishes<00:02:37.850> isn't<00:02:38.150> there<00:02:38.360> and

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
got some happy fishes isn't there and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.650 
got some happy fishes isn't there and
they're<00:02:39.770> going<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.040> quickly<00:02:40.630> acclimate<00:02:41.630> to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
they're going to quickly acclimate to

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.630 
they're going to quickly acclimate to
that<00:02:41.920> environment<00:02:42.920> there<00:02:43.070> that<00:02:43.250> you've<00:02:43.370> set

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
that environment there that you've set

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.520 
that environment there that you've set
up<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:44.720> there<00:02:44.960> we<00:02:45.110> go

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
up so there we go

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.280 
up so there we go
happy<00:02:45.890> fishes
