00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
of it but the timer will ring true so

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.550 
of it but the timer will ring true so
here<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.150> go<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.799> leave<00:03:03.799> any<00:03:03.950> time<00:03:05.319> so<00:03:06.319> take

here we go I leave any time so take

00:03:06.560 --> 00:05:35.000 
here we go I leave any time so take

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.050 

okay<00:05:36.570> that<00:05:37.570> was<00:05:37.810> four<00:05:38.560> minutes<00:05:38.890> and<00:05:39.060> 34

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
let's see it from the other point of

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.080 
let's see it from the other point of
view<00:06:07.450> over<00:06:07.690> here<00:06:11.310> as<00:06:12.310> I<00:06:12.550> could<00:06:12.700> have<00:06:12.790> centered

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
view over here as I could have centered

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.370 
view over here as I could have centered

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.980 
up the coffee table in front of the
couch<00:06:14.590> but<00:06:15.520> this<00:06:15.730> is<00:06:15.940> the<00:06:16.600> point<00:06:16.750> of<00:06:16.840> view<00:06:16.960> of

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
couch but this is the point of view of

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.690 
couch but this is the point of view of
the<00:06:17.080> front<00:06:17.230> door<00:06:17.380> so<00:06:17.830> if<00:06:17.920> guests<00:06:18.160> came<00:06:18.400> in<00:06:18.550> they
