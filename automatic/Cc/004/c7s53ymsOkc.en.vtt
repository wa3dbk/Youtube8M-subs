00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
detail and again very slim similar to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.150 
detail and again very slim similar to
movie<00:02:26.910> design<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:27.960> can't<00:02:28.410> really<00:02:28.470> fault<00:02:28.980> it

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
movie design so can't really fault it

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.210 
movie design so can't really fault it
okay<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.150> arms<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:31.750> don't<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.230> at<00:02:32.470> all<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
okay the arms I don't like at all the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
to get them out of the way not too bad

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.040 
to get them out of the way not too bad
the<00:02:36.880> arms<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.360> can<00:02:37.540> only<00:02:37.660> see<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.870> arms

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the arms you can only see the arms

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.840 
the arms you can only see the arms
because<00:02:38.350> they<00:02:38.470> are<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.920> back<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.430> I'll<00:02:39.670> go

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
because they are in the back and I'll go

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.450 
because they are in the back and I'll go
into<00:02:40.090> more<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.630> in<00:02:40.870> articulation<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.980> in

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
into more of that in articulation and in

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.800 
into more of that in articulation and in
your<00:02:42.670> arms<00:02:42.880> right<00:02:42.910> here<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.450> then<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.720> have

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
your arms right here and then you have

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.160 
your arms right here and then you have
to<00:02:43.900> gun<00:02:44.080> it's<00:02:45.010> not<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.580> Zen<00:02:46.300> wise<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.810> may<00:02:46.900> get

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
to gun it's not and Zen wise you may get

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.950 
to gun it's not and Zen wise you may get
some<00:02:47.440> sculpting<00:02:48.220> arm<00:02:48.610> hand<00:02:49.270> thing<00:02:49.570> going<00:02:49.840> here

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
some sculpting arm hand thing going here

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.960 
some sculpting arm hand thing going here
but<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:50.710> looks<00:02:51.070> messy<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.730> looks<00:02:51.880> like

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
but it just looks messy just looks like

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.180 
but it just looks messy just looks like
a<00:02:52.060> bunch<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.510> shapes<00:02:52.990> put<00:02:53.380> together<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.040> I'm

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
a bunch of shapes put together so I'm

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.890 
a bunch of shapes put together so I'm
not<00:02:54.340> really<00:02:54.400> digging<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.180> arms<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.660> much

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
not really digging the arms that much

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.660 
not really digging the arms that much
but<00:02:56.500> actually<00:02:56.860> I'm<00:02:56.920> not<00:02:57.010> digging<00:02:57.220> them<00:02:57.430> at<00:02:57.520> all

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
but actually I'm not digging them at all

and then we have the legs the legs
nicely<00:03:00.430> detailed<00:03:00.610> guts<00:03:01.450> them<00:03:01.630> again<00:03:02.080> there's

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500

let's<00:03:16.390> get<00:03:16.540> on<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.780> harness<00:03:17.260> first<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.740> all

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
let's get on to the harness first of all

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.000 
let's get on to the harness first of all
see<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.850> joint<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.810> ball<00:03:19.990> joint<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:20.590> way

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
see the the joint the ball joint is way

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.910 
see the the joint the ball joint is way
back<00:03:21.850> here<00:03:22.180> its<00:03:22.630> arms<00:03:22.930> should<00:03:23.050> be<00:03:23.110> like<00:03:23.380> here

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
back here its arms should be like here

but his arm is all the way back here
yeah<00:03:26.740> and<00:03:27.270> articulation<00:03:28.270> sensitive<00:03:28.780> object

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
yeah and articulation sensitive object

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.890 
yeah and articulation sensitive object
it's<00:03:29.380> got<00:03:29.710> this<00:03:29.920> weird<00:03:30.570> articulation<00:03:31.570> like<00:03:31.720> it

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
it's got this weird articulation like it

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.280 
it's got this weird articulation like it
goes<00:03:32.140> as<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.070> can<00:03:33.130> see<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:34.480> goes<00:03:34.780> from<00:03:35.050> this

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
goes as you can see it goes from this

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.980 
goes as you can see it goes from this
type<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.620> rotation<00:03:36.459> oh<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:37.420> can<00:03:37.600> bet<00:03:37.780> his

such a crazy way that it just bothers me
no<00:04:00.730> waste<00:04:01.020> articulation<00:04:02.020> legs<00:04:02.860> can<00:04:03.520> go

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
no waste articulation legs can go

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.729 
no waste articulation legs can go
forward<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.650> back<00:04:05.650> got<00:04:06.070> that<00:04:06.280> much<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:08.530> the

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
forward and back got that much on the

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.710 
forward and back got that much on the
ball<00:04:08.950> joint<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.310> can<00:04:09.520> bend<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.030> also<00:04:10.450> twist

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
ball joint you can bend and also twist

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.170 
ball joint you can bend and also twist
at<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.020> same<00:04:11.260> time<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.770> you<00:04:12.489> can<00:04:12.670> move<00:04:12.970> this

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
at the same time and you can move this

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.780 
at the same time and you can move this
as<00:04:13.390> well<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:14.470> transformation<00:04:14.860> but<00:04:15.190> that's<00:04:15.670> a

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
as well the transformation but that's a

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.180 
as well the transformation but that's a
jointed<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.330> overall<00:04:16.840> iron<00:04:17.620> right<00:04:17.919> here

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
jointed so overall iron right here

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.520 
jointed so overall iron right here

do like but the arms and the arms are my
biggest<00:04:26.290> problem<00:04:26.800> with<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.010> figure<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.580> don't

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
biggest problem with the figure I don't

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.520 
biggest problem with the figure I don't
like<00:04:28.120> where<00:04:28.300> their<00:04:28.419> position<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:29.020> don't<00:04:29.320> like

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
like where their position I don't like

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.770 
like where their position I don't like
the<00:04:29.890> articulation<00:04:30.610> on<00:04:30.760> them<00:04:30.940> I<00:04:31.150> don't<00:04:31.720> like

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
the articulation on them I don't like

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.220 
the articulation on them I don't like
these<00:04:32.020> big<00:04:32.230> panels<00:04:32.650> on<00:04:32.740> his<00:04:32.919> shoulders<00:04:33.250> I

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
these big panels on his shoulders I

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.500 
these big panels on his shoulders I
really<00:04:35.230> wish<00:04:35.470> he<00:04:36.190> had<00:04:36.370> head<00:04:36.610> articulation<00:04:37.270> I

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
really wish he had head articulation I

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.080 
really wish he had head articulation I
definitely<00:04:38.350> think<00:04:38.620> they<00:04:38.770> could've<00:04:39.039> been<00:04:39.310> some

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
definitely think they could've been some

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.210 
definitely think they could've been some
way<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.330> fit<00:04:40.840> at<00:04:41.080> least<00:04:41.590> the<00:04:41.890> next<00:04:42.190> will<00:04:42.400> so

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
way to fit at least the next will so

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.250 
way to fit at least the next will so
I'm<00:04:43.250> asked<00:04:43.580> he<00:04:44.090> looks<00:04:44.360> really<00:04:44.570> nice<00:04:44.840> there's

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.420 
I'm asked he looks really nice there's
something<00:04:45.530> wrong<00:04:45.740> with<00:04:45.920> the<00:04:46.010> way<00:04:46.130> he<00:04:46.250> looks

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
something wrong with the way he looks

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.670 
something wrong with the way he looks
it's<00:04:46.640> just<00:04:46.820> that<00:04:46.970> with<00:04:47.150> me<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.690> articulation

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
it's just that with me the articulation

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.010 
it's just that with me the articulation
could<00:04:49.610> have<00:04:49.700> been<00:04:49.790> better<00:04:49.940> it<00:04:50.750> definitely

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
could have been better it definitely

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.150

could<00:04:51.170> be<00:04:51.230> better<00:04:51.500> he's<00:04:51.680> definitely<00:04:51.830> not<00:04:52.070> a

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160
