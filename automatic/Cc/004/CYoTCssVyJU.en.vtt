00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
I'm Robert Lang I'm an origami artist I

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.329 
I'm Robert Lang I'm an origami artist I
do<00:00:03.030> many<00:00:03.330> different<00:00:03.419> types<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.170> origami<00:00:04.650> but

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
do many different types of origami but

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.000 
do many different types of origami but
one<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.640> my<00:00:05.790> specialties<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.720> insects<00:00:07.710> and

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
one of my specialties is insects and

one of my specialties is insects and
these<00:00:08.820> are<00:00:09.150> some<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:10.050> my<00:00:10.530> origami<00:00:11.040> insect

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
these are some of my origami insect

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
designs like most origami each of them

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.390

paper these are examples of we might

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.050 
paper these are examples of we might
call<00:00:21.330> state<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> art<00:00:22.080> origami<00:00:23.060> in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.600 
a few minutes to fold any one of these
pieces<00:00:29.970> would<00:00:30.929> take<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.320> couple<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.769> days<00:00:32.040> to

professor who's the world expert on this
type<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:29.800> beetle<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:30.460> he<00:01:30.580> asked<00:01:30.880> me<00:01:31.000> if<00:01:31.090> I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
type of beetle and he asked me if I

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.200 
type of beetle and he asked me if I
could<00:01:31.270> do<00:01:31.510> an<00:01:31.630> origami<00:01:31.990> version<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.910> this<00:01:33.910> is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
could do an origami version and this is

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.950 
could do an origami version and this is
the<00:01:34.780> origami<00:01:35.050> version<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.970> is<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.480> little<00:01:37.840> bit

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
the origami version it is a little bit

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.260 
the origami version it is a little bit
larger<00:01:38.440> than<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:39.400> real<00:01:39.580> thing<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:40.120> real

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
larger than the real thing the real

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.890 
larger than the real thing the real
thing<00:01:40.480> is<00:01:40.570> only<00:01:40.720> about<00:01:41.080> that<00:01:41.350> long<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:43.030> so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
thing is only about that long but so

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.060 
thing is only about that long but so
that<00:01:44.050> we<00:01:44.140> could<00:01:44.290> get<00:01:44.410> all<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.680> detail<00:01:45.040> I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
that we could get all the detail I

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.190 
that we could get all the detail I
folded<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.730> in<00:01:45.850> somewhat<00:01:46.660> larger<00:01:47.050> than

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
folded it in somewhat larger than

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.180 
folded it in somewhat larger than
life-size<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:49.230> then<00:01:50.230> this<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:52.620> a<00:01:53.620> brown

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
life-size and then this is a a brown

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.570 
life-size and then this is a a brown
widow<00:01:54.670> spider<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:56.110> real<00:01:56.290> thing<00:01:56.560> is<00:01:56.770> only

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
widow spider the real thing is only

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.510 
widow spider the real thing is only
about<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:58.000> long<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:59.260> there's<00:02:00.040> its

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
about that long and there's its

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.150 
about that long and there's its
underside
