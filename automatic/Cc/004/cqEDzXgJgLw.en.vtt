up against the MIT and incredibly
dangerous<00:01:41.520> select<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> question<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.409> will

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
dangerous select so the question is will

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.039 
dangerous select so the question is will
he<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.890> able<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.159> deal<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:45.060> select<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
