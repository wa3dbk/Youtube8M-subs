00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:50.559 
military time and then the dial down
here<00:03:49.819> it's<00:03:49.940> really<00:03:50.209> cool

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
here it's really cool

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.600 
here it's really cool
hey<00:03:50.690> actually<00:03:51.110> your<00:03:51.680> watch<00:03:51.890> is<00:03:52.129> actually<00:03:52.459> like

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
hey actually your watch is actually like

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.289 
hey actually your watch is actually like
a<00:03:52.640> timer<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:53.870> can<00:03:54.260> time<00:03:54.590> up<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:55.069> 30<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.879> think

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
a timer so it can time up to 30 I think

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.470 
a timer so it can time up to 30 I think
you<00:03:56.510> can<00:03:57.200> sign<00:03:57.409> up<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.819> 60<00:03:58.819> seconds<00:03:59.239> at<00:03:59.360> the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
you can sign up to 60 seconds at the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.210 
you can sign up to 60 seconds at the
bottom<00:03:59.780> so<00:03:59.959> one<00:04:00.170> rotation<00:04:00.650> at<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.829> bottom

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
bottom so one rotation at the bottom

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.979 
bottom so one rotation at the bottom
dial<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.500> one<00:04:03.500> minute<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:03.980> then<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.989> dial

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
dial is one minute and then the dial

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.160 
dial is one minute and then the dial
over<00:04:06.319> here<00:04:06.739> this<00:04:06.980> third<00:04:07.430> circle<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:08.359> marks

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
over here this third circle it marks

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.479 
over here this third circle it marks
every<00:04:09.560> single<00:04:09.920> time<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:11.049> second<00:04:12.049> hand<00:04:12.980> went

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
every single time the second hand went

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.610 
every single time the second hand went
around<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.480> it's<00:04:14.720> kind<00:04:14.930> of<00:04:14.959> like<00:04:15.079> timing<00:04:15.319> so

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
around so it's kind of like timing so

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.009 
around so it's kind of like timing so
this<00:04:15.859> one<00:04:16.130> times<00:04:16.519> seconds<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.299> then<00:04:17.660> this<00:04:17.840> on

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
this one times seconds and then this on

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.900 
this one times seconds and then this on
tracks<00:04:18.320> how<00:04:18.500> many<00:04:18.680> minutes<00:04:18.919> has<00:04:19.190> passed<00:04:19.489> based

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
tracks how many minutes has passed based

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.879 
tracks how many minutes has passed based
on<00:04:20.150> this<00:04:20.329> time<00:04:20.630> we're<00:04:20.780> down<00:04:20.900> here<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.410> to

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
on this time we're down here and to

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.680 
on this time we're down here and to
start<00:04:21.949> that<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.490> have<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.699> press<00:04:22.940> this<00:04:23.389> button

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
start that you have to press this button

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.810 
start that you have to press this button
right<00:04:23.840> here<00:04:24.050> so<00:04:25.000> let's<00:04:26.000> go<00:04:26.330> ahead<00:04:26.479> and<00:04:26.570> do<00:04:26.870> that

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.880 

start<00:04:33.490> and

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.210 

you<00:04:37.460> can<00:04:37.610> see<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.970> second<00:04:38.360> hand<00:04:38.540> has<00:04:38.720> started

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
you can see the second hand has started

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.060 
you can see the second hand has started
turn

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.850 

so<00:04:44.070> every<00:04:44.340> time<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.960> hand<00:04:46.200> inside<00:04:46.650> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
so every time that the hand inside the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.500 
so every time that the hand inside the
smaller<00:04:47.190> start<00:04:47.580> goes<00:04:47.730> a<00:04:47.910> lesson<00:04:48.300> at<00:04:48.420> the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
smaller start goes a lesson at the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.810 
smaller start goes a lesson at the
bottom<00:04:48.840> goes<00:04:49.350> around<00:04:49.560> once<00:04:49.920> as<00:04:50.160> one<00:04:50.370> minute<00:04:50.670> so

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
bottom goes around once as one minute so

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.630 
bottom goes around once as one minute so
this<00:04:51.000> one<00:04:51.270> will<00:04:51.450> tick<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:53.010> will<00:04:53.160> mark<00:04:53.400> one

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
this one will tick and it will mark one

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.060 
this one will tick and it will mark one
minute<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.240> can<00:04:54.390> do<00:04:54.570> up<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:55.530> can<00:04:55.710> record

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
minute and it can do up to it can record

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.770 
minute and it can do up to it can record
up<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.400> 30<00:04:56.640> minutes<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.210> then<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.480> will<00:04:57.630> just

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780
