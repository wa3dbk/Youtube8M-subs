00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.960
 Let's friends sports with Alex Cruz 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.030
 great goalkeeper of the striped team of 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.010
 monterrey how many thousands alex 92 92 15 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.570
 years 15 years what did you think in general 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.099
 this tournament for striped set of 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.039
 monterrey because he left us a great 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.140
 experience if it was complicated right now 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.289
 party the others because we were 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.390
 controlling the other parties but this 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.250
 well, we had to live part of the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.810
 tournament they do not lose the semifinal against the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.250
 pachuca team but you dominated 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.150
 almost almost in the general comparison more 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.639
 get to goal 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.130
 if this one unfortunately we could not 

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:37.500
 Finalize 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.410
 those those attacks 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.560
 this because the first thing they had 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.970
 was and we fell and want to know a little 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.620
 about the development that occurs in 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.360
 monterrey for example how was your step 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.739
 al monterrey how did you get and now 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.550
 you want to be a great goalkeeper sub title 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.580
 fifteen 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 I was 12 years old and he has 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.629
 maintained and it's a great institution let 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.580
 many teachings you especially the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.080
 doorman teachers for me the teacher 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.710
 raÃºl salas taught me a lot and then 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.920
 I've had great progress there, well 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.230
 it was not an easy team and it was always 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.090
 on top of us and well thank god 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.770
 to see what we wanted 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.380
 it is clear that pachuca when it is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.060
 exceeded expected very well and defends 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 with the whole organ we go to space not 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.330
 it's always there we are pressing not 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.610
 we give space as you work in pachuca 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.750
 that goes very well in sub-13 sub-15 second 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.100
 division has many good teams 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.200
 third division has very teams 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.720
 good the row of pachuca work hard 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.280
 only to work hard and finally 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.290
 age is to want or not to reach the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.240
 first division had already tried a 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.800
 shot in the semifinal that got you the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.090
 goalkeeper was a great goal practicing 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.780
 like how was that goal I want to pumped 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.860
 If this one 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.750
 as I've always wanted nor funk is 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.590
 Christian ronaldo and I've always wanted 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.960
 hit him like him and try and thanks to 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.820
 God is the goal is a great job 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.090
 that the young people have made 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.380
 tried and made a great effort 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.470
 They have committed themselves to a lot 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.569
 responsibility above all to maintain a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.450
 line that today the institution marks us 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.830
 for all of us including 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.720
 coaches that is looking to train 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.900
 young people with talent and above all 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.580
 finish with the processes reaching 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.709
 final and good today today our colleague 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.600
 another final and we hope to get a 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.400
 result a very successful line because 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.470
 we said third division is doing well in 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.950
 a division is doing well sub-13 sub-15 to 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.920
 all yes, fortunately I can 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.600
 comment that I had the tournament 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.880
 happened to be part of the technical staff of 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.269
 third edition he does in the second 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.830
 today we are working with young people 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.780
 we continue in these projects and good in 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.360
 the line of the institution with all the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.920
 equipment is training and the most 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.930
 you can reach the end is not easy 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.750
 It is very difficult 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.659
 teams that make up Mexican soccer 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.549
 in basic forces day by day there is 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.170
 working better young very 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.000
 interesting teams with a lot 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.269
 projection and good has not been 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.310
 simple and it really is a fight that 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.750
 is maintaining based on a lot 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.310
 work and dedication 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.829
 Well, together, I do not think it improves 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.329
 for all of us and we simply 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.430
 touched lose we keep the zero of the 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.829
 tournament and that's precisely why it leaves us 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.030
 out and well that's the way football is 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.560
 they have a great defense you are a very 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.180
 good side of the left have very 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.250
 good goalie will have to work a little 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.680
 more ahead the corner ahead 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.000
 yes I think that I think most of us have 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.669
 that all work not only the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.950
 front and good this to continue giving 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.450
 our twister back in Monterrey as 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.609
 that things will be given to all 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.469
 we very educated of you play 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.840
 with line of five always with the ball 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.129
 controlled always ball to the floor yes 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.069
 I think our team has always been 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.900
 based on the order always always 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.540
 keep trying to keep the zero and of 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.919
 there from there to look for the goal not of science 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.659
 all the people who came with you to 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.340
 support them what do you think the impulse of 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.659
 public, I think it was very good, 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.900
 I think it was a very important part 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.269
 for all of us I think 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.799
 if we feel support and good 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.989
 unfortunately, things did not happen 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.459
 the semifinal this sir the lord is the 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.069
 great tournament of basic forces category 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.579
 sub-15 in the international signal of for 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.579
 sports
