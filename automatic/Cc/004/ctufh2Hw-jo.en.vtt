00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.220
 the ghosts exist I always have them 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.630
 seen ghosts I had never imagined 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 I wrote about that 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.550
 they are quite good really seriously 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.500
 you'll see where I come from the ghosts 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.680
 they are taken lightly I understand your 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 fascination for the happy ones this is my 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.489
 sister but you must be careful I feel 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.300
 as if there was a link between your 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.300
 heart and mine 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.510
 how do you maintain this house is a 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.469
 privilege to have been born in it is not 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.469
 you can give it up 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.600
 I could have a copy of the keys there 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.229
 you need them there are areas of the house that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.229
 they are not safe 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.790
 in these rotten walls in the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.230
 darkness 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.230
 many secrets are hidden 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.260
 tomÃ¡s 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.070
 someone died in this house 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.070
 good sign 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.399
 he had a violent death in particular 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.020
 a rate as old as this with the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.020
 time comes alive 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.689
 start clinging to things 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.549
 some are good others are bad and there are 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.180
 others of which should not go back to 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.180
 talk to each other 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.080
 what happens what do you want
