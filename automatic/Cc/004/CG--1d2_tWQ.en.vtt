hello there today I'm going to show you

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.909 
hello there today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:04.080> I<00:00:04.190> lace<00:00:05.190> up<00:00:05.490> my<00:00:05.990> blue<00:00:06.990> taffeta<00:00:07.319> corset

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
how I lace up my blue taffeta corset

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.540 
how I lace up my blue taffeta corset
here<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.900> I'm<00:00:09.900> doing<00:00:10.410> an<00:00:10.620> experiment<00:00:11.040> I'm

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
here and I'm doing an experiment I'm

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.470 
here and I'm doing an experiment I'm
going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.420> show<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:13.219> how<00:00:14.219> hard<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.150> lace

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
going to show you how hard it is to lace

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.820 
going to show you how hard it is to lace
up<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.839> corset<00:00:16.199> because<00:00:16.470> it's<00:00:16.650> very

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
up this corset because it's very

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.960 
up this corset because it's very
slippery<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:18.330> also<00:00:19.670> harder<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> Lisa

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
slippery and it's also harder to Lisa

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.519 
slippery and it's also harder to Lisa
because<00:00:21.359> there's<00:00:21.600> not<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:21.900> few<00:00:22.109> grommets

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
because there's not as few grommets

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.830 
because there's not as few grommets
which<00:00:22.740> means<00:00:23.279> less<00:00:23.640> friction<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.420> hold<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
which means less friction to hold the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.560 
which means less friction to hold the
laces<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.680> place<00:00:25.859> while<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.189> clean<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.910> then

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
laces in place while I clean up and then

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.080 
laces in place while I clean up and then
I'm<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.230> show<00:00:28.740> how<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> lace<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.929> a

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
I'm going to show how I lace up with a

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.930 
I'm going to show how I lace up with a
different<00:00:33.090> technique<00:00:33.210> from<00:00:34.340> honey<00:00:35.340> roses

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
different technique from honey roses

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.850 
different technique from honey roses
videos<00:00:36.300> or<00:00:36.660> she's<00:00:36.989> also<00:00:37.140> known<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:37.530> trolls

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
videos or she's also known as trolls

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.569 
videos or she's also known as trolls
neat<00:00:38.309> hug<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.050> it's<00:00:40.050> where<00:00:40.230> she<00:00:40.410> takes<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
neat hug and it's where she takes the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.430 
neat hug and it's where she takes the
bottom<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> laces<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:44.570> ties<00:00:45.570> them<00:00:45.989> like

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
bottom of the laces and ties them like

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.350 
bottom of the laces and ties them like
across<00:00:46.829> each<00:00:47.070> other<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.610> they<00:00:47.730> cross<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
across each other so they cross and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.940 
across each other so they cross and
therefore<00:00:48.750> holds<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> course<00:00:49.440> template<00:00:49.739> so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
therefore holds the course template so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.310 
therefore holds the course template so
I'll<00:00:50.430> laced<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.059> regular<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.020> then

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
I'll laced up the regular way and then

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.139 
I'll laced up the regular way and then
I'll<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.160> happens<00:00:53.489> when<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.760> laced<00:00:53.940> up

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
I'll see what happens when I laced up

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:11.220 
I'll see what happens when I laced up
her<00:00:54.360> away<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.050> hopefully<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.559> better

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.760 

you

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:40.660 
you
you

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.399 

there<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.880> go

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
there we go

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.590 
there we go
so<00:01:43.520> while<00:01:44.520> slicing<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.539> if

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
so while slicing it up I don't know if

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.349 
so while slicing it up I don't know if
you<00:01:45.750> could<00:01:45.869> tell<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.000> top<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> lace

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
you could tell but the top of the lace

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.870 
you could tell but the top of the lace
is<00:01:48.539> kept<00:01:48.719> slipping<00:01:48.929> and<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.460> only<00:01:50.640> way<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.819> can

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
is kept slipping and the only way I can

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.149 
is kept slipping and the only way I can
keep<00:01:51.270> them<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.630> slipping<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.560> hold<00:01:52.920> them

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
keep them from slipping was to hold them

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.819 
keep them from slipping was to hold them
in<00:01:53.280> front<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.000> pull<00:01:54.929> on<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> same

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
in front and pull on them at the same

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.580 
in front and pull on them at the same
time<00:01:56.159> while<00:01:56.640> not<00:01:57.020> letting<00:01:58.020> them<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.319> an<00:01:58.439> edge

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
time while not letting them get an edge

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.340 
time while not letting them get an edge
so<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.789> really<00:02:00.090> hard<00:02:00.359> to<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.689> so

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
so it's really hard to do that so

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.109 
so it's really hard to do that so
sometimes<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.069> don't<00:02:02.219> wear<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.640> course<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.030> is

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
sometimes I don't wear this course it is

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.690 
sometimes I don't wear this course it is
often<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.539> because<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.869> frustrating<00:02:04.700> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
often just because it's frustrating so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.809 
often just because it's frustrating so
now<00:02:06.119> I'm<00:02:06.209> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> take<00:02:06.569> it<00:02:06.659> off<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.819> release

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
now I'm going to take it off and release

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.360 
now I'm going to take it off and release
it<00:02:09.090> show<00:02:09.329> you<00:02:09.390> how<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> was<00:02:09.929> released<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.649> see

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
it show you how it was released and see

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.110 
it show you how it was released and see
what<00:02:11.519> happens

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
what happens

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.259 
what happens
all<00:02:12.780> right<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.650> took<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:14.220> laces<00:02:14.790> untied

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
all right so I took the laces untied

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.870 
all right so I took the laces untied
them<00:02:15.900> at<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.110> bottom<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.709> crisscross<00:02:17.400> them

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
them at the bottom and crisscross them

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.080 
them at the bottom and crisscross them
so<00:02:18.329> I<00:02:18.660> tied<00:02:19.500> one<00:02:19.829> to<00:02:19.860> one<00:02:20.099> side<00:02:20.579> and<00:02:20.849> tie<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
so I tied one to one side and tie the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.640 
so I tied one to one side and tie the
other<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.599> other<00:02:21.780> side<00:02:22.049> and<00:02:22.230> let's<00:02:22.410> just

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
other to the other side and let's just

00:02:22.650 --> 00:03:15.920 
other to the other side and let's just
see<00:02:22.860> how<00:02:23.069> this<00:02:23.310> works

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.640 

all<00:03:16.930> right<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.950> as<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.910> could<00:03:19.180> see<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:20.170> did<00:03:20.410> not

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
all right so as you could see it did not

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.280 
all right so as you could see it did not
work<00:03:21.010> very<00:03:21.100> well<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:24.330> think<00:03:25.330> it<00:03:25.630> might<00:03:25.810> work<00:03:25.990> if

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
work very well I think it might work if

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.530 
work very well I think it might work if
it<00:03:26.470> were<00:03:26.650> just<00:03:27.100> slipping<00:03:27.520> on<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.700> bottom<00:03:28.210> but

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
it were just slipping on the bottom but

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.890 
it were just slipping on the bottom but
my<00:03:28.720> problem<00:03:29.170> is<00:03:29.260> just<00:03:29.650> looking<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.580> top<00:03:30.900> so

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
my problem is just looking on the top so

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.070 
my problem is just looking on the top so
it<00:03:32.320> kept<00:03:32.560> doing<00:03:32.710> the<00:03:32.860> same<00:03:33.040> thing<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:34.120> tried

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
it kept doing the same thing so I tried

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.960 
it kept doing the same thing so I tried
to<00:03:35.110> lace<00:03:35.890> up<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:36.160> same<00:03:36.340> way<00:03:36.490> I<00:03:36.520> already<00:03:36.670> did

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
to lace up the same way I already did

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.110 
to lace up the same way I already did
one<00:03:37.350> thing<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.500> might<00:03:38.680> help<00:03:39.190> though<00:03:39.520> with<00:03:39.820> is

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
one thing that might help though with is

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.410 
one thing that might help though with is
if<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.930> always<00:03:41.290> get<00:03:41.680> those<00:03:41.830> uneven<00:03:42.130> laces<00:03:43.030> at

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
if you always get those uneven laces at

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.290 
if you always get those uneven laces at
the<00:03:43.750> end<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.980> it'll<00:03:45.310> help<00:03:45.640> keep<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:48.030> laces<00:03:49.030> on

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
the end so it'll help keep the laces on

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.300 
the end so it'll help keep the laces on
the<00:03:49.450> bottom<00:03:49.750> from<00:03:49.930> sliding<00:03:50.530> from<00:03:50.710> one<00:03:50.920> side<00:03:51.160> to

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
the bottom from sliding from one side to

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.490 
the bottom from sliding from one side to
the<00:03:51.370> other<00:03:51.810> socially<00:03:52.810> if<00:03:52.900> you're<00:03:53.020> not<00:03:53.170> closed

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
the other socially if you're not closed

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.990 
the other socially if you're not closed
all<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.920> way<00:03:54.040> then<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.520> makes<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.790> bigger

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
all the way then it makes a bigger

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.260 
all the way then it makes a bigger
difference<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:59.220> places<00:04:00.220> are<00:04:00.370> pretty<00:04:00.550> even<00:04:01.120> now

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
difference so places are pretty even now

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.760 
difference so places are pretty even now
and<00:04:03.240> it<00:04:04.240> might<00:04:04.510> help<00:04:04.660> for<00:04:04.930> some<00:04:05.110> people<00:04:05.470> but

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
and it might help for some people but

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.260 
and it might help for some people but
it's<00:04:05.950> not<00:04:06.010> gonna<00:04:06.220> help<00:04:06.370> for<00:04:06.610> this<00:04:06.700> corset<00:04:07.150> the

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
it's not gonna help for this corset the

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.970 
it's not gonna help for this corset the
best<00:04:07.540> thing<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.840> could<00:04:08.050> have<00:04:08.080> done<00:04:08.320> for<00:04:08.590> this

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
best thing I could have done for this

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.740 
best thing I could have done for this
course<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.400> was<00:04:09.520> to<00:04:09.640> give<00:04:09.820> it<00:04:09.940> more<00:04:10.120> grommets

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
course it was to give it more grommets

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.100 
course it was to give it more grommets
therefore<00:04:11.350> more<00:04:11.560> friction<00:04:12.070> or<00:04:12.600> use<00:04:13.600> different

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
therefore more friction or use different

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.979 
therefore more friction or use different
material<00:04:16.769> make<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.920> corset<00:04:18.280> so<00:04:18.700> that<00:04:19.630> was<00:04:19.810> the

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
material make the corset so that was the

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.230 
material make the corset so that was the
experiment<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:20.920> if<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.670> guys<00:04:21.790> have<00:04:22.030> had<00:04:22.180> a

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
experiment and if you guys have had a

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.000 
experiment and if you guys have had a
different<00:04:22.600> result<00:04:22.690> when<00:04:23.140> if<00:04:23.440> you've<00:04:23.710> tried

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
different result when if you've tried

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.010 
different result when if you've tried
this<00:04:24.220> technique<00:04:24.610> before<00:04:24.760> let<00:04:25.660> me<00:04:25.750> know<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:25.990> the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
this technique before let me know in the

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.480 
this technique before let me know in the
comments<00:04:26.410> below<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:27.130> thanks<00:04:27.940> for<00:04:28.060> watching
