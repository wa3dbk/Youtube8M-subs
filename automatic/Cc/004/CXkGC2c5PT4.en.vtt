for the heat you have to be a little
careful<00:04:19.639> let's<00:04:20.639> take<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.850> look<00:04:21.060> one<00:04:21.479> more<00:04:21.540> time

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
careful let's take a look one more time

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.170 
careful let's take a look one more time
back<00:04:22.169> at<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.620> flashing<00:04:23.220> lights<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.729> that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
back at the flashing lights and that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.670 
back at the flashing lights and that
other<00:04:24.389> part<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> control<00:04:25.169> panel<00:04:25.440> just<00:04:25.590> a

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
other part of the control panel just a

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.520 
other part of the control panel just a
second<00:04:26.180> okay<00:04:27.180> here<00:04:27.660> there<00:04:27.990> are<00:04:28.139> a<00:04:28.200> number<00:04:28.260> of

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
second okay here there are a number of

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.090 
second okay here there are a number of
spots<00:04:29.400> on<00:04:29.729> the<00:04:30.380> in<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.530> picture<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:31.830> you

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
spots on the in the picture that you

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.020 
spots on the in the picture that you
should<00:04:32.340> be<00:04:32.460> able<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:33.889> read<00:04:34.889> some<00:04:35.250> of<00:04:35.280> okay<00:04:35.970> so

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
should be able to read some of okay so

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.650 
should be able to read some of okay so
the<00:04:37.190> top<00:04:38.190> light<00:04:38.430> that's<00:04:38.669> not<00:04:38.820> on<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.210> energy

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
the top light that's not on is energy

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.840 
the top light that's not on is energy
saver<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:40.200> they<00:04:40.320> can<00:04:40.560> take<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.889> little<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.310> little

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
saver so they can take a little a little

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.500 
saver so they can take a little a little
less<00:04:42.000> electricity<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.850> weather<00:04:45.270> the

is the power switch the button to the

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.740 
is the power switch the button to the
left<00:05:02.370> I'll<00:05:02.580> try<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:02.820> throw<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.210> circle<00:05:03.660> around

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
left I'll try to throw a circle around

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.260

it<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.789> says<00:05:05.990> no<00:05:06.990> zero<00:05:07.229> so<00:05:07.530> G<00:05:07.770> which<00:05:08.550> means<00:05:08.820> the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
it is says no zero so G which means the

it is says no zero so G which means the
nozzle<00:05:09.660> cleaner<00:05:09.900> so<00:05:10.430> it's<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:11.669> self-cleaning

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
nozzle cleaner so it's a self-cleaning

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.570 
nozzle cleaner so it's a self-cleaning
system<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.870> make<00:05:13.139> sure<00:05:13.289> that<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.680> nozzles<00:05:14.220> get
