00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.950 
here is the foundation I got it in the
shape<00:01:26.159> 2.0<00:01:26.850> which<00:01:27.030> i<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> second

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
shape 2.0 which i think is the second

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.810 
shape 2.0 which i think is the second
lightest<00:01:28.229> color<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.189> really<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.700> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
lightest color and I really like that it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.160 
lightest color and I really like that it
has<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> pump<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> seems<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
has a pump and it seems like it's a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.050 
has a pump and it seems like it's a
pretty<00:01:31.320> good<00:01:31.470> size<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.340> 1<00:01:32.670> fluid<00:01:32.909> ounce

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
pretty good size it is 1 fluid ounce

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.910 
pretty good size it is 1 fluid ounce
though<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> guess<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.380> packaging

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
though so I guess it's just a packaging

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.679 
though so I guess it's just a packaging
that's<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.850> deceiving<00:01:36.150> cuz<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.570> like

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
that's kind of deceiving cuz it's like

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.120 
that's kind of deceiving cuz it's like
the<00:01:36.869> same<00:01:37.049> amount<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.650> normal<00:01:37.979> foundation

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the same amount as a normal foundation

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.429 
the same amount as a normal foundation
right<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> pretty<00:01:39.240> thin<00:01:39.540> liquid<00:01:39.960> it's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
right so it's a pretty thin liquid it's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.499 
right so it's a pretty thin liquid it's
kind<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.950> runny<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.400> my<00:01:41.759> hand<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.090> doesn't<00:01:42.329> seem

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
kind of runny on my hand it doesn't seem

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.280 
kind of runny on my hand it doesn't seem
too<00:01:42.720> thick<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> little<00:01:45.509> bit<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:45.960> does

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
too thick so a little bit of this does

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.010 
too thick so a little bit of this does
go<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> pretty<00:01:46.890> long<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.729> use<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.630> pump

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
go a pretty long way I use like one pump

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.719 
go a pretty long way I use like one pump
which<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> pea-sized<00:01:49.979> amount<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
which is like a pea-sized amount and I

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
which is like a pea-sized amount and I
was<00:01:50.850> able<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.180> cover<00:01:51.390> my<00:01:51.600> full<00:01:52.020> face<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.470> like

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
was able to cover my full face with like

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.069 
was able to cover my full face with like
a<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:52.950> light<00:01:53.340> layer<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.670> coverage<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.600> feel

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
a really light layer of coverage I feel

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.109 
a really light layer of coverage I feel
like<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.380> camera<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.040> looks<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.549> lot<00:01:56.880> more

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
like on camera it looks a lot more

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.300 
like on camera it looks a lot more
covered<00:01:57.719> than<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:57.990> does<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.350> real<00:01:58.619> life<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
covered than it does in real life like I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
covered than it does in real life like I
can<00:01:59.790> still<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.240> all<00:02:00.270> my<00:02:00.540> blemishes<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.469> lot

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
can still see all my blemishes and a lot

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.590 
can still see all my blemishes and a lot
of<00:02:01.740> redness<00:02:01.950> coming<00:02:02.520> through<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> did<00:02:03.570> just

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
of redness coming through but I did just

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.109 
of redness coming through but I did just
put<00:02:03.930> like<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.380> tiniest<00:02:04.770> amount<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.490> I'm<00:02:05.939> gonna

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
put like the tiniest amount so I'm gonna

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.070 
put like the tiniest amount so I'm gonna
go<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.479> another<00:02:06.630> way

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
go in with another way

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.800 
go in with another way
and<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.530> see<00:02:07.740> how<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.610> coverage<00:02:08.850> is<00:02:09.210> then<00:02:09.509> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and then see how the coverage is then I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.510 
and then see how the coverage is then I
just<00:02:10.110> realized<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.650> says<00:02:10.800> shake<00:02:11.280> well<00:02:11.490> before

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
just realized it says shake well before

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.760 
just realized it says shake well before
using<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> back<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.020> did<00:02:13.200> not<00:02:13.350> shake<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
using on the back and I did not shake it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.950 
using on the back and I did not shake it
so<00:02:14.490> I'm<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.000> shake<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.180> now<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:15.870> if

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
so I'm going to shake it now and see if

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.870 
so I'm going to shake it now and see if
that<00:02:16.110> changes<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> consistency<00:02:17.310> at<00:02:17.430> all<00:02:17.610> I

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
that changes the consistency at all I

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.340 
that changes the consistency at all I
feel<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.720> did<00:02:18.840> make<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.170> little

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
feel like it did make it a little

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.920 
feel like it did make it a little
thicker<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:21.030> gonna<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.600> second

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
thicker so I'm gonna do the second

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.730 
thicker so I'm gonna do the second
letter<00:02:22.080> with<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:24.530> feel<00:02:25.530> like<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
letter with that I feel like the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.770 
letter with that I feel like the
coverage<00:02:26.100> does<00:02:26.460> get<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> little<00:02:26.820> thicker<00:02:27.240> when

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
coverage does get a little thicker when

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.690 
coverage does get a little thicker when
you<00:02:28.110> shake<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.800> do<00:02:28.950> make<00:02:29.130> sure<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.580> you

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
you shake it so do make sure that you

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.670 
you shake it so do make sure that you
shake<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.270> like<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.660> says<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.200> back<00:02:31.320> but

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
shake it's like it says on the back but

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.080 
shake it's like it says on the back but
for<00:02:31.950> some<00:02:32.100> reason<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.580> don't<00:02:32.760> like<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:32.970> read

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
for some reason I don't like to read

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.610 
for some reason I don't like to read
directions<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:33.840> kind<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.380> figure

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
directions I just kind of like to figure

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.640 
directions I just kind of like to figure
things<00:02:34.830> out<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.070> my<00:02:35.310> own<00:02:35.460> okay<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:37.080> feel<00:02:37.500> like

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
things out on my own okay so I feel like

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.890 
things out on my own okay so I feel like
I<00:02:37.740> look<00:02:37.920> so<00:02:38.610> white<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.300> viewfinder<00:02:39.480> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
I look so white in the viewfinder and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.750 
I look so white in the viewfinder and
then<00:02:40.140> in<00:02:40.260> real<00:02:40.470> life<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.040> see<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> lot<00:02:41.610> of

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
then in real life you can see a lot of

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.790 
then in real life you can see a lot of
my<00:02:41.880> redness<00:02:42.270> coming<00:02:42.600> through<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.020> don't<00:02:43.680> know

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
my redness coming through I don't know

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.960 
my redness coming through I don't know
if<00:02:43.920> maybe<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.430> like<00:02:44.550> one<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.790> those

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
if maybe this is like one of those

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.699 
if maybe this is like one of those
foundations<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.720> gives<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.080> white<00:02:46.380> cast

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
foundations that gives you a white cast

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.010 
foundations that gives you a white cast
on<00:02:47.040> flash<00:02:47.670> photography<00:02:47.880> because<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.630> feel<00:02:48.990> like

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
on flash photography because I feel like

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.770 
on flash photography because I feel like
I<00:02:49.230> look<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:50.250> white<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.850> looks<00:02:50.910> scary<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:51.660> in

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
I look so white it looks scary but in

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.270 
I look so white it looks scary but in
real<00:02:51.959> life<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.350> does<00:02:52.500> not<00:02:52.740> look<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:52.950> way<00:02:53.250> I

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
real life it does not look that way I

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.699 
real life it does not look that way I
promise<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.540> doesn't<00:02:54.780> pretty<00:02:55.140> even<00:02:55.530> and

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
promise you it doesn't pretty even and

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.280 
promise you it doesn't pretty even and
well<00:02:56.310> covered<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:57.030> knew<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.630> wasn't<00:02:57.870> gonna<00:02:58.110> be

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
well covered I knew this wasn't gonna be

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.170 
well covered I knew this wasn't gonna be
like<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.590> full<00:02:58.800> coverage<00:02:59.010> foundation<00:02:59.220> it's

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
like a full coverage foundation it's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.150 
like a full coverage foundation it's
kind<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.450> one<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.630> those<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:01.050> your<00:03:01.470> skin<00:03:01.800> but

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
kind of one of those like your skin but

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
the best foundation looks a lot better

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.530 
the best foundation looks a lot better
with<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.130> full<00:03:35.370> face<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.580> makeup<00:03:35.730> obviously

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
with a full face of makeup obviously

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.240 
with a full face of makeup obviously
because<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.110> had<00:03:37.230> some<00:03:37.440> more<00:03:37.560> color<00:03:37.830> back<00:03:38.070> into

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
because it had some more color back into

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.880 
because it had some more color back into
my<00:03:38.430> face<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.790> don't<00:03:39.030> look<00:03:39.150> as<00:03:39.330> ghostly<00:03:40.050> um<00:03:40.590> I

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
so I'm kind of used to those being

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.680 
so I'm kind of used to those being
minimized<00:03:56.519> but<00:03:57.030> other<00:03:57.180> than<00:03:57.360> that<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.570> really

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
minimized but other than that I really

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.840

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:33.110 
I was hoping because it is so
lightweight<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:32.070> it<00:05:32.190> wouldn't<00:05:32.550> really<00:05:32.729> move

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
lightweight that it wouldn't really move

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.290 
lightweight that it wouldn't really move
and<00:05:33.599> it<00:05:33.930> does<00:05:34.110> like<00:05:34.440> it<00:05:34.610> totally<00:05:35.610> came<00:05:35.880> off<00:05:36.090> in

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
oily I don't know I was like so excited

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.390 
oily I don't know I was like so excited
to<00:06:31.990> try<00:06:32.260> this<00:06:32.320> but<00:06:32.710> I<00:06:32.770> think<00:06:32.860> if<00:06:33.130> you<00:06:33.220> have

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
to try this but I think if you have

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.940 
to try this but I think if you have
normal<00:06:33.730> skin<00:06:34.150> that<00:06:34.870> this<00:06:35.110> would<00:06:35.410> be<00:06:35.620> a<00:06:35.650> good

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
normal skin that this would be a good

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.100 
normal skin that this would be a good
foundation<00:06:36.100> for<00:06:36.700> you<00:06:36.760> but<00:06:37.030> for<00:06:37.600> me<00:06:37.750> with<00:06:37.930> my

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
foundation for you but for me with my

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.200 
foundation for you but for me with my
really<00:06:38.320> oily<00:06:38.590> skin<00:06:39.160> this<00:06:39.310> just<00:06:39.640> didn't<00:06:40.060> do

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
really oily skin this just didn't do

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.730 
really oily skin this just didn't do
anything<00:06:40.510> for<00:06:40.840> me<00:06:40.990> and<00:06:41.170> I'm<00:06:41.320> really<00:06:41.350> bummed

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
anything for me and I'm really bummed

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.080 
anything for me and I'm really bummed
because<00:06:41.890> I<00:06:42.130> really<00:06:42.400> wanted<00:06:42.670> something<00:06:42.910> that

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090
