00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.720
 hello parties good days or evenings 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.759
 nights then I bring you a 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.490
 program for which they were 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.500
 asking a lot and is the one that helps us 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.200
 to customize the bar clock 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.559
 tasks exactly the one that is 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.540
 in the part of here then they will go to 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.270
 link that I leave in the description of 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.329
 video and will proceed to download the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.670
 file that is there after the 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.300
 download give right click on it and what 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.700
 unzip and in the extracted folder 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.329
 you will find that crack for 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.340
 64 - bit operating systems equally 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.220
 way the crack for systems 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.550
 32-bit operations also the 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.700
 installer and the serial now start the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.070
 installer if you have windows 7 run 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.340
 what as administrator 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.950
 here you choose the language and accept 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.100
 then you give in next you accept the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.380
 license agreement and following 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.920
 again in next following of 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.929
 new next and finally install 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.319
 here we uncheck this option so that 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:28.079
 start the program and finish now 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:33.100
 according to your operating system 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:37.539
 apply us the crack whether it's 64 or 32 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.759
 bits in my case is 64 bits so in 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.130
 the respective folder what we will do 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.489
 file that is there and we 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.110
 we go to team to the local disk of 

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:50.140
 program files and folder 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.450
 atomic alarm cloud and here inside 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.110
 we paste the copied file and we go in 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.500
 copy and replace 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.110
 we closed this 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.390
 and double- clicking on the shortcut 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.480
 who left us on the desk we proceed 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.160
 to open the program immediately we can 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.550
 notice that the clock has changed 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.770
 aspect now we click on the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.620
 hour shown and we will open the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.620
 panel of the program then we're going to 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.740
 where it says about and how they see the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.959
 program has already been registered but 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.209
 in case it is not like that and ask them 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.520
 some serial or registry key to 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.680
 moment to start the program or even 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.290
 being here in this part then 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.440
 must enter the serial or password 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.989
 that can actually be anybody 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.750
 that in the folder they got is a 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.610
 example of the serial that can put of 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.470
 so that the only thing they should do 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.950
 is to copy it and enter it where they are 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.140
 request either here in this part of 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.020
 about him or when to start the 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.590
 program and give in accept and ready now 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.200
 everything would be perfect now yes yes we are going 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.640
 to topics we will find a great variety 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.010
 of skins 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.790
 we can use them to modify the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.010
 Appearance of our time date and others 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.110
 with just a click on the one that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.350
 we like it will instantly change the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.480
 visualization likewise we can 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.330
 try just to see how they look 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.080
 although all are very striking as it 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.080
 give account 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.730
 I could go on but many hahahaha to 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.030
 my taste and how is my desk 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.580
 I will leave this one that fits very well now 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.880
 the program also offers the option in 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.190
 where we can program some alarms 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.950
 thing that we will not see xd like we can 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.290
 customize some other things well 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.780
 be our taste but for what in 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.820
 We really want this is why the issues 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.490
 which is what will help us see more 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.650
 customized our desktop and how 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.900
 I told them to modify any of the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.780
 options that show how we 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.840
 it seems that it looks good and said everything 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.150
