00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
Microsoft model shop this is where

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.560 
Microsoft model shop this is where
Microsoft's<00:00:13.920> actual<00:00:14.309> products<00:00:14.790> are<00:00:14.940> designed

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
Microsoft's actual products are designed

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.810 
Microsoft's actual products are designed
and<00:00:16.020> built<00:00:16.230> we're<00:00:17.010> talking<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.369> Carson<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
and built we're talking to Carson a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.240 
and built we're talking to Carson a
guard<00:00:18.060> you're<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> model<00:00:18.630> maker<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.740> you

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
guard you're a model maker here and you

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.400 
guard you're a model maker here and you
guys<00:00:20.430> basically<00:00:20.789> build<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.270> stuff<00:00:21.510> from

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
guys basically build this stuff from

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.529 
guys basically build this stuff from
scratch<00:00:22.680> with<00:00:23.400> your<00:00:23.430> bare<00:00:23.640> hands<00:00:24.090> sometimes

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
scratch with your bare hands sometimes

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.779 
scratch with your bare hands sometimes
sometimes<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.289> 3d<00:00:25.560> printers<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.640> go

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
sometimes with 3d printers and you go

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.640 
sometimes with 3d printers and you go
from<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:27.119> prototype<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.170> prototype<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
from just prototype to prototype to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.479 
from just prototype to prototype to
prototype<00:00:28.890> into<00:00:29.250> an<00:00:29.340> actual<00:00:29.670> product<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> this

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
prototype into an actual product so this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.700 
prototype into an actual product so this
is<00:00:35.610> where<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> actual<00:00:36.090> printing<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.140> we

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
is where the actual printing so we

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.639 
is where the actual printing so we
basically<00:00:37.950> try<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.809> build<00:00:39.809> prototypes<00:00:40.410> in

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
basically try to build prototypes in

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.319 
basically try to build prototypes in
real<00:00:40.890> time<00:00:41.129> when<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:41.670> want<00:00:41.940> it

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
real time when they want it

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.139 
real time when they want it
5<00:00:43.020> o'clock<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:43.620> dump<00:00:43.860> their<00:00:44.040> files<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:45.000> get

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
5 o'clock they dump their files we get

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.910 
5 o'clock they dump their files we get
it<00:00:45.270> running<00:00:45.450> 8:00<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.289> morning<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.739> come

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
it running 8:00 in the morning they come

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.799 
it running 8:00 in the morning they come
in<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.550> ready<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.390> got<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
in it's ready to go we just got this a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.810 
in it's ready to go we just got this a
couple<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> weeks<00:00:49.410> ago<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.700> that

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
couple of weeks ago this is the one that

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.360 
couple of weeks ago this is the one that
prints<00:00:51.210> multi<00:00:51.539> materials<00:00:52.079> there's<00:00:52.680> four

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
prints multi materials there's four

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.689 
prints multi materials there's four
print<00:00:54.360> heads<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.899> each<00:00:55.140> print<00:00:55.530> head<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:55.949> can

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
print heads and each print head will can

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.639 
print heads and each print head will can
be<00:00:56.820> dedicated<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.510> two<00:00:57.840> different<00:00:58.020> materials

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
be dedicated to two different materials

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.700 
be dedicated to two different materials
and<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:59.430> will<00:00:59.609> mix<00:00:59.820> pilot<00:01:00.390> color<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.109> have

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and they will mix pilot color you have

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.650 
and they will mix pilot color you have
RGB<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.309> you'll<00:01:02.460> mix<00:01:02.670> different<00:01:02.789> colors<00:01:03.000> what

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
RGB and you'll mix different colors what

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.729 
RGB and you'll mix different colors what
is<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> material<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.350> put<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.589> here

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
is the material that you put in here

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.130 
is the material that you put in here
what<00:01:04.890> does<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> look<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.939> UV<00:01:06.299> cured

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
what does it look it's a it's a UV cured

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.440 
what does it look it's a it's a UV cured
epoxy<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.610> actually<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.939> liquid

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.179 

this<00:01:14.450> is<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.600> 3d<00:01:14.960> printed<00:01:15.290> wrench<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.830> you

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
this is a 3d printed wrench that you

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.010 
this is a 3d printed wrench that you
printed<00:01:16.700> in<00:01:16.820> one<00:01:16.970> piece<00:01:17.210> yes<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:17.659> that<00:01:17.810> shows

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
printed in one piece yes so that shows

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.050 
printed in one piece yes so that shows
the<00:01:18.170> ability<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.619> be<00:01:18.950> able<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.220> print<00:01:19.640> multiple

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
the ability to be able to print multiple

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.960 
the ability to be able to print multiple
parts<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.350> together<00:01:21.560> as<00:01:21.950> an<00:01:22.100> assembly<00:01:22.640> right

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
parts and together as an assembly right

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.999 
parts and together as an assembly right
that's<00:01:23.420> incredible<00:01:23.899> this<00:01:24.020> chain<00:01:24.380> was<00:01:24.649> also

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
that's incredible this chain was also

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.180 
that's incredible this chain was also
dying<00:01:25.280> also<00:01:25.790> as<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.509> single<00:01:26.930> it's<00:01:27.289> it's<00:01:27.649> able<00:01:27.890> to

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
dying also as a single it's it's able to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.880 
dying also as a single it's it's able to
support<00:01:28.729> basically<00:01:29.509> suspend<00:01:30.140> parts<00:01:30.470> in<00:01:30.590> space

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
support basically suspend parts in space

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.910 
support basically suspend parts in space
the<00:01:31.640> support<00:01:31.970> material<00:01:32.450> traps<00:01:33.289> it<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.649> holds

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
the support material traps it and holds

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.679 
the support material traps it and holds
it<00:01:34.039> when<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:34.340> remove<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> support<00:01:35.210> material

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
it when you remove the support material

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:36.760 
it when you remove the support material
they're<00:01:36.049> free-floating

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
they're free-floating

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.070 
they're free-floating
so<00:01:37.250> this<00:01:37.700> was<00:01:37.909> this<00:01:38.060> was<00:01:38.210> printed<00:01:38.600> not<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:38.930> one

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
so this was this was printed not in one

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.590 
so this was this was printed not in one
piece<00:01:39.259> right<00:01:39.560> not<00:01:39.979> in<00:01:40.130> one<00:01:40.280> piece<00:01:40.460> we<00:01:41.000> had<00:01:41.180> some

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
piece right not in one piece we had some

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.450 
piece right not in one piece we had some
some<00:01:42.049> issues<00:01:42.320> with<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.530> mouse<00:01:42.770> in<00:01:42.979> production

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
some issues with a mouse in production

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.120 
some issues with a mouse in production
and<00:01:43.729> we<00:01:44.149> built<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.450> four<00:01:44.720> up<00:01:44.899> size<00:01:45.560> one<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.039> they

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
and we built a four up size one so they

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.620 
and we built a four up size one so they
can<00:01:46.310> actually<00:01:46.429> see<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.759> physical<00:01:47.119> movement

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
can actually see the physical movement

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.609 
can actually see the physical movement
of<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.340> very<00:01:49.340> early<00:01:49.880> concepts<00:01:50.470> like<00:01:51.470> this

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
of the very early concepts like this

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.529 
of the very early concepts like this
yeah<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.130> Adi<00:01:52.310> tented<00:01:52.700> wheels<00:01:52.909> wow<00:01:53.240> that's<00:01:53.479> a

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
yeah so Adi tented wheels wow that's a

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:54.999 
yeah so Adi tented wheels wow that's a
crowd<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:53.810> coral<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.200> big<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:54.560> they<00:01:54.679> can<00:01:54.830> play

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
crowd of coral it big so they can play

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.830 
crowd of coral it big so they can play
with<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.310> see<00:01:55.700> all<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.970> little<00:01:56.209> details<00:01:56.569> and

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
with it see all the little details and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.359 
with it see all the little details and
you<00:01:57.229> were<00:01:57.350> saying<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.799> this<00:01:58.009> takes<00:01:58.250> you

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
you were saying so you this takes you

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.740 
you were saying so you this takes you
said<00:01:58.549> this<00:01:58.670> this<00:01:58.940> wrench<00:01:59.209> took<00:01:59.360> about<00:01:59.450> 35

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
said this this wrench took about 35

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.359 
said this this wrench took about 35
minutes<00:02:00.080> to<00:02:00.259> write<00:02:00.380> about<00:02:00.560> 35<00:02:00.950> minutes<00:02:01.159> you

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
minutes to write about 35 minutes you

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.910 
minutes to write about 35 minutes you
can<00:02:01.520> do<00:02:01.640> an<00:02:01.789> entire<00:02:02.090> Mouse<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:03.170> how<00:02:03.590> long<00:02:03.649> does

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
can do an entire Mouse in how long does

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.740 
can do an entire Mouse in how long does
it<00:02:03.979> take<00:02:04.159> about<00:02:04.819> three<00:02:05.149> hours<00:02:05.179> three<00:02:05.720> hours

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
it take about three hours three hours

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.210 
it take about three hours three hours
and<00:02:06.170> then<00:02:06.259> you're<00:02:06.619> starting<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.950> be<00:02:07.009> able<00:02:07.130> to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
and then you're starting to be able to

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.039 
and then you're starting to be able to
use<00:02:07.310> different<00:02:07.459> materials<00:02:07.729> yes<00:02:08.660> there's<00:02:08.959> a

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
use different materials yes there's a

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.559 
use different materials yes there's a
soft<00:02:09.679> rubber<00:02:09.890> compound<00:02:10.489> with<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> hard<00:02:10.970> harder

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
soft rubber compound with a hard harder

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.289 
soft rubber compound with a hard harder
plastic<00:02:12.080> like<00:02:12.260> compound<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.910> mix<00:02:14.120> between

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
plastic like compound the mix between

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.729 
plastic like compound the mix between
the<00:02:14.600> two<00:02:14.750> will<00:02:14.900> give<00:02:15.049> you<00:02:15.140> different<00:02:15.260> drama

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
the two will give you different drama

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.569 
the two will give you different drama
ters<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.790> can<00:02:17.000> then<00:02:17.150> two-shot<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:19.250> parts

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
ters you can then two-shot the the parts

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.190 
ters you can then two-shot the the parts
so<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.269> kind<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.510> hard<00:02:20.750> you've<00:02:20.900> got<00:02:20.989> hard

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
so this is kind of hard you've got hard

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.110 
so this is kind of hard you've got hard
plastic<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:21.859> then<00:02:22.040> you've<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.940> we're

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
plastic here then you've like we're

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.569 
plastic here then you've like we're
representing<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.989> side<00:02:24.799> grips<00:02:25.100> of<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.370> mouse

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
representing the side grips of a mouse

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.060 
representing the side grips of a mouse
so<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.090> actually<00:02:26.329> have<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.660> couple<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.290> mouse

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
so you actually have a couple of mouse

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.530 
so you actually have a couple of mouse
prototypes<00:02:28.670> here<00:02:28.880> we<00:02:29.000> should<00:02:29.060> look<00:02:29.269> at<00:02:29.420> them

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
prototypes here we should look at them

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.740 
prototypes here we should look at them
yeah<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:30.470> once<00:02:30.890> they<00:02:31.100> create<00:02:31.459> all<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
yeah so once they create all of the the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.660 
yeah so once they create all of the the
bosses<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.320> features<00:02:33.709> inside<00:02:34.100> they're<00:02:34.370> able

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
bosses and features inside they're able

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.090 
bosses and features inside they're able
to<00:02:34.820> load<00:02:35.390> components<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.440> do<00:02:36.739> their<00:02:36.890> testing

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
to load components and do their testing

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.150 
to load components and do their testing
and<00:02:37.670> how<00:02:38.180> long<00:02:38.390> will<00:02:38.540> something<00:02:38.720> like<00:02:38.810> this

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and how long will something like this

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.440 
and how long will something like this
hold<00:02:40.160> up<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.549> mean<00:02:40.700> if<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:40.940> if<00:02:40.970> you<00:02:41.299> put

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
hold up I mean if you if you put

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.819 
hold up I mean if you if you put
together<00:02:41.570> you've<00:02:41.930> got<00:02:41.959> obviously<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.530> space

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
together you've got obviously the space

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.080 
together you've got obviously the space
for<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.070> electronics<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.700> these<00:02:43.850> mice

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
for the electronics and these mice

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.330 
for the electronics and these mice
correct<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:45.140> could<00:02:45.320> go<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.590> use<00:02:45.829> this<00:02:46.070> as

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
correct you could go and use this as

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.090 
correct you could go and use this as
your<00:02:47.000> absolute<00:02:47.750> main<00:02:47.959> device<00:02:48.290> these<00:02:48.620> these

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
your absolute main device these these

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.890 
your absolute main device these these
don't<00:02:49.579> have<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:49.850> whole<00:02:50.239> lot<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.480> thermal

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
don't have a whole lot of thermal

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.539 
don't have a whole lot of thermal
integrity<00:02:51.560> if<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.799> were<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.980> warm<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.370> up

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
integrity if you were to warm this up

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.520 
integrity if you were to warm this up
and<00:02:52.790> bend<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.150> it

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
and bend it it

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.610 
and bend it it
stay<00:02:53.770> in<00:02:53.830> meltdown<00:02:54.550> yeah<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:55.750> overtime<00:02:56.319> the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
stay in meltdown yeah so overtime the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.920 
stay in meltdown yeah so overtime the
thing<00:02:56.830> would<00:02:56.980> tend<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.400> kind<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.180> say<00:02:58.450> yeah

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
thing would tend to kind of say yeah

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.430 
thing would tend to kind of say yeah
that's<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.800> human<00:03:00.250> Stern<00:03:00.459> yes<00:03:00.730> yeah<00:03:01.440> we

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
that's like a human Stern yes yeah we

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.220 
that's like a human Stern yes yeah we
also<00:03:02.590> do<00:03:02.800> tests<00:03:03.160> test<00:03:03.730> fixtures<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:04.990> if<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
also do tests test fixtures so if the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.740 
also do tests test fixtures so if the
mouse<00:03:05.410> has<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.770> go<00:03:05.890> through<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.100> life<00:03:06.280> cycle

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
mouse has to go through a life cycle

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.940 
mouse has to go through a life cycle
rather<00:03:07.750> than<00:03:08.050> spend<00:03:08.350> thousands<00:03:08.800> of<00:03:08.890> dollars

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
rather than spend thousands of dollars

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.979 
rather than spend thousands of dollars
creating<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.819> fixture<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.390> holds<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> mouse

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
creating a fixture that holds the mouse

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.460 
creating a fixture that holds the mouse
and<00:03:12.180> then<00:03:13.180> like<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.480> robotic<00:03:13.870> finger<00:03:14.260> whatever

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
and then like a robotic finger whatever

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.440 
and then like a robotic finger whatever
we'll<00:03:14.770> do<00:03:14.920> life<00:03:15.489> testing<00:03:15.940> on<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.150> buttons

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
we'll do life testing on the buttons

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.960 
we'll do life testing on the buttons
will<00:03:17.230> create<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.680> fixture<00:03:18.069> in<00:03:18.160> 3d<00:03:18.580> do<00:03:18.910> you

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
will create the fixture in 3d do you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.309 
will create the fixture in 3d do you
have<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.150> robotic<00:03:19.540> finger<00:03:19.900> here<00:03:20.080> though<00:03:20.200> I'm

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
have a robotic finger here though I'm

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.620 
have a robotic finger here though I'm
interested<00:03:20.800> to<00:03:20.920> know<00:03:20.950> if<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.580> exists<00:03:22.150> did

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
interested to know if that exists did

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.350 
interested to know if that exists did
this<00:03:22.900> morning<00:03:23.380> but<00:03:23.830> actually<00:03:24.520> if<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.700> hear

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
this morning but actually if you hear

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.150 
this morning but actually if you hear
the<00:03:25.660> robotic<00:03:26.080> finger<00:03:26.350> out<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.709> lab<00:03:26.890> here

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
the robotic finger out of the lab here

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.610 
the robotic finger out of the lab here
we<00:03:27.250> did<00:03:27.459> build<00:03:27.700> actually<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.269> hand<00:03:28.630> really<00:03:29.200> is

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
we did build actually a hand really is

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.810 
we did build actually a hand really is
it<00:03:29.830> located<00:03:30.100> just<00:03:30.310> as<00:03:30.489> this<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:31.209> a<00:03:31.239> fully<00:03:32.820> what

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
it located just as this is a fully what

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.479 
it located just as this is a fully what
is<00:03:33.910> this<00:03:34.090> clear<00:03:35.019> windows<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:36.130> was<00:03:36.370> an

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
is this clear windows this was an

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.040 
is this clear windows this was an
example<00:03:36.610> of<00:03:37.120> when<00:03:37.330> we<00:03:37.450> first<00:03:37.480> released

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
example of when we first released

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.280 
example of when we first released
Windows<00:03:38.650> Phone<00:03:39.510> they<00:03:40.510> didn't<00:03:40.840> want<00:03:41.019> to<00:03:41.140> show

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
Windows Phone they didn't want to show
