so<00:00:08.320> what<00:00:08.469> do<00:00:08.559> you<00:00:08.620> think<00:00:08.830> of<00:00:08.920> this<00:00:08.980> twisting

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:09.549 
so what do you think of this twisting

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.250 
so what do you think of this twisting
what<00:00:09.700> I<00:00:09.730> think<00:00:10.000> is<00:00:10.210> every<00:00:10.570> other<00:00:10.599> time<00:00:11.080> we've

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 
what I think is every other time we've

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.289 
what I think is every other time we've
ever<00:00:11.440> docked<00:00:12.070> a<00:00:12.190> boat<00:00:12.370> you<00:00:12.519> crashed<00:00:12.849> into<00:00:13.059> the

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
ever docked a boat you crashed into the

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:14.879 
ever docked a boat you crashed into the
thing<00:00:13.599> now<00:00:13.809> you<00:00:13.869> got<00:00:14.139> this<00:00:14.260> thing<00:00:14.500> I<00:00:14.590> might<00:00:14.709> let

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
thing now you got this thing I might let

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.230 
thing now you got this thing I might let
you<00:00:14.920> drive<00:00:15.219> this<00:00:15.789> is<00:00:16.029> way<00:00:16.449> way<00:00:17.109> easier<00:00:17.770> than

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
you drive this is way way easier than

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.910 
you drive this is way way easier than
than<00:00:19.240> than<00:00:19.630> just<00:00:19.689> docking<00:00:20.320> and<00:00:20.439> I<00:00:20.500> think<00:00:20.740> what

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
than than just docking and I think what

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.099 
than than just docking and I think what
you<00:00:21.519> know<00:00:21.640> it's<00:00:21.880> gonna<00:00:22.029> be<00:00:22.180> even<00:00:22.510> easier<00:00:22.720> for

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
you know it's gonna be even easier for

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.870 
you know it's gonna be even easier for
someone<00:00:23.289> who's<00:00:23.560> never<00:00:23.890> driven<00:00:24.130> a<00:00:24.369> boat<00:00:24.519> yes

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
yeah you can't do that with just a

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.270 
yeah you can't do that with just a
steering<00:00:44.110> wheel<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.620> throttles<00:00:45.040> for<00:00:45.250> I

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
steering wheel in the throttles for I

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.780 
steering wheel in the throttles for I
don't<00:00:45.400> know<00:00:45.580> how

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
don't know how

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.300 
don't know how
yeah<00:00:45.970> what<00:00:46.210> about<00:00:46.360> what<00:00:46.480> I<00:00:46.510> noticed<00:00:46.960> was<00:00:47.830> you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.310 
yeah what about what I noticed was you

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.280 
yeah what about what I noticed was you
know<00:00:48.400> when<00:00:48.670> we<00:00:48.790> had<00:00:48.940> it<00:00:49.030> on<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.210> high-speed<00:00:49.390> it

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
know when we had it on the high-speed it

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
know when we had it on the high-speed it
was<00:00:50.410> more<00:00:50.590> difficult<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:51.010> have<00:00:51.220> the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
was more difficult to have the

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.620 
was more difficult to have the
controller<00:00:51.580> simply<00:00:51.910> put<00:00:52.030> on<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.210> dock<00:00:52.390> mode

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
controller simply put on the dock mode

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.480 
controller simply put on the dock mode
you<00:00:53.080> could<00:00:53.230> just<00:00:53.380> come<00:00:53.590> in<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:53.800> just<00:00:53.860> precise

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
you could just come in and just precise

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.820 
you could just come in and just precise
like<00:00:54.790> you<00:00:54.880> say<00:00:55.030> right<00:00:55.480> into<00:00:55.720> the<00:00:55.810> slip<00:00:56.050> spin<00:00:56.710> it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
like you say right into the slip spin it

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.680 
like you say right into the slip spin it
on<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:56.980> dime<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.550> then<00:00:57.940> be<00:00:58.060> able<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.240> back<00:00:58.480> in

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
on a dime and then be able to back in

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.180 
on a dime and then be able to back in
and<00:00:58.840> just<00:00:58.960> make<00:00:59.080> those<00:00:59.230> micro<00:00:59.650> adjustments

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
and just make those micro adjustments

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.700 
and just make those micro adjustments
and<00:01:00.430> not<00:01:01.300> even<00:01:01.510> have<00:01:01.660> to<00:01:01.780> have<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:01.930> have<00:01:02.350> anybody

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
and not even have to have a have anybody

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.920 
and not even have to have a have anybody
you<00:01:03.130> know<00:01:03.220> yeah<00:01:03.640> grab<00:01:03.970> the<00:01:04.180> piling<00:01:04.600> well<00:01:04.900> I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
you know yeah grab the piling well I

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.719 
you know yeah grab the piling well I
think<00:01:05.199> what's<00:01:05.530> really<00:01:05.950> cool<00:01:06.220> about<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.549> you

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
think what's really cool about it you

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.640 
think what's really cool about it you
you<00:01:06.759> get<00:01:07.119> you<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.420> get<00:01:07.780> there<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.170> first<00:01:08.350> time

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
you get you you get there the first time

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.380 
you get you you get there the first time
and<00:01:08.829> it's<00:01:08.950> you<00:01:09.579> know<00:01:09.610> it<00:01:09.790> takes<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.090> few<00:01:10.240> minutes

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
and it's you know it takes a few minutes

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.300 
and it's you know it takes a few minutes
to<00:01:10.570> get<00:01:10.750> used<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.230> but<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:11.710> think<00:01:11.800> that<00:01:12.220> if

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
to get used to it but I think that if

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.420 
to get used to it but I think that if
you<00:01:12.430> spent<00:01:12.790> 30<00:01:13.510> minutes<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:14.080> an<00:01:14.200> hour<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:15.280> a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
you spent 30 minutes to an hour in a

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.850 
you spent 30 minutes to an hour in a
marina<00:01:15.760> working<00:01:16.300> on<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:16.630> then<00:01:17.260> you<00:01:17.500> would<00:01:17.680> be

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
marina working on this then you would be

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.649 
marina working on this then you would be
as<00:01:18.159> good<00:01:18.520> at<00:01:18.640> dunking<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.060> boat<00:01:19.210> as<00:01:19.360> any<00:01:19.510> of

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
as good at dunking a boat as any of

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.120 
as good at dunking a boat as any of
these<00:01:19.720> captains<00:01:20.110> in<00:01:20.260> here<00:01:20.440> maybe<00:01:20.710> even<00:01:20.980> better

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
these captains in here maybe even better

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.360 
these captains in here maybe even better
when<00:01:21.880> I<00:01:21.909> in<00:01:22.090> 30<00:01:22.330> min<00:01:22.540> what<00:01:22.690> I<00:01:22.720> noticed<00:01:23.140> is<00:01:23.370> like

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
when I in 30 min what I noticed is like

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.980 
when I in 30 min what I noticed is like
the<00:01:24.490> guys<00:01:24.610> on<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:24.850> big<00:01:25.000> offshore<00:01:25.360> boats<00:01:25.570> he'll

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
the guys on the big offshore boats he'll

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.390 
the guys on the big offshore boats he'll
use<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.290> boat<00:01:26.470> all<00:01:26.770> right<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:27.100> think<00:01:27.250> that's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
use the boat all right and think that's

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.920 
use the boat all right and think that's
right<00:01:27.729> that's<00:01:28.090> one<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:28.330> those<00:01:28.390> kind<00:01:28.600> of<00:01:28.659> tricky

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
right that's one of those kind of tricky

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.660 
right that's one of those kind of tricky
things<00:01:29.200> they<00:01:29.590> even<00:01:29.740> have<00:01:29.830> bow<00:01:29.979> thrusters<00:01:30.460> this

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
things they even have bow thrusters this

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.610 
things they even have bow thrusters this
Didem<00:01:30.970> almost<00:01:31.750> all<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.290> know<00:01:32.380> without

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
Didem almost all that you know without
