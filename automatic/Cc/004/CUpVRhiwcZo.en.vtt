00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
just a programming error number 11 the

hypercube

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.160

I<00:03:53.770> guess<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.880> hypercube<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.780> can<00:03:56.020> store

I guess the hypercube it can store

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.960 
I guess the hypercube it can store
infinite<00:03:56.680> amounts<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.070> anything<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:57.760> give
