00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.560
 what's going on 640 welcome to one 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.600
 can live recordings new cd with you 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.759
 My girlfriend and I are here two 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.269
 men a controller and 6543 what our 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.219
 aim 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.289
 to be positive exactly on everyone 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.490
 case to say positive people i think 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.900
 we actually have that here 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.900
 created so walls is not like that 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:51.020
 matter but 11 there is virtually 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:51.020
 positively this is a fps 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.410
 but we are behind 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.580
 pixel 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:55.080
 then four pieces of old four pieces or 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.080
 be anyway 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.950
 that's hard to pull 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.750
 make the teams 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.750
 Jackson 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:27.470
 But I have to say that 's it 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:28.850
 also the ps4 controller play a game 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:54.640
 of course I know t-shirt too 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:54.640
 among the people 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.590
 ok shows that the hat synonymous with it 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:29.310
 you already have contact 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:40.370
 this builds here I think I wanted the place 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:40.370
 even the game lights up again 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.000
 but still a 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.610
 where are the opponents and I am here 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.500
 used okay people we won it 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.330
 we get 18 accesses are on 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.150
 positive or even second place 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.500
 Rate a crazy grass if you like that 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.590
 definitely liked one video 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:28.540
 positive rating there was a bit 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.540
