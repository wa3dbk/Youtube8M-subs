gonna<00:00:48.809> fall<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> foam<00:00:50.640> eNOS<00:00:51.149> should<00:00:51.450> go<00:00:51.660> away

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
gonna fall the foam eNOS should go away

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.100 
gonna fall the foam eNOS should go away
and<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.350> should<00:00:52.559> change<00:00:52.770> says<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> deep

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
and it should change says to a deep

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.810 
and it should change says to a deep
garnet<00:00:55.110> red<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:56.039> experiences<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
garnet red and my experiences that it

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.510 
garnet red and my experiences that it
does<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.180> change<00:00:57.660> color<00:00:58.039> when<00:00:59.039> it's

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
does actually change color when it's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.270 
does actually change color when it's
ready<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.149> we'll<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.809> our<00:01:00.960> best<00:01:00.989> after<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.070> on

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
ready so we'll do our best after that on

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.850 
ready so we'll do our best after that on
camera<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.660> know<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.309> done<00:01:05.309> stirring

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
camera you can know and done stirring

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:16.230 
camera you can know and done stirring
alright<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.729> what

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.510 

so<00:01:17.240> it<00:01:17.330> has<00:01:17.390> turned<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:18.140> that<00:01:18.409> deep<00:01:18.860> darker<00:01:19.310> red

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
so it has turned to that deep darker red

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.360 
so it has turned to that deep darker red
and<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.850> foam<00:01:20.120> is<00:01:20.540> not<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:21.770> high<00:01:21.979> it's<00:01:22.220> just

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
and the foam is not so high it's just

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.760 
and the foam is not so high it's just
around<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.790> edges<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.290> what<00:01:24.440> we<00:01:24.560> did<00:01:24.710> is

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
around the edges and so what we did is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.360 
around the edges and so what we did is
we<00:01:24.979> took<00:01:25.130> a<00:01:25.580> couple<00:01:25.820> of<00:01:26.060> spoonfuls<00:01:26.360> of<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.979> jam

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
we took a couple of spoonfuls of the jam

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.070 
we took a couple of spoonfuls of the jam
and<00:01:28.400> put<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:28.940> in<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.180> little<00:01:29.420> jar<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:29.930> then<00:01:30.020> we

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
and put it in a little jar and then we

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.340 
and put it in a little jar and then we
put<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.320> in<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.619> freezer<00:01:30.830> for<00:01:31.250> about<00:01:32.350> three

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
put it in the freezer for about three

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.340 
put it in the freezer for about three
minutes<00:01:33.500> something<00:01:34.130> like<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:35.060> then<00:01:35.570> you

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
minutes something like that and then you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.910 
minutes something like that and then you
and<00:01:36.619> um<00:01:37.360> then<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.509> can<00:01:38.690> tell<00:01:38.900> that<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.229> has<00:01:39.440> gel

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
and um then you can tell that it has gel

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.650 
and um then you can tell that it has gel
because<00:01:40.250> it's<00:01:40.580> um<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:41.090> turn<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.420> around

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
the little jar so we're gonna use this

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.310 
the little jar so we're gonna use this

to through those holes when it was new
would<00:04:22.500> just<00:04:22.820> steam<00:04:23.820> out<00:04:24.060> off<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.720> sides<00:04:24.990> but

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
would just steam out off the sides but

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.960 
would just steam out off the sides but
we<00:04:25.530> kind<00:04:25.740> of<00:04:25.830> got<00:04:25.980> to<00:04:26.190> know<00:04:26.220> it's<00:04:26.610> kind<00:04:26.880> of

we kind of got to know it's kind of
gotten<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.450> little<00:04:27.570> lopsided<00:04:28.050> whatnot<00:04:29.040> so<00:04:29.070> we

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
gotten a little lopsided whatnot so we

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.470 
gotten a little lopsided whatnot so we
kind<00:04:29.550> of<00:04:29.580> know<00:04:29.700> what<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:29.940> looks<00:04:29.970> like<00:04:30.300> when
