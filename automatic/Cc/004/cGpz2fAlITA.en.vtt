00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
where they're connected this one happens

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.890 
where they're connected this one happens
to<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.820> opens<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.390> closes<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
glasses and we call that the hinge

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.639 
glasses and we call that the hinge
temple<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:35.820> has<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> screw<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.440> can

temple and it has a screw that we can

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.880 
temple and it has a screw that we can
tighten<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:39.090> usually<00:00:39.899> right<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
tighten and it's usually right in the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.819 
tighten and it's usually right in the
top<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.430> we're<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> use<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.739> call

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
top and we're going to use what we call

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.680 
top and we're going to use what we call
an<00:00:44.370> optometric<00:00:45.329> screwdriver<00:00:46.020> now<00:00:46.950> there's

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
an optometric screwdriver now there's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.799 
an optometric screwdriver now there's
regular<00:00:48.690> flat<00:00:49.500> tip<00:00:49.829> ones<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.629> then<00:00:51.629> there's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
regular flat tip ones and then there's

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
regular flat tip ones and then there's
regular<00:00:52.170> cross<00:00:52.440> tip<00:00:52.770> ones<00:00:53.039> or<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.760> we

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
regular cross tip ones or as we

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.380 
regular cross tip ones or as we
otherwise<00:00:54.719> call<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.260> Phillips<00:00:55.620> head<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.390> in

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
otherwise call it a Phillips head and in

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.740 
otherwise call it a Phillips head and in
my<00:00:57.690> case<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> flat<00:00:59.280> tip<00:00:59.550> screw<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.329> what

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
my case I have a flat tip screw and what

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.150 
my case I have a flat tip screw and what
we're<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> use<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.649> we're<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
we're going to use is we're going to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.030 
we're going to use is we're going to
actually<00:01:02.489> try<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> find<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.500> tabletop<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
actually try to find a tabletop or a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.000 
actually try to find a tabletop or a
corner<00:01:05.640> we're<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.590> secure<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> frame

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
corner we're going to secure the frame

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.109 
corner we're going to secure the frame
on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.850> corner<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:10.470> table<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.820> this

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
on the corner of the table and this

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
on the corner of the table and this
could<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> kitchen<00:01:12.689> table<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.290> desk<00:01:13.500> or

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
could be a kitchen table a desk or

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.160 
could be a kitchen table a desk or
anything<00:01:14.430> that's<00:01:14.729> firm<00:01:15.119> enough<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.900> put

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
anything that's firm enough to put

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.649 
anything that's firm enough to put
pressure<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.060> now<00:01:18.060> look<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.479> my

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
pressure on and now look at my

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.670 
pressure on and now look at my
screwdriver<00:01:19.970> this<00:01:20.970> has<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.900> swivel<00:01:22.470> on

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
screwdriver this has a little swivel on

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.550 
screwdriver this has a little swivel on
the<00:01:22.799> top<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.310> me<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.930> put<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.259> palm

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the top for me to put my put in my palm

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.090 
the top for me to put my put in my palm
and<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.610> way<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.360> put<00:01:27.390> pressure<00:01:27.810> onto<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and this way I can put pressure onto the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.580 
and this way I can put pressure onto the
screw<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.520> turn<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.909> slowly<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.500> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
screw and turn it slowly so I'm going to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.480 
screw and turn it slowly so I'm going to
begin<00:01:31.710> by<00:01:32.600> lining<00:01:33.600> up<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.900> flat<00:01:34.890> tip<00:01:35.159> into<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
begin by lining up the flat tip into the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.069 
begin by lining up the flat tip into the
screw<00:01:35.820> head<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:37.100> then<00:01:38.100> we're<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:39.079> turn

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
screw head and then we're going to turn

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.340 
screw head and then we're going to turn
it<00:01:40.259> clockwise<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:41.130> tighten<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
it clockwise to tighten and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.200 
it clockwise to tighten and
counterclockwise<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.799> loosen<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.939> case

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
counterclockwise to loosen but this case

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.999 
counterclockwise to loosen but this case
we're<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.689> clockwise<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.649> we've<00:01:46.829> made

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
we're going clockwise and so we've made

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.639 
we're going clockwise and so we've made
the<00:01:47.189> adjustment<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.820> now<00:01:47.970> tighter<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:49.380> of

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the adjustment it's now tighter and of

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.109 
the adjustment it's now tighter and of
course<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> other<00:01:50.490> side<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.909> same

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
course we can do the other side the same

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.859 
course we can do the other side the same
way<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.880> now<00:01:54.110> I've<00:01:55.110> got<00:01:55.320> both<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.770> these

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
way and now I've got both of these

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
way and now I've got both of these
tightened<00:01:58.250> now<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> other<00:01:59.549> part<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
tightened now the other part of the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.850 
tightened now the other part of the
frame<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.360> could<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.780> tightened<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.829> eye

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
frame that could be tightened is the eye

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.280 
frame that could be tightened is the eye
wire<00:02:02.219> where<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> lens<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.509> being<00:02:03.750> held<00:02:03.990> into

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
wire where the lens is being held into

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.859 
wire where the lens is being held into
the<00:02:04.409> frame<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.939> course<00:02:06.180> there<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.509> another

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the frame and of course there is another

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.800 
the frame and of course there is another
screw<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:07.950> there

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
screw right there

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.580 
screw right there
