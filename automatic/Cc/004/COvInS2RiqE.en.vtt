00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
to work fine obviously that's the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.510 
to work fine obviously that's the
original<00:01:59.289> batch<00:01:59.439> of<00:01:59.649> they're<00:02:01.500> not<00:02:02.500> see<00:02:02.799> copied

battery but it works fine so thus that's

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.990 
battery but it works fine so thus that's
worth<00:02:07.689> getting<00:02:08.970> 10<00:02:09.970> pounds<00:02:10.360> put<00:02:10.600> an<00:02:10.660> MP<00:02:10.990> and
