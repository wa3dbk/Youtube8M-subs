00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.729
 Jalloh get together Hoffmann also e2 the pitch another Krost move should 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:11.590
 I'll show you here the swanky the criticism Rome needs because of other Euro 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.049
 Friends or via international band 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.240
 You definitely need two ports on the internet to find their lift words 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.470
 mostly the wrong ones 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.320
 Definitely right any function in tune are these doctrines that do it 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.400
 once first porten then would have the title we prescribe it Pizarro 6 and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.699
 24 too 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.250
 sometime sees 065 24 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.480
 then the second fort CCP and Roddick open from 2300 to the 2400 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 So I like him again 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 who write in the backup or that we just look at more often 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.840
 about which Stemann can park the ashram Cross Online FrÃ¼hlings faith 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.800
 I am on Amazon because I am not a problem is a user and now believe too 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.340
 that it does not work anymore 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.799
 you can catch something here 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.389
 He also sent a free version of it to Johnson without Abraham 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.780
 "This is all embarrassing to have to pay attention to is also in 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.490
 Portland and Seattle sometimes play with it 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.579
 Accordingly, he can not play Munich on the board 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630
 So if you do not like to play internationally 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.180
 then still open 48 Kim policy 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.980
 with these ports so that the 1 5 5 also three times more than 5 5 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.760
 around 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.620
 it was actually to the ports to where you can find all the programs now 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.590
 will beam tray times on chip de 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.870
 That's where you get Nina Matschie 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.470
 By 4 90 percent are satisfied with Grammer Dreckmann 6 MW 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.580
 tree 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.050
 to recommend how much deeper also Arminia would like to play with friends 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.490
 or you invite yourself 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.450
 easy 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.950
 further below 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.190
 to play there 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.830
 at the moment 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.010
 what Steal about the 50 game types are there usually to 40 to 60 players 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.130
 are mostly on but scars 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.320
 many international so much saved Rome 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.690
 But in the evening still a lot of German users would find at most the 90th 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.040
 Percent so super program and therefore must be synonymous with degenerate a pretty 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.209
 Small 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.709
 why year in case Pierer wrote the instructions to Worldlink for Schrader and 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.909
 Matthias percent vehicle 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.559
 in the small workshop like Vito with the small town rally in front 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.349
 Abenberg corner on downloads then too 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.040
 He is stopped by Webb 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.200
 who make very funny thinks or girls collectible abuse card 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.429
 play 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:39.730
 feeder services 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.230
 to that I am supposed to after the death of teacher posts on 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.360
 still as I said the written instructions for the high places so 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.250
 You can also download the Dead Body and download it to us 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.989
 Couple 2 and then you could 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.870
 Instructions also download here as I said the page ice cream 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.870
 put the clear in Germany radio goes to 4 clock 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.879
 around 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.659
 I think Siebert was already around when you wake up still open especially the 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.669
 Celebration Bock Leaving this is still about milk on Windows 7 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.289
 In fact, Klaus Jahn I usually every time you play for the first time 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.759
 Dispute over whether this is to be blocked by the celebration do not want 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.579
 so again the box the first posted ca 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.279
 Winston sixth 24 also to 7000 46 90 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:28.949
 the second followed her needed 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:34.339
 CCP and Judith are doing well in 2000 or 2400 and if Italy uses them 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.169
 stow watch Mayer TC BW Rheine 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.979
 three times the 1 5 5 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.119
 Percent also in the context of the 5 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:45.359
 Detour weighty diving more for the next idea 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.229
 Nevertheless, in order to be mistaken for Venice, we too have to rave too much 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.659
 one that suits the internal Haiti to make the spring when building up now 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.899
 this year Windows icon image 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:01.409
 instead of financing one would come and then each one comes around we have to 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.299
 Sixes one 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.299
 yes and then write the old conflict 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.809
 for that easy 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:13.979
 and then they are important on the numbers but that we are the standard 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.859
 Who is going to take samples 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.880
 for the AAK of 2 6 8 points so I for example 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.159
 around 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.889
 With it you can have your boarding school to show that you count to this 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:25.999
 enter the 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.300
 Press Enter and plenty of conflict 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.770
 works the way synonymous with Windows XP 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.690
 is still there with the Six Pay but not so many have 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.699
 Understand Bull City 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.550
 so the wars for yes 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.439

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.490
 I am also attached to the antenna 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:02.300
 Space to reach 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.599
