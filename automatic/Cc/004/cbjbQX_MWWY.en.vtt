00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.679
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:26.610
 Yes er a Kopenrobu First we ran the city 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:31.280
 Very good steering feel think O'sleep from the moment you began to run anymore this is 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.310
 In the case of this Copen, it is really true 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.930
 It's response of Anoii sports car 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:41.360
 It has been realized 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:44.250
 Well I kinda I feel called kana body last year has been quite firm 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.770
 The size of the tire is also large 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.579
 Sometimes Hey 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.829
 Or a trembling in the rough in the road surface 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.680
 If you also Kedomo I have a pretty good doing much this place to be 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.890
 It is made me feel like I should be doing 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.450
 Power performance is good enough 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.290
 Well now the roof one ton reach such a light car this car in many 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:11.920
 Well car weight of 800 kilometers 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:13.090
 As I keep it, I already have enough power of the frame of this 64 horsepower sound system too 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.360
 Run well 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:23.110
 How to use cvt is not too bad 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:25.060
 Well Kedomo you're not around to another 2000 rotation I also look Well now after and it something in the city 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.280
 Even if I step down lightly from here 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.360
 Chan 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.960
 Even in this cvt I manual would also be of course because it is Well and me reaction to 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.690
 Well, it's like a good response like a sports car 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.690
 I think I can not be betrayed so much even if I expect 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.710
 I think that would like to enter the highway at Yes example Kopen 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:58.280
 The feeling of acceleration is not bad 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.850
 Well, I hope you can combine it with a light and well torqued engine . 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.890
 It was an area almost almost the same as the last time in the nose, but 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:12.390
 I will accelerate smoothly If this is it I say so-called like this really join the neighborhood of the line 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:17.459
 I think the thing is not to a scary thought in like a place 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:21.150
 I'm better reaction Toka when jumped lightly from there this time that 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.800
 I think the matching of 10 transmissions is also this 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.510
 I think I have taken well 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.050
 When the sound of the engine is going crooked Chan but is the So I do not have elaborate make up Well Toko 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.470
 Ne 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:40.290
 I of the lower and split even I'm not that good again referred to as the log 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:40.290
 I I think that is not bad have not never frivolous feeling came out strong sound 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:52.600
 Well, I think it's kind of like it's pretty good 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.670
 Because it is not well how really I Doll feeling less such even in places like the subsequent corner 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.200
 Also I'd want to say Jan commonplace 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.480
 Really coupled with also a low center of gravity But you know it 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:07.940
 Just as I thought I could not do 5 glad 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.030
 The movement changes lightly, but there is something fun of running 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:16.610
 If the light vehicles of the sports car 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:20.380
 Some other I was a child Gane x things like Is the will not taste only in it sight 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.380
 It's not like that 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.890
 I made it open and started running 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:34.360
 It is the first impression that it is Kpen after all that it is a formal dress 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.740
 Closed One end to the mouth a little Well law I and running in a state Well so little chassis 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.490
 If you feel like there is not enough rigidity 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.870
 It looks like the front meeting screen seems to pull the window a bit 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.530
 I have something to do 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:51.510
 If it is open, it will not bother you all 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:56.160
 It 's not just because it feels open because there is something pleasantly in the sense, actually 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.940
 Many things I have been tuned to fit in a minute that out to the state of the open 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.100
 I suppose 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.480
 So after all Copen 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.959
 If you can ride it as much as possible 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:11.019
 It is the runs open as long as there is no heavy rain Gane 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.019
 I feel like it's the right figure or the right way to use it 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:21.390
 To new technologies we have been in it Tenkomori some well be fun, such as the world and more than anything 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:26.520
 Ne driving is the preconception of light cars so far or common sense 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:28.590
 The degree of completion as Copen car that is the other great good finish, such as overcome 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.200
 I think it has grown so much 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:38.290
 On the other hand , Sendai's Copen is eight people who don't like cars 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:41.260
 Then I think it 's pretty cute and try it actually and it's really fun but the quality is really high 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.150
 I think it was a car like that, but there is no such place 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.730
 But I'd say lonely 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.530
 Well new Copene Hey I'm also like the relationship with the user to talk to people in development 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.190
 It is important to emphasize the place 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.600
 You can feel a first 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.140
 So maybe that means that users will grow up in the future 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.140
 May
