00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.949 
shading with acrylics got some different
types<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.819> paint<00:02:27.060> Leah<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:27.569> we'll<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:27.870> run

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
types of paint Leah so we'll just run

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.199 
types of paint Leah so we'll just run
through<00:02:28.380> them<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.650> start<00:02:28.860> off<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.160> black<00:02:29.370> is

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
through them you start off with black is

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.569 
through them you start off with black is
a<00:02:30.269> cold<00:02:30.660> gray<00:02:31.050> night<00:02:31.739> blue<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.989> turquoise<00:02:34.579> and

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
a cold gray night blue a turquoise and

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.430 
a cold gray night blue a turquoise and
we've<00:02:35.760> got<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> new<00:02:36.090> care<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.840> interesting

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
we've got a new care this is interesting

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.400 
we've got a new care this is interesting
so<00:02:38.329> inks<00:02:39.329> are<00:02:39.480> obviously<00:02:39.750> different<00:02:39.959> and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
so inks are obviously different and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.400 
so inks are obviously different and
extra<00:02:40.739> opaque<00:02:41.549> they're<00:02:42.090> two<00:02:42.420> extra<00:02:42.989> opaque

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
extra opaque they're two extra opaque

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.970 
extra opaque they're two extra opaque
references<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.570> finally<00:02:45.570> some<00:02:45.870> white<00:02:46.079> so<00:02:46.769> be

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
references and finally some white so be

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.380 
references and finally some white so be
interesting<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.579> compare<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:48.120> what<00:02:48.269> we're

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
interesting to compare so what we're

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.000 
interesting to compare so what we're
going<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.570> do<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.780> we're<00:02:48.900> going<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.049> take<00:02:49.320> these

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
going to do is we're going to take these

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.430 
going to do is we're going to take these
three<00:02:50.280> paints<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:52.049> look<00:02:52.200> at<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
three paints and just look at the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.420 
three paints and just look at the
consistency<00:02:54.920> we're<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.070> going<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.280> give

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
consistency we're just going to give

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.890 
consistency we're just going to give
them<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.700> shake

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
them a shake

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.540 
them a shake
so<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.050> by<00:03:00.290> way<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.680> sample<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.310> the

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
so this by way of a sample is the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:13.240 
so this by way of a sample is the
turquoise<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.950> it's<00:03:07.069> fairly<00:03:07.400> thick<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:13.040> is

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
turquoise and it's fairly thick this is

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.640 
turquoise and it's fairly thick this is
an<00:03:13.519> ink<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.330> you<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:14.690> tell<00:03:14.900> just<00:03:15.170> shaking<00:03:15.560> the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
an ink and you can tell just shaking the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.910 
an ink and you can tell just shaking the
bottle<00:03:16.660> but<00:03:17.660> it's<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:18.080> lot<00:03:18.349> lighter<00:03:18.560> in

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
bottle but it's a lot lighter in

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.619 
bottle but it's a lot lighter in
consistency<00:03:19.720> much<00:03:20.720> more<00:03:20.989> like<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.200> wash<00:03:22.629> there

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
consistency much more like a wash there

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.580 
consistency much more like a wash there
we<00:03:23.750> go

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.780 

and<00:03:30.590> finally<00:03:31.040> we've<00:03:31.190> got<00:03:31.370> these<00:03:31.550> extra<00:03:31.820> opaque

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
and finally we've got these extra opaque

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:43.420 
and finally we've got these extra opaque
again<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:34.940> feels<00:03:35.210> different<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.980> let's<00:03:43.160> just

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
again it feels different so let's just

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:51.490 
again it feels different so let's just
get<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.670> brush<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.840> blue<00:03:48.110> is<00:03:48.350> fairly<00:03:49.390> normal<00:03:50.500> as

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
get a brush the blue is fairly normal as

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.410 
get a brush the blue is fairly normal as
you'd<00:03:51.740> expect<00:03:52.220> from<00:03:52.340> any<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.880> way<00:03:53.060> cause

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
you'd expect from any of the way cause

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.150 
you'd expect from any of the way cause
good<00:03:53.720> coverage<00:03:54.200> good<00:03:54.590> pigmentation<00:03:57.160> here

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
good coverage good pigmentation here

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.150 
good coverage good pigmentation here
we've<00:03:58.370> got<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:59.150> pink<00:04:01.000> it's<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.180> lot<00:04:02.330> light<00:04:03.160> look

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
we've got the pink it's a lot light look

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.120 
we've got the pink it's a lot light look
thinner<00:04:04.490> and<00:04:05.170> clearly<00:04:06.170> intended<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.740> be<00:04:06.860> used

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
thinner and clearly intended to be used

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
thinner and clearly intended to be used
either<00:04:07.400> as<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:08.080> filter<00:04:09.100> or<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.160> wash<00:04:10.580> and<00:04:10.970> then

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
either as a filter or a wash and then

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.690 
either as a filter or a wash and then
finally<00:04:11.600> we've<00:04:11.750> got<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.020> extra<00:04:12.440> peat

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.130 

okay<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.480> that's<00:04:19.600> definitely<00:04:20.080> thicker<00:04:22.140> as

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
okay and that's definitely thicker as

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.320 
okay and that's definitely thicker as
the<00:04:23.620> name<00:04:23.800> would<00:04:23.920> suggest<00:04:23.980> the<00:04:24.760> game<00:04:25.000> color

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
the name would suggest the game color

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.810 
the name would suggest the game color
