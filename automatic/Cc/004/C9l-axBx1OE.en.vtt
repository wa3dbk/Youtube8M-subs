inside<00:00:32.910> over<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> floor<00:00:34.610> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.790> how<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.030> do

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
inside over a floor this is how you do

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.950 
inside over a floor this is how you do
us<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.309> put<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> water<00:00:38.969> into<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.690> glass<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
us so you put the water into a glass and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.590 
us so you put the water into a glass and
fill<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> right<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> top<00:00:41.270> then<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> bring

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
fill it right to the top then you bring

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830 
fill it right to the top then you bring
the<00:00:42.750> bowl<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.350> case<00:00:43.620> any<00:00:43.950> spills<00:00:44.600> can<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.690> have

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the bowl in case any spills can we have

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
the bowl in case any spills can we have
someone<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.649> audience<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.309> pick<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
someone from the audience to pick the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.250 
someone from the audience to pick the
piece<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.390> cardboard<00:00:53.629> so<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.899> put<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
piece of cardboard so we put the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.889 
piece of cardboard so we put the
cardboard<00:00:55.590> over<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.280> top<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.030> hold<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.660> tight

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
cardboard over the top and hold it tight

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.310 
cardboard over the top and hold it tight
a<00:00:58.910> bit<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.030> water<00:01:00.239> might<00:01:00.660> come<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
a bit of water might come out when you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.899 
a bit of water might come out when you
tip<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.800> upside<00:01:02.100> down<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.820> bladder<00:01:03.270> laughs

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
tip it up upside down but bladder laughs

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.590 
tip it up upside down but bladder laughs
hold<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.090> tight<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.420> around<00:01:06.990> 5<00:01:07.260> seconds<00:01:08.600> then

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
hold it tight for around 5 seconds then

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.819 
hold it tight for around 5 seconds then
let<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.020> hand<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> should<00:01:11.280> stay

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.810 

this<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:16.030> happening<00:01:16.270> because<00:01:17.219> with<00:01:18.219> no<00:01:18.250> air

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
this is happening because with no air

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.749 
this is happening because with no air
inside<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.570> glass<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.140> air<00:01:20.320> pressure<00:01:20.799> from

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
inside the glass the air pressure from

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.660 
inside the glass the air pressure from
outside<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.450> glass<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:23.020> greater<00:01:23.380> than<00:01:23.890> the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
outside the glass is greater than the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.450 
outside the glass is greater than the
pressure<00:01:24.909> of<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.719> water<00:01:26.110> inside<00:01:26.829> the<00:01:27.039> glass

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.130 

we'll<00:01:30.460> test<00:01:30.969> it<00:01:31.210> all<00:01:31.360> over<00:01:32.310> ahead
