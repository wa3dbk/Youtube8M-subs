00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.390
 we cut grief today 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.430
 something together 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.980
 take milky when I'm cooking small 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.419
 always full of milk 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.220
 then you could war too 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.560
 like wholegrain crisis namely had now 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.150
 but only to there a little salt 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.180
 a bit of nutmeg an egg and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.009
 butter in the first step we come 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.770
 just the milk with a pinch 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.810
 salt and a bit of nutmeg on the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.160
 you can find the quantities of the ingredients 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.410
 as always below in the infobox 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.940
 and when the whole cooks we give 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.239
 the priest as the would like to cook 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.860
 I just stirred the semolina 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.750
 then let boil to twice as 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.430
 and now I leave the top four 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.820
 on it but have the stove plate 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.719
 turn off and let the semolina now 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.070
 here five minutes in the source 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.480
 In the meantime you can already do that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.239
 Prepare next step and indeed 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.300
 just a piece of fresh-holding foil on 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.640
 the work surface because if that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.890
 Here then its five minutes to go 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.750
 is the egg is still fast 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.369
 stir and then this whole 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.390
 here on the plastic wrap 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.070
 painted 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.530
 the whole will be with the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.740
 kept fresh foil wrapped and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.420
 a roll-formed, the parting 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.770
 The whole thing has stirred here now 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.560
 it will form and shape the fpÃ¶ 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.270
 from this a big role 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.009
 that's my role to leave the whole thing 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.649
 cool yourself when it cools down 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.599
 it will be easy to slice here 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.830
 sliced 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.739
 the whole thing will be in one 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.569
 coated pan with a bit 

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:46.920
 Butter seared on both sides for a short time 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:52.020
 and then the devices are cut 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.429
 actually already cut 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.429
 now so yes 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.950
 I would say artistically creative 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.350
 I do not care much about it 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.360
 Then he disappears in his mouth and speaks 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.820
 then now this short from both sides 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.979
 and then I'm already done 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.550
 and then there's this so is the little 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:18.440
 sung and I'll be up to cinnamon and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.319
 eat sugar if you want you can 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:29.480
 to decrease or any other 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.980
 things do not eat that way now 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.239
 think that's a sweet meal so that 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.599
 crisis skidding is not at all 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.799
 sweet or something and then the first 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.250
 I'll try it today 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:43.489
 different things about it and that 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.160
 I'll be in heat charge 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.760
 I have fresh cheeses here and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.319
 that's sugar and cinnamon we have to look 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.120
 What I like to taste can be cumbersome 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.400
 not imagine very very well 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.090
 I just do not have a home and that 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.500
 is holiday 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.090
 I hope you have this little cook 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.510
 Video fell again it went great 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.310

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.840
