to<00:00:47.010> help<00:00:47.250> cut<00:00:47.489> through<00:00:47.520> some<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> soft

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
to help cut through some of the soft

to help cut through some of the soft
snow<00:00:48.510> conditions<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.260> bringing<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> widest

part<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> ski<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.180> where<00:00:51.329> traditionally

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
part of the ski from where traditionally

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.990 
part of the ski from where traditionally
would<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.469> closer<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.789> boot

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
would be up here closer to the boot

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.880 
would be up here closer to the boot
which<00:00:54.360> would<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.629> located<00:00:54.780> here<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.739> by

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
which would be located here so by

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.770 
which would be located here so by
cutting<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.340> distance<00:00:56.699> from<00:00:56.820> boot<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.300> tip<00:00:57.539> in

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
cutting the distance from boot to tip in

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.010 
cutting the distance from boot to tip in
half<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:58.949> obviously<00:01:00.020> accelerate

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
half you actually obviously accelerate

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.229 
half you actually obviously accelerate
the<00:01:01.170> sensation<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.920> what<00:01:02.190> you'll<00:01:02.340> feel<00:01:02.670> that

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the sensation of what you'll feel that

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299 
the sensation of what you'll feel that
ski<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.690> edge<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.500> you've<00:01:04.769> got<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.979> bit<00:01:05.189> of

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
ski on edge so you've got a bit of

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280 
ski on edge so you've got a bit of
rocker<00:01:05.519> also<00:01:06.150> combined<00:01:06.540> adept<00:01:06.840> at<00:01:07.140> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
rocker also combined adept at that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
rocker also combined adept at that
flexion<00:01:07.740> point<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.310> where<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> skis<00:01:09.240> widest

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
flexion point so where the skis widest

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.320 
flexion point so where the skis widest
it's<00:01:09.900> also<00:01:10.080> at<00:01:10.380> its<00:01:10.530> camber<00:01:10.860> neutral<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.490> where

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's also at its camber neutral so where

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
it's also at its camber neutral so where
you're<00:01:12.510> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.780> edging<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.290> ski<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.710> on

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you're going to be edging that ski in on

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.350 
you're going to be edging that ski in on
the<00:01:14.250> snow<00:01:14.460> surface<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.299> be

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the snow surface it's going to be

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.969 
the snow surface it's going to be
digging<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.170> tip<00:01:16.439> area<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
digging in and that tip area is going to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.620 
digging in and that tip area is going to
allow<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.220> ski<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.610> rise<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:18.030> from<00:01:18.240> there<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
allow the ski to rise up from there and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.840 
allow the ski to rise up from there and
that<00:01:19.080> area<00:01:19.380> where<00:01:19.799> camber<00:01:20.250> meets<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.670> side

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
that area where camber meets and side

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.429 
that area where camber meets and side
cut<00:01:21.090> meats<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.420> going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.810> only<00:01:22.020> about<00:01:22.140> two

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
cut meats is going to be only about two

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.380 
cut meats is going to be only about two
centimeters<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.490> what's<00:01:23.700> unique<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
centimeters so what's unique about this

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.999 
centimeters so what's unique about this
ski<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.960> specifically<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.830> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
ski that I like specifically is that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.460 
ski that I like specifically is that
when<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> put<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> ski<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.790> edge<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.869> kind<00:01:28.409> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
when I put the ski on edge I can kind of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
when I put the ski on edge I can kind of
take<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.009> little<00:01:29.280> bit<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.490> pressure<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.299> off

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
take a little bit of pressure on in off

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.910 
take a little bit of pressure on in off
that<00:01:30.509> edge<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.320> allow<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.619> key<00:01:31.799> either

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that edge and allow this key either

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.760 
that edge and allow this key either
slide<00:01:32.430> or<00:01:32.640> smear<00:01:33.060> downfall<00:01:33.570> line<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:33.990> dig<00:01:34.650> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
slide or smear downfall line or dig it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
slide or smear downfall line or dig it
in<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.070> hard<00:01:35.250> enough<00:01:35.310> where<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.700> ski<00:01:35.909> grips

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
in just hard enough where that ski grips

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
in just hard enough where that ski grips
hard<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.840> activates<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.040> radius<00:01:38.460> that's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
hard and activates the radius that's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
hard and activates the radius that's
located<00:01:39.270> under<00:01:39.659> foot<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> little<00:01:40.650> bit<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
located under foot with a little bit of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.350 
located under foot with a little bit of
camber<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> traditionally

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
camber so I get a traditionally

when<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> let<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:44.970> ski<00:01:45.180> kind<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.420> slightly

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
when I let this ski kind of slightly

when I let this ski kind of slightly
come<00:01:46.229> off<00:01:46.409> edge<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> keep<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> flat<00:01:47.640> flat

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
come off edge or I keep it flat flat

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
based it's really smooth and loose so I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.670 
based it's really smooth and loose so I
can<00:01:50.610> pivot<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> manipulate<00:01:52.049> tight<00:01:52.290> areas
