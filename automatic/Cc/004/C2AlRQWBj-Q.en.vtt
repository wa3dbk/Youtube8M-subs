00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
don't have to do this but for this

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.030 
don't have to do this but for this
particular<00:03:13.830> bottle<00:03:15.049> this<00:03:16.049> adapter<00:03:16.620> ring<00:03:16.799> is

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
particular bottle this adapter ring is

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.330 
particular bottle this adapter ring is
too<00:03:17.519> big<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:18.810> bottle<00:03:19.200> won't<00:03:19.530> fit<00:03:19.829> into<00:03:20.040> it

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
too big this bottle won't fit into it

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.500 
too big this bottle won't fit into it
very<00:03:20.549> well<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.530> I'll<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:22.859> drop<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.730> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
main warming chamber and this is the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.340 
main warming chamber and this is the
lift<00:03:28.410> out<00:03:28.590> basket<00:03:29.100> as<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.579> see<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:31.200> can

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
lift out basket as you can see you can

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.099 
lift out basket as you can see you can
load<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.859> way<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.720> put<00:03:33.720> it<00:03:33.840> into<00:03:34.019> the

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
load it that way just put it into the

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.590 
load it that way just put it into the
lift<00:03:34.290> out<00:03:34.470> basket<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.130> drop<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.820> down<00:03:35.850> into

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
lift out basket and drop it down into

lift out basket and drop it down into
the<00:03:37.670> warming<00:03:38.670> chamber<00:03:39.109> this<00:03:40.109> thing<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.500> pretty

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
the warming chamber this thing is pretty

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.830 
the warming chamber this thing is pretty
much<00:03:40.890> all<00:03:41.190> automatic<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.239> just<00:03:42.570> have<00:03:42.720> this

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
much all automatic so you just have this

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.400 
much all automatic so you just have this
one<00:03:42.900> button<00:03:43.470> here<00:03:43.769> you<00:03:44.579> press<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:46.290> then

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
one button here you press it and then

00:03:46.410 --> 00:04:07.839 
one button here you press it and then
you<00:03:46.530> wait

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.910

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
steam coming up but there's definitely

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.400 
steam coming up but there's definitely
some<00:04:30.150> bubbling<00:04:31.040> down<00:04:32.040> there<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:33.200> it's<00:04:34.200> pretty

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
anyone messing with this thing we just

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.610 
anyone messing with this thing we just
let<00:04:39.930> let<00:04:40.260> that<00:04:40.410> sit<00:04:40.740> for<00:04:40.770> about<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.130> minute<00:04:42.620> then

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
let let that sit for about a minute then

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.700 
let let that sit for about a minute then
after<00:04:43.950> that<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.520> can<00:04:45.290> kind<00:04:46.290> of<00:04:46.380> swish<00:04:46.590> it

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
after that you can kind of swish it

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.280 
after that you can kind of swish it
around<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:47.070> feel<00:04:47.250> how<00:04:47.460> how<00:04:47.760> warm<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.210> is<00:04:48.330> it's

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
around to feel how how warm it is it's

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.980 
around to feel how how warm it is it's
definitely<00:04:49.500> a<00:04:49.830> warm<00:04:51.050> bottle<00:04:52.050> now<00:04:53.780> one<00:04:54.780> way<00:04:54.930> to

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
definitely a warm bottle now one way to

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.960 
definitely a warm bottle now one way to
test<00:04:55.290> if<00:04:55.500> it's<00:04:55.650> an<00:04:55.770> appropriate<00:04:56.130> temperature

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
test if it's an appropriate temperature

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.080 
test if it's an appropriate temperature
is<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.690> put<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.229> few<00:04:58.500> drops<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.580> milk<00:04:59.820> on

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
is to put a few drops of the milk on
