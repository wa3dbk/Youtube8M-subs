00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.130 
strangers wouldn't be able get me today
okay<00:02:14.560> yeah<00:02:14.950> well<00:02:15.880> when<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.240> watched<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.900> think

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
okay yeah well when I watched I think

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.840 
okay yeah well when I watched I think
with<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.290> way<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.650> get<00:02:18.100> back<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> think<00:02:18.730> you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
with a way to get back I think you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.120 
with a way to get back I think you
should<00:02:19.030> try<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.360> do<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.600> really<00:02:20.110> clean<00:02:20.530> show<00:02:20.860> now

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.040 
should try to do a really clean show now
I<00:02:21.340> think<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.850> would<00:02:22.030> go<00:02:22.180> back<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.600> that<00:02:22.750> if

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
I think that I would go back to that if

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.280 
I think that I would go back to that if
I<00:02:23.170> was<00:02:23.290> creating<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.709> show<00:02:23.890> like<00:02:24.250> something

like once it's been done you know what I

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.160

the<00:02:44.260> beginning<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.680> try<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.190> think<00:02:45.370> it'd<00:02:45.459> be

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
the beginning to try it I think it'd be

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.699 
the beginning to try it I think it'd be
hard<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.910> do<00:02:46.030> something<00:02:46.239> like<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.540> but<00:02:46.959> it

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
hard to do something like that but it

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.740 
hard to do something like that but it
may<00:02:47.860> be<00:02:47.890> out<00:02:48.100> long<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.610> don't<00:02:48.670> know<00:02:48.880> yeah<00:02:49.180> well<00:02:49.720> I

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
may be out long I don't know yeah well I

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.580 
may be out long I don't know yeah well I
think<00:02:49.959> one<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.170> best<00:02:50.290> shows<00:02:50.470> that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
think one of the best shows that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.320 
think one of the best shows that
