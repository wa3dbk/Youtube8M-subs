00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
evening light and by using the long lens

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.840 
evening light and by using the long lens
and<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.540> wide<00:03:54.810> aperture<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.620> can<00:03:56.010> separate<00:03:56.640> it

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
and a wide aperture I can separate it

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.490 
and a wide aperture I can separate it
from<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.090> background<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.840> means<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.350> can

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
from the background that means I can

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.170

made the background a bit blurry but

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.110 
made the background a bit blurry but
what's<00:04:00.780> most<00:04:01.020> important<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.430> majority<00:04:02.850> of

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
the light is behind the bike and it

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.229 
the light is behind the bike and it
brings<00:04:06.630> up<00:04:06.870> all<00:04:07.019> those<00:04:07.170> little<00:04:07.320> sparkles<00:04:08.239> and

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
like as pretty as this one this one is a

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.840 
like as pretty as this one this one is a
honey<00:04:34.050> so<00:04:34.860> let's<00:04:35.010> just<00:04:35.190> turn<00:04:35.340> around<00:04:35.520> like

honey so let's just turn around like

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.690 
honey so let's just turn around like
that<00:04:36.650> so<00:04:37.650> we've<00:04:37.800> now<00:04:37.890> got<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.160> light<00:04:38.310> straight

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
that so we've now got the light straight

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.050 
that so we've now got the light straight
onto<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.030> side<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.830> I'll<00:04:41.460> just<00:04:41.610> take<00:04:41.729> a<00:04:41.790> shot

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
personally I think I'm going to prefer

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.900 
personally I think I'm going to prefer
the<00:04:50.400> one<00:04:50.780> with<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.870> backlight<00:04:52.669> let's<00:04:53.669> just

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
the one with the backlight let's just

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.690 
the one with the backlight let's just
shoot<00:04:54.090> that<00:04:54.150> one<00:04:55.010> yeah<00:04:58.100> we<00:04:59.100> flick<00:04:59.340> between<00:04:59.490> the

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
shoot that one yeah we flick between the

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.830 
shoot that one yeah we flick between the
two<00:05:00.590> personally<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.620> much<00:05:02.130> prefer<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:03.539> earlier

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
two personally I much prefer the earlier

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.080 
two personally I much prefer the earlier
shot<00:05:04.169> with<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.890> light<00:05:05.070> coming<00:05:05.340> in<00:05:05.550> behind<00:05:05.669> it

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
shot with the light coming in behind it

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.000 
shot with the light coming in behind it
so<00:05:06.450> get<00:05:06.630> out<00:05:06.750> there<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.050> go<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.590> play<00:05:07.800> with<00:05:07.979> it

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
so get out there and go and play with it

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.480 
so get out there and go and play with it
something<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:08.820> remember<00:05:09.090> if<00:05:09.479> you're<00:05:09.750> shooting

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
something to remember if you're shooting

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.310 
something to remember if you're shooting
against<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.580> light<00:05:11.789> sometimes<00:05:12.660> your<00:05:12.930> cameras

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
against the light sometimes your cameras

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.170 
against the light sometimes your cameras
light<00:05:13.530> meter<00:05:13.560> may<00:05:14.190> get<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.669> little<00:05:15.030> bit

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
light meter may get a little bit

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.480 
light meter may get a little bit
confused<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:16.110> create<00:05:16.800> a<00:05:16.830> silhouette<00:05:17.250> will

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
confused and create a silhouette will

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.820 
confused and create a silhouette will
make<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.729> picture<00:05:18.060> too<00:05:18.300> dark<00:05:18.600> so<00:05:18.930> always<00:05:19.560> have

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
make the picture too dark so always have

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.130 
make the picture too dark so always have
a<00:05:19.890> look<00:05:20.039> at<00:05:20.130> your<00:05:20.250> histogram<00:05:20.700> and<00:05:21.140> increase

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
a look at your histogram and increase

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.350 
a look at your histogram and increase
the<00:05:22.350> exposure<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.950> bit<00:05:23.190> if<00:05:23.370> it<00:05:23.550> does<00:05:23.820> look<00:05:24.120> too

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
the exposure a bit if it does look too

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.630 
the exposure a bit if it does look too
