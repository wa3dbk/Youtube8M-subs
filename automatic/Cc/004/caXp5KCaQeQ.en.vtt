my<00:02:38.470> energy<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.070> he<00:02:39.190> didn't<00:02:39.430> do<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.640> either

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
my energy but he didn't do that either

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.960 
my energy but he didn't do that either
he<00:02:40.960> was<00:02:41.320> sucking<00:02:41.620> my<00:02:41.770> up<00:02:42.130> my<00:02:42.310> energy<00:02:42.520> by

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
he was sucking my up my energy by

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.190 
he was sucking my up my energy by
punching<00:02:43.570> me<00:02:43.780> or<00:02:44.130> doing<00:02:45.130> any<00:02:45.280> attacks<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:46.030> me

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
punching me or doing any attacks on me

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.880 
punching me or doing any attacks on me
that<00:02:47.200> was<00:02:47.320> really<00:02:47.680> bad<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:49.870> got<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.410> can't

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
that was really bad and we got a I can't

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:30.480 
that was really bad and we got a I can't
believe<00:02:51.130> it

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.180 

he<00:03:31.490> gives<00:03:31.730> your<00:03:32.350> gives<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.440> energy<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:34.040> you

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
he gives your gives you energy to you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.280 
he gives your gives you energy to you
right<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:34.790> that's<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.090> good<00:03:35.360> addition

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
right so that's a good addition

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.440 
right so that's a good addition
all<00:03:36.920> right<00:03:37.100> continuing<00:03:37.760> on<00:03:37.910> with<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.270> main

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
all right continuing on with the main

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.330 
all right continuing on with the main
storyline<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:39.410> guess<00:03:39.770> it<00:03:39.920> splits<00:03:40.340> off<00:03:40.640> into
