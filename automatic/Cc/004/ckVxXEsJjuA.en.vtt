 hello youtube friends my name is 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:29.840
 fences power and this is a new tutorial 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.760
 and today we are going to learn how to find 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.390
 iron 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.990
 carbon 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.300
 and gravel 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.350
 in the previous video that I showed him about 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.309
 the gravel 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.309
 a way 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.460
 so they know 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.719
 how to find everything now 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.719
 what are we going to look for 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.040
 let us begin 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.890
 good what I know 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.620
 is that gravel and coal are available 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.980
 in the caves in the high places 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.510
 also from the mountains 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.510
 we found the carbon 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.690
 I already have the coal 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.430
 with coal 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.430
 you can snack with 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.979
 with the wooden beak 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.979
 of stone 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.600
 and 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.600
 You can also snack with 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.870
 with all the itching with everything that is 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.650
 very easy 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.650
 what yes 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.310
 it gets a bit more complicated 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.810
 with forgiveness 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.149
 that's why it gets a bit more complicated 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.149
 with iron with iron 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.460
 yes the iron 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:12.440
 it is itched with the wooden one not with the beak 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.010
 of wood but with the peak 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.890
 d 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.510
 stone with faeces and then with everything 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.510
 the rest but the wood does not 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.190
 good as the farm 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.930
 very cute 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.670

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.160
 yes I can 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.300
 and here 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.300
 eternity 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.630
 I love doing every connect with the 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.470
 harrow 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.750
 is the mountain and the sack the block of 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.960
 stone laying 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.810
 of all 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.810
 good to find iron 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.330
 for me very easy I do not know 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.880
 you have to make common 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:19.370
 7 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:22.220
 u 8 blocks down itching 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.180
 and then the whole a house 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.030
 underground to find 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.330
 to find 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.200
 the good iron the gradation is achieved 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.420
 also in 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.420
 in the caves making tunnels 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.170
 for me 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.170
 it's not that hard to find 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.870
 Let's see 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.160
 we found iron more or less here 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.920
 we started to chop and turn coal and 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.100
 keep in the iron so if you can 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.100
