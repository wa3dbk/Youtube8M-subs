Lengths program I ended up selecting

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.480 
Lengths program I ended up selecting
them<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:10.479> just<00:01:10.990> I<00:01:11.170> liked<00:01:11.409> the<00:01:11.590> program<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.310> they

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
them I just I liked the program and they

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.700 
them I just I liked the program and they
make<00:01:12.700> wigs<00:01:12.970> for<00:01:13.299> free<00:01:13.509> for<00:01:14.110> women<00:01:14.409> that<00:01:14.560> have

lost their hair due to cancer treatments

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.410 
lost their hair due to cancer treatments
and<00:01:17.320> so<00:01:17.980> I<00:01:18.010> just<00:01:18.280> thought<00:01:18.430> it<00:01:18.490> was<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:19.090> really

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
and so I just thought it was a really

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.350 
and so I just thought it was a really
great<00:01:19.870> cause<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:20.800> I'm<00:01:21.490> very<00:01:21.790> excited<00:01:22.270> about

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
great cause and I'm very excited about

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.000 
great cause and I'm very excited about
this<00:01:22.720> is<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:22.960> first<00:01:23.140> time<00:01:23.290> I'm<00:01:23.380> doing<00:01:23.590> my<00:01:23.800> hair

this is the first time I'm doing my hair

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.310 
this is the first time I'm doing my hair
so<00:01:24.220> I'm<00:01:24.310> actually<00:01:24.520> very<00:01:24.909> nervous<00:01:25.320> because

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
so I'm actually very nervous because

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.360 
so I'm actually very nervous because
even<00:01:26.740> though<00:01:26.830> it's<00:01:26.980> something<00:01:27.220> I've<00:01:27.340> been

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
getting quite a bit cut off obviously

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.770 
getting quite a bit cut off obviously
and<00:01:37.900> so<00:01:38.940> any<00:01:39.940> other<00:01:40.120> time<00:01:40.360> I've<00:01:40.600> had<00:01:40.750> short

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
and so any other time I've had short

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.260 
and so any other time I've had short
hair<00:01:41.080> before<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:41.560> I<00:01:41.830> love<00:01:42.070> short<00:01:42.280> hair<00:01:42.370> but

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
hair before and I love short hair but

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.670 
hair before and I love short hair but
I've<00:01:43.420> always<00:01:43.600> kind<00:01:43.750> of<00:01:43.930> incrementally

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
I've always kind of incrementally

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.080 
I've always kind of incrementally
brought<00:01:44.920> my<00:01:45.070> hair<00:01:45.280> up<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:45.760> would<00:01:45.909> be<00:01:46.000> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
brought my hair up so this would be the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.789 
brought my hair up so this would be the
first<00:01:46.330> time<00:01:46.479> I've<00:01:46.630> ever<00:01:46.690> done<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:47.110> super<00:01:47.620> long

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799
