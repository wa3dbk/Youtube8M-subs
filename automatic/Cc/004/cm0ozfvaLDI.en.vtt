00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
how to reverse out of car parks all

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
how to reverse out of car parks all
right<00:00:14.509> now<00:00:15.830> say<00:00:16.830> you've<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.580> got<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> forward

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
right now say you've just got a forward

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.380 
right now say you've just got a forward
pipe<00:00:18.240> into<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.720> car<00:00:18.990> park<00:00:19.230> from<00:00:19.380> your<00:00:19.500> test<00:00:20.390> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
pipe into a car park from your test and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.330 
pipe into a car park from your test and
you<00:00:21.900> want<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> be<00:00:22.289> able<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.560> reverse<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:23.130> on

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
you want to be able to reverse out on

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.970 
you want to be able to reverse out on
the<00:00:23.430> correct<00:00:23.789> side<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.510> road<00:00:24.830> all<00:00:25.830> right

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the correct side of the road all right

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.310 
the correct side of the road all right
so<00:00:26.160> how<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.449> find<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.080> center

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
so how we do that is you find the center

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.980 
so how we do that is you find the center
of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> road<00:00:28.830> then<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.330> from<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
of the road then then you from the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
of the road then then you from the
center<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> road<00:00:31.710> that's<00:00:31.980> one<00:00:32.430> meter<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
center of the road that's one meter and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.190 
center of the road that's one meter and
a<00:00:33.510> quarter<00:00:34.280> from<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.520> center<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.239> road<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
a quarter from the center of the road so

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100 
a quarter from the center of the road so
we<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:37.649> reverse<00:00:38.149> my<00:00:39.149> car<00:00:39.510> babe<00:00:39.750> we'll

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
we know reverse my car babe we'll

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.020 
we know reverse my car babe we'll
reverse<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> vehicle<00:00:41.010> back<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.520> meter<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.969> a
