00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 if you

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.799 
3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 if you
notice<00:00:58.309> I<00:00:58.430> threw<00:00:58.670> in<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:58.909> basic<00:00:59.390> so<00:00:59.570> that<00:00:59.690> we're

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
notice I threw in a basic so that we're

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.680 
notice I threw in a basic so that we're
not<00:00:59.899> just<00:00:59.960> turning<00:01:00.500> constantly<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:02.359> hand

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
not just turning constantly and the hand

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.840 
not just turning constantly and the hand
will<00:01:03.109> wind<00:01:03.410> up<00:01:03.590> tangled<00:01:03.949> on<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.460> outside

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
will wind up tangled on the outside

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.389 
will wind up tangled on the outside
basic<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:05.780> if<00:01:05.869> we<00:01:06.020> watch<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.440> hand<00:01:06.710> one<00:01:07.039> time

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
basic so if we watch the hand one time

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.270 
basic so if we watch the hand one time
there's<00:01:08.149> the<00:01:08.420> rock<00:01:08.600> as<00:01:08.960> we're<00:01:09.590> stepping<00:01:09.920> I'm

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
there's the rock as we're stepping I'm

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.520 
there's the rock as we're stepping I'm
letting<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.670> fingers<00:01:11.000> kind<00:01:11.179> of<00:01:11.420> roll<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:12.080> you

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
letting the fingers kind of roll and you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.680 
letting the fingers kind of roll and you
wind<00:01:12.740> up<00:01:12.860> with<00:01:13.009> an<00:01:13.190> over-the-top<00:01:13.759> look<00:01:14.270> here

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
wind up with an over-the-top look here

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.550 
wind up with an over-the-top look here
I'm<00:01:14.929> quickly<00:01:15.649> fixing<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:16.929> by<00:01:17.929> rolling<00:01:18.229> across

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
I'm quickly fixing it by rolling across

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.219 
I'm quickly fixing it by rolling across
and<00:01:19.160> under<00:01:20.979> here<00:01:22.270> one<00:01:23.270> other<00:01:23.479> way<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:23.750> fix<00:01:24.050> it

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
and under here one other way to fix it

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.109 
and under here one other way to fix it
if<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.500> wind<00:01:24.710> up<00:01:24.860> in<00:01:25.009> this<00:01:25.160> position<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:25.910> just

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
if you wind up in this position is just

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.350 
if you wind up in this position is just
do<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.420> inside<00:01:26.990> turn<00:01:27.789> and<00:01:28.789> that<00:01:28.970> takes<00:01:29.210> you

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
do the inside turn and that takes you

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.160 
do the inside turn and that takes you
about<00:01:29.920> yeah<00:01:33.910> so<00:01:34.910> here's<00:01:35.179> some<00:01:35.660> pointers<00:01:35.989> for

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
about yeah so here's some pointers for

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.809 
about yeah so here's some pointers for
the<00:01:36.229> ladies<00:01:36.500> especially<00:01:36.860> for<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.429> outside

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
the ladies especially for the outside

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.830 
the ladies especially for the outside
turn<00:01:39.310> unlike<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.429> inside<00:01:40.789> turn<00:01:41.000> your<00:01:41.360> punch

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
turn unlike the inside turn your punch

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.499 
turn unlike the inside turn your punch
balancing<00:01:42.470> on<00:01:42.649> one<00:01:42.709> leg<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:44.090> if<00:01:44.179> we<00:01:44.239> can<00:01:44.360> show

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
balancing on one leg so if we can show

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.550 
balancing on one leg so if we can show
it<00:01:44.599> really<00:01:44.750> quick<00:01:45.050> I<00:01:46.179> step<00:01:47.179> on<00:01:47.390> my<00:01:47.720> right<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.470> I

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
it really quick I step on my right and I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.999 
it really quick I step on my right and I
have<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:49.009> get<00:01:49.250> around<00:01:49.550> on<00:01:50.420> that<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.679> what<00:01:51.800> I<00:01:51.860> do

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
have to get around on that so what I do

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.169 
have to get around on that so what I do
is<00:01:52.429> I<00:01:52.610> squeeze<00:01:53.060> my<00:01:54.050> thighs<00:01:54.679> together<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:56.030> help

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
is I squeeze my thighs together to help

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.580 
is I squeeze my thighs together to help
balance<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.959> I<00:01:57.259> kind<00:01:57.530> of<00:01:57.649> drag<00:01:58.039> my<00:01:58.910> left<00:01:59.590> so

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
balance and I kind of drag my left so

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.499 
balance and I kind of drag my left so
there's<00:02:00.890> no<00:02:01.099> weight<00:02:01.340> on<00:02:01.369> my<00:02:01.550> left<00:02:01.819> I<00:02:02.000> just<00:02:02.239> drag

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
there's no weight on my left I just drag

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.660 
there's no weight on my left I just drag
it<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:02.929> that<00:02:03.110> it's<00:02:03.379> there<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.039> have<00:02:04.640> a

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
it so that it's there and you have a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.290 
it so that it's there and you have a
little<00:02:04.940> bit<00:02:05.119> more<00:02:05.599> stability<00:02:06.789> very<00:02:07.789> nice

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
little bit more stability very nice

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.020 
little bit more stability very nice
I'll<00:02:08.810> cover<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.679> direction<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.670> turns

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
I'll cover the direction of the turns

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.020 
I'll cover the direction of the turns
for<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.870> inside<00:02:12.319> versus<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.950> outside<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.940> if

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
for the inside versus the outside so if

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.540 
for the inside versus the outside so if
we<00:02:14.180> look<00:02:14.390> at<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.660> inside<00:02:15.290> turn<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:16.160> inside

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
we look at the inside turn the inside

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.940 
we look at the inside turn the inside
turn<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:18.590> turns<00:02:18.950> right<00:02:19.370> away<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:21.260> squares<00:02:21.709> off

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
turn it turns right away and squares off

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.710 
turn it turns right away and squares off
with<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.340> partner<00:02:22.700> let's<00:02:23.300> look<00:02:23.480> at<00:02:23.599> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
with the partner let's look at the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.670 
with the partner let's look at the
outside<00:02:23.900> turn<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.550> outside<00:02:25.940> turn<00:02:26.780> squares

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
outside turn so the outside turn squares

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
outside turn so the outside turn squares
off<00:02:27.950> with<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.370> partner<00:02:28.790> first

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
off with the partner first

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.140 
off with the partner first
and<00:02:31.260> rotates<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.520> there's<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.820> little<00:02:33.000> bit

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and rotates so there's a little bit

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.000 
and rotates so there's a little bit
different<00:02:33.600> action<00:02:34.020> there<00:02:34.230> take<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> look<00:02:34.830> at

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
different action there take a look at

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.290 
different action there take a look at
the<00:02:35.130> other<00:02:35.250> video<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.820> can<00:02:35.940> see<00:02:36.000> there's

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
the other video and you can see there's

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.950 
the other video and you can see there's
a<00:02:36.360> slight<00:02:36.540> difference<00:02:37.050> as<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.230> how<00:02:37.470> they<00:02:37.710> work
