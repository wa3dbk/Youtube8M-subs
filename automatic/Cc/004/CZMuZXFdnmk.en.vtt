alone<00:00:43.460> studies<00:00:44.460> show<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.730> about<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.450> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
alone studies show that about one and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.600 
alone studies show that about one and
twenty<00:00:46.289> eight<00:00:46.440> people<00:00:46.860> break<00:00:47.070> bones<00:00:47.370> each

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
twenty eight people break bones each

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.080 
twenty eight people break bones each
year<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.870> why<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.230> many<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.559> ask

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
year but why so many you ask

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.380 
year but why so many you ask
consider<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.590> adults<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.910> 206<00:00:53.910> bones<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
consider this adults have 206 bones in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.720 
consider this adults have 206 bones in
their<00:00:54.539> bodies<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.079> more<00:00:56.070> than<00:00:56.219> half<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> them

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
their bodies and more than half of them

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.349 
their bodies and more than half of them
are<00:00:57.120> found<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.510> our<00:00:57.629> hands<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.649> our<00:00:58.770> feet

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
are found in our hands and in our feet

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.910 
are found in our hands and in our feet
so<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.809> how<00:01:00.989> breaking<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.469> bone<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
so you can see how breaking a bone is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.060 
so you can see how breaking a bone is
just<00:01:02.430> an<00:01:02.550> accident<00:01:03.149> waiting<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.449> happen

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
just an accident waiting to happen

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
just an accident waiting to happen
and<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.309> does<00:01:05.519> happen<00:01:05.750> many<00:01:06.750> broken

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and when it does happen many broken

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.310 
and when it does happen many broken
bones<00:01:07.229> require<00:01:07.830> surgery<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> heal<00:01:09.110> this<00:01:10.110> type

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
bones require surgery to heal this type
