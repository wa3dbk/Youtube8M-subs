00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.460 
sheet music if you want to work through
it<00:00:23.820> slowly<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.480> your<00:00:24.539> own<00:00:24.750> time<00:00:24.990> piece<00:00:25.439> by

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it slowly in your own time piece by

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.790 
it slowly in your own time piece by
piece<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.670> free<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.599> why<00:00:28.199> not<00:00:28.349> so

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
piece do that it's free so why not so

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.060 
piece do that it's free so why not so
the<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.340> example<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.750> basic<00:00:31.230> by<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the first example is the basic by and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.209 
the first example is the basic by and
hi-hat<00:00:32.880> swing<00:00:33.300> pattern<00:00:33.540> hopefully<00:00:34.320> you've

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
hi-hat swing pattern hopefully you've

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.770 
hi-hat swing pattern hopefully you've
already<00:00:35.520> got<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.880> down<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.420> some<00:00:36.600> degree

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
already got that down to some degree

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
already got that down to some degree
before<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.320> start<00:00:37.590> tackling<00:00:37.920> these<00:00:38.129> ideas

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
before you start tackling these ideas

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:52.140 
before you start tackling these ideas
just<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> refresh<00:00:39.239> it

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.610 

okay<00:00:53.150> I'm<00:00:53.570> actually<00:00:53.810> going<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.080> skip<00:00:54.380> now<00:00:54.560> to

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
okay I'm actually going to skip now to

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.470 
okay I'm actually going to skip now to
the<00:00:54.860> end<00:00:54.890> example<00:00:55.610> just<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:55.940> pay<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.150> full

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
the end example just to pay the full

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.880 
the end example just to pay the full
pattern<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:56.989> you<00:00:57.050> can<00:00:57.170> get<00:00:57.290> an<00:00:57.410> idea<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.739> the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
pattern so you can get an idea of the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:15.219 
pattern so you can get an idea of the
sound<00:01:12.640> there<00:01:13.640> we<00:01:13.820> have<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.000> alright<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.080> what

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
sound there we have it alright so what

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.510 
sound there we have it alright so what
I've<00:01:15.320> actually<00:01:15.470> done<00:01:15.710> here<00:01:15.920> at<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.100> example

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
I've actually done here at the example

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.580 
I've actually done here at the example
started<00:01:16.940> from<00:01:17.060> number<00:01:17.300> two<00:01:17.510> is<00:01:17.869> I've<00:01:18.320> split

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
started from number two is I've split

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.830 
started from number two is I've split
each<00:01:18.920> quarter<00:01:19.490> know<00:01:19.610> each<00:01:19.910> beat<00:01:20.330> of<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.630> bar

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
each quarter know each beat of the bar

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.340 
each quarter know each beat of the bar
into<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.830> separate<00:01:22.369> example<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:23.570> then<00:01:24.110> just

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
into a separate example and then just

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.800 
into a separate example and then just
loop<00:01:24.590> that<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.820> can<00:01:25.970> see<00:01:26.090> in<00:01:26.180> example<00:01:26.600> 2

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
loop that so you can see in example 2

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.570 
loop that so you can see in example 2
it's<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.259> first<00:01:27.470> beat<00:01:27.860> from<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.399> full

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
it's the first beat from the full

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.090 
it's the first beat from the full
pattern<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:29.780> just<00:01:29.930> repeated<00:01:30.440> it<00:01:30.530> four

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
pattern and I just repeated it four

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.490 
pattern and I just repeated it four
times<00:01:31.430> just<00:01:32.240> so<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.570> really<00:01:32.869> work<00:01:33.259> on

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
times just so you can really work on

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.930 
times just so you can really work on
each<00:01:33.649> bit<00:01:33.890> slowly<00:01:34.160> if<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:34.520> want<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.729> do<00:01:34.850> it

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
each bit slowly if you want to do it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.270 
each bit slowly if you want to do it
that<00:01:35.090> way<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:35.780> that<00:01:35.810> first<00:01:36.170> example<00:01:36.830> simply

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
that way so that first example simply

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:51.860 
that way so that first example simply
goes<00:01:37.610> pride<00:01:38.030> snare<00:01:38.660> fate<00:01:39.140> as<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.500> trip

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.210 

you<00:01:52.870> know<00:01:52.960> work<00:01:53.290> on<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.650> if<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.830> want<00:01:54.070> just

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
you know work on that if you want just

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.800 
you know work on that if you want just
go<00:01:54.430> slowly<00:01:54.790> until<00:01:55.120> you've<00:01:55.240> got<00:01:55.420> comfortable

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
go slowly until you've got comfortable

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.310 
go slowly until you've got comfortable
with<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.430> second<00:01:57.430> example<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:58.270> it's<00:01:58.750> been<00:01:58.960> two

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
with it second example is it's been two

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.470 
with it second example is it's been two
of<00:01:59.620> the<00:01:59.740> full<00:01:59.950> pattern<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.850> you've<00:02:01.060> got<00:02:01.090> a<00:02:01.300> high

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
of the full pattern so you've got a high

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.260 
of the full pattern so you've got a high
hat<00:02:01.690> on<00:02:01.840> there<00:02:02.080> on<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.190> first<00:02:03.310> part<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.850> its

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
hat on there on the first part and its

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:20.320 
hat on there on the first part and its
high<00:02:04.660> hat<00:02:04.840> ride<00:02:05.080> snare<00:02:05.710> based<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.340> what

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.290 

beautiful<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:22.470> next<00:02:22.950> example<00:02:23.340> example<00:02:23.640> for

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
beautiful the next example example for

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.120 
beautiful the next example example for
is<00:02:24.570> beat<00:02:24.840> three<00:02:25.230> from<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> full<00:02:25.740> patterns

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
is beat three from the full patterns

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.250 
is beat three from the full patterns
we've<00:02:26.310> got<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.520> rider<00:02:26.730> base<00:02:27.090> then<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.750> ghosted

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
we've got a rider base then to ghosted

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:40.310 
we've got a rider base then to ghosted
snares<00:02:38.150> now<00:02:39.150> if<00:02:39.300> you<00:02:39.450> actually<00:02:39.630> look<00:02:39.870> at<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
snares now if you actually look at the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.200 
snares now if you actually look at the
full<00:02:40.560> pattern<00:02:40.830> number<00:02:41.070> five<00:02:41.400> example<00:02:42.000> 5

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
full pattern number five example 5

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.840 
full pattern number five example 5
you'll<00:02:42.960> notice<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.410> actually<00:02:44.010> beat<00:02:44.220> too<00:02:44.520> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
you'll notice that actually beat too and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.730 
you'll notice that actually beat too and
before<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.870> same<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.470> we've<00:02:46.620> already

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
before are the same so we've already

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.530 
before are the same so we've already
covered<00:02:47.010> before<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.910> already<00:02:48.150> done<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.330> bit<00:02:48.510> of

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
covered before you already done a bit of

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.210 
covered before you already done a bit of
work<00:02:48.750> there<00:02:50.750> so<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.780> play<00:02:52.170> all<00:02:52.440> four<00:02:52.740> parts

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
work there so to play all four parts

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:08.650 
work there so to play all four parts
together<00:02:53.400> they're<00:02:53.880> slowly
