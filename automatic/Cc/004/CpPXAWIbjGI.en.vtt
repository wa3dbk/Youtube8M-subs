00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
there is another command for that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.449 
there is another command for that
let's<00:02:38.490> place<00:02:38.910> down<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.450> detector<00:02:39.840> wheel

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
let's place down the detector wheel

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.660 
let's place down the detector wheel
block<00:02:41.459> above<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.880> or<00:02:42.980> yeah<00:02:44.040> block<00:02:44.310> off<00:02:44.489> with

block above it or yeah block off with
oil<00:02:45.600> at<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.780> block<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.410> /or<00:02:47.400> CM<00:02:47.850> had<00:02:48.500> this

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
oil at the block and on /or CM had this

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.840 
oil at the block and on /or CM had this
is<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.010> end<00:02:50.130> point<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.550> rollercoaster

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
is the end point of the rollercoaster

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.790 
is the end point of the rollercoaster
does<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.390> end<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.739> then<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.130> name<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.670> end

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
does it end and then the name is end

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.050 
does it end and then the name is end
point<00:02:57.290> that's<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:58.950> okay

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
point that's like this okay

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.000 
point that's like this okay

and now if you fire that comment so rzm
start<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.500> then<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.650> names<00:03:10.950> be<00:03:11.310> point<00:03:12.530> it's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
start and then the names be point it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.650 
start and then the names be point it's
gonna<00:03:13.739> delete<00:03:14.130> all<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.550> minecarts<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.269> radius

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
gonna delete all the minecarts in radius

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.840 
gonna delete all the minecarts in radius
of<00:03:15.780> four<00:03:16.019> blocks<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.800> was<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.900> first<00:03:18.900> and

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
of four blocks so this was the first and

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.990 
of four blocks so this was the first and
so

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.040 

if<00:03:25.420> we<00:03:25.720> have<00:03:25.870> done<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.230> under<00:03:26.410> nice<00:03:27.100> no<00:03:28.000> he'll

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.410 

so<00:03:32.050> if<00:03:32.230> we<00:03:32.380> done<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:33.070> right<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.760> should<00:03:33.820> lead

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
so if we done it right it should lead

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.530 
so if we done it right it should lead
this<00:03:34.570> one<00:03:34.780> cuts<00:03:35.020> our<00:03:35.530> cm<00:03:36.480> start<00:03:37.480> at<00:03:38.380> each<00:03:38.680> point

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
this one cuts our cm start at each point

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.290 
this one cuts our cm start at each point
and<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.960> deletes<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.590> one<00:03:41.740> guard<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:43.090> best

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
and it deletes the one guard the best

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.180 
and it deletes the one guard the best
part<00:03:43.540> about<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.930> thing<00:03:44.140> is<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:44.410> we<00:03:44.560> can<00:03:44.800> just

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
part about the thing is that we can just

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.000 
part about the thing is that we can just
erase<00:03:45.930> yuppie<00:03:48.990> further<00:03:49.990> comment<00:03:50.410> with<00:03:50.680> a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
erase yuppie further comment with a

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.400 
erase yuppie further comment with a
detector<00:03:51.580> will<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.390> if<00:03:52.600> we<00:03:52.780> do<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.050> and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
detector will so if we do this and

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.820 
detector will so if we do this and
command<00:03:53.830> look<00:03:54.030> beneath<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.270> our<00:03:56.140> cm<00:03:56.820> star<00:03:57.820> at

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
command look beneath it our cm star at

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:06.570 
command look beneath it our cm star at
each<00:03:59.830> point<00:04:01.860> let's<00:04:02.860> cover<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:03.340> up<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:05.310> now<00:04:06.310> this

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
each point let's cover it up so now this

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.810 
each point let's cover it up so now this
is<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:06.910> this<00:04:07.600> is<00:04:07.660> our<00:04:07.900> rollercoaster<00:04:08.820> spawn

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
is this this is our rollercoaster spawn

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.750 
is this this is our rollercoaster spawn
a<00:04:09.850> card<00:04:10.290> enter<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.410> right<00:04:13.020> then<00:04:14.610> it<00:04:15.610> it

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
a card enter it right then it it

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.110 
a card enter it right then it it
automatically<00:04:16.739> just<00:04:17.739> deletes<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.730> minecart

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
automatically just deletes the minecart

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.380 
automatically just deletes the minecart
and<00:04:19.299> put<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:20.200> on<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.470> ground<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.970> can<00:04:22.150> just

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
and put you on the ground you can just

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
for this you're recommends there are our

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.330 
for this you're recommends there are our
our<00:04:29.590> CM<00:04:30.310> remove<00:04:31.240> now<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.810> names<00:04:32.260> says<00:04:32.950> what<00:04:33.220> it

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
our CM remove now the names says what it

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.760 
our CM remove now the names says what it
does<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.730> removes<00:04:33.970> one<00:04:34.480> of<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.660> points<00:04:35.020> and

does it removes one of the points and

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.650 
does it removes one of the points and
then<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:36.669> have<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:37.000> list<00:04:37.480> command<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:39.660> that

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
then you have the list command and that

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.650 
then you have the list command and that
