in<00:00:17.900> this<00:00:18.900> video<00:00:19.199> we'll<00:00:19.470> use<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.800> transparency

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
in this video we'll use the transparency

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.099 
in this video we'll use the transparency
Channel<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> refraction<00:00:21.689> setting<00:00:21.990> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
Channel and the refraction setting to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.290 
Channel and the refraction setting to
create<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.410> glass<00:00:22.680> surface<00:00:22.949> let's<00:00:23.939> start<00:00:24.180> by

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
create a glass surface let's start by

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.349 
create a glass surface let's start by

creating a new material go to create new
material<00:00:28.609> let's<00:00:29.609> rename<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.060> material

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
material let's rename this material

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.990 
material let's rename this material

glass go ahead and double-click to open
up<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:33.420> material<00:00:34.340> I'm<00:00:36.020> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.110> turn<00:00:37.320> off

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
up your material I'm going to turn off

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.530 
up your material I'm going to turn off
the<00:00:37.800> color<00:00:38.070> channel<00:00:38.550> because<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the color channel because this is a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.360 
the color channel because this is a
transparent<00:00:40.200> object<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.950> getting<00:00:41.160> most

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
transparent object and it's getting most

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.450 
transparent object and it's getting most
of<00:00:41.520> its<00:00:41.670> light<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.360> from<00:00:42.510> its<00:00:42.600> transparency

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
of its light just from its transparency

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.979 
of its light just from its transparency
I'm<00:00:44.460> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:44.760> turn<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.120> transparency<00:00:45.750> by

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
I'm going to now turn on transparency by

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.090 
I'm going to now turn on transparency by
clicking<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> check<00:00:46.590> mark<00:00:46.620> next<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.069 
clicking on the check mark next to
transparency<00:00:47.879> next<00:00:48.390> let's<00:00:48.570> adjust<00:00:48.870> our

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
transparency next let's adjust our

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
transparency next let's adjust our
specular<00:00:49.680> settings<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.430> click<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
specular settings so click on the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.729 
specular settings so click on the
specular<00:00:51.180> channel<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.660> let's<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.530> ahead

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
specular channel and let's just go ahead

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.139 
specular channel and let's just go ahead
and<00:00:52.860> bring<00:00:53.010> down<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> width<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and bring down the width because this is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.000 
and bring down the width because this is
a<00:00:54.180> hard<00:00:54.420> surface<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.110> increase<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> height

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
a hard surface and increase the height

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.869 
a hard surface and increase the height
depending<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.100> your<00:00:59.190> scene<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.460> may<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.850> fact

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
depending on your scene you may in fact

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.250 
depending on your scene you may in fact
be<00:01:00.180> able<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.420> turn<00:01:00.600> off<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> specular

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
be able to turn off the specular

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.750 
be able to turn off the specular
altogether<00:01:01.680> now<00:01:02.129> let's<00:01:02.309> go<00:01:02.399> back<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
altogether now let's go back to the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.240 
altogether now let's go back to the
transparency<00:01:03.270> channel<00:01:04.129> inside<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
transparency channel inside of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.830 
transparency channel inside of
transparency<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> setting<00:01:06.630> called

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
transparency is a setting called

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.960 
transparency is a setting called
refraction<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.670> heart

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
refraction and this is really the heart

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.149 
refraction and this is really the heart
of<00:01:09.210> any<00:01:09.630> good<00:01:09.990> transparent<00:01:10.560> material<00:01:10.920> go

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
of any good transparent material go

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.359 
of any good transparent material go
ahead<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.460> set<00:01:11.580> refraction<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> 1.6<00:01:13.070> now<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
ahead and set refraction to 1.6 now you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.580 
ahead and set refraction to 1.6 now you
may<00:01:14.520> wonder<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.810> refraction<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
may wonder one what is refraction and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.429 
may wonder one what is refraction and
two<00:01:17.340> where<00:01:17.790> did<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.000> number<00:01:18.210> come<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:18.840> well

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
two where did that number come from well

the<00:01:30.810> manual<00:01:31.250> first<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.490> see<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> list<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.270> useful

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the manual first I see a list of useful

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.670 
the manual first I see a list of useful
refraction<00:01:34.500> values<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.030> these<00:01:36.270> is

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
refraction values and one of these is

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.350 
refraction values and one of these is
glass<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> glass<00:01:38.970> has<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
glass and we see the glass has a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.929 
glass and we see the glass has a
refraction<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.990> somewhere<00:01:40.380> between<00:01:40.610> 1.44<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
refraction of somewhere between 1.44 and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.450 
refraction of somewhere between 1.44 and
1.9<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.170> chose<00:01:43.350> 1.6<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.310> it's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
1.9 I just chose 1.6 because it's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.880 
1.9 I just chose 1.6 because it's
somewhere<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.820> middle<00:01:45.140> now<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.619> want

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
somewhere in the middle now if we want

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.889 
somewhere in the middle now if we want
we<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.250> also<00:01:47.399> take<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> look<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.299> what

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
we can also take a look at what

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.690 
we can also take a look at what
refraction<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.159> there's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> little

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
refraction is and there's a little

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.600 
refraction is and there's a little
illustration<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.680> imagine<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.950> arrow<00:01:53.250> is

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
air which as far as we're concerned

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.009 
air which as far as we're concerned
doesn't<00:02:10.800> really<00:02:11.009> bend<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.400> light<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:11.760> all

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.449 

now<00:02:16.019> back<00:02:16.439> in<00:02:16.620> our<00:02:16.709> scene<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:17.159> we've<00:02:17.310> created

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
now back in our scene here we've created

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.580 
now back in our scene here we've created
a<00:02:17.819> glass<00:02:18.209> material<00:02:18.420> let's<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.110> apply<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.409> to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
a glass material let's just apply it to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.390 
a glass material let's just apply it to
our<00:02:19.769> teapot<00:02:20.189> and<00:02:20.370> give<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.760> render<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:25.400> what

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
our teapot and give it a render and what

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.679 
our teapot and give it a render and what
we<00:02:26.489> get<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.670> something<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.450> it's

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
we get is something like this it's

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.449 
we get is something like this it's
looking<00:02:27.989> pretty<00:02:28.409> good<00:02:28.560> considering<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
looking pretty good considering the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.890 
looking pretty good considering the
amount<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.730> effort<00:02:29.909> that<00:02:30.090> we've<00:02:30.299> put<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.599> now

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
amount of effort that we've put in now

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.679 
amount of effort that we've put in now
the<00:02:31.290> issues<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.159> I'm<00:02:32.370> seeing<00:02:32.700> are<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.420> lot<00:02:33.659> of

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
the issues that I'm seeing are a lot of

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.809 
the issues that I'm seeing are a lot of
aliasing<00:02:34.470> at<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.680> tops<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.220> bottoms<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.700> my

aliasing at the tops and bottoms of my

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.729 
aliasing at the tops and bottoms of my
teapot<00:02:36.239> basically<00:02:36.989> those<00:02:37.140> areas<00:02:37.530> where

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
teapot basically those areas where

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.770 
teapot basically those areas where
there's<00:02:37.859> a<00:02:37.920> lot<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.430> refraction<00:02:39.209> sort<00:02:39.689> of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
there's a lot of refraction sort of

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.720 
there's a lot of refraction sort of
piling<00:02:40.140> up<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.349> top<00:02:40.409> of<00:02:40.739> itself<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.280> order<00:02:41.579> to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
piling up on top of itself in order to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.729 
piling up on top of itself in order to
improve<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.780> look<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.049> all<00:02:43.260> transparent

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
improve the look of all transparent

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.470 
improve the look of all transparent
materials<00:02:44.220> what<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.549> need<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.819> do<00:02:44.939> is<00:02:45.150> go<00:02:45.329> into

down the render of anything else which

down the render of anything else which
is<00:03:36.359> quite<00:03:36.629> nice<00:03:36.870> now<00:03:37.139> for<00:03:38.099> me<00:03:38.190> this<00:03:38.459> might<00:03:38.849> be<00:03:39.000> a

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
is quite nice now for me this might be a

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.030 
is quite nice now for me this might be a
little<00:03:39.209> bit<00:03:39.389> too<00:03:39.629> slow<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.440> continue

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
little bit too slow so you can continue

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.469 
little bit too slow so you can continue
to<00:03:41.129> play<00:03:41.220> around<00:03:41.459> with<00:03:41.579> these<00:03:41.730> settings<00:03:42.000> now

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
to play around with these settings now

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.360 
to play around with these settings now
there<00:03:42.629> are<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.840> couple<00:03:43.019> other<00:03:43.290> settings<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.159> want

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
there are a couple other settings I want

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.270 
there are a couple other settings I want
to<00:03:44.430> show<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.639> in<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.060> glass<00:03:45.269> material<00:03:46.129> one<00:03:47.129> of

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
to show you in the glass material one of

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.899 
to show you in the glass material one of
them<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.699> something<00:03:48.510> called<00:03:48.810> total<00:03:49.620> internal

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
them is something called total internal

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.030 
them is something called total internal
reflections<00:03:50.909> and<00:03:51.209> what<00:03:51.810> this<00:03:51.989> does<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.620> it

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
reflections and what this does is it

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.710 
reflections and what this does is it
allows<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.579> create<00:03:53.760> effects<00:03:54.299> sort<00:03:54.629> of

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
allows you to create effects sort of

trapped<00:03:56.909> inside<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.690> then<00:03:57.959> there's<00:03:58.139> this

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349

these if left on give you a more

these if left on give you a more

remove extraneous reflections and for me

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:10.969 
remove extraneous reflections and for me
exit<00:04:09.870> reflections<00:04:10.349> will<00:04:10.470> do<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.739> that'll

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
exit reflections will do that that'll

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.559 
exit reflections will do that that'll
just<00:04:11.099> sort<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.280> clean<00:04:11.579> up<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.909> appearance<00:04:12.389> of

just sort of clean up the appearance of

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.390 
just sort of clean up the appearance of
your<00:04:13.079> material<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:13.769> I'm<00:04:13.859> going<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.069> turn<00:04:14.220> off

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
your material so I'm going to turn off

your material so I'm going to turn off
exit<00:04:14.760> reflections<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:16.099> let's<00:04:17.099> just<00:04:17.310> do<00:04:17.489> one

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
exit reflections and let's just do one

final<00:04:18.030> render

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.020 

now<00:04:23.770> we<00:04:23.830> did<00:04:24.160> have<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.400> wait<00:04:24.520> a<00:04:24.550> little<00:04:24.820> bit

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
now we did have to wait a little bit

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.460 
now we did have to wait a little bit
longer<00:04:25.240> for<00:04:25.360> this<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.810> render<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.260> I'd<00:04:26.320> say

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
longer for this to render and I'd say

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.410 
longer for this to render and I'd say
there's<00:04:26.650> still<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.890> few<00:04:27.280> anti-aliasing<00:04:28.030> issues

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
there's still a few anti-aliasing issues

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.210 
there's still a few anti-aliasing issues
around<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.900> area<00:04:29.200> of<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.380> lid<00:04:29.590> but<00:04:29.860> all<00:04:30.040> in

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
around the area of the lid but all in

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.530 
around the area of the lid but all in
all<00:04:30.310> I'd<00:04:30.610> say<00:04:30.640> this<00:04:30.850> is<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.000> pretty<00:04:31.240> solid

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
all I'd say this is a pretty solid
