00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
ball and a plate adjust a little bit let

ball and a plate adjust a little bit let
some<00:00:42.600> air<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.620> tie<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.800> easy<00:00:45.289> we

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
some air out so you can tie it easy we

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.569 
some air out so you can tie it easy we
want<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.530> twist<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> bubble<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> end

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
want to twist a bubble right on the end

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.850 
want to twist a bubble right on the end
and<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.059> want<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.329> keep<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.719> smaller<00:00:49.260> than<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and we want to keep it smaller than the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.080 
and we want to keep it smaller than the
width<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> balloon<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:53.579> reason<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
width of the balloon the reason for that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
width of the balloon the reason for that
is<00:00:54.360> we're<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> push<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.930> bubble

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
is we're going to push that bubble

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.729 
is we're going to push that bubble
inside<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:56.940> take<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.440> push<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
inside so if we take that we can push it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.950 
inside so if we take that we can push it
inside<00:00:58.920> that<00:01:01.190> take<00:01:02.190> some<00:01:02.340> practice<00:01:02.870> now<00:01:03.870> if

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
inside that take some practice now if

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.109 
inside that take some practice now if
you<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.290> balloon<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> squeeze<00:01:05.119> that

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you get this balloon to squeeze that

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.910 
you get this balloon to squeeze that
will<00:01:06.270> make<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.630> easier<00:01:06.920> you're

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
will make it a little easier you're

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590 
will make it a little easier you're
going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> want<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> twist<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:09.060> balloon<00:01:09.390> on

we're going to put it inside just like
we<00:01:50.670> did<00:01:50.790> before<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.720> time<00:01:52.079> instead<00:01:52.409> of

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
we did before but this time instead of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.050 
we did before but this time instead of
breaking<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.009> from<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> outside<00:01:53.820> we're<00:01:53.939> going

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
to break it from the inside

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
to break it from the inside
it's<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:56.130> difficult<00:01:56.719> we're<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.869> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it's a little difficult we're going to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.090 
it's a little difficult we're going to
take<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> ball<00:01:58.320> we're<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> push<00:01:58.979> it

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.440 
take the ball we're going to push it
inside<00:02:01.399> to<00:02:02.399> keep<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.670> from<00:02:02.850> coming<00:02:03.090> undone

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
inside to keep this from coming undone

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.810 
inside to keep this from coming undone
I'm<00:02:03.780> gonna<00:02:03.930> give<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.200> squeeze

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
I'm gonna give it a squeeze

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.570 
I'm gonna give it a squeeze
and<00:02:06.820> I'm<00:02:06.970> going<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.120> turn<00:02:07.450> this<00:02:07.690> one<00:02:07.960> around<00:02:08.580> my

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
and I'm going to turn this one around my

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.930 
and I'm going to turn this one around my
finger<00:02:10.740> you<00:02:11.740> can<00:02:11.890> see<00:02:12.100> right<00:02:12.310> here<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.790> creates

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
finger you can see right here it creates

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.360 
finger you can see right here it creates
a<00:02:13.150> little<00:02:13.330> bit<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.660> seal<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.220> keeps<00:02:15.220> it

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
a little bit of a seal that keeps it

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.720 
a little bit of a seal that keeps it
from<00:02:15.400> like<00:02:16.209> just<00:02:16.240> spring<00:02:16.930> loading<00:02:17.350> outside

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
from like just spring loading outside

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.860 
from like just spring loading outside
now<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.880> might<00:02:19.090> have<00:02:19.209> gotten<00:02:19.390> tight<00:02:19.630> again

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
now this might have gotten tight again

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.960 
now this might have gotten tight again
so<00:02:19.990> I'm<00:02:20.050> going<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.200> give<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.410> another<00:02:20.500> squeeze

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
so I'm going to give it another squeeze

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.880 
we have the ball inside the balloon how
cool<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.330> that<00:02:58.360> now<00:02:59.170> we<00:02:59.230> just<00:02:59.440> make<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.739> dog

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
cool is that now we just make the dog

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.590 
cool is that now we just make the dog
like<00:03:00.070> we<00:03:00.220> always<00:03:00.370> do<00:03:00.670> but<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.269> want<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.480> keep

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
like we always do but you want to keep

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.270 
like we always do but you want to keep
track<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.900> where<00:03:02.019> that<00:03:02.110> ball<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:03.190> we're

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
track of where that ball is so we're

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.790 
track of where that ball is so we're
going<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> make<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.640> head<00:03:04.290> small<00:03:05.290> section<00:03:05.650> for

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
going to make the head small section for

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.830 
going to make the head small section for
the<00:03:05.860> head<00:03:06.010> maybe<00:03:06.430> about<00:03:06.640> two<00:03:06.790> inches<00:03:07.090> same

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the head maybe about two inches same

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.370 
the head maybe about two inches same
size<00:03:08.140> for<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.500> ears<00:03:11.340> do<00:03:12.340> two<00:03:12.610> ears<00:03:13.049> also<00:03:14.049> about

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
size for the ears do two ears also about

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.199 
size for the ears do two ears also about
two<00:03:14.560> inches<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.070> these<00:03:15.700> three<00:03:15.880> here<00:03:16.060> should

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
two inches so these three here should

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.240 
two inches so these three here should
all<00:03:16.330> be<00:03:16.450> about<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.720> same<00:03:16.870> size<00:03:17.140> because<00:03:18.130> we

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
all be about the same size because we

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.430 
all be about the same size because we
broke<00:03:18.519> off<00:03:18.730> some<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.720> balloon<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.170> little

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
broke off some the balloon is a little

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.440 
broke off some the balloon is a little
bit<00:03:20.560> shorter<00:03:21.040> because<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.910> that<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.120> dog<00:03:22.299> is

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
bit shorter because of that the dog is

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.240 
bit shorter because of that the dog is
going<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.660> be<00:03:22.720> smaller<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.260> it's<00:03:23.410> good<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.829> make

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
going to be smaller so it's good to make

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.640 
going to be smaller so it's good to make
this<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.430> small<00:03:24.880> dog<00:03:25.090> twist<00:03:26.019> this<00:03:26.140> section<00:03:26.470> here

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
this a small dog twist this section here

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.600 
this a small dog twist this section here
into<00:03:27.100> this<00:03:27.250> section<00:03:27.549> here<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:30.220> there<00:03:30.370> we<00:03:30.459> have

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
into this section here and there we have

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.520 
into this section here and there we have
our<00:03:30.760> head<00:03:30.910> now<00:03:31.720> we're<00:03:31.870> going<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.019> do<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.290> same

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
our head now we're going to do the same

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.500 
our head now we're going to do the same
for<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.370> neck<00:03:33.579> just<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.570> small<00:03:34.810> bubble<00:03:36.510> two
