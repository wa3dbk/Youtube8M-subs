00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.030 
the herd we saw stays in the same area
pretty<00:01:59.759> often<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.390> seeing<00:02:01.229> those<00:02:01.469> Bighorn

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
pretty often and seeing those Bighorn

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.190 
pretty often and seeing those Bighorn
isn't<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:02.670> rare<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.090> chase<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.689> had<00:02:03.869> thought

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
isn't as rare as chase and I had thought

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.160 
isn't as rare as chase and I had thought
which<00:02:05.159> was<00:02:05.399> further<00:02:05.820> evidence<00:02:06.030> by<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> sign<00:02:06.990> in

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
which was further evidence by a sign in

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.559 
which was further evidence by a sign in
the<00:02:07.259> road<00:02:07.439> near<00:02:07.710> where<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:08.009> saw<00:02:08.220> them<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.330> it

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
the road near where we saw them so it

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.390 
the road near where we saw them so it
wasn't<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.140> unique<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.709> an<00:02:10.830> experience

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
wasn't that unique of an experience

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.360 
wasn't that unique of an experience
after<00:02:11.610> all

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
after all

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.350 
after all
still<00:02:13.060> quite<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.780> story<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.069> guess<00:02:15.400> nearly

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
still quite a story that I guess nearly

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.140 
still quite a story that I guess nearly
anyone<00:02:16.750> could<00:02:16.959> have<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.349> Hell's<00:02:17.560> Canyon<00:02:18.150> for

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
anyone could have in Hell's Canyon for
