you see the notification of whatever it
is<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.820> then<00:02:34.590> take<00:02:35.590> an<00:02:35.770> action<00:02:36.040> on<00:02:36.550> that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
is and then take an action on that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.950 
is and then take an action on that
notification<00:02:37.920> using<00:02:38.920> your<00:02:39.070> watch<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:40.030> do<00:02:40.720> not

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
call or accept a call using the watch if

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.560 
call or accept a call using the watch if
you're<00:02:47.470> getting<00:02:47.710> a<00:02:47.740> text<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:48.700> read<00:02:49.540> it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
you're getting a text you can read it

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.500 
you're getting a text you can read it
and<00:02:49.870> reply<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:51.220> using<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.760> watch<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.360> so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
and reply to it using the watch and so

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.510 
and reply to it using the watch and so
pretty<00:02:52.780> much<00:02:52.960> anything<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.770> do<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.370> do

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
pretty much anything that you do you do

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.430 
pretty much anything that you do you do
not<00:02:54.640> have<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.910> reach<00:02:55.180> for<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.540> phone<00:02:55.870> all<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
not have to reach for the phone all the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.470 
not have to reach for the phone all the
notification<00:02:57.280> you're<00:02:57.430> going<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.670> get<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.270> can

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
notification you're going to get you can

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.500 
notification you're going to get you can
act<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.470> without<00:03:00.190> reaching<00:03:00.760> for<00:03:01.360> your

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
act on it without reaching for your

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.230 
act on it without reaching for your
phone<00:03:01.720> and<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.110> think<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.620> complete

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
phone and I think that is a complete

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.700 
phone and I think that is a complete
solution<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.630> is<00:03:04.870> what<00:03:05.050> gives<00:03:05.290> everyone

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
solution and that is what gives everyone

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.040 
solution and that is what gives everyone
convenience<00:03:06.610> alright<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.720> was<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
convenience alright so that was the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.690 
convenience alright so that was the
interview<00:03:08.290> there<00:03:08.620> I'm<00:03:08.860> definitely<00:03:09.220> excited

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
to how see how it feels on the risk

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.880 
to how see how it feels on the risk
because<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.410> is<00:03:26.500> really<00:03:26.890> thin<00:03:27.160> too<00:03:27.430> as<00:03:27.610> well<00:03:27.820> so

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
because it is really thin too as well so

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.080
