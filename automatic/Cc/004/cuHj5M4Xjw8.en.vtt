messy<00:00:34.559> hairstyle<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.370> don't<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.880> be

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
messy hairstyle so you don't have to be

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.510 
messy hairstyle so you don't have to be
super<00:00:36.329> precise<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.469> you<00:00:40.469> form<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
super precise and then you form the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.830 
super precise and then you form the
first<00:00:41.760> knot<00:00:45.559> just<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.840> with

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
first knot just like you do it with

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.549 
first knot just like you do it with
other<00:00:49.140> things<00:00:49.559> than<00:00:49.739> hair<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.230> form

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
other things than hair and then you form

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.540 
other things than hair and then you form
a<00:00:52.710> second

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.890

compress my ponytail just like so and I
achieve<00:02:41.840> this<00:02:42.020> interesting<00:02:42.650> result<00:02:43.069> which

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
achieve this interesting result which

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.699 
achieve this interesting result which
almost<00:02:43.970> looks<00:02:44.180> like<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.480> fishtail<00:02:44.780> braid<00:02:45.020> but

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
almost looks like a fishtail braid but

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.040 
almost looks like a fishtail braid but
it's<00:02:45.890> easier<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.670> do<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.239> there<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.810> something

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
it's easier to do and there is something

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.890 
it's easier to do and there is something
different<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.940> this<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.000> how<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.450> looks<00:02:50.660> like

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
different and this is how it looks like

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.140 
different and this is how it looks like
if<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.319> bring<00:02:51.560> my<00:02:51.620> ponytail<00:02:52.370> into<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.819> hole

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
if I bring my ponytail into this hole

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.830 
if I bring my ponytail into this hole
two<00:02:53.540> times<00:02:55.000> as<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.390> bring<00:02:56.840> my<00:02:57.050> hair<00:02:57.350> back<00:02:58.840> it

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
two times as I bring my hair back it

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.600
