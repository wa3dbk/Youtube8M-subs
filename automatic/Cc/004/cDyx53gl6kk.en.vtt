was outlined in a previous video there's

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.280 
was outlined in a previous video there's
two<00:02:18.489> drops<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.209> can<00:02:19.420> see<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.050> video

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
two drops that we can see in this video

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.440 
two drops that we can see in this video
the<00:02:20.530> first<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.220> which<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:22.000> Martian

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
the first of which is the Martian

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.720 
the first of which is the Martian
costume<00:02:22.930> vanity<00:02:23.470> set<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.160> second<00:02:24.580> is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
costume vanity set and the second is

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.870 
costume vanity set and the second is
Martian<00:02:25.330> conduct<00:02:25.840> placing<00:02:26.470> now<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> conduct<00:02:27.700> is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
Martian conduct placing now a conduct is

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.060 
Martian conduct placing now a conduct is
something<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.570> protects<00:02:28.989> wiring<00:02:29.590> sort<00:02:29.920> of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
something that protects wiring sort of

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.009 
something that protects wiring sort of
like<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.250> tubing<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:30.970> put<00:02:31.180> wires<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.660> so

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
like a tubing that you put wires in so

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.110 
like a tubing that you put wires in so
perhaps<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.769> might<00:02:32.920> use<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.400> conducts<00:02:33.970> to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
perhaps you might use the conducts to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.880 
perhaps you might use the conducts to
create<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.540> new<00:02:34.660> electrical<00:02:35.290> equipment<00:02:35.800> in

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
create the new electrical equipment in

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.810 
create the new electrical equipment in
this<00:02:36.070> update

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
this update

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.430 
this update
maybe<00:02:37.000> it's<00:02:37.239> used<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.600> create<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.080> mining

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
maybe it's used to create the mining

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.530 
maybe it's used to create the mining
amount<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.250> see<00:02:39.430> here<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:40.090> doesn't

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
amount that you can see here it doesn't

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.390 
amount that you can see here it doesn't

final things to note if you look at me

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.140 
final things to note if you look at me
digit<00:02:47.739> right<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.100> he<00:02:48.160> seems<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.850> be<00:02:48.940> using

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
digit right now he seems to be using

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.479

some<00:02:49.570> sort<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.930> improved<00:02:50.440> Cutlass<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.310> may

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
some sort of improved Cutlass and it may

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.759 
some sort of improved Cutlass and it may
also<00:02:51.700> fire<00:02:52.150> bombs<00:02:52.540> when<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.019> swing<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.560> it

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
also fire bombs when you swing it it

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.740 
also fire bombs when you swing it it
does<00:02:54.010> seem<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.280> do<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:55.120> will<00:02:55.239> just<00:02:55.420> replay

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
does seem to do that I will just replay

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.600 
does seem to do that I will just replay
it<00:02:55.870> for<00:02:56.019> you<00:02:56.110> one<00:02:56.290> more<00:02:56.320> time<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:57.250> does<00:02:57.459> look

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
it for you one more time it does look

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.670 
it for you one more time it does look
very<00:02:57.640> interesting<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:59.019> weapon<00:02:59.470> I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
very interesting and this weapon I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.039 
very interesting and this weapon I
assume<00:03:00.070> will<00:03:00.400> be<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.579> very<00:03:01.060> strong<00:03:01.450> weapon<00:03:01.870> a

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
assume will be a very strong weapon a

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.020 
assume will be a very strong weapon a
couple<00:03:02.560> more<00:03:02.709> things<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.160> note<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.579> there<00:03:03.910> are

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
couple more things to note is there are

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.150 
couple more things to note is there are
going<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.390> be<00:03:04.540> many<00:03:04.840> events<00:03:05.380> in<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.680> update

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
going to be many events in this update

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.620 
going to be many events in this update
so<00:03:06.430> there's<00:03:06.640> going<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.940> be<00:03:07.030> more<00:03:07.299> than<00:03:07.450> this

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
so there's going to be more than this

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.110 
so there's going to be more than this
one<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.440> can<00:03:08.650> see<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.010> UFOs<00:03:09.489> find<00:03:09.880> about

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
one and you can see the UFOs find about

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.420 
one and you can see the UFOs find about
in<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> background<00:03:10.959> which<00:03:11.350> confirms<00:03:11.920> that<00:03:12.220> it

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
in the background which confirms that it

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.039 
in the background which confirms that it
is<00:03:12.610> an<00:03:12.790> alien<00:03:13.120> event

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
is an alien event

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.410 
is an alien event
so<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.950> one-point-three<00:03:15.549> update<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.090> looking

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
so the one-point-three update is looking

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.600 
so the one-point-three update is looking
more<00:03:16.570> exciting<00:03:17.230> by<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.530> week<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.100> feel<00:03:18.340> free

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
more exciting by the week and feel free

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.520 
more exciting by the week and feel free
to<00:03:18.670> put<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.239> comments<00:03:19.690> how<00:03:19.810> excited<00:03:20.410> you

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
to put in the comments how excited you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.440 
to put in the comments how excited you
have<00:03:20.560> for<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.040> update<00:03:21.549> I'm<00:03:21.940> going<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.360> be
