00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
difficult keeping up with the heat but

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.729 
difficult keeping up with the heat but

what you have is perfect conditions for

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
what you have is perfect conditions for
seed<00:00:56.489> saving<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.140> air<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.770> dry

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
seed saving because the air is very dry

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
seed saving because the air is very dry
it's<00:00:59.489> lost<00:00:59.730> its<00:00:59.969> humidity<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.789> seeds<00:01:03.120> are

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it's lost its humidity the seeds are

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.539 
it's lost its humidity the seeds are
beginning<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.470> form<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.129> they're<00:01:05.220> beginning

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
beginning to form and they're beginning

in like this look um the fact that I've
mulch<00:01:46.710> them<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.159> lots<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.549> shredding<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
mulch them with lots of shredding and a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
mulch them with lots of shredding and a
bit<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> mushroom<00:01:49.470> compost<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> help

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
bit of mushroom compost is going to help

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.149 
bit of mushroom compost is going to help
but<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> roots<00:01:51.960> dry<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.740> will<00:01:52.890> die

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
but if the roots dry out they will die

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.429 
but if the roots dry out they will die
so<00:01:54.149> fingers<00:01:54.570> crossed<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:55.020> there'd<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
so fingers crossed that there'd be a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.109 
so fingers crossed that there'd be a
little<00:01:55.710> bit<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.950> rain<00:01:56.189> well<00:01:57.049> preferably

preferably a deluge okay sort of Noah's
Ark<00:02:03.030> type<00:02:06.530> reinforce<00:02:07.530> I'd<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:08.009> course<00:02:08.039> um

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
Ark type reinforce I'd of course um

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.410 
Ark type reinforce I'd of course um
black<00:02:09.090> currants<00:02:09.720> I've<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.319> ripen<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.160> up

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
black currants I've just ripen it up

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.690 
black currants I've just ripen it up
really<00:02:12.420> really<00:02:12.690> well

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
from it okay but that's okay because the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.699 
from it okay but that's okay because the
bush<00:02:50.090> can<00:02:50.360> afford<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.870> lose<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.200> little<00:02:51.380> bit<00:02:51.530> of

the new stuff anyway um that's a good

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.910 
the new stuff anyway um that's a good
way<00:02:55.160> of<00:02:55.190> pruning<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.200> actually<00:02:57.200> harvesting

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.830 
there I don't know if you can see I'll
zoom<00:03:20.000> in<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.239> little<00:03:20.359> bit

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
zoom in a little bit

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.150

there's lots of red currants now I'm a
little<00:03:25.549> bit<00:03:25.670> smarter<00:03:25.880> than<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.480> black<00:03:26.690> birds

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
little bit smarter than the black birds

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.410 
little bit smarter than the black birds
here<00:03:27.549> because<00:03:28.549> you<00:03:28.609> know<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.850> black<00:03:29.060> birds

just<00:03:29.720> love<00:03:30.019> berries<00:03:30.620> any<00:03:30.980> kind<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.549> berries

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
just love berries any kind of berries

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.199 
just love berries any kind of berries
but<00:03:33.230> they're<00:03:33.470> particularly<00:03:34.010> fond<00:03:34.639> of<00:03:34.970> red

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
but they're particularly fond of red

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.420 
but they're particularly fond of red
currants<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.019> what<00:03:36.170> I<00:03:36.200> do<00:03:36.350> I<00:03:36.709> plant<00:03:37.160> red

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
currants so what I do I plant red

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.360 
currants so what I do I plant red
currants<00:03:37.880> in<00:03:38.230> between<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.680> black<00:03:39.889> currants

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
currants in between the black currants

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.670 
currants in between the black currants
now<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.030> don't<00:03:41.299> use<00:03:41.510> a<00:03:41.540> lot<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.810> red<00:03:42.079> currants<00:03:42.470> I

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
now I don't use a lot of red currants I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.819 
now I don't use a lot of red currants I
I<00:03:42.739> would<00:03:43.239> harvest<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.420> fair<00:03:44.690> amount<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.680> make

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
I would harvest a fair amount to make

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.800 
I would harvest a fair amount to make
wine<00:03:46.130> with<00:03:46.489> because<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:46.910> makes<00:03:47.150> absolutely

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
wine with because it makes absolutely

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.750 
wine with because it makes absolutely
beautiful<00:03:48.560> tasty<00:03:49.190> dry<00:03:50.030> crisp<00:03:50.600> wine<00:03:51.609> but<00:03:52.609> in

general what I do is I leave them on the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.539 
general what I do is I leave them on the
bushes<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:57.200> black<00:03:57.410> birds<00:03:57.739> go<00:03:58.069> in<00:03:58.220> and

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
bushes and the black birds go in and

the<00:04:03.470> red<00:04:03.620> currants<00:04:04.190> for<00:04:04.370> themselves<00:04:05.410> leaving

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
the red currants for themselves leaving

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.050 
the red currants for themselves leaving
the<00:04:06.769> currants<00:04:07.670> alone<00:04:09.370> I've<00:04:10.370> never<00:04:10.639> really<00:04:10.910> had

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
the currants alone I've never really had

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.240 
the currants alone I've never really had
a<00:04:11.090> problem<00:04:12.400> as<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.459> can<00:04:13.849> see<00:04:14.500> with<00:04:15.500> the<00:04:15.919> birds

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
a problem as you can see with the birds

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.240 
a problem as you can see with the birds
ticking<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.090> fruit<00:04:17.950> simply<00:04:18.950> because<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.820> plant

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
ticking the fruit simply because I plant

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.690 
ticking the fruit simply because I plant
first<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.460> all<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.610> plant<00:04:23.000> for<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.330> bees<00:04:23.510> okay

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
first of all I plant for the bees okay

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.029 
first of all I plant for the bees okay
then<00:04:25.700> I<00:04:25.849> pumped<00:04:26.360> for<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.110> birds

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
then I pumped for the birds

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:32.589 
then I pumped for the birds
and<00:04:28.580> then<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.240> plant<00:04:29.629> for<00:04:29.870> myself<00:04:31.270> so<00:04:32.270> I've<00:04:32.389> got

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
and then I plant for myself so I've got

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.779 
and then I plant for myself so I've got
everything<00:04:32.900> firmly<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:33.800> place<00:04:33.979> there<00:04:34.430> I've

everything firmly in place there I've

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.790 
everything firmly in place there I've
got<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.300> bees<00:04:35.479> will<00:04:35.840> come<00:04:35.990> in<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.259> pollinate

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800
