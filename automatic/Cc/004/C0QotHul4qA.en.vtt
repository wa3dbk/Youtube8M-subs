they're<00:00:25.230> not<00:00:25.320> happy<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
they're not happy with then it's up to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.070 
they're not happy with then it's up to
the<00:00:26.640> mechanics<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> fine<00:00:27.660> tuning<00:00:27.689> of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the mechanics to do the fine tuning of

the mechanics to do the fine tuning of
the<00:00:28.170> suspension<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:29.099> things<00:00:29.340> worked<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.760> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the suspension get things worked out to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.790 
the suspension get things worked out to
hopefully<00:00:30.539> pick<00:00:30.689> up<00:00:30.840> some<00:00:30.990> extra<00:00:31.080> place<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> bit

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
hopefully pick up some extra place a bit

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.380 
hopefully pick up some extra place a bit
of<00:00:31.890> extra<00:00:32.040> speed<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.669> maybe<00:00:33.000> some<00:00:33.239> more

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
of extra speed and maybe some more

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.819 
of extra speed and maybe some more
efficient<00:00:33.750> handling<00:00:33.989> well<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.530> course<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
efficient handling well of course the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.110 
efficient handling well of course the
worst<00:00:34.980> thing<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.520> rip<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:35.940> say<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
worst thing is if you rip in and say you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540 
worst thing is if you rip in and say you
want<00:00:36.270> 20<00:00:36.600> more<00:00:36.719> horsepower<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.100> mechanics

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
want 20 more horsepower the mechanics

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.340 
want 20 more horsepower the mechanics
well<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.090> can't<00:00:39.329> work<00:00:39.510> miracles<00:00:39.719> let's<00:00:40.200> have

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
well they can't work miracles let's have

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.319 
well they can't work miracles let's have
a<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:40.620> off<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.370> start<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.879> will<00:00:42.120> be

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
as well so it is the two BMWs chasing

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.110 
as well so it is the two BMWs chasing
