00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:15.469
 installation kv-1 consists of six parts 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.900
 the heart of the installation is a capacitor which 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:32.689
 can make home 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.689
 very simple foil film is made 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.050
 sock and ball that presses the foil 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.190
 Bilovol installation is a discharger 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.190
 Formative, too, just make 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.379
 car ignition coil 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:08.149
 electronic transformer which can 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.149
 buy an electron at any store 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.939
 rewind the transformer winding 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 we get 24 kilovolts this device 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.460
 connect the capacitor 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:36.090
 informing mu arrestor through 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.090
 Diodes that take microwaves 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:47.789
 connect to vi tatar which stands 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.789
 water spring water 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.950
 turn on 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:10.710
 notice the water starts to cloud 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:14.260
 minerals containing nikolai water 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:21.910
 crushed and the water becomes hard 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:25.870
 soft drinking a glass of such water you 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.860
 feel the inner heat and after 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.860
 making alcohol 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.880
 this suggests that the cells in your 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.209
 body cleaned and you will live 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.209
 longer 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.720
 miracle of water 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:00.760
 connecting to this installation magnetic boron 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:04.770
 we get the effect of cavitation which 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.770
 destroys any materials 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.350
 creates a lot of pressure 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:19.740
 note below is cracked 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:23.800
 the bank turn on the bank pleases us the top 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.640
 the lower one remains whole even though it 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.640
 cracked 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.700
 happens at the expense of compression 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:41.490
 water and how cavitation happens 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:41.490
 material destruction repeatable 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.959
 again 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.959
 cracked jar remained untouched 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:00.840
 it means you can clean the pipeline 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.840
 pipes without destroying them by cavitation 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:12.770
 farther 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:15.420
 using this magnetic boron men 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:48.590
 smoke any facet materials 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:53.900
 and so on pouring a little oil water 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:59.480
 thin strip as you see we 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.480
 we get a miracle of fuel 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:09.760
 now we will do it pay 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:15.190
 note that when the work will begin kavi 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:20.260
 Tatars water movement will go from top to bottom 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:25.180
 now we will see it here see movement 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:36.760
 goes excited down with this water mixed 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:42.100
 with oil, the miracle of fuel is turned on 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:45.240
 one minute of time and it turned out the fuel 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.240
 for the miracle of the membrane 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.440
 fuel ready 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:13.880
 now we will pour into the container a first-aid kit from 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.880
 this capacity water pipes 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.680
 falls into an IV 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.910
 further on is moving along the thin copper 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.910
 tubes 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:49.839
 to the hole in the oven above the hole stands 

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:55.729
 miracle membrane in the furnace here is a miracle water 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:07:00.729
 ignites passing through the embers of firewood with 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:05.349
 large emission of red light 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:09.529
 living heat you burn less wood 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:10.989
 get more warm with good 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:14.360
 heat 

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:17.769
 which prague warm up very much 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.769
 room faster 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:30.850
 about all this you can find out on my 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:30.850
 site connect together we are power
