it there give it literally that much
more<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.980> killer<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.489> they'd<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
more your killer and they'd go down to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
you're killing off both cylinders and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.510 
you're killing off both cylinders and
you<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.289> start<00:00:52.530> bogging<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:52.920> till<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.340> let

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
you just start bogging down till you let

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.310 
you just start bogging down till you let
go<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.730> throttle<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.989> it's<00:00:57.989> literally

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
go the throttle and then it's literally

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.049 
go the throttle and then it's literally
like<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> hasn't<00:00:59.010> stopping<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.820> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
like that hasn't stopping like that I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.810 
like that hasn't stopping like that I
thought<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.989> could<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:02.250> stator<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:05.610> seems

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
thought it could be the stator it seems

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.070 
thought it could be the stator it seems
a<00:01:05.880> bit<00:01:06.000> weird<00:01:06.210> looking<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.600> other<00:01:06.659> people's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080

and<00:01:24.979> also<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.299> choke<00:01:27.600> didn't<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.500> make<00:01:28.650> a

but revving it up now does make a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.840 
but revving it up now does make a
difference<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:34.159> I'll<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.400> show<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.790> a

haven't got the airbox connected this
bike<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.880> does<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.540> should<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.960> run

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
bike I know it does and it should do run

bit<00:01:49.200> lean<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.680> won't<00:01:49.829> run<00:01:50.100> at<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.909> perfect

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
bit lean it won't run at it's perfect

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.710 
bit lean it won't run at it's perfect
point<00:01:52.220> but<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:53.369> will<00:01:53.670> run<00:01:54.329> without<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
point but they will run without the

point but they will run without the
airbox<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.430> I<00:01:56.430> don't<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.630> they

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
airbox on I don't like it but they

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.940 
airbox on I don't like it but they
should<00:01:58.200> rev<00:01:58.770> out<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.409> I've<00:02:01.530> had<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> there

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
should rev out and I've had it there

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.060 
should rev out and I've had it there
before<00:02:02.070> when<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.549> running<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.030> now

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.050 

takeovers<00:02:07.070> a<00:02:07.100> bit<00:02:07.310> high<00:02:07.460> just<00:02:07.760> because<00:02:07.940> the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
takeovers a bit high just because the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.910 
takeovers a bit high just because the
strong<00:02:08.300> cables<00:02:08.780> connected<00:02:09.410> up<00:02:09.500> on<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.710> funny

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
strong cables connected up on a funny

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.610 
strong cables connected up on a funny
way<00:02:10.450> if<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.600> fiddle<00:02:11.870> around<00:02:11.960> with<00:02:12.140> I'll<00:02:12.320> make<00:02:12.500> it

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
way if I fiddle around with I'll make it

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.400 
way if I fiddle around with I'll make it
a<00:02:12.680> tick<00:02:12.860> ever<00:02:13.040> go<00:02:13.190> down<00:02:13.430> but<00:02:14.140> excuse<00:02:15.140> me<00:02:15.260> this

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
a tick ever go down but excuse me this

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.770 
a tick ever go down but excuse me this
is<00:02:15.470> without<00:02:16.250> joke<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.209> is<00:02:20.360> giving<00:02:20.660> it

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
is without joke and this is giving it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:30.780 
is without joke and this is giving it
sort<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.170> gentle<00:02:21.680> throttle

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.789 

and<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.780> what<00:02:32.019> happens<00:02:32.319> when<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.500> give<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
and this what happens when I give it the

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:42.399 
and this what happens when I give it the
beans

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.990 

now<00:02:43.409> if<00:02:43.530> I'm<00:02:43.709> very<00:02:43.950> careful<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.700> sort<00:02:44.939> of

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
now if I'm very careful and sort of

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.490 
now if I'm very careful and sort of
fiddle<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.480> up

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.260 

that's<00:02:53.130> about<00:02:53.340> as<00:02:53.460> high<00:02:53.610> as<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:54.000> make<00:02:54.120> it

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
that's about as high as I can make it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.470 
that's about as high as I can make it
Reb<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:55.440> just<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.550> hold<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.450> camera

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
Reb I just have to hold the camera

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.930 
Reb I just have to hold the camera
creatively<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.620> can<00:02:58.800> apply<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.490> choke<00:02:59.760> my

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
creatively so I can apply the choke my

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.180 
creatively so I can apply the choke my
other<00:03:00.090> hand<00:03:00.530> because<00:03:01.530> I'm<00:03:01.650> got<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.920> cable

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
other hand because I'm got the cable

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.220 
other hand because I'm got the cable
connected<00:03:02.550> up<00:03:02.670> but<00:03:02.850> you'll<00:03:03.030> see<00:03:03.240> I'll<00:03:03.690> do<00:03:03.930> a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
connected up but you'll see I'll do a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.920 
connected up but you'll see I'll do a
little<00:03:04.440> bit<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.770> throttle<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.280> then<00:03:05.760> all<00:03:06.750> of

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
little bit of throttle and then all of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:53.260 
little bit of throttle and then all of
the<00:03:07.020> throttle

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.450 

so<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.330> see<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.720> will<00:03:54.870> rev<00:03:55.080> past<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.620> 5k<00:03:55.920> mark

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
so you see it will rev past that 5k mark

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.930 
so you see it will rev past that 5k mark
so<00:03:56.700> that's<00:03:56.880> what<00:03:57.060> makes<00:03:57.210> me<00:03:57.390> doubt<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.660> Stata
