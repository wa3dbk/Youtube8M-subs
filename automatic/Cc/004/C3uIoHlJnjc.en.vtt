00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.280
 you want a premium sedan but not the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.139
 you want German 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.730
 the alternatives you know are not many 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.529
 hands a new one has just arrived 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.360
 the infinites with 50 comes from Japan 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.160
 I remind you that this brand does 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.649
 part of the nissan orbit exactly 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.009
 as lexus was iota and declared war 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:34.860
 open to the usual audi a4 bmw 3 series 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.180
 as you see the recipe is similar whose 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.280
 50 is a four-door sedan 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.530
 characterized by a very design 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.629
 racy at times sporty and with so much 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 technology under the hood but this does not 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.079
 means copying because the machine 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.960
 a personality all its own 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.690
 starting from the very muscular front and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.870
 the cards are very fluid and sculpted 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.070
 you can here at the handles 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 on the belt line and then there is a 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 this stylistic detail the upright 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.890
 the area is half-moon shaped 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.509
 back is the most conventional and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.759
 according to me like a little too much 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.140
 Japanese but overall whose 50 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.700
 a nice presence on the road too 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.450
 because the dimensions are everything 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.090
 respect 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.649
 4 m 79 of length also for this is 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.689
 the largest in the category like 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.189
 interior space and as a trunk that 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.189
 measures 500 liters 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.270
 and whose 50 is beautiful even in the second 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.850
 me for this bridge from a setting 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.950
 very hi tech with this high design 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.659
 characterized by a double arc line 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.149
 and then the main feature 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.619
 this double touchscreen display that 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.570
 high for satellite navigation and 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.220
 the lowest one for the controls of the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.350
 satellite navigator same computer 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.409
 on-board driving mode change 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.850
 automatic steering and setting the 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.159
 space must also be abundant thanks in 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.229
 particular to the wide seat of the seats 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.429
 and I also like to say the materials 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.069
 which have been chosen as a combination 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.649
 color finishes and perceived quality 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.479
 both for the plastic and for the leather yes 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.060
 widen also behind thanks to the step of 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.799
 285 meters the most important value of the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.440
 category so I have so much space for 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.180
 legs you see it for the feet while a little 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.540
 just what i have in mind for 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.540
 height 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.420
 the version I chose for this 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.740
 test is the 2200 diesel and therefore the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.380
 most interesting engine for the market 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.870
 Italian and it must be said immediately that it is a 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.110
 propeller of mercedes origin therefore 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.450
 we are talking about a 2.1 liter 4 cm 170 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.730
 horses 400 newtonmetri of couple that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.470
 I think the right compromise for one 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.350
 for a car of this type on paper 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.630
 performance is still brilliant 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.430
 8.5 seconds from 0 to 100 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.020
 the combination in this case and with a 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.730
 seven-speed automatic transmission 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.110
 this too is of mercedes origin which it is 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.630
 very sweet in the steps 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.700
 instead it becomes a bit slow when yes 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.890
 sets driving more sporting yes 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.720
 switch to manual setting and then 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.850
 you can change the relationship even with 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.680
 these puzzles behind the wheel technical innovation 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.810
 and very interesting technology 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.790
 product to which 50 is the same type 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.820
 drive by wire which means that how 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.280
 on planes there is no connection 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.100
 mechanical between the steering wheel and the wheels 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.170
 front cars and the first car in the world that 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.780
 adopts a solution of this type 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.190
 and this solution therefore governed by 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.890
 electronics also allows you to adjust 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.440
 resistance and steering response 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.420
 from this central display with three 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.200
 intensity levels what I can 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.519
 say that the feeling is not let's say 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.390
 comparable to what one gives you 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.100
 electro-hydraulic steering and in particular 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.049
 or when the guide becomes more engaged e 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.700
 so when the feelings they have 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.700
 transmitting the wheels to the steering wheel are 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.100
 very important to understand how 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.049
 better manage the machine and the other 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.610
 what i noticed is that the answer 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.989
 the steering is always very immediate 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.820
 even when the program is not imposed 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.579
 sporting which can make driving 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.860
 car less comfortable steering a 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.630
 part road behavior is of 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.360
 good level this exemplary mounts tires 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.180
 of the 19 inches that are in my opinion fin 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.660
 too large and make it very flat 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.770
 in a rigid curve on the experiences with 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.229
 road holding levels really 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.270
 important I can't define it though 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.599
 a sedan vest and in some ways 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.449
 sporty like a bmw 3 series whose 50 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.400
 rather it is suitable for long journeys from 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.289
 do also in silence because 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.370
 the sound of the passenger compartment is really 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.370
 high level 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.120
 of which 50 I liked the style 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.699
 soundproofing staff 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.410
 of the passenger compartment and the infinite system in 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.180
 touch did not like the floor of 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.250
 load slightly uphill the 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.900
 engine throttle acceleration e 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.639
 the steering film always too much 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.830
 direct is filtered according to my taste 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.380
 how much the price the v50 that I tried e 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.840
 the top range sports equipment costs 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.970
 price list 45 thousand and 500 euros includes 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.190
 almost all included a guarantee of 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.110
 3 years or 100,000 km 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.760
 the most economical attack version 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.400
 always with 2200 diesel engine but with 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.940
 manual gearbox instead starts from 36 thousand e 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.310
 100 euros 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.600
 so if you ask me if 50 can 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.490
 be a valid alternative to 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.199
 German I answer yes for content 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.699
 technicians and style 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.949
 but also the coat of arms in this 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.660
 segment also counts a lot for the 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.400
 repeatability but having on the hood a 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.990
 new brand different from the usual suspects 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.520
 for many it could be a valid one 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.320
 purchase motivation 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.860
 and then turns wants you like question 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.860
 stand out
