00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.689
 hello girls welcome to that with 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.410
 mayra today being teaching tutorial of 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.410
 this hairstyle 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.939
 It is a simple hairstyle for hair 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.939
 medium to long 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.380
 we'll start on the left side and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.960
 we will select a small part of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.510
 front of the hair dividing it into three 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.510
 parts and we'll start a normal braid 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.719
 by adding hair to the braid only 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.649
 we will be selecting hair from the 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.649
 top part 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.160
 when forming the braids we will be 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.160
 directing down 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.980
 once all the hair is selected 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.780
 we will be forming the braid until the 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.780
 where we can reach it to do 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.520
 we will be pulling the segments a little 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.770
 of the braid to do a little more 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.280
 wide and give it a little more design and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280
 texture 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.399
 we will be treating the braid with a 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.399
 small league 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.720
 if you like the hairstyle can end there 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.140
 I will be forming another tense in the other 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.990
 side likewise making a braid 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.280
 normal and only picking hair 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.280
 from the top side 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.700
 remember to direct the braid towards 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.700
 down so that it falls 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.890
 and once we'll be thinking about everything else 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.890
 of the hair down 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.180
 we know releasing the segments in the braid 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.170
 and we will be dealing with a league 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.170
 little 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.860
 we will be joining the two braids in the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.860
 back with a small league 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.380
 we will be releasing the segments above 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.310
 equally of the braid to make it a 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.310
 little bit wider 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.360
 and here is the hairstyle 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.489
 to give a final touch to the hairstyle 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.489
 we will do adding a flower 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.120
 and girls ready this hairstyle I hope that 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.980

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.980
