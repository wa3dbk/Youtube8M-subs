00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.460
 so now only a very important 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.030
 part for you that is the said evening 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.889
 what are we doing in there before we just stop 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.430
 one day before our actual 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.449
 wedding entry into the program what we 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.830
 is've already done in the run 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.300
 Finally, to look if the location 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.580
 not here in the region is what he is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.650
 in our case, just the case 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.609
 then we have already in advance 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.289
 informed about where we can 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.400
 possibly make pictures that means so 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.740
 if it is far away we are 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.809
 Of course google has to go there 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 maps and street view our friend there 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.780
 Let's see what can there 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.879
 There are also great things to be done 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.430
 portal just like the photo community 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.070
 flickr and you can assume that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 some photographer has been there once 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.770
 there used to be a bad idea 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.590
 you should then on the spot once 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.820
 postcards look because the people that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.440
 but we are usually then always 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 so close before that we did not 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.850
 postcards buy the part but for you 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.590
 very important what am I doing in the evening 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 before, because the evening before it is just 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 so very important for yourself 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.860
 to send again that means for 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.180
 It means that we are watching, of course 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.900
 the equipment is ready as far as the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.670
 charged batteries 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.960
 the memory cards ready to stop 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.310
 then take pictures 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.430
 but other things as well 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.049
 hotel reservations that stands or whatever 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.840
 maybe it is very advisable again 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.130
 to call the organization that is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.930
 So in this case either the bride and groom 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.299
 to ask again if something 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.130
 on the schedule has changed we stop 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.570
 just to do with brides the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 are also very nervous and the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.509
 Most are very very nervous that is 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.759
 So if there are initially dates postponed 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.259
 Be specially at the hairdresser before 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.790
 and then just one hour 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.189
 comes later and actually already the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.630
 is already brewing through is rather 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.549
 unfavorable therefore again asks the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.990
 Bruthren if it is the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.490
 contact persons are with us are 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.710
 often also wedding planner the stop 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.509
 just then so the updated lists 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.140
 or just weaken in others 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.880
 ceremonies master 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.680
 so, who is just then to mourn 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.300
 so to speak, the one who is just 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.979
 still a lot makes the once before 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.830
 call made look gives you too 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.690
 your own safety exactly and with 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.760
 you actually start this security 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.810
 very good in the day if it is not the 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.010
 evening before, but maybe two 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.869
 days before because that flies or 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.600
 the procedure is the same 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.820
 It is important that all these things 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.380
 afterwards together they are together 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.239
 that you the bride and groom again 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.950
 have personally contacted in 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.239
 some form with that there as well 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.760
 this security is you on the 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:27.140
 away you are in anticipation of this day 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.120
 and that's pretty easy 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.040
 and you are sure you start with that 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.290
 equipment that in turn makes us 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.489
 blessing 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.140
 he takes care of everything 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.910
 every battery is charged that the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.680
 camera is prepared that there 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.150
 Battery is in it that the cards are in it 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.290
 that they are empty all just 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.640
 So I just do not need it 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.870
 For me, that's a dream come true 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.660
 you have to do it alone 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.250
 just do not mature for her side 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.690
 Of course it's very personal to me personally 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.300
 nice i take my bag and 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.769
 decrypted and can hold for it 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.690
 Another part just not so suitcase pack 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.739
 is again a great thing but how did 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.049
 so everyone has that ultimately one 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.400
 Division is also not a measure 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.019
 now to you because we know it 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.390
 not better or the like but it 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.890
 just as a small tip with because too 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.950
 such mistakes have already happened to us 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.989
 So we are too late 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.190
 but unfortunately I knew that 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.760
 not we were not right 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.110
 informed 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.700
 and that's a bit too 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.049
 relaxed we have this in this 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.660
 case namely get there we sat in 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.579
 car and the phone rings 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.230
 We thought we had an hour before 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.989
 still everything in the green area but the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.000
 Bride Groom called us directly already 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.690
 from the registry office and asked where we were 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.160
 then stay 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.390
 because you could no longer respond to 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.709
 but it was not ours in the end 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.910
 fault 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.799
 so far everything is still pretty good 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.970
 We have no pictures of 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.299
 the work 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.560
 So now do it for you, I think 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.450
 actually a very good thing 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.200
 before even call briefly to the then 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.280
 to think 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.900
 maybe you make yourself one too 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.760
 small list finished if you like it 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.570
 not quite a lot of experience in it is 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.400
 it always very helpful 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.530
 once I have a short query all these 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.470
 things and then the day just can 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.350
 would be wonderful 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.060
 it helps in any case, inasmuch as 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.620
 I myself very well he organizes 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.060
 it is so the day has its 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.650
 momentum it always changes 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.810
 but again if I myself 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.970
 the process knows relatively well and me 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.830
 even in advance not so press then 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.960
 that is essential for me, so to speak 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.530
 easier to respond and it 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.049
 is just great so that's her for 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.370
 you have your route planning now 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.140
 He also finds the way and punctually 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.420
 Arrive you have your schedule 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.980
 you have all the special requests with you 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.240
 you have to check on weather again 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.610
 watched how the weather gets 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.080
 If it rains you have the plan b for 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.850
 you either have it all over 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.380
 trunk full of white screen or 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.040
 you've already thought about where you are 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.840
 you can have internal pictures 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.250
 generally all these eventualities for 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.940
 you exhausted as much as any 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.770
 is possible 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.360
 you have the janka with it if it is 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.740
 motto wedding is and the whole in 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.180
 which takes place under equal with that 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.620
 He is not the only suit since or 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.590
 according to the clothing regulations 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.290
 are you well equipped you have yours 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.910
 equipment checked and if you have someone 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.169
 how mature you have then that one 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.890
 Everything is prepared that it only 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.080

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.690
