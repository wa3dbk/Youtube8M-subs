don't have the luxury of being able to

take our time to take a shot the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.090 
take our time to take a shot the
difference<00:00:47.820> between<00:00:48.019> soldiering<00:00:49.019> and<00:00:49.260> your

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
difference between soldiering and your

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
difference between soldiering and your
average<00:00:50.580> barroom<00:00:51.300> brawler<00:00:51.630> I<00:00:51.750> guess<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
average barroom brawler I guess is the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
average barroom brawler I guess is the
intention<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.220> kill<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.910> become<00:00:54.270> more<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
intention to kill you become more of a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.979 
intention to kill you become more of a
hunter<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.860> become<00:00:56.190> someone<00:00:57.030> who<00:00:57.360> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
hunter and you become someone who is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.420 
hunter and you become someone who is
there<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.620> kill<00:00:59.040> someone

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
there to kill someone

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.950 
there to kill someone
and<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.790> your<00:00:59.969> mindset<00:01:00.270> becomes<00:01:00.719> very

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and so your mindset becomes very

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.660 
and so your mindset becomes very
different<00:01:03.770> so<00:01:04.770> I<00:01:04.830> suppose<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.220> order<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.520> get

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
different so I suppose in order to get

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.350 
different so I suppose in order to get
into<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.940> job

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
into the job

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.490 
into the job
emotionally<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.290> able<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
emotionally you have to be able to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.180 
emotionally you have to be able to
distance<00:01:07.950> yourself<00:01:08.430> from<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:09.600> task<00:01:09.840> at<00:01:09.990> hand

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
distance yourself from the task at hand
