00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
course a lot of people really keep

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.320 
course a lot of people really keep
coming<00:02:18.450> back<00:02:18.569> for<00:02:18.780> other<00:02:18.840> multi

coming back for other multi
their<00:02:19.450> component<00:02:20.020> for<00:02:20.140> various<00:02:20.470> games<00:02:21.510> so

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
their component for various games so

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.100 
their component for various games so
it's<00:02:23.230> definitely<00:02:23.620> sad<00:02:23.920> news<00:02:24.160> but<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:25.110> don't

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
it's definitely sad news but I don't

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.210 
it's definitely sad news but I don't
think<00:02:26.230> we<00:02:26.290> should<00:02:26.320> be<00:02:26.500> too<00:02:26.680> mad<00:02:26.920> at<00:02:27.130> the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
think we should be too mad at the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.520 
think we should be too mad at the
developers<00:02:27.730> or<00:02:27.910> mad<00:02:28.060> at<00:02:28.180> Sony<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:29.170> can't

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
developers or mad at Sony I can't

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.040 
developers or mad at Sony I can't
imagine<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.820> numbers<00:02:31.300> for<00:02:31.570> these<00:02:31.690> games

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
imagine that the numbers for these games

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.830 
imagine that the numbers for these games
were<00:02:32.380> high<00:02:32.590> enough<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:33.790> basically<00:02:34.150> pay<00:02:34.540> for

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
were high enough to basically pay for

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.600 
were high enough to basically pay for
the<00:02:34.960> costs<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.590> actually<00:02:35.710> keeping<00:02:36.340> them<00:02:36.490> open

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
the costs of actually keeping them open

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.450 
the costs of actually keeping them open
so<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.600> definitely<00:02:37.900> feel<00:02:38.530> your<00:02:38.770> feels<00:02:39.070> about

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
so I definitely feel your feels about

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.790 
so I definitely feel your feels about
losing<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.030> game<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.480> love<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:41.560> kind

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
losing a game that you love you can kind

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.260 
losing a game that you love you can kind
of<00:02:41.890> understand<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:42.700> probably<00:02:43.060> wasn't

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
of understand that this probably wasn't

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.800 
of understand that this probably wasn't
a<00:02:43.590> easy<00:02:44.590> decision<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.460> make<00:02:45.820> for<00:02:45.850> anyone<00:02:46.630> on

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
a easy decision to make for anyone on

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.770 
a easy decision to make for anyone on
the<00:02:47.350> other<00:02:47.530> side<00:02:47.860> of<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.190> fence<00:02:48.570> still<00:02:49.570> though

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the other side of the fence still though

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.260 
the other side of the fence still though
I<00:02:50.020> would<00:02:50.290> be<00:02:50.410> curious<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.890> know<00:02:51.310> how<00:02:51.940> many<00:02:51.970> of

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
I would be curious to know how many of

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.640 
I would be curious to know how many of
you<00:02:52.390> are<00:02:52.480> actually<00:02:52.810> going<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.080> be<00:02:53.170> affected<00:02:53.620> by
