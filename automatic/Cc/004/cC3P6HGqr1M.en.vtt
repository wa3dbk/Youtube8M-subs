00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 or the Caesar cherubs or cane question 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello jose I'm sorry if I bother you but 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.150
 what kind of lighting do I need for my 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.610
 aquarium measures 43 centimeters of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.280
 high with 5 centimeters of gravel and 4 of 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.980
 the surface for my apple snail 60 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.900
 long and 32 centimeters wide the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.359
 plants that I plan to play ringing lives 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.570
 with genesis valley without wounds in what 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.820
 ace the monier cup and adding co2 and not 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590
 I have nutritious substrate only with balls 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.750
 of clay with nutrients thinks to fertilize 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.820
 and safe liquid fertilizer the fish that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.000
 they may want to go are neon grupies 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.500
 platis siphon molist barbo or bar bus 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.820
 Tiger 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 these are the fish you can buy 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.840
 What fish do you recommend for me? 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.789
 I mentioned and what kind of temperature the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.559
 filter that I have is with hair or sponge 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.570
 thick that can acquire tubes 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.070
 fluorescent just to the extent of my 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.079
 philips brand aquarium 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.760
 again I hope I have not bothered you anymore 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.470
 that are many questions I hope that 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.480
 answer to say you are going to ride a 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.160
 good aquarium of 80 liters and everything seems 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.110
 be fine although you already know that the filter 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.000
 could be improved and as long as you have that 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.950
 you should put ceramic beads 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.510
 or something that replaces it if the fertilizer 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.729
 liquid is what is there is better than nothing 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.710
 and among all those fish I think what 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.720
 it would be better to start with platis guti 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.820
 see then later you could 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.820
 try to put molist and if your water has 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.800
 a ph and a gh means or pulling to low 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.660
 you could also try it with lions 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.340
 who advised against the long tiger because 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.530
 they are very nervous and would attack the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.690
 most of the fish which would limit 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.020
 much your chances to choose 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.789
 only if pit platis bryant bustillo 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.160
 says I think it's a question that we 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.500
 many of us are interested at what time 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.440
 will you feed your fish I give them to 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.990
 3 and 8 o'clock in the afternoon is fine for 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.520
 fish is basic to eat a two or three 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.770
 times a day according to the aquarium that 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.020
 have the most normal thing is to give them two 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.880
 times a day in small amount to be 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.710
 possible one in the morning and one in the 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.810
 late especially if they are fry 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.340
 I usually give him my fish breakfast 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.770
 about eleven what is 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.719
 they wake up and then today is a 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.399
 second intake around five o'clock 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.170
 in the afternoon I like to think that the 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.969
 breakfast is equally important for 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.099
 fish that for people besides 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.560
 doing this regularly you see him 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.690
 the most annotated fish Luciano Mendez says 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.790
 it is bad that during the day the light passes 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.280
 of the aquarium lit without turning off I have 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.440
 a few plants greetings the light of the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.110
 aquariums should not exceed 8 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.269
 hours daily lit and sometimes even 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.980
 even at 6 hours the explanation is that 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.230
 you would get very hard seaweed from 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.090
 remove the leaves of the plants at 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.209
 aquarium walls and objects that 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.819
 is in the manuel he says hello two days ago 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.680
 I bought a ramires and I see little color and 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.750
 today he has not eaten and he also has the tail 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.120
 folded always in my 60's aquarium 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.590
 liters I also have a red beta that what 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.629
 I had to put in a farrowing 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.849
 because ramirez was approaching yes and he was 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.890
 they opened their guts and I read that that 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.170
 do when you feel threatened or to 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.700
 defend myself I would like you to tell me if 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.560
 There is some medication to improve your 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.720
 color or if it is improved only when it 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.430
 get used to the new aquarium I would like 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.500
 also know if it is male or female and 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.810
 I have doubts here I leave the link 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.610
 so you see it 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.190
 you ramirez if you urgently need 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.849
 water changes of 50% once a 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.500
 week 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.480
 especially if you're not used to doing 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.459
 They are very sensitive to that topic your 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.410
 fish a female the males have a few 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.330
 skewers in the upper fin lack 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.950
 black stripes on the lower fins and 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.750
 its round black spot does not have 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.700
 blue spots however the female 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.950
 It has a pink belly, as is your case 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.780
 black stripes on the lower fins and 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.519
 It does not have these spikes up well 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.500
 that the black circle if it has some 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.209
 little blue dots you have done well separating 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.340
 beta but it would not last long in that 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.080
 container and you will need another aquarium and 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.030
 if you can not be, you should give it so that 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.620
 live better luck like de ramÃ­rez and me 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.260
 Moran has not released the Bible but not 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.780
 nothing happens finally says hello jose I 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.340
 made with a 100-liter aquarium this 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.319
 second hand and I think I've found a 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.900
 good coach tank for 75 euros and 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.400
 includes two resistors filter 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.980
 heaters three trunks three stones 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.140
 volcanic and a white one several siphon 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.060
 liquid plant fertilizer elimination 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.040
 chlorine and so on books and some things 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.959
 more than surely I forget here 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.459
 come my first doubts I've been 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.720
 reading something on the net how to clean 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.760
 an aquarium that has been used 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.220
 previously by another person but not 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.750
 It has clarified a lot 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.220
 in some places it says that for 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.990
 disinfect the aquarium well 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.910
 use a little energy without soap to 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.470
 disinfect the aquarium whenever 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.630
 It is clear but it gives me a bit of 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.310
 roll up what do you think the crystals 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.470
 they have a bit of dirt I imagine 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.030
 lime development on the inside and 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.710
 maybe some trick is passed to create 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.780
 that society and leave my aquarium as 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.640
 again on the other hand I would like to ride 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.580
 an Amazonian aquarium with many plants 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.830
 especially carpeting in the other aquarium 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.480
 of 55 liters that I have is emanated as 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.820
 substrate and the truth is that I'm not 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.500
 all satisfied I have some little plants of 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.330
 alternating was king mickey and every day that 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.550
 happen they are more yellow and I think that 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.260
 maybe it's because of the errand that substrate 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.040
 do you recommend using thanks in advance 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.870
 and a gretting 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.940
 of course you have found a good your 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.160
 side I would not use a product to 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.840
 Clean the aquarium and less bleach though 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.760
 some people do use a drop 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.890
 to clean I do not recommend it is 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.190
 It is advisable to clean it with water 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.110
 tap one two three or four times or the 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.300
 that both the aquarium and the 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.040
 filter loads and gravel to remove 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.020
 the tartar during cleaning could you 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.850
 use a cloth moistened in vinegar 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.320
 although if he has been there for a long time 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.180
 will remove the first one if in the end 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.770
 it is removed everything just rinses well 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.180
 aquarium so there are no remains of 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.919
 vinegar and once full and in 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.360
 working as long as you leave the 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.400
 water level above the spot 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.320
 it will be removed, you can also pass it 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.330
 from time to time magnets for aquarium or 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.770
 a palette you can use substrates 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.990
 defendants as long as you put 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.910
 under nutritious substrate the plants 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.800
 what you have are intense lighting or 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.289
 be one watt per liter and they need 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.789
 abundant weekly water changes per 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.560
 what was not only a lack of his 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.660
 status but you should also put 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.550
 powerful lighting and also if your 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.430
 idea is to put carpet plants in the 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.380
 future you will need lighting of 5 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.940
 because they penetrate much more into the water and 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.949
 come down below so that the plants 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.449
 upholstery can be nourished although they are 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.370
 much more expensive and if you can not 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.349
 allow it in my previous video I give you 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.780
 a couple of tips to put them in a 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.940
 cheapest but experimental gold form 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.669
 or give us some pictures of your plants 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.490
 and a video and it says that you think it should be 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:13.710
 there are some transparent sheets this 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.419
 it has a transparent down I have a few 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.580
 very small animals seem 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.440
 little pikes stuck in the glass are 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.360
 transparent and move quickly by the 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.870
 crystal I have already removed several with my finger 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.870
 What can be 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.119
 i 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.089
 As they are plants, I think they are new 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.830
 It is normal for some leaves to be discarded 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:54.569
 while they adapt by doing a bit of 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.789
 fertilizer and enough lighting to 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.800
 they should not spend anything beyond 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:00.960
 the bugs are plan arias and things like that 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.430
 typical on the side that appear 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.409
 because the water starts to get more 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.969
 healthy and take the opportunity to edit it well 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:07.919
 but well we finished the video 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:09.539
 but before I go I'm going to show you the 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.400
 aquarium again because I love how 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.710
 it is at the moment it seems that the new 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.110
 lighting does not harm the 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.060
 plants neither the fish nor the aquarium in 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.699
 following videos we will see how it goes 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.409
 affecting this light to the aquarium some of 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:24.659
 you already told me that 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:26.699
 you use this type of lighting and 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:28.589
 it seems that it is working so 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:30.990
 I encourage you that if you have an aquarium 

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:33.360
 apart from your main one you try 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.689
 these lights and see what happens up 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.689
 morning
