00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.890

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.700
 grams of bacon 150 grams of sausage 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.790

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.970
 grams of cooked beans and washed presses 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.680
 the recipe, we will need all the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.110
 separate ingredients 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.610
 We go part by piece here I 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.970
 I have done with the calabrese already fried 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.290
 separated 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.290
 now I'm going to brown the onion 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.010
 I already enjoy that the pot is already shaken 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.040
 with bacon and calabrese to give a 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.830
 More on the onion, yes she already 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.640
 I'm golden 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.380
 Just like I did with the bacon and 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.930
 pepperoni 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.930
 now that I'm going to put the garlic 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:04.860
 when and if she already has pain when I 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.860
 I come with beans already cooked and washed 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.690
 I can not move much because otherwise 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:16.450
 he will stick 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:20.440
 so it's just for him to get the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:24.940
 I'll tell you what I mean. 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.170
 ready now we will mix all 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.380

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.630
 tomatoes and red and yellow peppers 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:45.880
 olive you prefer that I go 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:48.780
 stir carefully to the non-beans 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.780
 sticky 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:03.870
 and here I go to season with salt was a 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.870
 A little bit carefully 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.849
 I speak that he is Mexican because he is 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.650
 spicy 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:18.579
 he carries pepperoni pepper and the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:21.940
 always stirring with 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.690
 very careful this time to try 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.710
 see if you need any more seasoning there 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:34.780
 now last I'll put 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:37.650
 chives parsley August amount 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.650
 to prefer 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:53.259
 a light mix and to finish 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.699
 At the time of serving I pick up straw potatoes. 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:59.509
 this is homemade 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:04.639
 I like to do at home but if you want 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:10.819
 buy only the package and 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:17.439
 put on top of the beans is ready 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:17.439
 for you who can be punished with rice 

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:20.619
 White 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:25.399
 I'll tell you a secret. 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.619
 the patient himself if it is 

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:29.869
 No one but I 'm a lousy cook. 

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:32.569
 even my rice is one of those you can 

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:35.599
 play on the wall that sticks is really 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.039
 way but this dish here I'll have to 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.779
 do at home 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.569
 I do not know if the result will be equal to 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:44.929
 But I'm going to have to do sorting. 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:48.319
 I think it's cool and it's an easy dish is you 

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:52.159
 sees that the only thing is that it is delayed 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:54.739
 is cooking the same beans and then is 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:57.949
 It's very simple to play in the pan. 

00:05:54.739 --> 00:06:00.110
 separating the ingredients is ready 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.779
 so now we're going for the best rate 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.059

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.579

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:10.909
