00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
up next to the house I'll be more likely

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.940 
up next to the house I'll be more likely
to<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.460> out<00:00:35.579> there<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> scissors<00:00:36.149> and

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950

them I think they will they have a
tendency<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> root<00:00:57.000> anyhow<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:58.260> pretty<00:00:58.440> hard

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
tendency to root anyhow it's pretty hard

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.810
