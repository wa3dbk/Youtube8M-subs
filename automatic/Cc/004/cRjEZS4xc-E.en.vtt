00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.639
 hello everyone with you again max and advice 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.809
 by this frame 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.770
 today's issue will be dedicated 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.080
 shooting when mounted on the chest despite 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.240
 on this weather consider the shooting data 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.829
 we are using a bicycle 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.519
 probably many times downloaded in 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.109
 On the Internet, such vidos in which people 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.210
 riding a bike or any other 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.739
 two-wheeled transport removed here 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.220
 the fact that under their feet is just an example 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.390
 even in my video there was a similar situation 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.190
 Today I will tell you how to avoid such 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.840
 moments probably first 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.390
 tips will be useful for those who 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.269
 riding a two-wheeled vehicle 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.420
 bicycle cycle scooter what else is there 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.850
 the other side of the video will be useful for 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.859
 all who use attachments on the chest 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.929
 for understanding issues related to 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.300
 angle of view and so this way 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.039
 Looks like a standard camera installed in 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 mount on the chest while riding 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.570
 bike ride 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.210
 and motorcycle natural after replanting 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.979
 is anger and lean forward due to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.830
 This camera is standard installed 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.979
 laziness cube and bends down your legs 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.380
 anything except happens before 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.920
 you the easiest thing to do 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.640
 try to flip the camera 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.170
 configure and enable accordingly 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.050
 camera settings 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.909
 but no less then the camera will begin 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.310
 look too high up basically 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.590
 if you just lean forward 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.180
 may be interesting, I 'm glad 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.070
 I apologize in advance for the weather 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.979
 today is pretty windy and I have with 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.550
 no microphone here that was planning what 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.050
 black bird and take it easy here so the 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.759
 eternal still more or less normal 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.679
 heard and so how to avoid such 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.570
 situations and not beautiful angles 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.270
 it's enough to use here 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.970
 such a transition with the majority of u 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.759
 about similar cameras in the set of such 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.530
 river bundles already but even if you have it 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.810
 no, don't be really upset 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.570
 It is worth it to buy a penny in principle 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.000
 from us and either order from anywhere 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.440
 China is really worth such 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.390
 kopeck adapters like this 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.459
 looks like 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.150
 use from adapter and lengthen 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.150
 our mount 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.650
 that's the way we change the mount a 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.650
 now install the camera mount itself 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.790
 so let's see what we have now 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.270
 It turned out due to this lower 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.340
 screw 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.290
 we can adjust the tilt of the camera 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.540
 almost from the very bottom to the very 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.670
 top there is a camera you can run here 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.470
 so here so here so how as soon 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.480
 that is, well, now even during the tilt 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.370
 cameras will shoot the road in front of us 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.050
 for even more interesting angles 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.090
 which may not even be in principle 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.890
 associated with cycling or 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 motorcycle can use one more 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.140
 lining shoulder and gather more interesting 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.570
 a system of these two adapters 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.760
 using two adapters we got 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.440
 even more interesting system which 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.110
 can be customized for almost any 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.780
 angle of view now it is adjustable up 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.700
 down and left and right that is basically 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.820
 absolutely any crayfish you can 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.250
 pick up and secure with screws 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.650
 Well, at the end of the release a few examples 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.650
 video filmed using a mount on the chest 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.800
 but 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.890
 On this today, I hope all the advice to you 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.350
 I liked to shoot their cool vidos 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.730
