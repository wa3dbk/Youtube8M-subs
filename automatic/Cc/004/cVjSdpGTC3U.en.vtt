00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.910
 watsa everyone today we get 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.740
 found every weekends ears 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.389
 I tend to tend when we go 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.900
 to say there is news about 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.060
 Youtube 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.289
 I'm not talking about you youtuber 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.250
 and all in all I'm talking to you about 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 of the company 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.960
 we'll say specifically google because 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.970
 that google bought youtube this year 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 so much there was little information 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.119
 new information that risks to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.730
 my opinion to displease you because 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.800
 it's far from pleasing people or so 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.960
 maybe it'll please, but at least 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.969
 I find it rather strange even if 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.040
 this way of seeing things are a 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.809
 the case of two little youtube or rather 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.100
 google 1 remember it because for me 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.360
 it's more rarely youtube it's a 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.610
 kind of google video 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.309
 except that they kept the name youtube 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.230
 for for commercial reasons so 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.610
 simply and that he prefers to keep 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.230
 that name because it passed more 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.969
 cream and then people were not thinking 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.829
 necessarily go on youtube and tell yourself 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.780
 this is google that's it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.489
 it's just a little parenthesis that I 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.890
 put then actually it's the possibility 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.080
 in fact that could well be 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.939
 to arrive because then it's official 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 cited by by people who 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.159
 work at youtube but it does not have 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.590
 been formalized as a decision that 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.030
 will happen that will be done so for 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.159
 the moment we're going to say it's a little bit 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.000
 stand by and I wanted to talk to you about it 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.130
 because it's still so damn 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.990
 interesting and importantly because 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.580
 that you look at my videos where 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.350
 you also go other videos you 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.509
 go to youtube and well I think 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 that it is interesting and important that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.439
 you know a little bit about what's going on 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.520
 already level of this platform na which has 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.140
 enormously changed anyway these 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.189
 past years it's still me 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.590
 three four years ago that I'm on 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.750
 youtube and I've seen big fat big 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.130
 big big big change but it's 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.659
 scared like that you're like that that makes 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.780
 really scared between since then 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.220
 there in fact so youtube this plan would 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.840
 so on a new economic model in 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.250
 margin of what the platform already offers 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.640
 the aim would be to propose to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.590
 users so some kind of service 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.630
 paid subscription to delete 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.790
 the commercials of the videos I put you 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.700
 in quotation marks what was said by 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.680
 robert king who is the manager of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.119
 youtube business operations 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.489
 necessarily it touches everything that will be 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.270
 trade and / or marketing 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.130
 publishes 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.150
 ter six people and yes there it only 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.770
 just wants to say I think that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.350
 you understand that there will be a 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.510
 subscription system maybe want 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.740
 conceivable certainly people will choose 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.200
 by their own will 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.270
 by paying this subscription there well they 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.700
 will have the opportunity to no longer have 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.520
 of commercials on the videos actually on 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.590
 the youtube website 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.000
 with also is remember that in 2013 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.880
 and had a little this subscription option 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.110
 on chains that did not need to 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.610
 pay I do not know if you saw this 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.690
 kind of things but no need for 99 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.080
 cents to subscribe to a channel 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.760
 Youtube 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.440
 of course you can subscribe too 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.630
 for free but the when you go 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.820
 pay 99 cents you will not 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.900
 access this ads and everything is in 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.310
 does finally it's like if you 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.960
 pay somewhere a part of 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.820
 the chain is finally also a little 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.150
 down because you do not want more 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.710
 is also a little information by 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.020
 example me honestly I can not in 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.920
 speak now all the chains 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.960
 youtube channel can make their 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.760
 chains a little somewhere paying in 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.930
 the settings which is pretty scary 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.890
 but nobody does it because already 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.750
 nobody will pay 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.490
 and most of all it's practically 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.720
 everyone here is this a 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.050
 stuff that will fetch a little bit all the 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.570
 world 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.050
 I personally am not sure 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.730
 at all from this view of what's on offer 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.860
 I say google directly 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.360
 I think that besides the passage of a 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.920
 little application that is really 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.930
 cool good bah it's true that it's raging 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.300
 and a little youtuber because some 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.640
 part we are not paid we say like 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.980
 what is an application called 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.380
 adblock that simply removes the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.130
 ads but not the commercials on 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.990
 Youtube 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.390
 finally not only on youtube basically it's 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.950
 sure on the internet on any website 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.660
 well he'll see actually remove all 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.280
 these famous had all these famous 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.810
 advertisements elsewhere really practical 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.970
 if you do not have it you know 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.010
 not type adblock on google and you 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.860
 really go 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.689
 fell in paradise heaven without 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.849
 advertising and that's really some 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.349
 beautiful thing that's me I'm not 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.170
 not from this opinion there I think about these 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.060
 damage after I think that's me 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.170
 actually think before before before 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.239
 before when google 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.680
 finally had not bought youtube and 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.110
 when it was very beautiful beautiful 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.000
 unfortunately it's very expensive too 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.410
 the servers and all then the number of 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.479
 videos that are a bit of every minute 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.949
 it's really a huge number of 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.090
 videos and it's very scary and then 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.820
 especially it takes a lot of space 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.110
 a lot of electricity and where we can 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.229
 not laugh but it's true in addition to 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.789
 these same big warehouse with full 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.139
 of hard drives and where they orangis he 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.000
 save the videos and then after 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.039
 it's in servers and finally opens 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.090
 a big mouth this is happening for all 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.710
 mercenary people as if ever the 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.000
 video you do as you want I 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.289
 I'm on my personal page it's me 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.340
 I'm really happy to tell you what 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.900
 you think you know everything about 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.030
 comments do not hesitate to add to 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.030
 the next checho and saout
