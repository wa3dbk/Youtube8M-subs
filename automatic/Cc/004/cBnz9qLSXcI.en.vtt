00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.860
 pioneer DJ created for DJs and 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.230
 producers the easiest to handle 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.140
 x500 company has the best processors 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.350
 rmx-1000 flagship functions to simplified 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.489
 management and more attractive price 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.799
 customization and control 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.210
 several parameters at once 

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:52.239
 hand make effector attractive 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.589
 for live remixing or working 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.269
 studio including thanks 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.339
 free plugin 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.440
 two sections are designed to create 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.930
 effects bit and simultaneous 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.699
 processing using exit effects you 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.070
 can beautifully come out of the most 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.710
 crazy effect combinations on the right 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.720
 us stage effects like enermax 1000 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.150
 they are divided into two effects sections 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.429
 adding energy setos and effects 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:21.100
 breakdown combinable with filter and 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:25.119
 other effects and so on top we have a mod 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.939
 echo but from file and river bottom filters 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.090
 bass and treble zeus fall down and 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.950
 reverb down 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.990
 The device has two innovations instead of 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.359
 creating multiple complex organs 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.299
 control we made armies with more 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.429
 simple intuitively select the effect and 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.210
 turn the knob for simultaneous 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.189
 changes in the level and depth of the effect 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.710
 now this is a pen- sensitive handle 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.469
 which increase the infection of my actions 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.710
 with other parameters another way 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.409
 effects control function echo plus 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.689
 this feature adds a short echo also 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.609
 echo handle on the other hand 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.390
 plus battle can adjust the time 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.700
 given 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.440
 effect and tonic effects themselves 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.720
 allow you to max out 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.910
 creativity but sometimes beautifully come out of 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.770
 effects mode is not easy you can 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.530
 turn off the effect and leaving a fading 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.380
 tail but this is not always what you want 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.360
 mx has a unique click solution and 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.100
 hold the exit effects button 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.560
 it drowns out the music 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.990
 the effect also with this button you can 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.990
 add war break echo or backspin 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.459
 to the forest or by releasing the button you 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.980
 return the sound of the track but without 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.170
 effects it works great before 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.950
 break down in a you can also leave 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.950
 effects activated 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:58.510
 add all the stage effects and 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.730
 edit rhythmic tracks in this 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.810
 sections have audio effects at the top and 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.310
 drum machine down in the middle there is a handle 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.680
 simultaneously controlling both sections 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.349
 You can apply audio effects to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.989
 loops trance where brought change tracks 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.079
 using roll trance is reverse delay and 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.079
 offset 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.530
 gram machine has a barrel working club 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.150
 hi-hat and cymbals press any of 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.459
 buttons and this sound will start 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.919
 playable in the loop turning 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.599
 pen you change its size sometimes very 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.319
 interesting to add to your set of rhythmic

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.769
 like stage effects pressing 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.780
 Encoder significantly increases 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.299
 time setting as rhythmic 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.950
 effects and drum machines drum machine 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.040
 can also be used for 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.829
 create 4 and 8 bit loops click 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.909
 overdub and then rhythmically press 5 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.159

 sequence 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.050
 part of this loop can be removed while holding
