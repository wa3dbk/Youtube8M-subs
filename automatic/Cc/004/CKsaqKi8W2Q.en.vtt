00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:21.433
 This is the device on which 

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.637
 we carried out the reverse osmosis process, 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.245
 as a result of which we concentrated the juice. 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:29.204
 This is a membrane, 

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:31.437
 which served us to concentrate the juice. 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.767
 We put her in the cylinder. 

00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:44.914
 We closed it all tight 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.488
 and here gas was supplied - argon. 

00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:50.987
 The gas brought pressure on the juice, 

00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:54.338
 as a result 

00:00:53.717 --> 00:00:55.102
 in the reverse osmosis process 

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:56.904
 water passed through the membrane 

00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:59.230
 and she was dripping at us with this tube. 

00:01:00.507 --> 00:01:01.684
 The whole had to be mixed up. 

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:03.885
 The pressure that was used 

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:06.387
 it was much more than the osmotic pressure, 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.544
 in this case, we squeezed the juice 

00:01:08.544 --> 00:01:09.942
 you can say so hard 

00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:11.383
 that we were squeezing water out of it. 

00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.502
 The first cylinder is located 

00:01:15.502 --> 00:01:17.502
 our starting juice. It's pale pink. 

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:21.901
 The second cylinder is located 

00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.710
 juice after the reverse osmosis process. 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.400
 It's red and you can buy the juice in the store. 

00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:30.714
 The third cylinder is located 

00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:31.650
 just the water itself. 

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:32.971
 It has neither taste nor smell. 

00:01:35.977 --> 00:01:38.582
 As we can see, the process of reverse osmosis serves not only 

00:01:38.582 --> 00:01:40.680
 for concentrating the juice, but above all to 

00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:41.940
 receiving clean water. 

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.100
 It is used for desalination of water in areas 

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:45.940
 where is its deficit. 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.940
 In this way, drinking water is obtained. 

00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:53.450
 What is reverse osmosis? 

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:56.380
 In nature, everything strives to achieve a state of equilibrium. 

00:01:56.378 --> 00:01:59.270
 When we combine two solutions with different concentrations, 

00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:01.740
 after a while we will be able to notice 

00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:03.350
 that despite the lack of mixing 

00:02:03.353 --> 00:02:05.080
 the concentration in the whole vessel is even. 

00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:08.180
 When two solutions with different concentrations 

00:02:08.184 --> 00:02:10.360
 will be separated by a semipermeable membrane 

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.360
 - means that they can go through only 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.360
 small solvent molecules - 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.040
 we will be able to notice 

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:18.240
 that concentrations on both sides of the membrane 

00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:19.860
 after some time they evened out. 

00:02:19.863 --> 00:02:23.040
 It happened because the solvent molecules 

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:24.310
 passed from one side of the membrane 

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:27.040
 - that is where there were more solvent molecules, 

00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:28.470
 and lower concentration - 

00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:31.620
 to the other side, where there was a higher concentration 

00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:33.100
 that is, less solvent. 

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:35.680
 This is called osmosis. 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.840
 Solvent molecules during this process 

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:40.110
 exert pressure on the semi-permeable membrane, 

00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:42.560
 which is called osmotic pressure. 

00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:45.600
 When the pressure is applied to the system 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.510
 than osmotic pressure, the process will be reversed 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.860
 and the solvent molecules will start to pass 

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:55.160
 on this side of the membrane, where there are more molecules of solvent, 

00:02:55.157 --> 00:02:57.920
 i.e. lower concentration, which means further 

00:02:57.922 --> 00:02:59.840
 concentration of a more concentrated solution. 

00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:03.010
 This process is called reverse osmosis. 

00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:08.080
