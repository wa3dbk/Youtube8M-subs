right here is the cisco linksys e1000
wireless-n<00:00:26.279> router<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.859> this<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:29.070> actually

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
wireless-n router and this is actually

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.120 
wireless-n router and this is actually
now<00:00:30.029> their<00:00:30.390> entry-level<00:00:30.900> wireless<00:00:31.890> n<00:00:32.099> router

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
