00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
okay in this lesson we've got a

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.450 
okay in this lesson we've got a
combination<00:00:39.520> of<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.780> couple<00:00:41.110> of<00:00:41.460> influences

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
combination of a couple of influences

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.840 
combination of a couple of influences
first<00:00:43.090> of<00:00:43.239> all<00:00:43.390> our<00:00:43.720> riff<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.710> based<00:00:45.220> on<00:00:45.489> a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
first of all our riff is based on a

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.509 
first of all our riff is based on a
Chicago<00:00:46.750> sound<00:00:47.050> derived<00:00:47.500> from<00:00:47.680> Howlin<00:00:48.309> wolf

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519

the London sessions album there Hubert

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.319 
the London sessions album there Hubert
Sumlin<00:00:58.269> played<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.829> riff<00:01:00.070> primarily<00:01:01.000> and

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
Sumlin played the riff primarily and

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.390 
Sumlin played the riff primarily and
clapped<00:01:01.750> in<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:01.960> solo<00:01:02.260> work<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.829> so<00:01:03.129> we've

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
clapped in the solo work and so we've

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.040 
clapped in the solo work and so we've
got<00:01:03.550> kind<00:01:03.699> of<00:01:03.789> a<00:01:03.879> combination<00:01:04.210> of<00:01:04.629> that<00:01:04.750> here

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
got kind of a combination of that here

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.050 
got kind of a combination of that here
as<00:01:05.199> well<00:01:05.410> as<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.590> slightly<00:01:06.460> different<00:01:06.670> chord

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
as well as a slightly different chord

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.380 
as well as a slightly different chord
progression<00:01:07.660> so<00:01:08.460> originally<00:01:09.460> just<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.119> kind

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
progression so originally just to kind

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.730 
progression so originally just to kind
of<00:01:10.420> go<00:01:10.539> over<00:01:10.720> this<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.990> begin<00:01:11.110> with<00:01:11.259> in<00:01:11.619> the

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
of go over this to begin with in the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.859 
of go over this to begin with in the
riff<00:01:11.979> it<00:01:12.280> was<00:01:12.490> split<00:01:12.970> between<00:01:13.119> two<00:01:13.509> guitars

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
riff it was split between two guitars

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.749 
riff it was split between two guitars
whereas<00:01:14.410> one<00:01:14.649> guitar<00:01:14.830> would<00:01:15.160> play<00:01:15.340> this<00:01:15.520> first

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
whereas one guitar would play this first

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.990 
whereas one guitar would play this first
figure<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:17.020> then<00:01:17.590> carry<00:01:17.920> on<00:01:18.009> moving<00:01:18.759> up

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
figure and then carry on moving up

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.990 
figure and then carry on moving up
higher<00:01:19.180> maybe<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.720> root<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:21.070> sustaining

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
higher maybe to the root and sustaining

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.950 
higher maybe to the root and sustaining
or<00:01:22.149> adding<00:01:22.600> in<00:01:22.720> other<00:01:23.280> short<00:01:24.280> ideas<00:01:24.960> whereas

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
or adding in other short ideas whereas

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.609 
or adding in other short ideas whereas
the<00:01:26.110> other<00:01:26.229> guitar<00:01:26.440> player<00:01:26.830> would<00:01:27.039> play

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the other guitar player would play

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.859 
the other guitar player would play
something<00:01:29.619> like<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:31.450> though<00:01:31.630> we're

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
something like that here though we're

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.450 
something like that here though we're
combining<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.380> two<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.009> course<00:01:33.250> one

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
combining the two so of course one

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.340 
combining the two so of course one
person<00:01:33.850> could<00:01:33.970> play<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.360> so<00:01:34.660> first<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.229> all

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
person could play it so first of all

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.070 
person could play it so first of all
let's<00:01:35.950> think<00:01:36.039> in<00:01:36.280> terms<00:01:36.459> of<00:01:36.640> an<00:01:36.759> e<00:01:36.880> shape<00:01:37.179> g7

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
let's think in terms of an e shape g7

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.249 
let's think in terms of an e shape g7
chord<00:01:39.060> sliding<00:01:40.060> into<00:01:40.209> the<00:01:40.420> third<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.050> first

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
chord sliding into the third and first

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.339 
chord sliding into the third and first
string<00:01:41.590> notes<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.959> would<00:01:44.080> be<00:01:44.200> as

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:44.349 
string notes and that would be as

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:47.729 
string notes and that would be as
follows<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:46.090> moving<00:01:46.360> down<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.410> pitch

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:47.739 
follows then moving down to a pitch

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:49.589 
follows then moving down to a pitch
which<00:01:48.039> is<00:01:48.190> actually<00:01:48.580> part<00:01:48.759> of<00:01:48.940> this<00:01:49.030> position

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
which is actually part of this position

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:54.389 
which is actually part of this position
in<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.349> arpeggio<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.399> seventh<00:01:51.759> chord<00:01:53.399> so

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
in the arpeggio of the seventh chord so

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.639 
in the arpeggio of the seventh chord so
there<00:01:54.580> we<00:01:54.670> are<00:01:54.700> going<00:01:55.000> for<00:01:55.239> that<00:01:55.270> pitch<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
there we are going for that pitch and

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.660 
there we are going for that pitch and
then<00:01:56.890> moving<00:01:57.099> up<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.429> scale

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.300 

to<00:02:00.670> go<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.179> flat<00:02:01.390> 7<00:02:01.810> or<00:02:01.929> the<00:02:01.960> minor<00:02:02.229> 7<00:02:02.679> now

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
to go to the flat 7 or the minor 7 now

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.800 
to go to the flat 7 or the minor 7 now
to<00:02:03.399> keep<00:02:03.579> things<00:02:03.850> interesting<00:02:04.060> we<00:02:04.539> want<00:02:04.719> to

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
to keep things interesting we want to

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.599 
to keep things interesting we want to
get<00:02:04.899> a<00:02:04.929> theme<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.350> variation<00:02:05.920> going<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.460> we'll

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
get a theme and variation going so we'll

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.339 
get a theme and variation going so we'll
do<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.759> again<00:02:07.149> but<00:02:07.539> on<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.780> second<00:02:08.170> time

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
do it again but on the second time

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.800 
do it again but on the second time
instead<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.220> going<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.670> minor<00:02:09.849> 7<00:02:10.360> we'll<00:02:10.629> go

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
instead of going to the minor 7 we'll go

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.970 
instead of going to the minor 7 we'll go
to<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.170> root<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.840> damp<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.230> well<00:02:14.440> also

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
to the root and damp that as well also

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.100 
to the root and damp that as well also
in<00:02:15.340> palm<00:02:15.580> muting<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:15.940> base<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:16.750> with<00:02:16.989> the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
in palm muting the base so with the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.690 
in palm muting the base so with the
theme<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.349> variation<00:02:18.040> we've<00:02:18.340> got<00:02:18.549> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
theme and variation we've got the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:29.280 
theme and variation we've got the
following<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:28.360> before<00:02:28.690> we<00:02:28.780> go<00:02:28.900> any<00:02:28.930> further

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
following now before we go any further

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.710 
following now before we go any further
let's<00:02:29.709> talk<00:02:29.890> about<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.280> introduction<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
let's talk about the introduction the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.110 
let's talk about the introduction the
introduction<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:33.069> really<00:02:33.489> important<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.000> this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
introduction is really important in this

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.030 
introduction is really important in this
type<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.390> music<00:02:34.690> because<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.799> get

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
type of music because it can get

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.830 
type of music because it can get
repetitious<00:02:36.790> starting<00:02:37.450> in<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.630> first

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
repetitious starting in the first

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.440 
repetitious starting in the first
measure<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.470> repeating<00:02:39.099> consecutive<00:02:40.030> 12<00:02:40.269> bar

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
measure and repeating consecutive 12 bar

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.870 
measure and repeating consecutive 12 bar
choruses<00:02:40.989> so<00:02:41.200> one<00:02:41.380> way<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.590> alleviate<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.310> is

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
choruses so one way to alleviate that is

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.539 
choruses so one way to alleviate that is
to<00:02:43.630> begin<00:02:43.980> elsewhere<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.190> what's<00:02:45.370> real

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
to begin elsewhere and what's real

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.880 
to begin elsewhere and what's real
typical<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.360> start<00:02:46.629> in<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.930> 11th<00:02:47.319> bar<00:02:47.560> so

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
typical is to start in the 11th bar so

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.710 
typical is to start in the 11th bar so
that's<00:02:48.069> what<00:02:48.190> we're<00:02:48.310> doing<00:02:48.670> with<00:02:49.060> some<00:02:49.269> octave

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
that's what we're doing with some octave

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.280 
that's what we're doing with some octave
damps<00:02:50.200> also<00:02:51.010> from<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> e<00:02:51.370> shape<00:02:51.489> position<00:02:52.299> I'm

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
damps also from the e shape position I'm

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.520 
damps also from the e shape position I'm
using<00:02:53.650> my<00:02:54.250> 1st<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.849> 4th<00:02:55.120> fingers<00:02:55.599> so<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.410> my

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
using my 1st and 4th fingers so that my

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.740 
using my 1st and 4th fingers so that my
second<00:02:57.010> finger<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.459> available<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.269> embellish

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
second finger is available to embellish

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.440 
second finger is available to embellish
this<00:02:59.110> octave<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.769> first<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.190> all<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.549> beat<00:03:01.180> 1

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
this octave so first of all on beat 1

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.020 
this octave so first of all on beat 1
we'll<00:03:01.840> hit<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:02.200> straight<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.860> damp<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.400> and

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
we'll hit it straight and damp it and

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.259 
we'll hit it straight and damp it and
the<00:03:04.900> up<00:03:05.019> B<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.260> be<00:03:05.440> 2<00:03:05.739> though<00:03:06.040> we'll<00:03:06.609> go<00:03:07.150> over

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
the up B to be 2 though we'll go over

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.629 
the up B to be 2 though we'll go over
here<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.840> minor<00:03:08.049> 7<00:03:08.590> play<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.400> couple

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
here to the minor 7 play a couple

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.789 
here to the minor 7 play a couple
sixteenths<00:03:10.269> on<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.989> then<00:03:11.109> move<00:03:11.260> back<00:03:11.530> up

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
sixteenths on that and then move back up

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.690 
sixteenths on that and then move back up
to<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:12.160> full<00:03:12.340> octave<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:14.099> again<00:03:15.099> remember<00:03:15.670> to

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
to the full octave and again remember to

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.150 
to the full octave and again remember to
or<00:03:16.180> if<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.510> haven't<00:03:16.660> mentioned<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:17.109> to<00:03:17.290> damp<00:03:17.620> the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
or if I haven't mentioned it to damp the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.039 
or if I haven't mentioned it to damp the
fifth<00:03:18.880> string<00:03:19.150> when<00:03:19.359> you're<00:03:19.480> doing<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.900> and

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
fifth string when you're doing that and

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.870 
fifth string when you're doing that and
I'm<00:03:20.170> doing<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.590> with<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.739> pad<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.340> my<00:03:21.549> index

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
I'm doing that with a pad of my index

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.789 
I'm doing that with a pad of my index
finger<00:03:22.299> so<00:03:23.049> so<00:03:23.230> far<00:03:23.500> it's<00:03:25.319> from<00:03:26.319> there<00:03:26.530> we<00:03:26.680> go

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
finger so so far it's from there we go

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.470 
finger so so far it's from there we go
to<00:03:26.859> our<00:03:27.040> five<00:03:27.310> chord<00:03:27.700> which<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:28.030> based<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.450> a

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
to our five chord which is based on a

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.020 
to our five chord which is based on a
c-shape<00:03:29.139> come<00:03:29.829> in<00:03:29.950> on<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.190> upbeat<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:30.519> beat<00:03:30.639> 1

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
c-shape come in on the upbeat of beat 1

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.270 
c-shape come in on the upbeat of beat 1
and<00:03:31.299> damp<00:03:31.810> eighth<00:03:32.260> notes<00:03:32.620> for<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:32.950> rest<00:03:33.130> of

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
and damp eighth notes for the rest of

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.530 
and damp eighth notes for the rest of
the<00:03:33.340> measure<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.489> let's<00:03:36.669> hear<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.389> go

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
the measure so let's hear that and go

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:47.630 
the measure so let's hear that and go
into<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.049> riff<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.440> we<00:03:38.530> have

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.770 

moving<00:03:48.640> on<00:03:48.760> from<00:03:48.790> there<00:03:49.120> we<00:03:49.180> got<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.540> go<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.690> the

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
moving on from there we got to go to the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.500 
moving on from there we got to go to the
forecourt<00:03:50.260> as<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.740> blues<00:03:50.950> does<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:52.030> let's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
forecourt as the blues does so let's

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.020 
forecourt as the blues does so let's
move<00:03:52.780> 12<00:03:53.170> bar<00:03:53.290> blues<00:03:53.320> Attis<00:03:53.770> let's<00:03:54.010> move<00:03:54.220> up<00:03:54.430> to

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
move 12 bar blues Attis let's move up to

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.710 
move 12 bar blues Attis let's move up to
that<00:03:55.150> position

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
that position

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.560 
that position
yeesh<00:03:55.990> a<00:03:56.200> Pugin<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.890> we'll<00:03:57.580> play<00:03:57.790> exactly<00:03:58.120> the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
yeesh a Pugin and we'll play exactly the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.240 
yeesh a Pugin and we'll play exactly the
same<00:03:58.690> thing<00:03:59.080> as<00:03:59.200> we<00:03:59.320> did<00:03:59.470> before<00:03:59.620> on<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.100> one

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
same thing as we did before on the one

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.730 
same thing as we did before on the one
chord<00:04:00.580> just<00:04:01.030> higher<00:04:01.300> so<00:04:01.720> that's<00:04:01.930> sliding<00:04:02.620> into

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
chord just higher so that's sliding into

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:14.250 
chord just higher so that's sliding into
the<00:04:02.890> ninth<00:04:03.070> fret<00:04:03.370> and<00:04:12.420> then<00:04:13.420> we<00:04:13.510> return<00:04:13.690> and

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
the ninth fret and then we return and

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.070 
the ninth fret and then we return and
play<00:04:14.440> another<00:04:14.740> two<00:04:15.220> bars<00:04:15.460> as<00:04:15.820> before<00:04:16.360> on<00:04:16.630> the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
play another two bars as before on the

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.550 
play another two bars as before on the
g7<00:04:17.680> now<00:04:18.580> at<00:04:18.700> this<00:04:18.850> point<00:04:19.140> I've<00:04:20.140> changed<00:04:20.470> the

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
g7 now at this point I've changed the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.050 
g7 now at this point I've changed the
chord<00:04:20.770> progression<00:04:21.250> from<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.580> original

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
chord progression from the original

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.270 
chord progression from the original
which<00:04:22.480> would<00:04:22.720> go<00:04:22.900> to<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:24.750> d7<00:04:25.750> and<00:04:25.870> then<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:25.990> c7<00:04:26.710> to

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
which would go to a d7 and then a c7 to

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.750 
which would go to a d7 and then a c7 to
instead<00:04:27.640> go<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:28.140> a7<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.290> d7<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.670> way

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
instead go to a7 and d7 and the way

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.990 
instead go to a7 and d7 and the way
we're<00:04:30.880> going<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.060> do<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:32.370> by<00:04:33.370> playing<00:04:33.670> a

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
we're going to do that is by playing a

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.850 
we're going to do that is by playing a
bass<00:04:34.480> string<00:04:34.660> oriented<00:04:35.410> riff<00:04:36.280> or<00:04:36.780> arpeggio<00:04:37.860> as

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
bass string oriented riff or arpeggio as

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.230 
bass string oriented riff or arpeggio as
opposed<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.610> type<00:04:39.790> of<00:04:39.820> riff<00:04:40.060> we're

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
opposed to the type of riff we're

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.670 
opposed to the type of riff we're
playing<00:04:40.480> before<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:41.080> we're<00:04:41.350> going<00:04:41.440> to<00:04:41.530> use<00:04:41.650> a

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
playing before so we're going to use a

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.050 
playing before so we're going to use a
slightly<00:04:41.890> different<00:04:42.160> fingering<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.910> make

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
slightly different fingering to make

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.330 
slightly different fingering to make
this<00:04:43.210> easier<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:44.170> is<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.530> chord<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:44.920> at<00:04:45.100> the

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
this easier that is the chord is at the

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.550 
this easier that is the chord is at the
5th<00:04:45.640> fret<00:04:45.820> but<00:04:46.300> we'll<00:04:46.510> finger<00:04:46.990> at<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.290> 4th

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
5th fret but we'll finger at the 4th

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.230 
5th fret but we'll finger at the 4th
fret<00:04:47.800> so<00:04:48.100> we<00:04:48.250> can<00:04:48.400> reach<00:04:48.610> into<00:04:48.940> some<00:04:49.150> other

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
fret so we can reach into some other

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.710 
fret so we can reach into some other
things<00:04:49.530> so<00:04:50.530> first<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.950> all<00:04:51.070> for<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.730> a7<00:04:52.300> we've

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
things so first of all for the a7 we've

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.400 
things so first of all for the a7 we've

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.040 
then into the 3rd root and minor 7 back
to<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.650> root<00:05:02.890> now<00:05:03.340> change<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.330> D<00:05:04.510> chord

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.189 
and then start moving down into the G
the<00:05:14.789> position<00:05:15.300> because<00:05:15.479> that's<00:05:15.689> the<00:05:15.930> next

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
the position because that's the next

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.990 
the position because that's the next
coming<00:05:16.469> chord<00:05:16.710> so<00:05:17.400> we're<00:05:17.580> here<00:05:17.819> for<00:05:18.000> that<00:05:20.000> and
