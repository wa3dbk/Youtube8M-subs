00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.550
 Good morning, sir, of the rings that Pedro 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.349
 vasconcelos and welcome another video 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.380
 This time we are here again in the series. 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.269
 daycare center indicates exactly looting in the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.330
 our marsupial to the end of the queue 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:27.349
 series and if that's what you get back 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:32.090
 what is not right and wrong is ahead 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.800
 and it ended and we won here it is anyway 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.399
 There is no wrong thing at this stage. 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.129
 I need that bizarre 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.629
 Ok I will not complain then how would I go? 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.090
 saying we are here for the end and yes 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.309
 so it's going to be a more obvious ending yet 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.469
 from our bandicoot crash series 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 we finally got here at doctor new 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.489
 and how are you saying that 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.300
 function battles makes this game is very 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.550
 difficult 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:06.869
 good let's see right ouch ouch ouch ouch with ok ok 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:12.330

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.180
 Oh my god, the pope drugs my 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:21.500

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.390
 damn damn wide our so 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.030
 thinking he was talking about that has been 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:34.290
 Difficult does not do this game is difficult 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:37.140
 Let's see, it 's because I'm finding the way. 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.570
 leaving it too late and it was 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.409
 out of the popular screen over here it will 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.040
 Adjust what it is, there it goes. 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.369
 not to his name and not returned to is not 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.250
 very bad is my god the sky has ever had 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.799
 because I'm very dumb or ok let's go 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.280
 let's go there 26 goals at home without 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.119
 still has three to get the drug to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.509
 and drug 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.240
 oh my god, but here is what it is 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.619
 This balance went up what there 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.750
 goodbye 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.910
 Oh my God , I'm going to die, so it's okay, okay? 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.310
 has one more standard of 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.020
 so you will only make unprecedented mistakes here 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.330
 guys every time we learn one 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.550
 new standard and we will not lose in the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.460
 previous standard type here 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.110
 here he has already caught the 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.870
 next boss that is what goes there and there 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.670
 will put off the screen also we're not 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.620
 so difficult that it will come up if 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.120
 There's a job we're going to hit. 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.510
 highlight here 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.970
 ready beauty there for a next pattern 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.800
 That's what he releases a pound. He's going to 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.230
 sign is not he the first then only 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.940
 Why are you going so normal and then go? 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.550
 although it will release one that will pass this 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.030
 Then it's going to go up and down. 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.190
 ok ok let's see here we beat 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.230
 here that year I could not get that 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.610
 another on the subject also the boot of 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.540
 inject his head 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.820
 come on, come on, come on, you 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.990
 ready soon soon and now what is the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.240
 His standard was made and drug 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.240
 the beauty pac caught got caught got caught 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.000
 got picked up like mother did not put it on 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.920
 pastor 2 what good now last 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.600
 standard as there is only one quiet to aaa that 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.030
 Beauty, guys, we got killed. 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.790
 neither doctor nor the cortex and zero the crash 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.020
 Is this nothing special? 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.090
 Is this what we've been through? 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.840
 will win will be 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:39.470
 I think with this they win to be a game era 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.690
 That's all beauty with everything on fire there 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.750
 in the back of the neocortex castle in 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.730
 flames and we're good with our 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.200
 friend who was kidnapped stolen on it 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.480
 I do not remember but not so long, I started 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.720
 this series is at the end of our series 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.930
 we go and she is fleeing in the balloon of 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.270
 of the neocortex crash bandicoot of veils of 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.850
 view it and created by not dog and everything 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.730
 and we will see the credits and the discredit 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.440
 I wanted to ask you a question 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.150
 You're watching this is the 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.640
 next you want me to play 100% 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.590
 I'm almost 60% and I know they have all 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.419
 the gems and all the keys to us 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.340
 find yet if you want I can 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.470
 come back and do that and we play with the 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.930
 people do a little stretching to 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.120
 life of the series now doing a zero 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.699
 to 1 100% collecting all gems 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.040
 They think Ram I do not know, I think they can. 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.690
 It's a good idea, I think you can 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.100
 like it but tell me there tell me what 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.220
 You find in the comments I should 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.840
 continue to 100% or not I 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.940
 accelerate credit for 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.979
 know what was in the end 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.169

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.320
