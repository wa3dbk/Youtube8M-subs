00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.960
 thanks to him the past joe satriani i am currently in san francisco en 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.769
 tour and I'm here to talk to you about the saturator distortion pedal 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.539
 develop with a super team of lackey fox around the world 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.339
 a work for which I of course collaborate actively and I thank 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.189
 really it's spring 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.369
 for whom he took time to help me design this holiday season 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 really fantastic but laments 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.310
 it's working with the designer team was broken of honor 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.400
 we put ourselves in the conditions of live with two other guitarists 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.500
 to test the pedal on several amp and with different games 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.880
 the engineers have been present sluggish with on the table all kinds 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.790
 of components this made it possible to test several possible configurations 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.170
 everyone can play in turn 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.170
 really I think that's exactly how it should be done 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.110
 with afp 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.700
 I love the holiday pedals 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.720
 I really have a lot and I think I spent almost 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.990
 tried 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.399
 it is necessary to be beautiful I particularly like the pedals that 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.840
 such thing but unfortunately they are no longer made in naples 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.840
 and therefore virtually impossible to find in the shops 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.690
 so we had stopped inventing a new model the redesign and an end 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.720
 and we adapt to create a new generation of effects pedals that 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.490
 can cross time and space 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.490
 then it's use both on stage and in the studio 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.380
 lucasarts milky way or to advance and household 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.270
 my work of stage and studio musicians makes me very proud 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 jan says with the pedals of adverse angry effects 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.760
 you know I play all the parts of the guitar among other melodies 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.920
 rhythmic parts and solos 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.170
 and so I'm really expecting a lot of medea defeat and all 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.360
 especially distortion 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.190
 when we play hours and hours we can go crazy looking for the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.009
 good setting with the fear of losing it at any moment 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:17.019
 the center must be really intense to play beautiful parts of 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.019
 Saturday guitar 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.829
 I believe so long the belt waits 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.509
 saturation is really a multifunctional distortion pedal that serves no purpose 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:38.019
 to nothing 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.259
 she can very easily issue the signature of her 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:45.089
 but he's also comfortable with more blues hip-hop sounds for 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.279
 rhythmic guitar parts jean to mobilize 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.799
 unclassifiable it is much easier to control than operettas 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.370
 which I used before thanks to these settings of ten years to come but 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.179
 its structure 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.689
 m 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.359
 which is also really great is its ability to deliver clear sounds 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.510
 crystalline 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.139
 when you decrease your guitar volume 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.139
 it took a lot of work to get to this result this pedal to 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.139
 an amplitude 2 0 to sendai even further it's a real pleasure to play 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.299
 with 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.470
 to assume them because the belt actor possessing is extrapolated me it is 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.839
 complained it was actually obvious to integrate this type of function this 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.019
 pedal you know on stage 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.599
 and I sometimes feel like I'm 10 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.689
 but in fact I do not really agree but without all 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.000
 distortion pedals while I have long since never come 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.650
 actually to exceed the nine points two points and what I mean the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.459
 bostonnais cure so the first thing I wanted to make sure of the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.689
 saturation is to have the feeling of being really at 10 on the 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:47.749
 distortion 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.629
 and even to be able to go further 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.279
 because in some parts of 31 years I really needed before the 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:58.950
 feeling of the head exceed happened to mark April 11 see above 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:03.539
 climate leader so we decided to incorporate this be a death 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.539
 which doubles the sensation of saturation and distortion 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.309
 sacrificing 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.150
 One is happy 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.640
 but it was really important for me but there are so many moments 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.370
 on stage I wanted to be own account + two presences or 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.029
 more volume 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.589
 no longer this complex chemical harmonic and distortion 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:28.800
 and that's exactly what gives the month switch 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.349
 for filming the prototype without residue dynamics problems 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.779
 having opened new possibilities a piece of glass in his guitar 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.779
 I could see it on the recording of my album 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.530
 audois and so it was during these recording sessions that I was able to 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.469
 measure with amazement and this distinction 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:52.039
 the change i said wow 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.300
 that's exactly what we wanted when we talked about some dynamic 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.059
 days before at worst 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:58.499
 hey target 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:59.840
 she wishes 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.930
 we learned that wall street switches not adopted was a little integrated 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.330
 because you make all these years I used pedals duty 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.680
 work such a coastal city that counted was connected 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.430
 for example a flan players a pedal wah-wah 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.540
 servette both are original 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.610
 nature 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.360
 the switchblade allow to link the euro rake statue to other countries 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.460
 d'albret does the rest 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.729
 they were assured their smooth reciprocal operation that put 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:27.470
 keep it 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.900
 with each original suspense pedal 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.139
 explore tower 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.139
 here is the red gold prototype of saturation 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:36.800
 r 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.500
 we decided the cell different prototypes by color 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.830
 red white rhÃ´ne do 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.159
 in the mouth morocco 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.119
 my duty these before sliding a unique identifier and well the 

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:51.810
 differentiate from not being there to tell each other 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.700
 by the way, it was the case and that is the slumbering law 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.560
 in the red the yellow and the black kelly here it is now in the studio with the 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.560
 very first belt wrong in my favorite color 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.680
 energy 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.469
 for 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.370
 important growth I'm not completely comfortable in all 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.830
 manufacturing aspects of this state 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.840
 the sound and of course very important to me as well as m all news 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.589
 features that we could 

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:50.219
 integrate and it's very exciting to play with the belt a little less 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:54.370
 the lot which was also very important because I wanted something 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.479
 from where freight of original 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.960
 and we worked a lot to arrive for the final result 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.340
 potentiometers 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.120
 until under x and even the color for four months we wanted to 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.659
 single pedal is very powerful 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:11.139
 and frankly I think the bet decor completely successful
