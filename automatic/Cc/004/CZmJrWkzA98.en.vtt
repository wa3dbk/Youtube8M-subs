00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.929
 good time of the day playing white against 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 rival from indonesia 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:18.300
 protect qaraqan on us here i play like 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.840
 the usual option with with taking out basically 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.840
 on t3 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:31.349
 I really like this system she 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:36.360
 quite unexpectedly for black right away 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.620
 put an elephant here so his words are wrong 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.770
 just came on 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:57.350
 to 6 departure seems to me useless and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:57.350
 so weak look horse until hold out 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.660
 letting down the boat 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 casio 2 horse through f1 he will go with me 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.510
 on g3 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.960
 opponent plays 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:24.660
 it is very strange while I want to bring an elephant 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.660
 usr again d3 loosen his king 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.250
 weaken the king well, most likely the horse 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:41.170
 fall on food larisa hell can not i sound 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:46.330
 but so well the king is weakened by him except 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:51.640
 he is weak now I want to go to them here 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:55.930
 ideas are shorter if he beats me 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.630
 black aching glorious king up 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.660
 weakened black glade now the question 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.790
 Genghis pawn or rook beat pawn 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.790
 so he could not walk on f6 queen 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:24.330
 so now it is necessary to bring the horse, I think 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.330
 most likely through such a route 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:34.540
 try to bend purely on massage 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:39.610
 icon on f6 page protected me 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.769
 point now you can think 4 minutes 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.670
 I have three full minutes 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.670
 good position 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:56.230
 until I bring the rook on and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:58.420
 on fright most likely so that he can 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:05.049
 it is necessary to ignore the series 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:08.959
 so too 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:12.370
 let's say I want a horse all the same 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:20.360
 salt and pawn for the pawn I will plant here 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:24.049
 of succeeds if he goes to them though 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:28.610
 they will go away what to walk on a horse 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:31.510
 I sat here must be very dangerous good 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.510
 find a victim now 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.480
 while he plays passive while by dish 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.409
 the second vine and basically you can 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:52.700
 sacrifice the shah for him from so take 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:59.629
 he can't be shah i just seem like this 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:03.549
 pawn this pawn on I finally can on so 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:09.699
 now what if here 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:16.310
 prepare and tinder or hold here 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:22.220
 put here got check and mate here I 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:24.849
 I will try while the boat here and he is absolutely 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:31.580
 does not think it seems to lose the queen 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:37.760
 so shah him one move here i am checkmate 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:41.570
 so I was forced very well not be the Shah 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.030
 gives and loses in vain he did not think 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:50.780
 it is not clear at all how people like them 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:54.800
 play does not think at all victory 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.620
 very easy well what can i say 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.479
 Now I will explain everything happened but 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.479
 The main reason, of course , is that 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:07.460
 the opponent did not think as usual, but I 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:10.580
 calculated I considered the options you generally need 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.120
 always at least one move count 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.840
 option to watch what can 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.840
 his rival 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.499
 while he thinks I'll show my hubs 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:35.460
 so I exchanged further maybe 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.069
 Of course the elephant c4 is not the best here 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.029
 a move because somehow it's like 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:44.879
 d6 comes and and i especially nothing 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:47.969
 we get but at least I brought 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:50.310
 black panic and if with you he came in 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:53.900
 d6 and then i brought black out 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.900
 chernokonk and to me it was more difficult 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:03.719
 there you are, let's say a horse called out first 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:07.169
 so I started with a black opornika poured 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:09.930
 all the pieces I wanted and created 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:18.110
 the threat of moto threats and then eventually 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:21.779
 the king is weak and besides this I am here 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:26.120
 weakened and black fields yes he gave up and 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:28.529
 apparently realized that there is nothing to catch 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.240
 black fields and accordingly my horse on 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:32.240
 it's a black field and came in the end 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:40.050
 He did not want to come because 

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:47.899
 there is a pawn like a splinter gets your 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:49.729
 the king and I summed up all absolutely figures and 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:53.339
 inflicted 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:58.110
 the final blow that is, could it 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:07:00.599
 earlier put instead of rooks 1 yes 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:03.509
 principle instead of rooks and one I could immediately 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:07.370
 beat the pawn okay let the last one down 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:07.370
 figure and beat the pawn 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.590
 and here in this position the opponent surrendered 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.590
 thank you for your attention
