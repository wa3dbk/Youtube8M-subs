00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
the I think samurai proud in this

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.240 
the I think samurai proud in this
current<00:02:40.570> wave<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.200> people<00:02:41.800> are<00:02:41.890> picking<00:02:42.070> up

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
current wave and people are picking up

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.790 
current wave and people are picking up
samurai<00:02:42.670> pral<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.450> rightly<00:02:43.960> so<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.380> mean<00:02:44.650> it's

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
samurai pral and rightly so I mean it's

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.610 
samurai pral and rightly so I mean it's
really<00:02:45.040> an<00:02:45.130> awesome<00:02:45.250> figure<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:47.020> they've

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
really an awesome figure but and they've

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.370 
really an awesome figure but and they've
left<00:02:47.830> out<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.070> lot<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.550> wasp<00:02:48.760> inators<00:02:49.380> but

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
left out a lot of the wasp inators but

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.260 
left out a lot of the wasp inators but
but<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.650> my<00:02:50.800> opinion<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.460> think<00:02:51.550> this<00:02:52.060> is<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
but in my opinion I think this is the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.620 
but in my opinion I think this is the
one<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.510> should<00:02:52.600> pick<00:02:52.870> up<00:02:52.990> first<00:02:53.320> before

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
one you should pick up first before

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.310 
one you should pick up first before

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.240

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
considering their everything of the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.250 
considering their everything of the
samurai<00:03:00.460> proud<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.540> see<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.840> samurai

tried tightening the screw and that's as
far<00:06:00.260> as<00:06:00.320> it'll<00:06:00.590> go<00:06:00.740> but<00:06:01.130> it's<00:06:01.610> fairly<00:06:01.940> loose

these<00:06:04.550> joints<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:06.680> become<00:06:06.919> tighter<00:06:07.220> but

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
these joints to to become tighter but

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.089 
these joints to to become tighter but
it's<00:06:08.270> no<00:06:08.449> big<00:06:08.630> deal<00:06:08.659> just<00:06:09.080> just<00:06:09.500> leave<00:06:09.620> one<00:06:09.860> on

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:10.099 
it's no big deal just just leave one on

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:11.830 
it's no big deal just just leave one on
the<00:06:10.340> lookout<00:06:10.639> for<00:06:10.699> that<00:06:10.909> I<00:06:11.210> don't<00:06:11.659> think<00:06:11.779> you

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
the lookout for that I don't think you

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.480 
the lookout for that I don't think you
can<00:06:11.960> test<00:06:12.169> out<00:06:12.409> the<00:06:12.560> figure

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
can test out the figure

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.409 
can test out the figure
before<00:06:14.120> you<00:06:14.240> buy<00:06:14.389> it<00:06:14.449> but<00:06:15.669> nevertheless<00:06:16.669> it<00:06:16.759> is

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
before you buy it but nevertheless it is

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.520 
before you buy it but nevertheless it is
there<00:06:17.720> so<00:06:17.990> it<00:06:18.440> can<00:06:18.500> be<00:06:18.800> a<00:06:18.830> pain<00:06:19.310> posing<00:06:19.910> him

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
there so it can be a pain posing him

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.040 
there so it can be a pain posing him
sometimes<00:06:21.530> but<00:06:21.680> all<00:06:22.130> in<00:06:22.400> all<00:06:22.460> he's<00:06:22.729> okay<00:06:23.060> the

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
sometimes but all in all he's okay the

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.469 
sometimes but all in all he's okay the
flying<00:06:24.319> gimmick<00:06:24.650> does<00:06:24.889> work<00:06:25.130> even<00:06:25.789> in<00:06:25.849> robot

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
flying gimmick does work even in robot

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.249 
flying gimmick does work even in robot
mode<00:06:26.509> which<00:06:27.440> we'll<00:06:27.620> see<00:06:27.650> later<00:06:27.770> in<00:06:28.190> alt<00:06:28.610> mode

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
mode which we'll see later in alt mode

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.839 
mode which we'll see later in alt mode
so<00:06:30.259> stay<00:06:30.440> tuned<00:06:30.620> for<00:06:30.800> part<00:06:30.919> c<00:06:31.130> as<00:06:31.310> we<00:06:31.639> transform

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
so stay tuned for part c as we transform

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.289 
so stay tuned for part c as we transform
him<00:06:32.240> thanks<00:06:32.870> for<00:06:32.900> watching
