of our fork asymmetrical system for the
WP<00:00:10.650> for<00:00:10.860> CS<00:00:11.130> work<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.960> had<00:00:13.230> some<00:00:13.440> good

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
WP for CS work and I had some good

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.320 
WP for CS work and I had some good
advice<00:00:13.860> by<00:00:14.099> friend<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.460> mine<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.700> Facebook<00:00:15.150> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
advice by friend of mine on Facebook and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.990 
advice by friend of mine on Facebook and
and<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.199> saying<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.470> know<00:00:16.619> hey<00:00:16.770> what<00:00:17.039> why

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
and I was saying you know hey what why

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.550 
and I was saying you know hey what why
did<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.240> do<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.570> what<00:00:19.020> was<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> point

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
did you do this what was the point

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.840 
did you do this what was the point
behind<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:19.890> whole<00:00:20.070> force<00:00:20.310> yes<00:00:20.550> thing<00:00:20.810> and

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
behind this whole force yes thing and

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.240 
behind this whole force yes thing and
you<00:00:23.850> know<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.119> my<00:00:24.240> world<00:00:24.890> you<00:00:25.890> kind<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.160> get

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
you know in my world you kind of get

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.529 
you know in my world you kind of get
lost<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.670> all<00:00:26.730> these<00:00:26.880> little<00:00:27.029> technical

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
lost in all these little technical

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.210 
lost in all these little technical
details<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.260> it's<00:00:28.380> true<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> market<00:00:29.039> might

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
details and it's true the market might

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
details and it's true the market might
not<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:29.609> understand<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
not really understand what it is that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.840 
not really understand what it is that
I've<00:00:31.349> talked<00:00:31.560> about<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.890> other<00:00:32.009> videos<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.640> I

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
I've talked about in other videos so I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.660 
I've talked about in other videos so I
just<00:00:33.329> wanted<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> hit<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> bullet<00:00:33.930> points<00:00:34.230> um

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
just wanted to hit the bullet points um

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
just wanted to hit the bullet points um
the<00:00:35.940> basic<00:00:36.390> premise<00:00:36.540> behind<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.989> four<00:00:37.170> CS<00:00:37.440> is

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the basic premise behind the four CS is

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.740 
the basic premise behind the four CS is
that<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.010> TTX<00:00:38.460> design<00:00:38.820> which<00:00:39.120> means<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that it's a TTX design which means that

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.810 
that it's a TTX design which means that
the<00:00:39.989> mid<00:00:40.200> valve<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.559> designed<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.980> both<00:00:41.129> push

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the mid valve is designed to both push

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.930 
the mid valve is designed to both push
fluid<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.829> an<00:00:43.829> meter<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.850> be

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
fluid and an meter it and it can be

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.729 
fluid and an meter it and it can be
configured<00:00:45.300> pretty<00:00:45.660> widely<00:00:45.899> inside<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.649> those

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
configured pretty widely inside of those

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.420 
configured pretty widely inside of those
parameters<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.020> what<00:00:49.020> we've<00:00:49.170> done<00:00:49.430> is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
parameters and so what we've done is

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
parameters and so what we've done is
we've<00:00:50.610> added<00:00:50.789> adjustability<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.930> not

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
we've added adjustability that was not

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.279 
we've added adjustability that was not
not<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.309> fork<00:00:53.550> originally<00:00:54.030> by<00:00:54.930> adding

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
not in the fork originally by adding

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.319 
not in the fork originally by adding
external<00:00:55.980> high<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.550> low<00:00:56.640> speed<00:00:56.850> compression

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
external high and low speed compression

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.139 
external high and low speed compression
adjustment<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.949> kind<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> augmenting<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
adjustment and kind of augmenting the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.049 
adjustment and kind of augmenting the
the<00:01:00.629> standard<00:01:01.250> top<00:01:02.250> adjusters<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.730> around

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the standard top adjusters and around

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.910 
the standard top adjusters and around
the<00:01:03.120> fork<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.689> four<00:01:07.200> CS<00:01:07.470> fork<00:01:07.740> in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the fork now and the four CS fork in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.550 
the fork now and the four CS fork in
general<00:01:08.400> has<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:08.670> lacked<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.810> effective

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
general has really lacked a effective

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.410 
general has really lacked a effective
speed<00:01:10.860> sent<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> bottom<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> control<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
speed sent to the bottom and control and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.940 
speed sent to the bottom and control and
its<00:01:12.869> various<00:01:13.140> versions<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.650> had<00:01:13.799> issues

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
its various versions have had issues

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.609 
its various versions have had issues
with<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.060> literally<00:01:15.560> breaking<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
with it you know literally breaking the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.420 
with it you know literally breaking the
piston<00:01:16.950> rings<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.439> allowing<00:01:19.979> force

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
piston rings to you know allowing force

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.520 
piston rings to you know allowing force
to<00:01:20.790> enter<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> floor<00:01:21.509> cartridge<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
to enter the floor cartridge and you

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.170 
to enter the floor cartridge and you
know<00:01:22.680> blow<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> caps<00:01:23.280> off<00:01:23.549> or<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> adjustment

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
know blow the caps off or the adjustment

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.160 
know blow the caps off or the adjustment
caps<00:01:24.570> off<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.430> we've<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.600> fixed<00:01:27.930> all<00:01:28.020> those

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
caps off and so we've we fixed all those

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649 
caps off and so we've we fixed all those
issues<00:01:28.590> through<00:01:29.340> our<00:01:29.430> design<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.000> we've<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
issues through our design and we've you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.120 
issues through our design and we've you
know<00:01:30.689> increased<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> duration<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
know increased the duration and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.520 
know increased the duration and
basically<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.909> total<00:01:33.240> ability<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> floor

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
basically the total ability of the floor

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.730 
basically the total ability of the floor
control<00:01:34.890> bottoming<00:01:35.460> modes<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.409> again<00:01:37.409> then

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
control bottoming modes and again then

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770 
control bottoming modes and again then
added<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.159> those<00:01:38.369> external<00:01:38.909> adjusters<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
added in those external adjusters that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.219 
added in those external adjusters that
allow<00:01:40.470> us<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.950> independently<00:01:41.640> tunable

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
allow us to have independently tunable

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.630 
allow us to have independently tunable
high<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.500> low<00:01:43.590> speed<00:01:43.829> compression<00:01:44.280> adjuster

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
high and low speed compression adjuster

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.340 
high and low speed compression adjuster
along<00:01:44.939> with<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> standard<00:01:45.600> mid<00:01:46.170> speed

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
along with the standard mid speed

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.340 
along with the standard mid speed
compression<00:01:46.860> adjuster<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> our<00:01:49.020> work<00:01:49.200> was

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
compression adjuster so our work was

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.609 
compression adjuster so our work was
really<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.399> polishing<00:01:50.970> off<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
really you know polishing off the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.069 
really you know polishing off the
polishing<00:01:52.619> off<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> high<00:01:52.950> spots<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
polishing off the high spots and

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.090 
polishing off the high spots and
optimizing<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> speed<00:01:55.380> sensitive<00:01:55.710> bottom<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
optimizing the speed sensitive bottom of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.679 
optimizing the speed sensitive bottom of
control<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> fork<00:01:56.820> has<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.000> nice<00:01:57.329> plush
