buy stage 11 trucks then you can still
watch<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.920> video<00:00:26.220> learned<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.609> lot<00:00:26.789> about

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
watch this video learned a lot about

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.910 
watch this video learned a lot about
deep<00:00:27.330> independent<00:00:27.930> truck<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> got<00:00:28.800> these

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
deep independent truck so I got these

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.810 
deep independent truck so I got these
trucks<00:00:29.099> off<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.880> 50<00:00:30.420> dollars<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.990> eBay<00:00:31.170> and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
trucks off for 50 dollars on eBay and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.580 
trucks off for 50 dollars on eBay and
that's<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> pretty<00:00:33.210> good<00:00:33.420> price<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.930> set<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
that's a pretty good price for set of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
that's a pretty good price for set of
trucks<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:35.040> our<00:00:35.160> hole<00:00:35.460> completely<00:00:35.969> hollowed

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
trucks at our hole completely hollowed

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.540 
trucks at our hole completely hollowed
out<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:36.930> these<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.070> forged

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
out like these so when you see forged

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.700 
out like these so when you see forged
they're<00:00:38.910> basically<00:00:39.390> referring<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> base

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
they're basically referring to the base

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.250 
they're basically referring to the base
plates<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> trucks<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.780> base<00:00:42.930> plates

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
plates of the trucks the base plates

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.950 
plates of the trucks the base plates
have<00:00:43.590> been<00:00:43.620> forged<00:00:44.480> which<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> type<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
have been forged which is the type of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.410 
have been forged which is the type of
way<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> making<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> metal<00:00:47.370> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.270> how

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
way of making the metal kind of like how

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.540 
way of making the metal kind of like how
they<00:00:48.600> would<00:00:48.780> make<00:00:48.989> airplanes<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.309> makes

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
they would make airplanes and that makes

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.520 
they would make airplanes and that makes
the<00:00:50.789> metal<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.390> lot<00:00:51.629> stronger

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the metal a lot stronger

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.069 
the metal a lot stronger
so<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.190> independent<00:00:53.789> cut<00:00:53.969> did<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.809> make

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
so what independent cut did was make

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.069 
so what independent cut did was make
your<00:00:55.260> truck<00:00:55.530> Forge<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.879> make<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> face

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
your truck Forge and they make a face

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.349 
your truck Forge and they make a face
plate<00:00:58.350> spinner<00:00:58.949> sharing<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.760> your<00:00:59.789> trucks<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
plate spinner sharing on your trucks and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.720 
plate spinner sharing on your trucks and
that<00:01:01.199> makes<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.710> truck<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> lot<00:01:02.309> lighter<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that makes the truck a lot lighter and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.240 
that makes the truck a lot lighter and
it<00:01:03.300> still<00:01:03.960> provides<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> strength

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it still provides a lot of strength

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.460 
it still provides a lot of strength
so<00:01:05.460> what's<00:01:05.820> hollowed<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.140> they

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
so what's hollowed out here is that they

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.649 
so what's hollowed out here is that they
have<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> grade<00:01:07.950> 8<00:01:08.130> kingpin<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.030> that's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
have a grade 8 kingpin here and that's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.039 
have a grade 8 kingpin here and that's
all<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.460> they<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.670> chrome<00:01:12.060> steel<00:01:12.420> axles

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
all and they have chrome steel axles

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
all and they have chrome steel axles
which<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.409> also<00:01:13.740> followed<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.610> look<00:01:14.820> at

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
which is also followed so if you look at

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.760 
which is also followed so if you look at
from<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.420> side<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> truck<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.590> see

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
from one side of the truck you can see

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.100 
from one side of the truck you can see
through<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> access<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.240> side<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
through the access to the other side and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.980 
through the access to the other side and
basically<00:01:20.100> having<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> kingpin<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
basically having all of kingpin and a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
basically having all of kingpin and a
hollow<00:01:22.200> axle<00:01:22.470> which<00:01:22.890> uses<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.220> lot<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.549> metal<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hollow axle which uses a lot of metal in

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.149 
hollow axle which uses a lot of metal in
the<00:01:24.299> truck<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:25.170> makes<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.650> truck<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> lot

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
the truck which makes the truck a lot

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.100 
the truck which makes the truck a lot
lighter<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.330> makes<00:01:27.540> your<00:01:27.659> board<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> lot

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
lighter and it makes your board a lot

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.080 
lighter and it makes your board a lot
lighter<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.799> kingpins<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.520> these<00:01:29.670> trucks<00:01:29.939> are

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
lighter the kingpins on these trucks are

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.120 
lighter the kingpins on these trucks are
also<00:01:31.640> shorter<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.450> by<00:01:34.290> doing<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.799> when

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
also shorter so by doing that when

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.160 
also shorter so by doing that when
you're<00:01:35.159> doing<00:01:35.579> grinds<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.329> ledges<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.960> rails

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you're doing grinds on ledges and rails

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.100 
you're doing grinds on ledges and rails
the<00:01:37.799> kingpins<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.759> actually<00:01:39.329> grinding<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the kingpins not actually grinding the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
the kingpins not actually grinding the
surface<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.490> won't<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.790> worn<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
surface so it won't get worn down and

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.139 
surface so it won't get worn down and
you<00:01:43.170> won't<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.560> stuck<00:01:43.979> by<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.549> kingpin<00:01:45.000> when

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you won't get stuck by your kingpin when

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.240 
you won't get stuck by your kingpin when
you're<00:01:45.270> grinding<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.680> also<00:01:46.860> dues

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you're grinding and that's also dues

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.420 
you're grinding and that's also dues
because<00:01:47.430> on<00:01:48.020> my<00:01:49.020> other<00:01:49.170> trucks<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:49.890> not<00:01:50.220> going

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
because on my other trucks I'm not going

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.730 
because on my other trucks I'm not going
to<00:01:50.490> name<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> brand<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:52.079> my<00:01:52.200> earth<00:01:52.380> truck

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
to name the brand but on my earth truck

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
to name the brand but on my earth truck
I<00:01:52.920> would<00:01:53.130> keep<00:01:53.640> grinding<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
I would keep grinding and then the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.660 
I would keep grinding and then the
kingpin<00:01:55.350> would<00:01:55.500> start<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.829> wear<00:01:56.040> down<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.399> lot

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
kingpin would start to wear down a lot

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.760 
kingpin would start to wear down a lot
and<00:01:57.000> when<00:01:57.630> they<00:01:57.719> came<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.079> wore<00:01:58.259> down<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.469> lot

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and when they came to in wore down a lot

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.280 
and when they came to in wore down a lot
the<00:01:59.070> nut<00:01:59.579> which<00:02:00.060> will<00:02:00.899> stay<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.439> my<00:02:01.619> thinking

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
the nut which will stay on my thinking

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.380 
the nut which will stay on my thinking
eventually<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:03.310> keep<00:02:03.550> falling<00:02:03.910> off<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.330> I

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
eventually just keep falling off and I

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.150 
eventually just keep falling off and I
would<00:02:04.540> keep<00:02:04.660> falling<00:02:05.020> off<00:02:05.080> my<00:02:05.110> board<00:02:05.500> because

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
would keep falling off my board because

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.710 
would keep falling off my board because
my<00:02:06.430> truck<00:02:06.700> would<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:07.060> completely<00:02:07.420> fall

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
my truck would just completely fall

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.889 
my truck would just completely fall
apart<00:02:07.750> so<00:02:08.320> with<00:02:09.250> these<00:02:09.460> trucks<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:10.030> kingpin<00:02:10.690> is

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
apart so with these trucks a kingpin is

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.450 
apart so with these trucks a kingpin is
shorter<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.530> won't<00:02:11.890> have<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.250> deal<00:02:12.430> with

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
shorter so you won't have to deal with

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.430 
shorter so you won't have to deal with
that<00:02:12.810> actually<00:02:13.810> they're<00:02:13.960> really<00:02:14.110> good

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
that actually they're really good

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.040 
that actually they're really good
because<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:16.270> nuts

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
because the nuts

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.230 
because the nuts
stay<00:02:17.320> on<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.830> doesn't<00:02:18.070> get<00:02:18.460> it<00:02:18.730> doesn't<00:02:19.090> lose

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
stay on it doesn't get it doesn't lose

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.840 
stay on it doesn't get it doesn't lose
this<00:02:19.390> grades<00:02:19.780> really<00:02:20.230> quick<00:02:20.620> which<00:02:21.550> means

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
this grades really quick which means

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.660 
this grades really quick which means
because<00:02:22.270> on<00:02:22.540> my<00:02:22.660> trucks<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.460> that's<00:02:24.460> worth

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
because on my trucks to the that's worth

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.820 
because on my trucks to the that's worth
kicking<00:02:24.880> loose<00:02:25.390> by<00:02:25.630> cells<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.260> by<00:02:26.380> rolling

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
kicking loose by cells just by rolling

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.470 
kicking loose by cells just by rolling
on<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.400> keep<00:02:27.580> falling<00:02:27.790> off<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.330> that

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
on it and we keep falling off and that

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.270 
on it and we keep falling off and that
would<00:02:28.630> be<00:02:28.780> really<00:02:29.110> annoying<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:30.010> with<00:02:30.160> these

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
would be really annoying so with these

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.850 
would be really annoying so with these
trucks<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.730> not<00:02:30.910> stay<00:02:31.270> on<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:32.350> your<00:02:32.650> wheels

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
trucks that not stay on so your wheels

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.330 
trucks that not stay on so your wheels
don't<00:02:33.160> fall<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.820> hangar<00:02:34.660> itself<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.410> really

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
don't fall the hangar itself is really

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.760 
don't fall the hangar itself is really
good<00:02:36.550> it's<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.450> really<00:02:37.750> smooth<00:02:38.080> metal<00:02:38.380> when

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
good it's a really smooth metal when

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.220 
good it's a really smooth metal when
you're<00:02:38.920> grinding<00:02:39.570> when<00:02:40.570> you're<00:02:40.690> grinding<00:02:40.900> you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
you're grinding when you're grinding you

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.920 
you're grinding when you're grinding you
get<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> really<00:02:41.709> smooth<00:02:41.950> grind<00:02:42.720> they<00:02:43.720> don't

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
get a really smooth grind they don't

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.080 
get a really smooth grind they don't
wear<00:02:44.110> down<00:02:44.320> as<00:02:44.650> fast<00:02:44.920> I've<00:02:45.310> been<00:02:45.580> using<00:02:45.880> these

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
wear down as fast I've been using these

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.460 
wear down as fast I've been using these
trucks<00:02:46.450> for<00:02:46.750> I'd<00:02:47.290> say<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.590> year<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.470> hardly

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
trucks for I'd say a year now and hardly

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.300 
trucks for I'd say a year now and hardly
any<00:02:52.110> noticeable<00:02:53.110> wear<00:02:53.410> besides<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.900> in

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
any noticeable wear besides the in

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.810 
any noticeable wear besides the in
avoidable<00:02:57.310> scratches<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:59.489> beef<00:03:01.860> okay<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.610> yeah

these<00:03:04.150> church<00:03:04.870> last<00:03:05.200> really<00:03:05.620> well<00:03:05.940> very

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
these church last really well very

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.020 
these church last really well very
strong<00:03:07.709> they're<00:03:08.709> very<00:03:08.920> responsive<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.640> like

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
strong they're very responsive to like

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.290 
strong they're very responsive to like
also<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.840> pivot<00:03:11.290> cups<00:03:11.530> don't<00:03:11.860> um<00:03:12.190> break<00:03:13.090> off

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
also the pivot cups don't um break off

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.740 
also the pivot cups don't um break off
like<00:03:13.690> my<00:03:14.110> other<00:03:14.260> trucks<00:03:14.760> typically<00:03:15.760> good<00:03:16.000> the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
like my other trucks typically good the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.660 
like my other trucks typically good the
bushings<00:03:17.200> I<00:03:17.320> replaced<00:03:17.769> with<00:03:18.130> fall<00:03:18.430> into

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
bushings I replaced with fall into

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.789 
bushings I replaced with fall into
bushings<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.570> can't<00:03:19.989> really<00:03:20.110> review<00:03:20.560> that

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
bushings so I can't really review that

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.610 
bushings so I can't really review that
but<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.670> trucks<00:03:22.000> response<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.140> really<00:03:23.410> big

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
but the trucks response is really big

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.530 
but the trucks response is really big
and<00:03:23.830> they're<00:03:23.950> really<00:03:24.459> smooth<00:03:24.760> turns<00:03:25.209> and

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
and they're really smooth turns and

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.660 
and they're really smooth turns and
responsive<00:03:26.290> turns<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:27.070> bit<00:03:27.280> harder<00:03:27.640> to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
responsive turns it's a bit harder to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.030 
responsive turns it's a bit harder to
get<00:03:28.090> new<00:03:28.269> your<00:03:28.420> base<00:03:28.600> with<00:03:28.930> your<00:03:29.080> trucks<00:03:29.410> by

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
get new your base with your trucks by

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.670 
get new your base with your trucks by
the<00:03:30.100> way<00:03:30.310> that<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:30.760> cheap<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:32.170> know<00:03:32.380> there's

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
the way that is cheap and I know there's

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.470 
the way that is cheap and I know there's
a<00:03:32.799> stage<00:03:33.040> eleventh<00:03:33.610> especially<00:03:34.269> they

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
a stage eleventh especially they

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.120 
a stage eleventh especially they
designed<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.049> so<00:03:35.200> it's<00:03:35.380> really<00:03:35.530> hard<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:35.950> get

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
designed it so it's really hard to get

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.400 
designed it so it's really hard to get
wheel<00:03:36.370> bite<00:03:36.670> yeah<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.209> trucks<00:03:37.630> are<00:03:37.840> pretty

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
wheel bite yeah the trucks are pretty

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.199 
wheel bite yeah the trucks are pretty
hard<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.620> get<00:03:38.739> wheel<00:03:38.950> bite<00:03:39.190> also<00:03:39.940> because

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
hard to get wheel bite also because

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.210 
hard to get wheel bite also because
there<00:03:40.360> are<00:03:40.540> high<00:03:40.750> trucks<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:41.560> yeah<00:03:41.890> that's

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
there are high trucks so yeah that's

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.080 
there are high trucks so yeah that's
pretty<00:03:42.340> much<00:03:42.760> it

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
pretty much it

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.360 
pretty much it
overall<00:03:43.630> these<00:03:43.780> are<00:03:43.959> amazing<00:03:44.530> trucks<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.190> would

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
overall these are amazing trucks I would

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.430 
overall these are amazing trucks I would
give<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.730> ten<00:03:45.940> out<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.120> ten<00:03:46.330> they're<00:03:46.959> super

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
give it a ten out of ten they're super

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.580 
give it a ten out of ten they're super
light<00:03:47.760> YUM<00:03:48.790> they<00:03:49.299> are<00:03:49.480> hollowed<00:03:49.930> out<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.290> you

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
light YUM they are hollowed out and you

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.470 
light YUM they are hollowed out and you
think<00:03:50.830> that<00:03:51.040> would<00:03:51.190> make<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.730> trucks<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.299> bit

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
think that would make the trucks a bit

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.750 
think that would make the trucks a bit
weaker<00:03:52.900> but<00:03:53.530> they're<00:03:53.920> actually<00:03:54.190> really

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
weaker but they're actually really

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.490 
weaker but they're actually really
strong<00:03:55.060> they're<00:03:55.510> holding<00:03:55.930> up<00:03:56.080> really<00:03:56.110> well

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
strong they're holding up really well

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.930 
strong they're holding up really well
I've<00:03:56.709> had<00:03:56.920> them<00:03:57.070> for<00:03:57.100> about<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.549> year<00:03:57.910> now

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
I've had them for about a year now

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.479 
I've had them for about a year now
there's<00:03:58.720> hardly<00:03:58.959> anywhere<00:03:59.680> there's<00:04:00.190> nowhere

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
there's hardly anywhere there's nowhere

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.660 
there's hardly anywhere there's nowhere
on<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.940> kingpin<00:04:01.180> because<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.900> shorter

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
on the kingpin because it is shorter

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.210 
on the kingpin because it is shorter
trucks<00:04:03.240> are<00:04:03.480> lighter<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.020> axles<00:04:04.500> have

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
trucks are lighter the axles have

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.280 
trucks are lighter the axles have
picking<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.730> few<00:04:05.940> where<00:04:06.210> from<00:04:06.600> landed<00:04:07.080> primo

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
picking a few where from landed primo

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.470 
picking a few where from landed primo
but<00:04:07.680> it's<00:04:07.800> still<00:04:08.010> good<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:09.000> still<00:04:09.300> holding

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
but it's still good it's still holding

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.480 
but it's still good it's still holding
