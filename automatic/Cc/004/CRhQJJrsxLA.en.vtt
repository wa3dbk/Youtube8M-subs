a<00:05:32.259> core<00:05:32.710> set<00:05:33.039> of<00:05:33.099> values<00:05:33.699> that<00:05:33.880> can<00:05:34.060> stand<00:05:34.330> up

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
a core set of values that can stand up

to<00:05:39.190> counter<00:05:39.550> it

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
to counter it

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.459 
to counter it
well<00:05:40.240> I<00:05:40.270> think<00:05:40.509> we<00:05:40.630> do<00:05:40.780> need<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:40.990> do<00:05:41.199> exactly

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
well I think we do need to do exactly

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.029 
well I think we do need to do exactly
that<00:05:41.680> to<00:05:42.009> recover<00:05:42.430> our<00:05:42.729> own<00:05:43.419> values<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.320> not

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
that to recover our own values and not

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.770 
that to recover our own values and not
just<00:05:45.340> Christians<00:05:45.880> but<00:05:46.090> we<00:05:46.150> need<00:05:46.449> to<00:05:46.599> group

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
just Christians but we need to group

just Christians but we need to group
together<00:05:46.990> I<00:05:47.349> think<00:05:47.500> all<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.729> victims<00:05:49.419> and
