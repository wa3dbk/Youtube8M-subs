going to show you how to make one of

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.610 
going to show you how to make one of
these<00:00:05.279> yeah<00:00:06.180> that's<00:00:06.540> right<00:00:06.839> we're<00:00:07.440> going<00:00:07.560> to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.129 
these yeah that's right we're going to
be<00:00:07.740> making<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.340> piston<00:00:09.330> door<00:00:09.480> which<00:00:09.900> is

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
be making a piston door which is

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.070 
be making a piston door which is
actually<00:00:10.290> quite<00:00:10.530> simple<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.360> to<00:00:12.360> make<00:00:12.540> but<00:00:12.900> I

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
actually quite simple to to make but I

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.189 
actually quite simple to to make but I
never<00:00:13.259> realized<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.860> before<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.780> all<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
never realized it before and all the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.250 
never realized it before and all the
tutorials<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:17.039> saw<00:00:17.369> on<00:00:17.580> YouTube<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.840> just<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
tutorials I saw on YouTube we're just a

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.890 
tutorials I saw on YouTube we're just a
little<00:00:19.680> bit<00:00:20.160> too<00:00:20.760> unclear<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.510> me<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
little bit too unclear for me so I

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.040 
little bit too unclear for me so I
decided<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.529> look<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.980> up<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.750> I'm<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:25.019> to

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
decided to look it up and I'm going to

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
decided to look it up and I'm going to
help<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.289> guys<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.949> too<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.400> case<00:00:26.550> you're

help you guys in it too in case you're
having<00:00:27.029> problems<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.750> first<00:00:28.470> things<00:00:28.740> first

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
having problems so first things first

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.310 
having problems so first things first
you<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.550> wrap<00:00:29.670> your<00:00:29.699> sticky<00:00:30.029> piston<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.750> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you can wrap your sticky piston and you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.240 
you can wrap your sticky piston and you
place<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:32.450> line<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.690> three<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.710> facing

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
place a line of three like so facing

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.869 
place a line of three like so facing
inwards<00:00:35.640> then<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:37.170> need<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.680> get<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.160> full

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
inwards then you need to get a full

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.600 
inwards then you need to get a full
block<00:00:39.210> distance<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> place<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:41.430> other

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
block distance and place the other

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.500 
block distance and place the other
Pistons<00:00:42.649> like<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.820> choose<00:00:45.239> what

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
Pistons like that now you choose what

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.810 
Pistons like that now you choose what
dual<00:00:45.960> material<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.710> want<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.399> instance

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
dual material you want in this instance

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.020 
dual material you want in this instance
I've<00:00:48.059> chosen<00:00:48.239> glass<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.219> you<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.489> stack

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
I've chosen glass and you just stack

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.319 
I've chosen glass and you just stack
them<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.510> too<00:00:51.570> wide<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.230> 3<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.789> now<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> next

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
them so too wide and 3 up now the next

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.200 
them so too wide and 3 up now the next
thing<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.590> choose<00:00:55.980> two<00:00:56.370> blocks<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
thing to do is to choose two blocks it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.610 
thing to do is to choose two blocks it
doesn't<00:00:57.480> matter<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.840> blocks<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.440> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
doesn't matter what blocks this is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
doesn't matter what blocks this is
because<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.250> where<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> red<00:00:59.969> stone

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
because this is just where the red stone

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.319 
because this is just where the red stone
will<00:01:00.420> rest<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> basically<00:01:02.789> that's<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.180> next

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
will rest so basically that's the next

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.539 
will rest so basically that's the next
stage<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.500> next<00:01:04.799> thing<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.159> need<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> do

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
stage the next thing that you need to do

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.929 
stage the next thing that you need to do
is<00:01:05.580> sort<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> dig<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> hole<00:01:07.010> or<00:01:08.010> rather<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.490> trench

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
is sort of dig a hole or rather a trench

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.460 
is sort of dig a hole or rather a trench
like<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.850> like<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.890> went<00:01:14.130> wrong<00:01:14.310> hello

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
like so like this that went wrong hello

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.719 
like so like this that went wrong hello
now<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.830> need<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.369> break<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
now what we need to do is break the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.580 
now what we need to do is break the
block<00:01:18.180> below<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.170> place<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> redstone

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
block below this and place a redstone

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.070 
block below this and place a redstone
torch<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.880> repeat<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> other<00:01:21.750> son

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
torch and repeat this with the other son

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.140 
torch and repeat this with the other son
so<00:01:23.720> now<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.780> need<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.229> dig<00:01:25.439> deeper<00:01:25.850> by<00:01:26.850> one

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
so now we need to dig deeper by one

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
so now we need to dig deeper by one
block<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.970> then<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.479> start<00:01:31.110> adding<00:01:31.380> our<00:01:31.710> red

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
block and then we start adding our red

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.730 
block and then we start adding our red
stone<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:34.020> actually<00:01:34.140> quite<00:01:34.409> simple

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
stone in so it's actually quite simple

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.429 
stone in so it's actually quite simple
that's<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.490> looks<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.880> from<00:01:36.060> top<00:01:36.659> now

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
that's what it looks like from top now

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.020 
that's what it looks like from top now
we<00:01:37.530> need<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> align<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> center

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we need to align this with the center

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.069 
we need to align this with the center
and<00:01:39.270> break<00:01:39.810> two<00:01:40.079> blocks<00:01:40.380> below<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.509> then<00:01:42.509> we

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and break two blocks below there then we

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.700 
and break two blocks below there then we
need<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> go<00:01:43.710> right<00:01:44.100> round<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> front<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
need to go right round to the front and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.100 
need to go right round to the front and
break<00:01:46.710> full<00:01:47.220> blocks<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.540> go<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.899> deeper

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
break full blocks and then go on deeper

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.550 
break full blocks and then go on deeper
again<00:01:49.670> break<00:01:50.670> these<00:01:50.970> two<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.540> add<00:01:52.049> more

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
again break these two and add more

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.190 
again break these two and add more
redstone<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.460> gaps<00:01:53.780> now<00:01:54.780> once<00:01:54.990> you've

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
redstone in the gaps now once you've

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.200 
redstone in the gaps now once you've
done<00:01:55.439> that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
done that

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.310 
done that
all<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.510> need<00:01:56.659> to<00:01:56.690> do<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:58.060> place<00:01:59.320> whatever

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
all you need to do is place whatever

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.460 
all you need to do is place whatever
floor<00:02:00.680> material<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:01.220> want<00:02:01.340> back<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.470> when's

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
floor material you want back so when's

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.260 
floor material you want back so when's
double<00:02:03.920> stone<00:02:04.100> slabs<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:04.820> I'm<00:02:04.880> just<00:02:05.060> going<00:02:05.210> to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
double stone slabs so I'm just going to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.920 
double stone slabs so I'm just going to
quickly<00:02:06.070> place<00:02:08.200> let's<00:02:09.200> go<00:02:09.800> there<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.640> go<00:02:10.930> so
