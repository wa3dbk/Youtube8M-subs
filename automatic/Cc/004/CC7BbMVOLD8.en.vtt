 styling tips on style on tv 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.540
 hey i 'm dennis kreuzberg if you are 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.370
 Want to see how to get in short hair 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.650
 conjure magic then you have to now 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.390
 watch this video and I will be you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.430
 show how it works so we have 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.240
 Here's a nice short cut straight 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.890
 hair 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.109
 we are a bit pretreated there 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.490
 We washed them and a bit 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.199
 Feelings first with a bit 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.000
 firmer now I will show you how 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.920
 So one died with the travel 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 curling tantle makes that is 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.950
 actually quite simple 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.110
 it is also very important here, the hair 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.600
 before getting through so no 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.260
 knots in it are depending on where to sit 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.760
 you divide exactly the vortex 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.379
 you take the curling iron I take 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.219
 that of babyliss you can as well 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.379
 take another 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.239
 the main thing that the heat again 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.190
 is regulated and that he is not so hot 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.500
 It is very important and then you share 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.090
 take a few c off we catch the best 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.300
 get on the service and work your way 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.160
 but now forward 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.880
 stick the hair tips with the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.560
 Fingering the curling iron put over it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.450
 that the hair is exactly in between 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:15.650
 then set about finger higher then 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.650
 turn up a bit 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.159
 you you just watch how strong 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.159
 wanted to have lured 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.790
 and pull it out carefully and the 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.990
 slack off founded very important and so 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.570
 work your way up now 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:44.540
 again a couple of them pointed stick 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.070
 turn well 1 and carefully with 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.630
 with the scalp that they are not until completely 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.420
 Down we are doing it burns 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.370
 you and then open again easily and 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.440
 pull out more here again 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.600
 a pass at the department you are 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.100
 not so one hundred percent because the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.800
 therefore lure a bit so quiet 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.570
 yes of course , and natural 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.490
 Curls are never very much like they are 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.630
 always a little different because of that 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.119
 you can also have a big time 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.800
 make a wave or a small wave times 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.120
 turn left to the right 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.620
 I'm a little more careful here 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.510
 I would like to have bigger waves now 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.530
 I'll go through this only once 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.840
 and out again and could also go in and out 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.130
 out again if you feel that 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.870
 that the hair does not evenly after 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.720
 show up then quietly take in cham 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.230
 and comb through once 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.120
 in between, expect a third 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.480
 I go back a bit and pull it 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.760
 because as out as I said here I turn 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.160
 Let's move forward so that's okay 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.530
 so turns a little bit alternately 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.390
 hold different directions 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.030
 screw in just turn it down here 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.660
 wait again for a short moment and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.550
 pull out 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.880
 Now you can just end the 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.630
 curl course 1 turn and out again 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.030
 The rear does not have to take the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.900
 same loose have as this is 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.980
 on top and on the front 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.530
 that's just a quick thing to do 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.400
 to get curls or waves 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.440
 short hair 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.569
 It is not quite there with the hair dryer 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.130
 so durable 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.230
 a bit more difficult there is the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.940
 curling iron already easier and also 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.010
 This style I would first 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.600
 Try it if you stay at home 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.970
 nothing intends to do that a bit 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.770
 practiced 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.209
 yes laughs like that and I put those 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.200
 bell city gone now we leave that 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.640
 cool down a bit 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.680
 I would be the same a bit 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.510
 style 100 you can see how fast we are 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.739
 have gotten into having too short 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.310
 so I came a little bit now 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.310
 on 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.590
 then I take a light cream now 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.189
 that it is not a wax, that is also true 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.930
 no gel and no cream but 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.099
 it is called mobbing has there of 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.590
 different companies that 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.390
 meanwhile call out is just 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.189
 a little easier than anything else 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.500
 disappears immediately in the hands 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.329
 and is very good in the hair 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.400
 distribute and you can apply the hair 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.060
 little style without it directly 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.060
 sticky 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:30.300
 so here you have a little free 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.560
 hand as with bloc are never so good 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.190
 that means it does not have to be so good 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.960
 lie 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.729
 but we also have to be careful that it 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.449
 Not too old-fashioned looks like that 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.630
 always nice with your hands 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.490
 by beating 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.060
 i take a bit of hairspray 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.660
 quite normal this time from bella 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.470
 that brings us a bit 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.470
 durability purely 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.190
 the advantage of curls is that the 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.810
 Hair color now a bit more 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.099
 the various blond werner shines 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.770
 the ones in there are now coming back 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.970
 a bit stronger to the validity 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.949
 that comes from the movement we do 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.240
 have reached now 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.099
 yes that's my curls and style now 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.900

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.610
