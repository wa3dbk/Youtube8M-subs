00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
sign ups and downs resistance until you

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.970 
sign ups and downs resistance until you
switch<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.390> killer<00:02:29.629> sparks<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.290> guy<00:02:30.680> doesn't

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
switch to in killer sparks I guy doesn't

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.640 
switch to in killer sparks I guy doesn't
do<00:02:31.040> much<00:02:31.189> damage<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.700> he<00:02:31.849> was<00:02:31.970> very<00:02:32.030> very<00:02:32.390> easy

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
so after that I'll need to jump over

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.210 
so after that I'll need to jump over
here<00:02:35.750> I'm<00:02:35.959> going<00:02:36.140> down<00:02:36.409> the<00:02:36.560> corridor<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.129> I

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
here I'm going down the corridor and I

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.339 
here I'm going down the corridor and I
will<00:02:37.400> try<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.730> do<00:02:37.970> an<00:02:38.060> epic<00:02:38.540> jump<00:02:38.780> here<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> know

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
will try to do an epic jump here I know

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.860 
will try to do an epic jump here I know
my<00:02:39.500> Hill<00:02:39.739> is<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.010> bit<00:02:40.220> slow<00:02:40.400> but<00:02:40.819> hey<00:02:41.030> guess<00:02:41.659> what

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
tank the whole group of maps so i was

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.920 
tank the whole group of maps so i was
thinking<00:02:45.980> of<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.220> jump<00:02:46.849> and<00:02:47.090> charged<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.720> the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
thinking of just jump and charged in the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.319 
thinking of just jump and charged in the
air<00:02:48.139> towards<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.680> map<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.159> because<00:02:50.120> i<00:02:50.150> was

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
air towards the map and because i was

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.940 
air towards the map and because i was
jumping<00:02:50.569> i'll<00:02:50.870> get<00:02:51.139> in<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.319> range<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.650> charge

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
jumping i'll get in the range of charge

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.800 
jumping i'll get in the range of charge
and<00:02:52.129> i'll<00:02:52.250> have<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.519> nice<00:02:52.760> clean<00:02:53.000> charge<00:02:53.359> on<00:02:53.569> the

and i'll have a nice clean charge on the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.869 
and i'll have a nice clean charge on the
mobs<00:02:54.019> and<00:02:54.319> let's<00:02:55.040> take<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.340> look<00:02:55.579> how<00:02:55.730> is
