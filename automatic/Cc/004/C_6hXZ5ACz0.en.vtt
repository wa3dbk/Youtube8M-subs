00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
hi guys welcome to part 3 of our YZ 450

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.610 
hi guys welcome to part 3 of our YZ 450
build<00:00:05.040> as<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:06.000> can<00:00:06.150> see<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.810> frame<00:00:07.440> is

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
build as you can see the frame is

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.740 
build as you can see the frame is
completely<00:00:08.069> bare<00:00:08.309> except<00:00:09.120> for<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.389> footpegs

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
completely bare except for the footpegs

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.640 
completely bare except for the footpegs
will<00:00:10.170> be<00:00:10.320> taking<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.429> others<00:00:11.759> out<00:00:11.940> now<00:00:12.150> I

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
will be taking the others out now I

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.129 
will be taking the others out now I
thought<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.860> having<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.370> frame<00:00:14.610> sandblasted

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
thought of having the frame sandblasted

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.590 
thought of having the frame sandblasted
but<00:00:16.139> I've<00:00:16.619> changed<00:00:16.710> my<00:00:17.130> mind<00:00:17.160> because<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.240> oil

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
but I've changed my mind because the oil

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.420 
but I've changed my mind because the oil
is<00:00:18.930> running<00:00:19.260> throughout<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.710> engine<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
is running throughout the engine in the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.090 
is running throughout the engine in the
front<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.600> frame<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.470> engine<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
front or the frame to the engine in the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.300 
front or the frame to the engine in the
front<00:00:23.130> comes<00:00:23.760> out<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:25.099> we<00:00:26.099> don't<00:00:26.220> want

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
front comes out here and we don't want

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.980 
front comes out here and we don't want
to<00:00:26.460> get<00:00:26.580> any<00:00:26.730> sand<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.240> there<00:00:27.390> might<00:00:27.750> cause

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
to get any sand in there might cause

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.189 
to get any sand in there might cause

at the bottom with the oil feeder pipes
going<00:01:14.430> I'm<00:01:14.939> not<00:01:15.119> sure<00:01:15.270> if<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.540> were<00:01:15.600> time<00:01:15.960> not

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
going I'm not sure if they were time not

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.920 
going I'm not sure if they were time not
tight<00:01:16.470> enough<00:01:16.640> but<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.390> some<00:01:18.540> earrings

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.469 
tight enough but it's got some earrings
in<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.860> replace<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.479> center

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
in there that will replace the center

in there that will replace the center
casing<00:01:21.869> seal<00:01:22.200> seems<00:01:22.619> fine<00:01:22.830> no<00:01:23.280> problems<00:01:23.759> with

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
casing seal seems fine no problems with

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.450 
casing seal seems fine no problems with
that<00:01:26.150> as<00:01:27.150> far<00:01:27.509> as<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.350> piston<00:01:28.710> goes<00:01:28.890> we'll

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
that as far as the piston goes we'll

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.039 
that as far as the piston goes we'll
