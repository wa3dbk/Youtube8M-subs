00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.160 
in the world and I think that set sets I
said<00:01:11.409> on<00:01:11.530> pole<00:01:11.829> that<00:01:12.430> year<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:13.990> then

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
said on pole that year and and and then

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.770 
said on pole that year and and and then
that<00:01:14.350> was<00:01:14.530> another<00:01:14.770> big<00:01:15.070> thing<00:01:15.340> it's<00:01:15.579> like

that was another big thing it's like

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.789 
that was another big thing it's like
what<00:01:16.780> I<00:01:17.259> it<00:01:17.979> was<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:19.200> never<00:01:20.200> knew<00:01:20.409> any<00:01:20.619> that

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
what I it was I never knew any that

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.340 
what I it was I never knew any that
happened<00:01:21.159> before<00:01:21.490> you<00:01:22.329> know<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.630> then<00:01:22.750> then<00:01:23.320> I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
happened before you know and then then I

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.980

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
going to have to improve the inner

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.830 
going to have to improve the inner
structure<00:02:00.310> here<00:02:00.609> if<00:02:00.700> we're<00:02:00.820> going<00:02:00.939> to<00:02:01.060> start

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
structure here if we're going to start

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.419 
structure here if we're going to start
getting<00:02:02.049> this<00:02:02.289> kind<00:02:02.469> of<00:02:02.590> these<00:02:03.100> kind<00:02:03.340> of

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
getting this kind of these kind of

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.130 
getting this kind of these kind of
people<00:02:03.789> I<00:02:04.000> think<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.420> was<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> big<00:02:04.899> thing<00:02:05.109> for

I<00:03:48.459> talked<00:03:48.700> about<00:03:48.819> earlier<00:03:48.970> but<00:03:49.329> sometimes<00:03:50.230> in

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
I talked about earlier but sometimes in

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.410 
I talked about earlier but sometimes in
in<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:51.340> eighth<00:03:51.489> hour<00:03:51.670> there's<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.060> little<00:03:52.299> bit

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
in the eighth hour there's a little bit

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.420 
in the eighth hour there's a little bit
of<00:03:52.510> strategy<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.440> look<00:03:53.709> on<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.280> other

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
of strategy that you look on the other

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.030 
of strategy that you look on the other
teams<00:03:54.790> oh<00:03:55.120> they<00:03:55.840> put<00:03:56.560> out<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:58.150> guy<00:03:58.389> so<00:03:58.810> now

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
teams oh they put out this guy so now

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.580 
teams oh they put out this guy so now
you<00:04:00.040> know<00:04:00.359> they're<00:04:01.359> running<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:01.840> lap<00:04:02.290> time

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
you know they're running this lap time

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.860 
you know they're running this lap time
okay<00:04:03.130> now<00:04:03.160> we'll<00:04:03.639> put<00:04:03.850> out<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.209> guy<00:04:04.450> and

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
okay now we'll put out this guy and

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.990 
okay now we'll put out this guy and
sometimes<00:04:05.410> it's<00:04:05.739> kind<00:04:05.799> of<00:04:05.980> fun<00:04:06.190> because<00:04:06.400> you

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
sometimes it's kind of fun because you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.809 
sometimes it's kind of fun because you
know<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:08.079> look<00:04:08.260> at<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.889> sometimes

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
know you look at that and sometimes

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.289 
know you look at that and sometimes
there<00:04:10.180> strategies<00:04:10.450> involved<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.790> the

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
there strategies involved and and so the

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.199 
there strategies involved and and so the
the<00:04:13.690> eight<00:04:13.810> hours<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.650> know<00:04:14.799> race<00:04:15.209> it's

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
the eight hours a you know race it's

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.460 
the eight hours a you know race it's
almost<00:04:16.539> it<00:04:16.750> back<00:04:16.930> then<00:04:17.109> it's<00:04:17.320> almost

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
almost it back then it's almost

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.719 
almost it back then it's almost
impossible<00:04:18.220> for<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.430> rider<00:04:18.669> to

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
impossible for a rider to

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.439 
impossible for a rider to
do<00:04:20.180> two<00:04:20.569> stents<00:04:20.900> back-to-back<00:04:21.499> I<00:04:22.340> did<00:04:23.270> get

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
do two stents back-to-back I did get

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.480 
do two stents back-to-back I did get
informed<00:04:23.870> last<00:04:24.439> year<00:04:24.710> when<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:24.889> was<00:04:25.069> here<00:04:25.129> that

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
informed last year when I was here that

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.189 
informed last year when I was here that
Wayne<00:04:25.879> Gardner<00:04:26.150> did<00:04:26.659> do<00:04:26.870> it<00:04:26.990> back-to-back

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
Wayne Gardner did do it back-to-back

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.010 
Wayne Gardner did do it back-to-back
because<00:04:27.889> his<00:04:28.580> rider<00:04:28.909> wasn't<00:04:29.389> fast<00:04:29.599> enough<00:04:29.719> to

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
because his rider wasn't fast enough to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.719 
because his rider wasn't fast enough to
win<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.289> race<00:04:30.439> I<00:04:30.620> had<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:30.979> do<00:04:31.099> a<00:04:31.129> second<00:04:31.580> stint

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
win the race I had to do a second stint

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.489 
win the race I had to do a second stint
right<00:04:31.939> at<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.180> end<00:04:32.300> which<00:04:32.419> it's<00:04:32.960> dark<00:04:33.289> it's

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:33.499 
right at the end which it's dark it's

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.469 
right at the end which it's dark it's
cooling<00:04:33.860> off<00:04:33.979> but<00:04:34.340> it's<00:04:34.490> still<00:04:34.849> tough<00:04:35.240> and

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
cooling off but it's still tough and

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.559 
cooling off but it's still tough and
then<00:04:35.960> like<00:04:36.800> like<00:04:37.099> Kevin<00:04:37.460> said<00:04:37.639> sometimes<00:04:38.240> you

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 
then like like Kevin said sometimes you

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.409 
then like like Kevin said sometimes you
know<00:04:39.409> maybe<00:04:39.650> Kevin's<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.610> little<00:04:40.819> quicker<00:04:41.029> in

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
know maybe Kevin's a little quicker in

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.869 
know maybe Kevin's a little quicker in
the<00:04:41.449> dark<00:04:41.840> so<00:04:42.229> you'd<00:04:42.409> want<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.919> guy<00:04:43.129> to<00:04:43.189> be<00:04:43.610> at

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
the dark so you'd want that guy to be at

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.869 
the dark so you'd want that guy to be at
the<00:04:44.240> end<00:04:44.479> okay<00:04:45.409> we<00:04:45.560> want<00:04:45.800> this<00:04:45.949> guy<00:04:46.159> to<00:04:46.219> be<00:04:46.520> on

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
the end okay we want this guy to be on

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.559 
the end okay we want this guy to be on
the<00:04:47.719> bike<00:04:47.900> at<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.680> end<00:04:48.889> in<00:04:49.249> the<00:04:49.490> dark<00:04:49.729> because

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
the bike at the end in the dark because

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.080 
the bike at the end in the dark because
he's<00:04:50.810> quicker<00:04:51.139> guy<00:04:51.439> so<00:04:52.099> sometimes<00:04:52.819> the

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
he's quicker guy so sometimes the

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.360 
he's quicker guy so sometimes the
strategies<00:04:53.960> you<00:04:54.620> know<00:04:54.710> it<00:04:54.830> comes<00:04:55.069> into<00:04:55.250> play

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
strategies you know it comes into play

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.450 
strategies you know it comes into play
so<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.960> depends<00:04:57.379> on<00:04:57.469> who<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.710> want<00:04:57.889> to<00:04:58.189> start

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
so it depends on who you want to start

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.830 
so it depends on who you want to start
the<00:04:58.610> race<00:04:58.789> who<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.330> want<00:04:59.509> to<00:04:59.569> finish<00:04:59.810> the<00:05:00.080> race

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
the race who you want to finish the race

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.390 
the race who you want to finish the race
more<00:05:02.840> -<00:05:03.050> more<00:05:03.289> -<00:05:03.500> because<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:03.979> stopped<00:05:04.219> them

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
more - more - because you stopped them

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.760 
more - more - because you stopped them
four<00:05:04.580> tires<00:05:04.879> right<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:06.199> know<00:05:06.289> I<00:05:06.319> got<00:05:06.529> to<00:05:06.620> put

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
four tires right you know I got to put

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.920 
four tires right you know I got to put
oil<00:05:06.800> in<00:05:07.129> the<00:05:07.159> bike<00:05:07.400> stuff<00:05:08.240> we're<00:05:08.569> just<00:05:08.599> not

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
oil in the bike stuff we're just not

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.110 
oil in the bike stuff we're just not
used<00:05:09.169> to<00:05:09.319> a<00:05:09.529> lot<00:05:10.159> of<00:05:10.279> opportunities<00:05:10.939> for

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
used to a lot of opportunities for

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.579 
used to a lot of opportunities for
things<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.419> go<00:05:11.599> wrong<00:05:11.629> -<00:05:12.110> you<00:05:12.259> know<00:05:12.319> you<00:05:12.439> could

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:12.589 
things to go wrong - you know you could

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:14.860 
things to go wrong - you know you could
have<00:05:12.710> a<00:05:12.770> perfect<00:05:13.250> strategy<00:05:13.490> on<00:05:14.270> both<00:05:14.449> riders

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
have a perfect strategy on both riders

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.140 
have a perfect strategy on both riders
really<00:05:15.080> fast<00:05:15.529> one<00:05:16.310> little<00:05:16.610> bobble<00:05:16.759> in<00:05:17.029> the

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
really fast one little bobble in the

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.089 
really fast one little bobble in the
pits<00:05:17.360> or<00:05:17.599> one<00:05:17.779> speeding<00:05:18.229> down<00:05:18.529> pit<00:05:18.830> lane<00:05:18.860> and

pits or one speeding down pit lane and

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.489 
pits or one speeding down pit lane and
there's<00:05:19.520> so<00:05:19.789> many<00:05:20.060> things<00:05:20.210> you<00:05:20.749> should<00:05:21.229> not<00:05:21.379> be

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:21.499 
there's so many things you should not be

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.969 
there's so many things you should not be
at<00:05:21.589> speed<00:05:21.860> limit<00:05:22.159> but<00:05:22.249> there<00:05:22.430> is<00:05:22.580> now<00:05:22.849> hmm<00:05:23.979> and

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
at speed limit but there is now hmm and

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.420 
at speed limit but there is now hmm and
