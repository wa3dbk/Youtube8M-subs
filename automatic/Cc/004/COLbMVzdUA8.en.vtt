00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.519
 and take a look at this in the top 5 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.889
 the kitchen of the hilarious stars 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.719
 scenes and the great thing about this top 5 is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.600
 is that I have chosen one 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.090
 specific way of dying 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 every person explodes from within and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.660
 what that looks like yes we will 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.949
 and the one is even more laughable than 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.420
 the others note I can do a bit 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.279
 track late but we keep going with number 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.350
 five start in this type of movies you have 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.059
 always a good guy meurs is the mountain and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.309
 the latter is the subject and is called 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.110
 mr.big the connoisseurs probably know 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.090
 which movie I am talking about 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.010
 and for the non-connoisseur it's James Bond 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.840
 member and watch there during a sausage and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.250
 too much promise they have m is the peak 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.899
 schie james bond 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 to gas capsule and solidify it 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.480
 in the bakers of miss de beek the bath 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.480
 guy 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.520
 but after this man some sort of could 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.010
 swelling and sweat into the air 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.500
 like a balloon and explodes 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.500
 yes what that is 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.359
 and there is a whole arc at number four 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:12.619
 star scene from the big trouble in movie 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.240
 little china ' 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.549
 and indicum it's all about jack 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.409
 turn and the truck driver he and 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.759
 its what is being captured but 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.829
 they also know how to escape and the 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.899
 shelter from walking and the bad guy in 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.270
 this movie and when they come 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.859
 have settled with the bad guy loop and 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.259
 you have to be very careful what is there 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.849
 happens with bodyguard funder he makes 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.539
 literally a bit fat with if 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.780
 resulted a very distinct kamikaze one 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.640
 suicide 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:46.670
 I mean so fat and I am even still 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:47.539
 more is we make strong are there of these 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.789
 man is perhaps the most 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.610
 realistic or under realistic 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.770
 way of dying in this entire top 5 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.750
 it comes down to that frame in it 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.689
 the film the naked 'can do half 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.459
 smell or through the bad guy standing no 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.409
 to rent a very forestry party 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.399
 switches off to a very special one 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.859
 way 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.310

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.750

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.639
 water pool to a tap and the 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.410
 walk through taps until he knows you 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:24.349
 a woman died in 2007 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.419

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.849

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.340

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.890

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.390
 not 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.070

 video processing but I don't mind 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.630

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.740
 in the video description 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.780
