this option will be available to you now
there<00:00:28.280> are<00:00:28.400> two<00:00:28.610> ways<00:00:28.820> we<00:00:28.850> can<00:00:29.210> start<00:00:29.539> this

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
there are two ways we can start this

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.979 
there are two ways we can start this
process<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:31.130> first<00:00:31.400> is<00:00:31.610> to<00:00:31.760> choose<00:00:32.059> recover

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
process the first is to choose recover

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.330 
process the first is to choose recover
system<00:00:33.500> settings<00:00:33.980> or<00:00:34.910> your<00:00:35.270> computer<00:00:36.340> from

system settings or your computer from

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.899 
system settings or your computer from
here<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:39.170> second<00:00:39.620> way<00:00:39.769> is<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.280> create<00:00:40.609> a

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
here the second way is to create a

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.739 
here the second way is to create a
system<00:00:41.420> repair<00:00:41.600> disk<00:00:42.159> it<00:00:43.159> is<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.210> very<00:00:44.479> good

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:44.749 
system repair disk it is a very good

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:46.750 
system repair disk it is a very good
idea<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:45.379> have<00:00:45.679> a<00:00:45.710> system<00:00:46.190> repair<00:00:46.489> disk

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760

initiate a recovery so for this tutorial
we'll<00:01:01.489> be<00:01:01.519> using<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.359> backup<00:01:02.749> and<00:01:02.870> restore
