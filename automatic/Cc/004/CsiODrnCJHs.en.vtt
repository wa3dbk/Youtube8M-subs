economics<00:00:05.060> is<00:00:05.180> a<00:00:05.210> popular<00:00:05.660> choice<00:00:05.870> among

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:06.320 
economics is a popular choice among

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.039 
economics is a popular choice among
students<00:00:06.830> of<00:00:06.920> the<00:00:07.040> external<00:00:07.430> system<00:00:07.870> so<00:00:08.870> what

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:09.049 
students of the external system so what

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.279 
students of the external system so what
does<00:00:09.259> studying<00:00:09.650> economics<00:00:10.219> actually<00:00:10.700> entail

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:11.289 
does studying economics actually entail

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.609 
does studying economics actually entail
it's<00:00:12.339> basically<00:00:13.419> the<00:00:14.419> study<00:00:14.809> of<00:00:14.900> a<00:00:15.440> new

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
it's basically the study of a new

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.280 
it's basically the study of a new
language<00:00:16.330> when<00:00:17.330> you<00:00:17.450> learn<00:00:17.630> language<00:00:18.110> you

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
language when you learn language you

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.860 
language when you learn language you
have<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:18.500> let<00:00:18.590> its<00:00:18.800> grammar<00:00:19.040> and<00:00:19.720> there's<00:00:20.720> the

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
have to let its grammar and there's the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.870 
have to let its grammar and there's the
vocabulary<00:00:21.440> and<00:00:21.590> there's<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:21.860> grammar<00:00:22.430> so

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
vocabulary and there's the grammar so

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.580 
vocabulary and there's the grammar so
the<00:00:23.180> main<00:00:23.330> purpose<00:00:23.780> of<00:00:23.930> this<00:00:24.050> course<00:00:24.320> is<00:00:24.530> to

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
the main purpose of this course is to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.990 
the main purpose of this course is to
build<00:00:24.830> up<00:00:25.040> the<00:00:25.130> grammar<00:00:25.370> of<00:00:25.520> that<00:00:25.790> language

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
build up the grammar of that language

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.110 
build up the grammar of that language
and<00:00:26.510> that<00:00:27.320> means<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:27.890> teach<00:00:28.190> students<00:00:28.730> how<00:00:29.090> to

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.120 
and that means to teach students how to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.589 
and that means to teach students how to
reason<00:00:29.840> in<00:00:30.260> economics<00:00:31.039> and<00:00:31.280> how<00:00:32.000> economists

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
reason in economics and how economists

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.150 
reason in economics and how economists
reason<00:00:33.110> because<00:00:33.380> it's<00:00:33.530> not<00:00:33.650> necessarily<00:00:34.130> that

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
reason because it's not necessarily that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.920 
reason because it's not necessarily that
most<00:00:34.550> well<00:00:34.850> most<00:00:35.300> of<00:00:35.420> them<00:00:35.540> actually<00:00:35.630> will<00:00:35.900> not

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
most well most of them actually will not

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.930 
most well most of them actually will not
become<00:00:36.200> economists<00:00:36.860> but<00:00:37.490> they<00:00:37.579> would<00:00:37.700> still

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
become economists but they would still

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.850 
become economists but they would still
work<00:00:38.180> in<00:00:38.510> an<00:00:38.600> economics<00:00:39.079> environment<00:00:39.739> they

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
work in an economics environment they

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.410 
work in an economics environment they
work<00:00:40.160> in<00:00:40.280> banks<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.790> work<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.150> management

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
work in banks the work and management

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.340 
work in banks the work and management
all<00:00:41.989> these<00:00:42.380> are<00:00:42.650> sub<00:00:42.890> areas<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.370> economics<00:00:43.910> I

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.410 

think<00:00:48.350> that<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:49.250> first<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:49.730> most<00:00:49.880> important

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
think that the first and most important

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.200 
think that the first and most important
thing<00:00:50.570> should<00:00:51.050> be<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.170> motivation<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.210> the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
thing should be a motivation and the

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.780 
thing should be a motivation and the
motivation<00:00:53.870> is<00:00:54.200> not<00:00:54.860> just<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.100> motivation<00:00:55.640> to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
motivation is not just a motivation to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.190 
motivation is not just a motivation to
get<00:00:56.000> another<00:00:56.300> certificate<00:00:56.600> a<00:00:57.910> motivation<00:00:58.910> to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
get another certificate a motivation to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.680 
get another certificate a motivation to
really<00:01:00.200> want<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:01.070> know<00:01:01.250> really<00:01:02.059> want<00:01:02.540> to

really want to know really want to

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.730 
really want to know really want to
understand<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.320> world<00:01:03.580> now<00:01:04.580> there's<00:01:05.299> no

mechanism of providing any evidence of

mechanism of providing any evidence of
this<00:01:09.110> kind<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.470> qualification<00:01:10.159> but<00:01:10.820> if

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
this kind of qualification but if

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.190 
this kind of qualification but if
individuals<00:01:11.540> have<00:01:11.690> to<00:01:11.810> make<00:01:11.960> choices

individuals have to make choices
themselves<00:01:12.409> I<00:01:12.860> would<00:01:12.890> simply<00:01:13.190> tell<00:01:13.460> them<00:01:13.670> that

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
themselves I would simply tell them that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.690 
themselves I would simply tell them that
if<00:01:14.360> that's<00:01:14.510> not<00:01:14.900> motivating<00:01:15.680> them<00:01:15.860> they're

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
if that's not motivating them they're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
if that's not motivating them they're
wasting<00:01:17.030> their<00:01:17.150> time

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250 

this<00:01:21.250> is<00:01:21.370> a<00:01:21.400> degree<00:01:22.240> level<00:01:22.630> subject<00:01:23.020> where<00:01:23.170> you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
this is a degree level subject where you

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.700 
this is a degree level subject where you
become<00:01:23.500> an<00:01:23.710> expert<00:01:24.040> in<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.280> subject<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.500> what

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
become an expert in the subject so what

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.350 
become an expert in the subject so what
sort<00:01:27.040> of<00:01:27.100> students<00:01:27.520> have<00:01:27.610> best<00:01:27.790> suited<00:01:28.120> to<00:01:28.150> an

sort of students have best suited to an
economics<00:01:28.870> course<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:30.220> helps<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:30.670> have<00:01:30.790> some

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
economics course it helps to have some

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.630 
economics course it helps to have some
kind<00:01:31.450> of<00:01:31.660> very<00:01:32.260> basic<00:01:32.530> mathematical<00:01:33.430> or

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
kind of very basic mathematical or

material<00:01:37.630> which<00:01:37.870> is<00:01:38.080> based<00:01:38.710> on<00:01:39.010> logic<00:01:39.940> it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
material which is based on logic it

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.560 
material which is based on logic it
doesn't<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.170> be<00:01:41.290> formal<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.920> can<00:01:42.070> be<00:01:42.190> even

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
doesn't have to be formal it can be even

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.240 
doesn't have to be formal it can be even
informal<00:01:43.570> verbal<00:01:43.990> form<00:01:44.620> of<00:01:44.710> logic<00:01:44.890> but<00:01:45.070> to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
informal verbal form of logic but to

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.070 
informal verbal form of logic but to
have<00:01:45.400> a<00:01:45.430> way<00:01:45.760> of<00:01:45.790> systematically<00:01:46.210> analyzing

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
have a way of systematically analyzing

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.680 
have a way of systematically analyzing
thing<00:01:47.440> now<00:01:48.070> usually<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.640> best<00:01:48.850> indicator<00:01:49.510> of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
thing now usually the best indicator of

thing now usually the best indicator of
such<00:01:49.870> things<00:01:50.140> would<00:01:50.290> be<00:01:50.470> some<00:01:51.160> qualification

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
such things would be some qualification

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.330 
such things would be some qualification
in<00:01:52.120> mathematics<00:01:52.660> at<00:01:52.870> the<00:01:52.900> GCSE<00:01:53.800> level<00:01:53.920> or<00:01:54.250> a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
in mathematics at the GCSE level or a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.310 
in mathematics at the GCSE level or a
level<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:59.640> would<00:02:00.690> recommend<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.900> students

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
level I would recommend the students

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
level I would recommend the students
begin<00:02:02.740> by<00:02:03.479> reading<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.840> subject<00:02:05.260> guide<00:02:05.440> what

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
begin by reading the subject guide what

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.930 
begin by reading the subject guide what
I<00:02:06.370> mean<00:02:06.550> by<00:02:06.729> reading<00:02:07.150> is<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.870> they<00:02:08.940> go

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
I mean by reading is that they go

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.840 
I mean by reading is that they go
through<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.270> entire<00:02:10.600> chapter<00:02:11.170> each<00:02:12.130> concept

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
through the entire chapter each concept

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.940 
through the entire chapter each concept
which<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.480> not<00:02:13.630> clear<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.080> them<00:02:14.290> they

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
which is not clear to them they

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.860 
which is not clear to them they
immediately<00:02:15.220> go<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.820> one<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.450> recommended

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
immediately go to one of the recommended

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.050 
immediately go to one of the recommended
textbooks<00:02:17.590> which<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.250> different<00:02:18.670> slightly

commanding it you're a slave to it so in

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.310 
commanding it you're a slave to it so in
order<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.060> make<00:03:19.269> sure<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.840> command<00:03:20.230> the

have<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.720> go<00:03:22.870> further<00:03:23.620> it's<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.519> ability<00:03:24.730> to

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
have to go further it's the ability to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.630 
have to go further it's the ability to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
exam time what qualities of the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.200 
exam time what qualities of the
examiners<00:03:38.750> looking<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.200> test<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.850> surprise

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
examiners looking to test to surprise

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.660 
examiners looking to test to surprise
students<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.750> exam<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:42.640> students<00:03:43.640> should

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
students in exam so students should

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.000 
students in exam so students should
expect<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.720> read<00:03:44.900> an<00:03:45.050> exam<00:03:45.320> question<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:45.890> have

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
expect to read an exam question I have

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.330 
expect to read an exam question I have
no<00:03:46.220> clue<00:03:46.520> what's<00:03:46.820> about<00:03:47.470> that's<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.560> good<00:03:48.740> start

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
no clue what's about that's a good start

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.110 
no clue what's about that's a good start
so<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.560> responsible<00:03:51.560> reaction<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.730> is<00:03:52.910> not

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
so the responsible reaction to it is not

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.810 
so the responsible reaction to it is not
of<00:03:53.270> course<00:03:53.480> getting<00:03:53.750> into<00:03:53.990> panic<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:54.820> looking

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
of course getting into panic and looking

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.060 
of course getting into panic and looking
for<00:03:55.970> your<00:03:56.000> inhaler<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:57.260> thing<00:03:57.440> is<00:03:57.530> just<00:03:57.650> look

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
for your inhaler the thing is just look

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.320 
for your inhaler the thing is just look
at<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.250> questions<00:03:58.580> there<00:03:58.730> just<00:03:58.880> a<00:03:58.970> minute<00:03:59.120> you

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
at the questions there just a minute you

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.870 
at the questions there just a minute you
know<00:03:59.480> I<00:03:59.750> haven't<00:04:00.650> seen<00:04:00.860> this<00:04:00.950> before<00:04:01.010> but<00:04:01.850> I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
know I haven't seen this before but I

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.570 
know I haven't seen this before but I
know<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.270> material<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:03.020> can<00:04:03.050> do<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.580> when

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
know the material and I can do it when

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.130 
know the material and I can do it when
they<00:04:04.700> come<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.180> exam<00:04:05.510> therefore<00:04:05.960> they

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
they come to the exam therefore they

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.990 
they come to the exam therefore they
have<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.320> prepare<00:04:06.980> themselves<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.730> be

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
have to prepare themselves to be

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.560 
have to prepare themselves to be
surprised<00:04:09.490> and<00:04:10.490> their<00:04:10.940> difference<00:04:11.360> between

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
surprised and their difference between

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.790 
surprised and their difference between
the<00:04:11.630> good<00:04:11.750> students<00:04:12.110> and<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.260> best<00:04:12.440> students

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
the good students and the best students

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.410 
the good students and the best students
is<00:04:12.980> whether<00:04:13.280> it's<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.490> pleasant<00:04:13.670> surprise<00:04:13.910> or<00:04:14.360> a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
is whether it's a pleasant surprise or a

of the points we give students in the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.470 
of the points we give students in the
exam<00:04:27.920> have<00:04:28.400> nothing<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.790> do<00:04:28.880> with<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.120> final

exam have nothing to do with the final
answer<00:04:29.930> we<00:04:30.530> want<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.800> see<00:04:30.980> how<00:04:31.250> they<00:04:31.520> deal<00:04:31.880> with

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
answer we want to see how they deal with

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.630 
answer we want to see how they deal with
the<00:04:32.090> problem<00:04:32.120> step<00:04:33.020> in<00:04:33.320> after<00:04:33.920> step<00:04:34.190> actually

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
the problem step in after step actually

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.460 
the problem step in after step actually
the<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.330> points<00:04:35.720> they<00:04:35.840> receive<00:04:36.170> for<00:04:36.380> the

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
the the points they receive for the

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.980 
the the points they receive for the
solution<00:04:36.950> have<00:04:37.190> very<00:04:37.580> very<00:04:37.850> little<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:38.690> most

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
solution have very very little so most

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.330 
solution have very very little so most
of<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.200> points<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:39.680> actually<00:04:39.830> for<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.190> whole

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
of the points is actually for the whole

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.340 
of the points is actually for the whole
process<00:04:40.640> of<00:04:41.060> dealing<00:04:41.720> with<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.930> questions

process of dealing with the questions

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.170 
process of dealing with the questions
and<00:04:42.560> that's<00:04:42.950> why<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.220> doesn't<00:04:43.310> matter<00:04:43.640> that

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
and that's why it doesn't matter that

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.670 
and that's why it doesn't matter that
they've<00:04:44.360> seen<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.690> before<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:45.050> have<00:04:45.260> not<00:04:45.470> seen
