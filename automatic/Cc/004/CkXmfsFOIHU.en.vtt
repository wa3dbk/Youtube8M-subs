00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everyone i 'm elias 360 and i 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.960
 I bring this new video and this time 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.760
 rare vehicles in gta 5 how will you be 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.620
 seeing in the title and good to 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.290
 Below I will show you what 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.530
 would be a guiri in heat here what 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.530
 you have 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.960
 well then after listening to the 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.919
 moans or whatever that was we go to 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.650
 video in question as I said 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.750
 rare vehicles in gta 5 this time 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.970
 they are aerial vehicles although 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.980
 we are also going to see some car but 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.570
 well the most important thing about this is a 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.580
 homework is one of those jobs that is 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.440
 created with the creator that you already know that 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.989
 is in beta but any user 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.300
 can create so good in question it 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.159
 flame cargo plane sandbox playstation3 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.379
 It is also available for Xbox 360 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:47.470
 you can search on the rockstar page and 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.330
 it is a death game of 2 to 12 people 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.979
 therefore we are going to need a 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.299
 second person is you invite people 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.820
 which is in your own session of 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.769
 game as usual the usual thing is that 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.049
 someone is joining so it's pretty easy 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.729
 find someone and we go with the 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.830
 first vehicle the cargo plane 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.199
 supposedly the largest plane in 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:08.350
 the whole game is bigger even than 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.689
 the the boing 747 that I can also 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.890
 bring if you want it but it seems to me that 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.049
 yes it is bigger I have not put them 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.720
 together to buy them but I think if 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.330
 this plane is metallized as you will be 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.070
 seeing with this grayish color seems 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.270
 that is talking about some announcement of the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.159
 telemarketing 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.829
 Well the truth is that it's pretty cool 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.719
 it seems there that I do not know when it flies very 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.729
 high as it is camufla a tad 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.939
 because the sky itself reflects the sky 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.159
 forgiveness on the plane itself and the truth is 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.710
 that is quite pretty cool you 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.020
 it costs to pluck an egg costs 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.390
 pluck a cow crate but the truth 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.280
 It is that it is pretty cool and has more is 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.929
 is more manageable than it seems 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.240
 that looks so good here what 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.390
 you have here I am planning a bit with 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.539
 him without getting far from this airport 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.189
 of trevor finally jump and well you go 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.780
 to see what short just when it's going to 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.250
 impact and everyone will say with me we wanted 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.409
 the explosion but the truth is that it 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.950
 remains a lawyer there and harder than a 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.079
 stone 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.620
 here I am bursting a dirigible TV 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.540
 that you can also use it 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.130
 in fact in the story mode you already know 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.590
 than with the code that comes with the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.120
 special edition I think and so on 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.800
 you can have it I have it not you 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.480
 candidly exchanged but good in the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.920
 you can also have history and 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.190
 in the online as you will have seen then 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.710
 also here I am with the jet which 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.270
 it is an airplane that is available from 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.250
 normal way at the airport so 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.230
 neither has anything mysterious but 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.460
 good as this went from rare vehicles 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.560
 neither is it a vehicle that is usually 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.020
 welcome very often and I also have to 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.300
 say that good in the story mode already 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.640
 you know that this plane if you take it you will be 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.960
 gasoline ends I do not know if in the mode 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.250
 history if you take it from the airport 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.920
 also but good here you have it 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.170
 is also to say that good now I take 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.350
 this car that is called brava topan si 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.850
 it's a pretty pretty good sports car 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.160
 the truth is that it runs a lot and has 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.870
 good handling and all those traction things 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.840
 all four wheels etc. but 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.690
 you also have the hold house that would come 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.720
 being hacienda or tax agency 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.040
 It's worth it, it's a truck that in a few 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.800
 words would be the truck that goes 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.780
 collecting taxes so if I 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.370
 you want to petar there you have it if you want 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.260
 show you with him 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.989
 and you have anger or anything here 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.569
 I'm with the 9th cabriolet that is a 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.510
 sporting also this may not be so 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.040
 as rare as the previous engraving 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.569
 they go if there is a car that looks like 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.760
 pretty but the one we usually take for 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.980
 the street is not that voucher so good 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.440

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.329

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.680
