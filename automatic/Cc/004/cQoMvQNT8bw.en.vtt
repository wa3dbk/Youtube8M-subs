00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
away with these sleeves simply because

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.270 
away with these sleeves simply because
they<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.299> come<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.560> bit<00:01:25.770> farther<00:01:26.009> on

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
they do come out a little bit farther on

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.109 
they do come out a little bit farther on
the<00:01:26.369> arm<00:01:26.580> even<00:01:27.240> though<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:28.759> you<00:01:29.759> know<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the arm even though they are you know a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.719 
the arm even though they are you know a
sleeveless<00:01:30.900> shirt<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> sleeves<00:01:32.460> when

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
sleeveless shirt I like the sleeves when

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.039 
sleeveless shirt I like the sleeves when
they're<00:01:32.909> thicker<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> can

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
they're thicker like this so I can

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
they're thicker like this so I can
probably<00:01:34.290> get<00:01:34.740> away<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.119> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
probably get away with this this one is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
probably get away with this this one is
in<00:01:36.390> an<00:01:36.509> extra<00:01:36.869> extra<00:01:37.259> large<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.710> also

20%<00:01:38.430> off<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.170> really

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
20% off I just think it's a really

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.660 
20% off I just think it's a really
really<00:01:40.590> pretty<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.159> go<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.490> lot

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
really pretty and it can go with a lot

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.460 
really pretty and it can go with a lot
of<00:01:41.700> different<00:01:41.909> things<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.780> spring
