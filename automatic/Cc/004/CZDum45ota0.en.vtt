00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.170 
it goes just gives us that situation
right<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.100> we'll<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> outcome<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
right there we'll see the outcome of the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.450 
right there we'll see the outcome of the
game<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:37.350> know<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.860> pretty<00:01:38.070> much<00:01:38.159> got<00:01:38.430> my

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
game you know I just pretty much got my

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.120 
game you know I just pretty much got my
secondary<00:01:38.909> base<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.680> already<00:01:40.890> sent

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
secondary base up and so I already sent

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.160 
secondary base up and so I already sent
my<00:01:41.220> wart<00:01:41.430> hogs<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.420> offensive<00:01:42.689> already

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
my wart hogs out to be offensive already

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.960 
my wart hogs out to be offensive already
I<00:01:43.259> want<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.590> destroy<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.100> secondary<00:01:44.460> base<00:01:44.670> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
I want to destroy that secondary base I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.190 
I want to destroy that secondary base I
don't<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.149> how<00:01:45.270> fast<00:01:45.509> they<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.110> or

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
don't know how fast they got it or

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.660 
don't know how fast they got it or
whatever<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.159> what<00:01:47.310> I'm<00:01:47.399> gonna<00:01:47.549> try

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
whatever but that's what I'm gonna try

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.789 
whatever but that's what I'm gonna try
to<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.290> I'm<00:01:49.409> cleaning<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.710> my

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
to do right now so as I'm cleaning on my

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.969 
to do right now so as I'm cleaning on my
secondary<00:01:50.189> base<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.670> see<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.030> these<00:01:51.270> guys

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
secondary base I see that these guys

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.319 
secondary base I see that these guys
they<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.430> destroyed<00:01:53.820> their<00:01:53.970> secondary

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
they they just destroyed their secondary

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.240 
they they just destroyed their secondary
base<00:01:54.540> which<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.680> low<00:01:56.219> i

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
base which is a little little low i

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.380 
base which is a little little low i
think<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.700> could<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.909> hard<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> sort<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
think that could have hard to sort a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
think that could have hard to sort a
little<00:01:57.540> bit<00:01:57.630> sooner<00:01:57.979> you<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.369> opinion

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
little bit sooner you know in my opinion

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.770 
little bit sooner you know in my opinion
it<00:01:59.969> could<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.210> been<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.390> show<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> little<00:02:00.659> bit

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
it could have been to show a little bit

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.999 
it could have been to show a little bit
sooner<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.110> those<00:02:01.229> seconds<00:02:01.590> matter<00:02:01.770> because

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
sooner in those seconds matter because

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.560 
sooner in those seconds matter because
every<00:02:02.189> second<00:02:02.520> matters<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.149> faster<00:02:03.509> you

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
every second matters the faster you

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.050 
every second matters the faster you
destroy<00:02:03.930> your<00:02:04.049> frickin<00:02:04.380> base<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.950> better<00:02:05.159> so

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
destroy your frickin base the better so

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
destroy your frickin base the better so
as<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.630> seen<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.290> took<00:02:07.409> advantage<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.890> it

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
as I seen that we took advantage of it

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.320 
as I seen that we took advantage of it
all<00:02:08.190> our<00:02:08.369> war<00:02:08.520> hogs<00:02:08.700> were<00:02:08.970> pretty<00:02:09.179> much

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
all our war hogs were pretty much

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.470 
all our war hogs were pretty much
destroying<00:02:10.370> all<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.430> green<00:02:11.910> guy's<00:02:12.060> war<00:02:12.330> hogs

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
destroying all the green guy's war hogs

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.920 
destroying all the green guy's war hogs
so

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
so

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.390 
so
you<00:02:13.079> know<00:02:13.200> that's<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.739> good<00:02:13.920> thing<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.219> guess

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
you know that's a good thing I guess

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.130 
you know that's a good thing I guess
because<00:02:14.609> in<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.909> point<00:02:15.209> staff<00:02:15.780> who<00:02:15.900> cannot

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
because in that point staff who cannot

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.660 
because in that point staff who cannot
probably<00:02:16.560> make<00:02:16.709> an<00:02:16.829> offensive<00:02:17.280> no<00:02:17.370> more<00:02:17.579> he

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
probably make an offensive no more he

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.849 
probably make an offensive no more he
probably<00:02:17.879> can't<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:18.269> be<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.079> little<00:02:19.349> be<00:02:19.829> a

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
probably can't go be a little be a

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.199 
probably can't go be a little be a
little<00:02:20.189> annoying<00:02:20.400> with<00:02:20.609> the<00:02:20.730> war<00:02:20.879> hogs<00:02:20.939> or

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
little annoying with the war hogs or

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.780 
little annoying with the war hogs or
whatever<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.810> was<00:02:21.989> able<00:02:22.109> to<00:02:22.260> out<00:02:22.560> tap<00:02:22.920> when

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
whatever and I was able to out tap when

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.209 
whatever and I was able to out tap when
the<00:02:23.909> base<00:02:24.060> went<00:02:24.359> up<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.750> was<00:02:25.439> able<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.799> out<00:02:25.920> tap

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
the base went up I was able to out tap

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.610 
the base went up I was able to out tap
the<00:02:26.939> green<00:02:27.150> guy<00:02:27.329> and<00:02:27.599> profit<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.409> was<00:02:28.530> able

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the green guy and profit and I was able

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.500 
the green guy and profit and I was able
to<00:02:28.739> actually<00:02:28.890> buy<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.060> another

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
to actually buy it so just another

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.899 
to actually buy it so just another
second<00:02:31.079> less<00:02:31.260> on<00:02:31.500> them<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.950> then<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.579> see<00:02:32.760> blood

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
second less on them and then I see blood

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.220 
second less on them and then I see blood
bought<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.329> right<00:02:33.450> after<00:02:33.569> my<00:02:33.780> god<00:02:33.959> destroyed

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
bought it right after my god destroyed

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.520 
bought it right after my god destroyed
so<00:02:34.799> just<00:02:35.430> those<00:02:35.700> seconds<00:02:36.180> right<00:02:36.299> there<00:02:36.659> just

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
so just those seconds right there just

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.080 
so just those seconds right there just
they<00:02:37.739> count<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.219> know<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.609> like<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.909> more

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
they count you know just like the more

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.690 
they count you know just like the more
seconds<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:39.900> they<00:02:40.769> don't<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.129> buy<00:02:41.489> that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
seconds that they don't have to buy that

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.780 
seconds that they don't have to buy that
base<00:02:42.530> it's<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.620> good<00:02:43.739> thing<00:02:43.889> on<00:02:44.040> us<00:02:44.189> because<00:02:44.400> now

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
base it's a good thing on us because now

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.250 
base it's a good thing on us because now
I'm<00:02:44.970> pushing<00:02:45.269> up<00:02:45.389> more<00:02:45.659> and<00:02:45.780> more<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.049> i'm

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
I'm pushing up more and more and i'm

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.720 
I'm pushing up more and more and i'm
filling<00:02:46.409> my<00:02:46.650> secondary<00:02:47.040> basis<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> lot<00:02:47.579> more

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
filling my secondary basis a lot more

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.479 
filling my secondary basis a lot more
safer<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.359> see<00:02:49.169> blood<00:02:49.290> he<00:02:50.129> took<00:02:50.159> some

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
safer I see blood he took some

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.920 
safer I see blood he took some
precautions<00:02:50.579> on<00:02:51.090> my<00:02:51.180> second<00:02:51.510> air<00:02:51.599> he<00:02:51.720> thought

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
precautions on my second air he thought

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.229 
precautions on my second air he thought
maybe<00:02:52.079> profit<00:02:52.500> was<00:02:52.620> going<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.799> show<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.159> and<00:02:53.370> so

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
maybe profit was going to show up and so

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.110 
maybe profit was going to show up and so
he<00:02:54.389> sent<00:02:54.689> three<00:02:54.900> Spartans<00:02:55.290> back<00:02:55.500> there<00:02:55.769> I

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
he sent three Spartans back there I

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.520 
he sent three Spartans back there I
don't<00:02:57.120> know<00:02:57.180> about<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.389> so<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:57.930> mean<00:02:58.230> that's<00:02:58.260> a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
don't know about that so I mean that's a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.929 
don't know about that so I mean that's a
good<00:02:58.709> thing<00:02:58.829> right<00:02:58.889> there<00:02:59.159> if<00:02:59.400> Prophet<00:02:59.819> did

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
good thing right there if Prophet did

problem to what he's trying to do
because<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.340> secondary<00:03:26.790> base<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.150> not<00:03:27.329> it's

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
because the secondary base is not it's

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.719 
because the secondary base is not it's
not<00:03:28.079> up<00:03:28.379> I'd<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.949> at<00:03:29.099> all<00:03:29.159> I'm<00:03:29.400> not<00:03:29.430> going<00:03:29.669> to

down with my ODSTs I'm gonna destroy it

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.909 
down with my ODSTs I'm gonna destroy it
and<00:03:33.629> he's<00:03:34.290> never<00:03:34.439> going<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.739> see<00:03:34.889> that

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
and he's never going to see that

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.679 
and he's never going to see that
secondary<00:03:35.459> base<00:03:35.669> up<00:03:35.939> which<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.359> huge

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
secondary base up which is a huge

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.360 
secondary base up which is a huge
problem<00:03:37.109> because<00:03:37.139> first<00:03:37.829> of<00:03:37.949> all<00:03:38.129> you're<00:03:38.310> not

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
problem because first of all you're not

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.469 
problem because first of all you're not
going<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.579> have<00:03:38.699> any<00:03:38.849> money<00:03:39.030> coming<00:03:39.359> in

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479 
going to have any money coming in

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:41.000 
going to have any money coming in
through<00:03:39.629> that<00:03:39.750> base<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.349> you're<00:03:40.799> not<00:03:40.889> going

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
through that base and you're not going

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.610 
through that base and you're not going
to<00:03:41.099> have<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.370> pop<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.970> fight<00:03:42.239> my<00:03:42.449> army<00:03:42.870> that's

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
to have the pop to fight my army that's

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.259 
to have the pop to fight my army that's
going<00:03:43.859> to<00:03:43.919> pretty<00:03:44.129> much<00:03:44.310> be<00:03:44.609> attacking<00:03:45.180> you

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
going to pretty much be attacking you

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.479 
going to pretty much be attacking you
constantly<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.229> that's<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.040> big<00:03:47.220> problem

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
constantly so that's the big problem

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.189 
constantly so that's the big problem
when<00:03:47.879> not<00:03:48.060> getting<00:03:48.329> your<00:03:48.419> secondary<00:03:48.750> base<00:03:48.930> up

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
when not getting your secondary base up

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.319 
when not getting your secondary base up
so<00:03:49.379> it's<00:03:49.530> one<00:03:49.709> base<00:03:49.949> against<00:03:50.699> two<00:03:50.819> bases<00:03:51.150> which

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
so it's one base against two bases which

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.360 
so it's one base against two bases which
is<00:03:51.419> me<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.810> was<00:03:52.500> able<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.739> get<00:03:52.829> my<00:03:52.889> secondary

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
is me I was able to get my secondary

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.469 
is me I was able to get my secondary
base<00:03:53.549> up<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:53.939> I'm<00:03:54.000> gonna<00:03:54.120> put<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.269> lot<00:03:54.449> of

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
base up and I'm gonna put a lot of

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:56.420 
base up and I'm gonna put a lot of
pressure<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:54.959> cush<00:03:55.259> right<00:03:55.500> now<00:03:55.620> I'm<00:03:56.310> gonna

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
pressure on cush right now I'm gonna

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.800 
pressure on cush right now I'm gonna
keep<00:03:56.549> destroying<00:03:56.879> a<00:03:57.030> secondary<00:03:57.509> and<00:03:57.750> I'm

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
keep destroying a secondary and I'm

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.659

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
and i was like thinking maybe I could

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.439 
and i was like thinking maybe I could
destroy<00:04:03.239> his<00:04:03.269> main<00:04:03.870> like<00:04:04.500> with<00:04:04.650> my<00:04:04.739> six<00:04:05.009> tanks

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
but now I had too many tanks right there

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.770 
but now I had too many tanks right there
and<00:04:08.430> then<00:04:08.519> he<00:04:08.759> had<00:04:08.849> turned<00:04:09.150> shooting<00:04:09.479> at<00:04:09.599> me<00:04:09.750> I

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
and then he had turned shooting at me I

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.270

one<00:04:10.079> of<00:04:10.139> my<00:04:10.199> tanks<00:04:10.439> was<00:04:10.560> kind<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:10.829> weak<00:04:11.009> so<00:04:11.250> I

which<00:05:00.900> kind<00:05:01.080> of<00:05:01.110> pushed<00:05:01.289> me<00:05:01.380> back<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:02.039> I

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
which kind of pushed me back so I

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.950 
which kind of pushed me back so I
decided<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.729> go<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.150> secondary<00:05:03.570> base<00:05:03.750> and

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
decided to go to the secondary base and

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.320 
decided to go to the secondary base and
destroy<00:05:04.050> once<00:05:04.530> again<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.520> Prophet<00:05:05.970> was<00:05:06.060> doing

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
destroy once again the Prophet was doing

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.150 
destroy once again the Prophet was doing
a<00:05:06.389> good<00:05:06.570> thing<00:05:06.630> by<00:05:07.080> having<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.650> harmonious

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
a good thing by having the harmonious

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.670 
a good thing by having the harmonious
there<00:05:08.400> which<00:05:09.000> is<00:05:09.180> smart<00:05:09.449> but<00:05:09.690> my<00:05:10.289> tanks<00:05:10.590> were

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
there which is smart but my tanks were

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.290 
there which is smart but my tanks were
too<00:05:10.830> strong<00:05:11.010> for<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.370> harmonium<00:05:11.850> so<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.090> was

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
too strong for the harmonium so I was

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.870 
too strong for the harmonium so I was
easily<00:05:12.570> just<00:05:12.870> I<00:05:13.199> was<00:05:13.770> easily<00:05:14.100> able<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.520> destroy

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
easily just I was easily able to destroy

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.930 
easily just I was easily able to destroy
it<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:16.470> also<00:05:16.979> I<00:05:17.160> got<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.370> cobra<00:05:17.729> on<00:05:17.880> the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
it and so also I got a cobra on the

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.370 
it and so also I got a cobra on the
secondary<00:05:18.330> base<00:05:18.570> right<00:05:18.780> there<00:05:18.840> I<00:05:18.990> didn't<00:05:19.260> want

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
secondary base right there I didn't want

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.469 
secondary base right there I didn't want
to<00:05:19.440> take<00:05:19.590> it<00:05:19.650> because<00:05:19.949> first<00:05:20.580> of<00:05:20.729> all<00:05:20.910> if<00:05:21.270> I

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
to take it because first of all if I

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.150 
to take it because first of all if I
take<00:05:21.660> that<00:05:21.840> second<00:05:22.199> that<00:05:22.410> third<00:05:22.680> base<00:05:22.949> right

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
take that second that third base right

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.379 
take that second that third base right
there<00:05:23.600> my<00:05:24.600> money<00:05:24.840> supply<00:05:25.260> is<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.699> lot<00:05:26.699> lower<00:05:26.910> and

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
there my money supply is a lot lower and

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.570 
there my money supply is a lot lower and
it's<00:05:27.840> it's<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.440> base<00:05:28.620> is<00:05:28.770> too<00:05:28.949> weak<00:05:29.160> for<00:05:29.370> me<00:05:29.430> to

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
it's it's the base is too weak for me to

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.129 
it's it's the base is too weak for me to
actually<00:05:29.729> keep<00:05:30.060> it<00:05:30.180> up<00:05:30.330> depending<00:05:30.660> how<00:05:30.870> strong

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
actually keep it up depending how strong

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.500 
actually keep it up depending how strong

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:47.480 
cash and then no it was really easy to

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.060

keep<00:07:47.570> this<00:07:47.720> guy<00:07:47.870> down<00:07:47.930> by<00:07:48.320> not<00:07:48.470> letting<00:07:48.860> him
