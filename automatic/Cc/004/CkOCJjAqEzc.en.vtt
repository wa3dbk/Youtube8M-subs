00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hi everyone so this is going to be my

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.349 
hi everyone so this is going to be my
part<00:00:03.720> one<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.859> new<00:00:05.310> series<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.910> am<00:00:05.940> doing

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
part one of a new series I am doing

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.059 
part one of a new series I am doing
which<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.930> breeding<00:00:07.200> leopard<00:00:07.649> geckos

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069

which is about breeding leopard geckos
and<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.880> thought<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.210> would<00:00:09.300> be<00:00:09.389> perfect

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
and I thought it would be perfect

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.080 
and I thought it would be perfect
because<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.559> perfect<00:00:11.190> time<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.490> think

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
because it's a perfect time to think

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.020

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
videos so that's just a little update so

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.890 
videos so that's just a little update so
let's<00:02:28.069> go<00:02:28.160> start<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.459> on<00:02:28.640> breeding<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.540> when

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
let's go start it on breeding so when

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.360 
let's go start it on breeding so when
you<00:02:29.989> first<00:02:30.200> start<00:02:30.500> out<00:02:30.590> on<00:02:30.830> breathing<00:02:31.250> you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
you first start out on breathing you

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.180 
you first start out on breathing you
want<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.640> focus<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.360> size<00:02:32.840> first<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.739> is<00:02:33.950> one

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
want to focus on size first that is one

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.280 
want to focus on size first that is one
of<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> first<00:02:34.610> things<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:35.000> look<00:02:35.299> at<00:02:35.510> each

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
of the first things I look at each

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.339 
of the first things I look at each
potential<00:02:36.769> mom<00:02:37.099> can<00:02:37.489> have<00:02:37.610> up<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.060> 10<00:02:38.569> babies

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
potential mom can have up to 10 babies

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.009 
potential mom can have up to 10 babies
at<00:02:39.590> one<00:02:39.830> time<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.640> want<00:02:40.849> to<00:02:41.060> calculate

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
at one time so you want to calculate

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.979 
at one time so you want to calculate
that<00:02:42.470> times<00:02:43.250> how<00:02:43.580> many<00:02:43.760> females<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.450> have<00:02:44.630> so

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
that times how many females you have so

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.750 
that times how many females you have so
if<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:46.340> have<00:02:47.319> five<00:02:48.319> or<00:02:48.349> six<00:02:48.980> females<00:02:49.459> that's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
if you have five or six females that's

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.890 
if you have five or six females that's
potentially<00:02:50.799> fifty<00:02:51.799> or<00:02:51.920> sixty<00:02:52.450> babies<00:02:53.450> to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
potentially fifty or sixty babies to

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.530 
potentially fifty or sixty babies to
feed<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.769> water<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.849> have<00:02:56.060> cages<00:02:56.569> for<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.590> sell

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
feed to water to have cages for to sell

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.710 
feed to water to have cages for to sell
that's<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.720> lot<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:01.239> especially<00:03:02.239> with<00:03:02.480> small

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
that's a lot so especially with small

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.150 
that's a lot so especially with small
Britain<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.200> recommend<00:03:03.709> starting<00:03:03.829> off<00:03:04.010> with

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
Britain I recommend starting off with

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.780 
Britain I recommend starting off with
one<00:03:04.459> male<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.910> one<00:03:05.660> two<00:03:05.959> three<00:03:06.010> females<00:03:07.010> this

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
one male and one two three females this

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.009 
one male and one two three females this
is<00:03:07.970> because<00:03:08.299> if<00:03:08.420> you're<00:03:08.510> gonna<00:03:08.630> keep<00:03:08.870> them

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
is because if you're gonna keep them

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.590 
is because if you're gonna keep them
together<00:03:09.230> in<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.739> colony<00:03:10.340> which<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.209> also

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
together in a colony which is also

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.020 
together in a colony which is also
something<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.620> lot<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.040> people<00:03:13.250> like<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.370> do<00:03:13.609> if

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
something a lot of people like to do if

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.920 
something a lot of people like to do if
you<00:03:14.329> have<00:03:14.420> more<00:03:14.660> than<00:03:14.780> one<00:03:14.959> female<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.650> will

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
you have more than one female it will

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.710 
you have more than one female it will
exponentially<00:03:17.930> decrease<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.980> chances<00:03:19.549> of

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
exponentially decrease the chances of

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.050 
exponentially decrease the chances of
your<00:03:20.720> female<00:03:21.709> being<00:03:21.920> oversexed<00:03:22.519> which<00:03:22.910> is

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
your female being oversexed which is

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.650 
your female being oversexed which is
basically<00:03:24.130> she<00:03:25.130> can't<00:03:25.400> he<00:03:26.060> wants<00:03:26.329> it<00:03:26.420> too<00:03:26.540> much

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
basically she can't he wants it too much

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.229 
basically she can't he wants it too much
and<00:03:26.930> yeah<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:27.829> that<00:03:28.250> turns<00:03:28.519> out<00:03:28.670> bad<00:03:28.819> so<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:29.120> you

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
and yeah so that turns out bad so if you

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.690 
and yeah so that turns out bad so if you
have<00:03:29.389> more<00:03:29.569> than<00:03:29.690> one<00:03:29.840> female<00:03:30.370> typically<00:03:31.370> the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
have more than one female typically the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.729 
have more than one female typically the
male<00:03:32.209> will<00:03:32.480> try<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.840> mate<00:03:33.200> with<00:03:33.230> all<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.620> them

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
male will try to mate with all of them

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.309 
male will try to mate with all of them
and<00:03:33.980> it'll<00:03:34.130> be<00:03:34.250> good<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.030> secondly<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.200> want

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
and it'll be good and secondly you want

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.870 
and it'll be good and secondly you want
to<00:03:36.470> look<00:03:36.769> at<00:03:36.950> more<00:03:37.190> there's<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.730> couple

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
to look at more there's a couple

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.860 
to look at more there's a couple
different<00:03:38.000> ways<00:03:38.329> of<00:03:38.480> doing<00:03:38.569> it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
different ways of doing it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.110 
different ways of doing it
some<00:03:39.019> people<00:03:39.319> go<00:03:39.410> with<00:03:39.620> what's<00:03:40.250> popular<00:03:40.760> some
