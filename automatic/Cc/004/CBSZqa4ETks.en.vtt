a huge effort here from stores that

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.210 
a huge effort here from stores that
we've<00:01:35.450> seen<00:01:35.630> in<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.780> past<00:01:36.009> we've<00:01:37.009> been

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
we've seen in the past we've been

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.370 
we've seen in the past we've been
typically<00:01:37.909> lagging<00:01:38.240> behind<00:01:38.329> compared<00:01:39.259> to<00:01:39.319> the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
rest of the high street so this is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.730 
rest of the high street so this is
definitely<00:01:41.569> an<00:01:41.780> example<00:01:42.229> of<00:01:42.289> where<00:01:42.470> we'd<00:01:42.590> like

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
definitely an example of where we'd like

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.010 
definitely an example of where we'd like
to<00:01:42.860> see<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.130> bike<00:01:43.250> industry<00:01:43.459> going<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.149> a
