grass block i would actually need colors
that<00:00:42.690> don't<00:00:42.750> exist<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.559> Lego<00:00:44.010> form<00:00:44.840> definitely

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that don't exist in Lego form definitely

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.600 
that don't exist in Lego form definitely
could<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:45.960> been<00:00:46.670> better<00:00:48.379> executed<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.039> had

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
could have been better executed if I had

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.000 
could have been better executed if I had
more<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.780> guess<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> light<00:00:52.739> brown

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
more of I guess it's the light brown

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.580 
more of I guess it's the light brown
color<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:54.239> call<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> tan<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.050> apparently

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
color I would call it tan but apparently

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.860 
color I would call it tan but apparently
sand<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.100> called<00:00:56.340> tan<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> know<00:00:57.690> that's

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
sand is called tan but you know that's

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.990 
sand is called tan but you know that's
that's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.379> part<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.309> challenge<00:00:59.760> is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that's a part of the the challenge is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900 
that's a part of the the challenge is
making<00:01:00.210> sure<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.910> create

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
making sure that you can create

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
making sure that you can create
something<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.989> your<00:01:04.409> resources<00:01:05.010> being

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
something with your resources being

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.830 
something with your resources being
limited<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:09.030> think<00:01:09.270> I

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
limited to what you have and I think I

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.200 
limited to what you have and I think I
executed<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.830> pretty<00:01:11.040> well<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> way

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
executed it pretty well I like the way

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.450 
executed it pretty well I like the way
it<00:01:12.330> turned<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.100> by<00:01:14.280> looking

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
it turned out as you can see by looking

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.030 
it turned out as you can see by looking
at<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.390> placement<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> blocks<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.799> are

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
at the placement of the blocks there are

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.149 
at the placement of the blocks there are
many<00:01:17.820> different<00:01:18.180> bricks<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.950> styles<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
many different bricks and styles of

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.820 
many different bricks and styles of
bricks<00:01:20.430> being<00:01:20.759> used<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:22.020> make<00:01:22.439> sure<00:01:22.470> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
bricks being used here to make sure that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.910 
bricks being used here to make sure that
it<00:01:22.979> gets<00:01:23.900> created<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.590> something<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
it gets created but that's something to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.010 
it gets created but that's something to
always<00:01:26.280> keep<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.610> mind<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:26.909> builds<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
always keep in mind in your builds it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.950 
always keep in mind in your builds it
doesn't<00:01:28.409> matter<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.400> full

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
doesn't matter if you have the full

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.450 
doesn't matter if you have the full
piece<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.470> doesn't<00:01:31.740> matter<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.430> have

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
piece it doesn't matter if you have

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
piece it doesn't matter if you have
something<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.090> fills<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.720> entire<00:01:33.750> section

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
something that fills the entire section

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
something that fills the entire section
you<00:01:34.680> need<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.400> only<00:01:35.549> matters<00:01:35.939> about<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.420> is
