obviously we want to get transfer player

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.690 
obviously we want to get transfer player
i<00:03:15.590> think<00:03:15.889> i<00:03:15.950> might<00:03:16.160> have<00:03:16.310> got<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.489> transfer

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
i think i might have got a transfer

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.909 
i think i might have got a transfer
player<00:03:17.060> already<00:03:17.319> but<00:03:18.319> probably<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:18.769> not

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
player already but probably just not

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.949 
player already but probably just not
noticing<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.549> think<00:03:19.609> that<00:03:19.880> Valdez<00:03:20.510> guy<00:03:20.690> was

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
noticing it I think that Valdez guy was

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.640 
noticing it I think that Valdez guy was
one<00:03:21.139> but<00:03:21.709> get<00:03:21.859> Hernandez<00:03:22.340> okay<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.169> he's<00:03:24.169> you

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
one but get Hernandez okay so he's you

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.830 
one but get Hernandez okay so he's you
know<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.919> good<00:03:25.069> player<00:03:25.280> FIFA<00:03:25.639> but<00:03:26.030> he's<00:03:26.629> not

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
know a good player FIFA but he's not

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.860 
know a good player FIFA but he's not
really<00:03:27.019> worth<00:03:27.349> too<00:03:27.560> much<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:29.209> is<00:03:29.599> going

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
really worth too much so that is going

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.140 
really worth too much so that is going
to<00:03:30.139> be<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.680> end<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.400> video<00:03:31.489> guys<00:03:31.760> if<00:03:31.790> you
