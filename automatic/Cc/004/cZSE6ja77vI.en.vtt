00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
anyways I post a veil Here I am like the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.080 
anyways I post a veil Here I am like the
weight<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.270> said<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.170> game<00:00:47.090> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
weight like I said with this game the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.260 
weight like I said with this game the
controls<00:00:48.390> aren't<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:49.020> lot<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.969> regular

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
controls aren't a lot like the regular

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.470 
controls aren't a lot like the regular
Mart<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.710> newer<00:00:52.980> Mario's<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.940> guess

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
Mart or like the newer Mario's I guess

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.720 
Mart or like the newer Mario's I guess
this<00:00:54.780> would<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> regular<00:00:55.320> Mart<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:55.890> not

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this would be the regular Mart but not

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.170 
this would be the regular Mart but not
like<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.649> new<00:00:58.649> Mario's<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.489> any<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.879> they

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
like the new Mario's in any way they

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
like the new Mario's in any way they
like<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.469> controls<00:01:01.829> are<00:01:02.010> somewhat<00:01:02.430> awkward

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
like the controls are somewhat awkward

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.060 
like the controls are somewhat awkward
and<00:01:03.030> somehow<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.690> survived<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.680> really

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and somehow I survived here I really

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.289
