00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.460
 How did Resident Evil end up 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.580
 Wesker ... 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.900
 You're behind all this. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.100
 You're like all things here. 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.560
 The slave of Umbrella. 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.960
 Clever girl. 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.580
 I've always been with Umbrella. 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.540
 You fucking ... 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.620
 Things you mentioned are nothing. 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.000
 View! 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.320
 Ultimate life form! 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.160
 What the? 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.340
 Sir, I don't know how to say ... 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.460
 we can't complete the t-virus project. 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 Damn it, Phillips! 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.660
 Why the hell not? 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.660
 I'm here in the middle of a monologue. 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.370
 In short, we have exceeded the budget, sir. These are hard times and honestly 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850
 we need to shrink lab coats. 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.480
 I mean, between the monsters and the big snake ... 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.360
 and sharks ... Like, do we need zombie sharks? 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.920
 Good white is not cheap! 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.580
 Okay, Wesker, enough. 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.960
 Guys, please give me a minute. 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.120
 Okay, what about independent funding? 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.300
 Hollywood loves zombies! 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.310
 Sure, he does. 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.080
 And some hot-shot director Anderson is impressed 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.200
 acquiring rights to your life story. 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.140
 Paul Thomas Anderson? I love his work! 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.960
 No, Paul WS Anderson. 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.600
 Mortal Kombat? 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.700
 Neee !!!!! 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.729
 Use it, Jill! 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.540
 Use it !!! 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.460
 Apply tooooo !!! 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.100
 This is your last chance. 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.200
 I think we've saved the world enough for today. 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.680
 Chris 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.520
 I've always felt ... 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.800
 Shhh ... 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.220
 I know...
