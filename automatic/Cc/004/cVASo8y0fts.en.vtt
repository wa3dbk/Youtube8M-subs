00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
now something I found during the testing

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.109 
now something I found during the testing
was<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.969> the<00:01:13.780> e-tec<00:01:14.140> 25<00:01:14.590> was<00:01:14.740> very<00:01:14.950> quiet<00:01:15.280> some

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
was it the e-tec 25 was very quiet some

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.760 
was it the e-tec 25 was very quiet some
of<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.359> is<00:01:16.719> because<00:01:17.109> of<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.320> insulation

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
of that is because of the insulation

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.800 
of that is because of the insulation
built<00:01:18.159> inside<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.880> engine<00:01:18.969> cowling<00:01:19.420> but<00:01:19.600> most
