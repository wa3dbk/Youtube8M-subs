for<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.420> whole<00:01:27.540> summer<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.960> don't<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.170> when

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
for the whole summer I don't think when

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.719 
for the whole summer I don't think when
I<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.530> summer<00:01:28.710> school<00:01:28.770> there's<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.310> slim

chance<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.119> might<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.840> my<00:01:31.020> grades

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
chance I might just because my grades

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.539 
chance I might just because my grades
are<00:01:31.380> kind<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.560> slipping<00:01:31.829> right<00:01:31.950> now<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:32.280> I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
are kind of slipping right now because I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.450 
are kind of slipping right now because I
really<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.909> don't<00:01:33.060> care<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:34.159> yeah<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.400> then

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really just don't care but yeah and then

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.280 
really just don't care but yeah and then
I<00:01:35.610> still<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.329> figure<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:36.659> how<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.200> gonna
