get<00:00:00.810> rid<00:00:00.900> of<00:00:00.960> that<00:00:01.280> back<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.550> one<00:00:04.190> so<00:00:05.190> here

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
get rid of that back to this one so here

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.940 
get rid of that back to this one so here
we<00:00:05.810> don't<00:00:06.810> need<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.200> make<00:00:07.350> note<00:00:07.560> objects

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
we don't need to make note objects

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.150 
we don't need to make note objects
anymore<00:00:08.250> because<00:00:11.300> we<00:00:12.300> can<00:00:12.570> deal<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.830> that

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
anymore because we can deal with that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.750 
anymore because we can deal with that
information<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:16.350> note<00:00:16.859> on<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:17.520> side

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
information as a note on on this side

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.790 
information as a note on on this side
and<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.000> note<00:00:18.150> off<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.840> side<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.500> may<00:00:19.619> know

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
and a note off on this side so may know

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.679 
and a note off on this side so may know
doesn't<00:00:20.160> need<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.369> make<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> dough<00:00:21.210> toss<00:00:21.420> for

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
doesn't need to make the dough toss for

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.750 
doesn't need to make the dough toss for
us<00:00:21.869> what's<00:00:22.140> happening<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:23.100> make<00:00:23.340> note<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
us what's happening with make note is

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.040 
us what's happening with make note is
that<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.029> makes<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.420> note<00:00:24.600> plays<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> note<00:00:25.920> of

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
that it makes the note plays the note of

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.660 
that it makes the note plays the note of
the<00:00:28.050> number<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.500> receives<00:00:28.890> with<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the number that it receives with a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
the number that it receives with a
velocity<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.150> 127<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.260> then<00:00:31.830> 200

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
velocity of 127 and then 200

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.620 
velocity of 127 and then 200
milliseconds<00:00:32.759> later<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.180> send<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> same

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
milliseconds later it will send the same

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.660 
milliseconds later it will send the same
note<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.110> last<00:00:34.290> year<00:00:34.469> 0<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.550> it

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
note for the last year 0 and it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
note for the last year 0 and it
remembers<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.540> notes<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:36.960> received<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.440> it

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
remembers what notes it's received so it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.350 
remembers what notes it's received so it
knows<00:00:37.739> when<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> send<00:00:39.290> notice<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> what

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
knows when to send notice to it so what

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.110 
knows when to send notice to it so what
I'm<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.050> instead<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.789> don't

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
I'm going to do is instead of so don't

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.410 
I'm going to do is instead of so don't
have<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> reconnect<00:00:45.719> anything<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:47.210> i'm<00:00:48.210> going

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
have to reconnect anything and i'm going

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.560 
have to reconnect anything and i'm going
to<00:00:48.510> use<00:00:48.809> pack<00:00:54.469> now<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.620> I've<00:00:55.680> done<00:00:55.800> there

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
to use pack now what I've done there

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
to use pack now what I've done there
cynically<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:58.309> to<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> blue<00:01:01.500> values<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.070> 0

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
cynically is to the blue values in a 0

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.450 
cynically is to the blue values in a 0
127<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.629> when<00:01:03.780> these<00:01:04.019> come<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.439> they<00:01:05.280> only

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
127 but when these come in they only

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.760 
127 but when these come in they only
update<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> left<00:01:06.150> hand<00:01:06.330> side<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.810> 127<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
update the left hand side so 127 is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.440 
update the left hand side so 127 is
never<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> change<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.119> always

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
never going to change so it's always

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
never going to change so it's always
going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> velocity<00:01:10.170> 127<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.040> we're

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
going to be a velocity 127 so we're

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.859 
going to be a velocity 127 so we're
going<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> output<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.729> list<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.720> note

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
going to output a list of the note

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.149 
going to output a list of the note
number<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.320> send<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.770> left<00:01:13.950> hand

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
number that you send into the left hand

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.410 
number that you send into the left hand
in<00:01:14.280> luck<00:01:14.430> which<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.640> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> update<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> 0

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
in luck which is going to update the 0

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.289 
in luck which is going to update the 0
plus<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.380> velocity<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.830> an<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.100> 27<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
plus a velocity of an or 27 and then it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.780 
plus a velocity of an or 27 and then it
will<00:01:18.450> update<00:01:18.750> notes<00:01:19.259> out<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.670> do

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
will update notes out and then if we do

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.300 
will update notes out and then if we do
the<00:01:20.880> same<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.240> over<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:23.180> back<00:01:24.320> 00<00:01:25.320> then

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the same thing over here back 00 then

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.399 
the same thing over here back 00 then
this<00:01:26.460> time<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.240> 0<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> left<00:01:27.869> hand<00:01:28.140> side<00:01:28.200> is

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
this time the 0 on the left hand side is

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.319 
this time the 0 on the left hand side is
just<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> placeholder<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:29.189> both<00:01:29.310> cases<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.210> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
just a placeholder in both cases so it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.969 
just a placeholder in both cases so it
will<00:01:30.450> always<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.780> updated<00:01:31.320> by<00:01:31.500> whatever<00:01:31.680> comes

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
will always be updated by whatever comes

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.789 
will always be updated by whatever comes
in<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> note<00:01:32.490> number<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> then<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
in as a note number and then the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.920 
in as a note number and then the
velocity<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.939> always<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.479> 0<00:01:36.689> from

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
velocity of is always going to be 0 from

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.260 
velocity of is always going to be 0 from
this<00:01:37.079> side<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.950> what<00:01:38.100> we're<00:01:38.250> doing<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.000> send

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
this side so what we're doing if I send

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.830 
this side so what we're doing if I send
that<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.570> same<00:01:39.840> place<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
that to the same place is to to get a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.200 
that to the same place is to to get a
note<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.110> 127<00:01:46.890> velocity<00:01:47.399> whenever<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.030> press

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
note of 127 velocity whenever we press

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.899 
note of 127 velocity whenever we press
the<00:01:48.360> key<00:01:48.509> down<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.560> note<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.920> velocity<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.670> 0

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909

and<00:02:04.120> then<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.390> stops<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:06.660> so<00:02:07.660> on<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.900> exercise<00:02:08.380> 3

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
and then it stops it so on to exercise 3

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.070 
and then it stops it so on to exercise 3
of<00:02:09.130> exercises<00:02:10.000> 3a<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:11.700> might<00:02:12.700> have<00:02:12.910> named<00:02:13.840> those

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
of exercises 3a I might have named those

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.160 
of exercises 3a I might have named those
into<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.620> law<00:02:15.090> less<00:02:16.090> confusing<00:02:16.600> me<00:02:16.810> but

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
into the law less confusing me but

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.130 
into the law less confusing me but
anyway<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:20.880> yeah<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.030> says<00:02:22.210> open<00:02:22.420> key<00:02:22.840> ctrl

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
anyway and yeah it says open key ctrl

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.560 
anyway and yeah it says open key ctrl
key<00:02:23.920> control<00:02:24.220> too<00:02:24.370> old<00:02:24.520> I'll<00:02:24.940> get<00:02:25.210> rid<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.450> this

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
key control too old I'll get rid of this

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.850 
key control too old I'll get rid of this
one<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:25.930> we<00:02:26.020> understand<00:02:26.440> how<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.650> one<00:02:26.830> works

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
one so we understand how this one works

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.640 
one so we understand how this one works
now<00:02:27.190> hopefully<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:29.700> keep<00:02:30.700> control<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.650> does

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
now hopefully and keep control to does

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.280 
now hopefully and keep control to does
exactly<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.280> same<00:02:33.340> thing<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.120> using<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:35.020> call

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
exactly the same thing but using a call

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.220 
exactly the same thing but using a call
again<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.900> here<00:02:37.900> if<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:38.350> double-click<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:38.890> colt

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.590 

we've<00:02:44.230> got<00:02:44.410> all<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.040> key<00:02:45.850> numbers<00:02:46.240> down

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
we've got all the the key numbers down

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.380 
we've got all the the key numbers down
on<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.780> left<00:02:46.960> hand<00:02:47.140> side<00:02:47.230> as<00:02:47.620> our<00:02:47.770> indices<00:02:48.390> so

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
on the left hand side as our indices so

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.850 
on the left hand side as our indices so
note<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.660> they<00:02:49.900> don't<00:02:50.110> have<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.530> in

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
note that they don't have to be in

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.330 
note that they don't have to be in
ascending<00:02:51.700> order<00:02:51.970> or<00:02:52.300> anything<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.340> they

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
ascending order or anything and they

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.550 
ascending order or anything and they
they<00:02:54.850> just<00:02:55.030> need<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.210> appear<00:02:55.570> there<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.020> then

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
they just need to appear there and then

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.180 
they just need to appear there and then
the<00:02:56.950> notes<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.460> you<00:02:57.580> want<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.390> happen<00:02:59.170> or<00:03:00.010> on

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
the notes that you want to happen or on

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.800 
the notes that you want to happen or on
the<00:03:00.280> right<00:03:00.430> hand<00:03:00.640> side<00:03:00.760> again<00:03:01.390> those<00:03:01.600> could<00:03:01.780> be

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
the right hand side again those could be

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
the right hand side again those could be
in<00:03:01.960> any<00:03:02.050> order<00:03:02.290> they<00:03:02.470> wouldn't<00:03:02.740> necessarily

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
in any order they wouldn't necessarily

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.350 
in any order they wouldn't necessarily
have<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.250> be<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:04.050> rising<00:03:05.050> over<00:03:05.200> there<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:07.090> when

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
have to be in rising over there so when

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.260 
have to be in rising over there so when
I<00:03:07.390> press<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.900> key<00:03:08.050> 120<00:03:08.830> 248<00:03:09.550> will<00:03:09.700> be<00:03:09.790> sent

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
I press the key 120 248 will be sent

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.940 
I press the key 120 248 will be sent
through<00:03:10.540> here<00:03:11.040> here<00:03:12.040> we've<00:03:12.640> got<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:13.950> message

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
through here here we've got a message

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.760 
through here here we've got a message
box<00:03:15.480> which<00:03:16.480> does<00:03:16.660> exactly<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.140> same<00:03:17.170> thing<00:03:17.350> as

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
box which does exactly the same thing as

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.340 
box which does exactly the same thing as
the<00:03:18.010> pack<00:03:18.190> object<00:03:18.550> was<00:03:18.670> doing<00:03:18.910> before<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.480> it

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
the pack object was doing before and it

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.190 
the pack object was doing before and it
routes<00:03:20.620> through<00:03:21.100> them<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:22.090> note<00:03:22.450> number<00:03:22.840> that

routes through them the note number that

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.000 
routes through them the note number that
we<00:03:23.320> had<00:03:24.030> which<00:03:25.030> effort<00:03:25.600> if<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.840> were<00:03:25.930> 122<00:03:26.680> press

well<00:04:08.620> and<00:04:09.299> we<00:04:10.299> in<00:04:10.510> fact<00:04:10.690> encounter<00:04:11.440> dollar<00:04:11.650> one

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
well and we in fact encounter dollar one

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.710 
well and we in fact encounter dollar one
and<00:04:12.130> then<00:04:12.220> dollar<00:04:12.430> to<00:04:12.640> dollar<00:04:12.910> three<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.420> so

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
and then dollar to dollar three and so

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.750 
and then dollar to dollar three and so
and<00:04:14.580> which<00:04:15.840> refers<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.200> different<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:18.370> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
and which refers to different the the

and which refers to different the the
items<00:04:19.329> in<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.600> list<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:20.049> might<00:04:20.380> come<00:04:20.620> in<00:04:20.850> but

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
items in a list that might come in but

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.950 
items in a list that might come in but
you<00:04:22.000> don't<00:04:22.030> need<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.360> worry<00:04:22.480> about<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.840> right

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
you don't need to worry about that right

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.560 
you don't need to worry about that right
now<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:26.560> think<00:04:26.610> for<00:04:27.610> this<00:04:27.700> tutorial<00:04:27.940> yes<00:04:28.420> it

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
now and I think for this tutorial yes it

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.720 
now and I think for this tutorial yes it
is
