it's got a good representative hardware
that'll<00:00:21.949> allow<00:00:22.430> you<00:00:22.490> to<00:00:22.699> you<00:00:23.390> know<00:00:23.449> you<00:00:23.539> once<00:00:23.900> I

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
that'll allow you to you know you once I

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.080 
that'll allow you to you know you once I
show<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:24.320> how<00:00:24.560> to<00:00:24.619> how<00:00:25.430> to<00:00:25.460> determine<00:00:25.850> whether

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
show you how to how to determine whether

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.300 
show you how to how to determine whether
or<00:00:26.210> not<00:00:26.330> it's<00:00:26.570> active<00:00:26.869> or<00:00:26.960> passive<00:00:27.189> you'll<00:00:28.189> be

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
or not it's active or passive you'll be

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.420 
or not it's active or passive you'll be
able<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:28.550> tell<00:00:28.699> that<00:00:28.730> for<00:00:29.029> all<00:00:29.710> pcs<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:31.279> if<00:00:31.340> you

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
able to tell that for all pcs so if you

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.299 
able to tell that for all pcs so if you
look<00:00:31.580> in<00:00:31.699> here<00:00:31.730> it's<00:00:32.509> got<00:00:32.719> this<00:00:32.929> green<00:00:33.559> cowling

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
look in here it's got this green cowling

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.229 
look in here it's got this green cowling
right<00:00:34.489> here<00:00:34.639> this<00:00:35.239> is<00:00:35.539> a<00:00:35.600> fan<00:00:36.969> active<00:00:37.969> cooling

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
right here this is a fan active cooling

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.450 
right here this is a fan active cooling
means<00:00:39.019> that<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.350> have<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.559> fan<00:00:40.039> that<00:00:40.399> is

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
means that you have a fan that is

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.660 
means that you have a fan that is
cooling<00:00:41.149> the<00:00:41.359> CPU<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.620> this<00:00:43.159> one<00:00:43.339> here<00:00:43.579> has

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
cooling the CPU and this one here has

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.569 
cooling the CPU and this one here has
got<00:00:43.699> this<00:00:44.030> fan<00:00:44.389> that<00:00:45.019> it'll<00:00:45.949> pull<00:00:46.190> out<00:00:46.339> and<00:00:46.519> you

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
got this fan that it'll pull out and you

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.639 
got this fan that it'll pull out and you
can<00:00:46.699> see<00:00:46.879> it's<00:00:47.030> got<00:00:47.209> a<00:00:47.239> fan<00:00:47.539> right<00:00:47.989> there<00:00:48.049> and

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
can see it's got a fan right there and

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.739 
can see it's got a fan right there and
what<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:48.859> does<00:00:49.159> that<00:00:49.459> draws<00:00:49.760> air<00:00:50.089> over<00:00:50.539> the

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
what that does that draws air over the

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.160 
what that does that draws air over the
CPU<00:00:51.499> block<00:00:51.769> here<00:00:52.010> these<00:00:52.100> fins<00:00:52.549> and<00:00:52.959> blows<00:00:53.959> it

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
CPU block here these fins and blows it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.129 
CPU block here these fins and blows it
out<00:00:54.670> into<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.059> you<00:00:56.389> know<00:00:56.449> your<00:00:56.749> surrounding

that goes on the CPU and it's got fins

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.069 
that goes on the CPU and it's got fins
now<00:01:12.590> if<00:01:12.710> this<00:01:12.859> was<00:01:13.130> an<00:01:13.280> active<00:01:13.789> cooling<00:01:14.570> or

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
now if this was an active cooling or

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:15.669 
now if this was an active cooling or
excuse<00:01:15.500> me

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
excuse me

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.209 
excuse me
a<00:01:15.829> passive<00:01:16.520> passively<00:01:17.299> cooled<00:01:17.659> CPU<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.100> would

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
a passive passively cooled CPU you would

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.880 
a passive passively cooled CPU you would
just<00:01:19.429> see<00:01:19.640> this<00:01:19.880> there<00:01:20.570> would<00:01:20.689> be<00:01:20.719> no<00:01:20.929> no<00:01:21.530> fans

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
just see this there would be no no fans

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.069 
just see this there would be no no fans
blowing<00:01:22.820> air<00:01:23.149> over<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.899> would<00:01:24.049> just

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
blowing air over it it would just

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.039 
blowing air over it it would just
radiate<00:01:24.679> heat<00:01:24.950> off<00:01:25.189> of<00:01:25.369> these<00:01:25.520> fins<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.869> this

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
radiate heat off of these fins but this

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.719 
radiate heat off of these fins but this
like<00:01:27.500> I've<00:01:27.649> pointed<00:01:27.859> out<00:01:28.009> this<00:01:28.219> system<00:01:28.460> has

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
like I've pointed out this system has

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.649 
like I've pointed out this system has
got<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:29.179> separate<00:01:29.869> fan<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.799> goes<00:01:31.009> in<00:01:31.880> here<00:01:32.119> and

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
got a separate fan that goes in here and

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.889 
got a separate fan that goes in here and
draws<00:01:33.469> air<00:01:33.890> over<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.640> fins<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.270> out<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.840> the

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
draws air over the fins and out of the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.980 
draws air over the fins and out of the
case<00:01:36.170> now<00:01:37.009> there<00:01:37.579> are<00:01:37.909> often<00:01:38.359> times<00:01:38.539> you'll

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
case now there are often times you'll

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.770 
case now there are often times you'll
have<00:01:39.229> an<00:01:39.560> actively<00:01:40.399> cooled<00:01:40.729> CPU<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.630> has<00:01:41.749> a

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
have an actively cooled CPU that has a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.880 
have an actively cooled CPU that has a
fans<00:01:42.170> right<00:01:42.469> on<00:01:42.619> it

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
fans right on it

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.139 
fans right on it
like<00:01:43.159> I've<00:01:43.340> got<00:01:43.579> a<00:01:43.729> graphics<00:01:44.299> card<00:01:44.630> in<00:01:44.899> this

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
like I've got a graphics card in this

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.940 
like I've got a graphics card in this

CPU<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.069> this<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.280> actively<00:02:01.639> cooled<00:02:01.999> and<00:02:02.270> right

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
CPU so this is actively cooled and right

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.629 
CPU so this is actively cooled and right
now<00:02:02.899> if<00:02:03.049> this<00:02:03.229> machine<00:02:03.439> was<00:02:03.979> just<00:02:04.280> like<00:02:04.460> this

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
now if this machine was just like this

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:08.520 
now if this machine was just like this
this<00:02:04.850> would<00:02:04.999> be<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.119> passively<00:02:05.659> cooled<00:02:06.170> machine

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
this would be a passively cooled machine

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.960 
this would be a passively cooled machine
so<00:02:09.530> my<00:02:09.649> name<00:02:09.769> is<00:02:09.860> Matthew<00:02:10.159> pierce<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.670> today<00:02:10.940> I

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
so my name is Matthew pierce and today I

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.610 
so my name is Matthew pierce and today I
showed<00:02:11.299> you<00:02:11.450> how<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.599> determine<00:02:12.290> whether<00:02:12.470> or

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
showed you how to determine whether or

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.260 
showed you how to determine whether or
not

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
not

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.390 
not
your<00:02:13.360> CPU<00:02:13.840> has<00:02:14.110> active<00:02:14.590> or<00:02:14.770> passive<00:02:14.980> cooling

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
your CPU has active or passive cooling

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.630 
your CPU has active or passive cooling
