00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.210
 yo i break up and welcome back to 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.210
 minecraft moth 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.620
 yes many people who have something like that 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.690
 yes minecraft a bit easy or no 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.710
 I'm looking for another challenge because really 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.500
 pgp 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.750
 you don't have a lot of fighting slash 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.109
 just in single player 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.640
 so that's why you now have things like this 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.990
 as with this mouth the bed did 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.810
 towers mouth and then you get one 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.890
 tower say something like that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.340
 And yes, let's take a look 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.110
 take 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.910
 that simply what it is it is just 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.910
 a tower with different floors 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:47.100
 were sitting down and and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.620
 you could say one at each level 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.440
 kind of bonus that gets that 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:00.359
 for beating that of the level 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.890
 say well and then you have to say so 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.920
 just make sure you sit well now 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.449
 could be reading 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.590
 grabbed air and then flew to the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.460
 next one 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.460
 take a nice look here 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.180
 and then look then we just go here 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.460
 move upwards and higher 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.979
 the harder it is going to be because say 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.430
 but you get more and more founded 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.789
 spans are just sitting here say 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.789
 that's one thing 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.170
 but at the very top you also have one 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:42.619
 kind of boss a boss like 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:45.069
 ideas and the higher you come the better you 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.069
