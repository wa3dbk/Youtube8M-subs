 It is this headband, but it is not sold now 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.440
 It is said that you can customize it so it will be sold later such as separately sold cherry blossoms

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.750
 Yes remember 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:11.170
 There is also the advantage that it can be made somewhat compact by being able to be disassembled into this 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:16.120
 Also, since the cable is also detachable. 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.610
