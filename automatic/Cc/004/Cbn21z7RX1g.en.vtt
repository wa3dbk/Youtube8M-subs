the lowest earnings for major so here
you're<00:00:18.060> seeing<00:00:18.090> uh<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:19.020> majors<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
you're seeing uh the majors of the

highest average earnings obviously
there's<00:00:21.390> there<00:00:21.689> could<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.840> huge<00:00:22.170> change

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
there's there could be huge change

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.859 
there's there could be huge change
between<00:00:23.039> people<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.570> just

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
between people and this is for just

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.560 
between people and this is for just
bachelor<00:00:25.410> degrees<00:00:25.980> uh<00:00:26.340> only<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.359> not

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
bachelor degrees uh only so not

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.609 
bachelor degrees uh only so not
including<00:00:27.660> graduate<00:00:28.170> degrees<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.500> anything

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
including graduate degrees or anything

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800 
including graduate degrees or anything
like<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.660> that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
like that but I think that with that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.389 
like that but I think that with that
said<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.500> see<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> bit<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.070> pattern<00:00:32.250> here

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
said you can see a bit of a pattern here

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.100 
said you can see a bit of a pattern here
just<00:00:32.820> look<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> difference<00:00:33.570> even<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
just look at the difference even in the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.049 
just look at the difference even in the
top<00:00:34.350> jobs<00:00:34.739> yeah<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.610> true

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
top jobs yeah that's true

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.580 
top jobs yeah that's true
pick<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> very<00:00:36.630> top<00:00:36.930> drop<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.380> very

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
pick the very top drop at the very

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
pick the very top drop at the very
bottom<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.280> top<00:00:38.460> job<00:00:38.489> exactly<00:00:39.420> yeah

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
bottom of the top job exactly yeah

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.260 
bottom of the top job exactly yeah
still<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> lot<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.710> money<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.760> percent<00:00:42.149> is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
still a lot of money the one percent is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.350 
still a lot of money the one percent is
doing<00:00:42.510> quite<00:00:42.690> well<00:00:42.800> working<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.980> oil

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
doing quite well working in oil

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.790 
doing quite well working in oil
petroleum<00:00:45.360> engineering<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.230> don't<00:00:46.469> even<00:00:46.590> know

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
petroleum engineering I don't even know

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.170 
petroleum engineering I don't even know
if<00:00:46.920> most<00:00:47.100> people<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.520> college<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.850> know<00:00:47.969> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
if most people in college and know that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090 
if most people in college and know that
that's<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.539> major<00:00:48.809> didn't<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.739> there's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that's a major didn't know and there's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.950 
that's a major didn't know and there's
no<00:00:50.280> way<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:50.940> school<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.390> had

up your average earnings I didn't

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.410 
up your average earnings I didn't
realize<00:01:31.829> aerospace<00:01:32.400> engineering<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.270> like

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
realize aerospace engineering is like

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.870 
realize aerospace engineering is like
forth<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.140> list<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:35.340> good<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.640> sad

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
forth on this list that's good of sad

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.149 
forth on this list that's good of sad
why<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.320> hired<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:37.860> more

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
why you think that's we hired make more

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.710 
why you think that's we hired make more
money<00:01:38.369> yeah<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> guess<00:01:39.060> they're<00:01:39.180> making<00:01:39.420> planes

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
money yeah I guess they're making planes

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.179 
money yeah I guess they're making planes
I<00:01:39.990> know<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.350> making<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.009> ton<00:01:41.130> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
I know but if you making a ton of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.940 
I know but if you making a ton of
money<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.520> no<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.850> make<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.450> make<00:01:42.479> oil<00:01:42.950> or

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
money but no you make if you make oil or

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.319 
money but no you make if you make oil or
whatever<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.700> drilling

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
whatever it is that that drilling

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.730 
whatever it is that that drilling
equipment<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.930> something<00:01:46.020> apparently<00:01:46.380> that's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
equipment or something apparently that's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.410 
equipment or something apparently that's
more<00:01:46.920> valuable<00:01:47.250> than<00:01:47.460> making<00:01:47.640> spaceships<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
more valuable than making spaceships and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.060 
more valuable than making spaceships and
and<00:01:48.600> rocket<00:01:49.200> planes<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.619> stuff<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.860> that

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and rocket planes and stuff like that

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.580 
and rocket planes and stuff like that
but<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:51.000> everybody<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.810> doing<00:01:52.110> very<00:01:52.439> well

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
but not everybody is doing very well

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.740 
but not everybody is doing very well
with<00:01:53.070> their<00:01:53.250> majors<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.909> least<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.360> terms<00:01:54.570> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
with their majors at least in terms of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.120 
with their majors at least in terms of
the<00:01:54.810> money<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.259> let's<00:01:55.350> bring<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> lowest

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
the money so let's bring up the lowest

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.670 
the money so let's bring up the lowest
average<00:01:56.579> earnings<00:01:57.180> by<00:01:57.540> major<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.560> they're

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
average earnings by major and so they're

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.959 
average earnings by major and so they're
you're<00:01:58.860> seeing<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> de<00:01:59.460> list<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> little

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you're seeing it the de list is a little

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
you're seeing it the de list is a little
bit<00:02:00.119> different<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.960> many<00:02:01.110> engineering

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
bit different not so many engineering

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.969 
bit different not so many engineering
degrees<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.780> you've<00:02:03.780> got<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> couple<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
degrees here you've got a couple of that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.639 
degrees here you've got a couple of that
sort<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> health-related<00:02:05.700> ones

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
sort of health-related ones

that<00:02:14.990> said<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.800> then<00:02:15.890> Counseling<00:02:16.400> Psychology

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
that said and then Counseling Psychology

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.060 
that said and then Counseling Psychology
is<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.570> lowest<00:02:18.050> which<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:18.500> would<00:02:18.710> not<00:02:18.950> have

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
is the lowest which I would not have

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.790 
is the lowest which I would not have
guessed<00:02:19.780> earlier<00:02:20.780> good<00:02:20.990> education<00:02:21.560> all<00:02:21.680> these

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
guessed earlier good education all these

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.350 
guessed earlier good education all these
things<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.400> feel<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:22.820> really<00:02:23.030> matter

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
things that I feel like really matter

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.630 
things that I feel like really matter
don't<00:02:23.690> make<00:02:23.810> as<00:02:24.110> much<00:02:24.320> money<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.800> my<00:02:25.010> major<00:02:25.280> is

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
don't make as much money and my major is

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.280 
don't make as much money and my major is
on<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:25.970> list<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.840> makes<00:02:27.050> me<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> little

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
on this list that makes me a little

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.290 
on this list that makes me a little
nervous<00:02:27.590> but<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.130> wasn't<00:02:28.430> at<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.580> bottom<00:02:28.880> no

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
nervous but it wasn't at the bottom no

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.070 
nervous but it wasn't at the bottom no
it's<00:02:29.570> not<00:02:29.750> your<00:02:30.110> own<00:02:30.260> okay<00:02:30.620> okay<00:02:31.460> yeah<00:02:31.850> uh<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.050> a

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
it's not your own okay okay yeah uh so a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.480 
it's not your own okay okay yeah uh so a
couple<00:02:33.440> things<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.980> saw<00:02:34.190> there

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
couple things that you saw there

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.800 
couple things that you saw there
including<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:35.090> health<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.510> medical

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
including a health and medical

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.720 
including a health and medical
preparatory<00:02:36.290> programs<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:37.160> also<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
preparatory programs and also the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.030 
preparatory programs and also the
counseling<00:02:38.240> psychology<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.350> looks<00:02:39.620> really

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
counseling psychology it looks really

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.200 
counseling psychology it looks really
bad<00:02:40.190> when<00:02:40.460> you<00:02:40.550> see<00:02:40.700> them<00:02:40.820> at<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.940> bottom<00:02:41.180> that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
bad when you see them at the bottom that

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.970 
bad when you see them at the bottom that
list<00:02:41.540> but<00:02:41.750> they<00:02:41.930> they<00:02:42.170> explain<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.680> here<00:02:42.860> the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
list but they they explain it here the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.860 
list but they they explain it here the
reason<00:02:43.250> they<00:02:43.340> think<00:02:43.400> it's<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:43.820> low<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.360> that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
reason they think it's so low is that

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.870 
reason they think it's so low is that
those<00:02:45.080> jobs<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.770> you<00:02:45.980> want<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.430> get<00:02:46.580> by

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
those jobs that you want to get by

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.360 
those jobs that you want to get by
getting<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.240> major<00:02:47.510> really<00:02:48.350> require<00:02:49.010> a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
getting that major really require a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.100 
getting that major really require a
graduate<00:02:49.910> degree<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.540> if<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.750> were<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.930> drop

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
graduate degree and if you were to drop

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.180 
graduate degree and if you were to drop
out<00:02:51.290> before<00:02:51.380> getting<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.830> graduate<00:02:52.040> degree

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
out before getting a graduate degree

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.040 
out before getting a graduate degree
you're<00:02:52.550> not<00:02:52.700> really<00:02:52.940> qualified<00:02:53.390> for<00:02:53.570> job<00:02:53.930> in

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
you're not really qualified for job in

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.020 
you're not really qualified for job in
that<00:02:54.140> field<00:02:54.200> that's<00:02:54.860> true<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:55.400> how<00:02:55.550> how<00:02:55.880> much

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
that field that's true but how how much

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.820 
that field that's true but how how much
would<00:02:56.210> it<00:02:56.240> be<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.840> difference<00:02:57.530> do<00:02:57.710> you<00:02:57.740> think

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
would it be the difference do you think

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.060 
would it be the difference do you think
if<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.520> petroleum<00:02:59.240> engineer<00:02:59.690> got<00:02:59.930> even<00:03:00.890> more

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
if the petroleum engineer got even more

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.270 
if the petroleum engineer got even more
education<00:03:01.820> well<00:03:02.630> apparently<00:03:02.960> actually<00:03:03.710> for

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
education well apparently actually for

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.410 
education well apparently actually for
the<00:03:04.340> petroleum<00:03:04.730> engineering<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.390> uh

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
the petroleum engineering in uh

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.060 
the petroleum engineering in uh
specifically<00:03:06.320> they<00:03:06.620> don't<00:03:06.860> make

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
specifically they don't make

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.650 
specifically they don't make
significantly<00:03:07.700> more<00:03:07.910> money<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.270> a<00:03:08.300> graduate

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
significantly more money with a graduate

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.870 
significantly more money with a graduate
degree<00:03:08.800> because<00:03:09.800> apparently<00:03:10.250> what<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.520> is<00:03:10.610> if

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
degree because apparently what it is if

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.130 
degree because apparently what it is if
you<00:03:11.000> get<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.270> graduate<00:03:11.630> degree<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:11.930> that

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
you get the graduate degree in that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.720 
you get the graduate degree in that
field<00:03:12.440> that<00:03:12.590> implies<00:03:13.040> you're<00:03:13.340> going<00:03:13.640> to

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
field that implies you're going to

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.250 
field that implies you're going to
academic<00:03:14.180> work<00:03:14.360> which<00:03:14.600> doesn't<00:03:14.930> pay<00:03:15.020> as<00:03:15.140> well

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
academic work which doesn't pay as well

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.440 
academic work which doesn't pay as well
which<00:03:15.470> is<00:03:15.620> even<00:03:15.860> worse<00:03:15.890> yeah<00:03:16.459> exactly<00:03:16.640> yeah

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
which is even worse yeah exactly yeah

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.570 
which is even worse yeah exactly yeah
and<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.080> for<00:03:18.290> some<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.500> these<00:03:18.740> like<00:03:19.100> uh<00:03:19.130> like

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
and so for some of these like uh like

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.550 
and so for some of these like uh like
medical<00:03:20.060> degree<00:03:20.360> is<00:03:20.540> probably<00:03:20.930> MBA<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.470> you

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
medical degree is probably MBA is you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.870 
medical degree is probably MBA is you
definitely<00:03:21.950> benefit<00:03:22.340> from<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.550> graduate

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
definitely benefit from the graduate

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.699 
definitely benefit from the graduate
degree<00:03:23.120> but<00:03:23.300> for<00:03:23.450> others<00:03:23.750> you<00:03:24.260> can<00:03:24.410> just<00:03:24.590> get

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
degree but for others you can just get

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.170 
degree but for others you can just get
your<00:03:24.890> engineering<00:03:25.250> degree<00:03:25.310> go<00:03:25.820> out<00:03:25.940> make<00:03:26.150> a

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
your engineering degree go out make a

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.970 
your engineering degree go out make a
billion<00:03:26.420> dollars<00:03:26.540> do<00:03:27.320> much<00:03:27.470> better<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.830> rest

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
billion dollars do much better the rest

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.240 
billion dollars do much better the rest
of<00:03:28.100> us<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:28.430> easy<00:03:28.850> yeah<00:03:29.209> so<00:03:30.020> uh<00:03:30.050> you're<00:03:31.040> you're

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
of us so easy yeah so uh you're you're

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.250 
of us so easy yeah so uh you're you're
holding<00:03:31.670> down<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:31.880> lower<00:03:32.240> end<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.050> have

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
holding down the lower end but you have

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.990 
holding down the lower end but you have
the<00:03:33.470> sort<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:33.830> richness<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.459> life<00:03:34.520> of

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
the sort of richness of life of

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.760 
the sort of richness of life of
appreciating<00:03:35.720> culture<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.260> stuff<00:03:36.380> like<00:03:36.590> that

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
appreciating culture and stuff like that

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.010 
appreciating culture and stuff like that
yeah<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.550> I<00:03:38.090> with<00:03:38.420> my<00:03:38.450> political<00:03:38.990> science

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
yeah and I with my political science

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.930 
yeah and I with my political science
degree<00:03:39.410> I<00:03:39.560> don't<00:03:39.800> even<00:03:39.950> show<00:03:40.160> up<00:03:40.190> I'm<00:03:40.580> just

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
I guess hanging out in the middle they

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.470 
I guess hanging out in the middle they
feel<00:03:43.220> comfortable<00:03:43.700> there<00:03:43.850> yeah<00:03:44.209> that's<00:03:44.420> a

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
feel comfortable there yeah that's a

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.390 
feel comfortable there yeah that's a
good<00:03:44.660> space<00:03:44.810> yeah<00:03:45.020> yeah<00:03:45.800> so<00:03:46.070> is<00:03:46.160> everything

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
good space yeah yeah so is everything

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.490 
good space yeah yeah so is everything
else<00:03:46.610> everything<00:03:47.420> else<00:03:47.570> is<00:03:47.720> there<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:48.350> yeah

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
else everything else is there so yeah

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.140 
else everything else is there so yeah
exactly<00:03:48.650> there's<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:49.310> many<00:03:49.520> and<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:50.060> know

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
exactly there's so many and you know

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.270 
exactly there's so many and you know
were<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.780> will<00:03:51.290> eventually<00:03:51.560> reach<00:03:51.920> what<00:03:52.160> they

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
were I will eventually reach what they

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.010 
were I will eventually reach what they
say<00:03:52.550> should<00:03:52.610> be<00:03:52.790> my<00:03:53.030> average<00:03:53.360> salary<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.810> think

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
say should be my average salary I think

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.110 
say should be my average salary I think
but<00:03:54.709> anyway<00:03:54.770> yeah<00:03:55.100> like<00:03:55.370> we<00:03:55.489> said<00:03:55.700> it's<00:03:55.940> not

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
but anyway yeah like we said it's not

everything obviously you want to choose
a<00:03:57.950> major<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.550> will<00:03:58.670> get<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.940> job<00:03:59.030> that

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
a major that will get you a job that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.520 
a major that will get you a job that
you'll<00:03:59.450> actually<00:03:59.540> enjoy<00:04:00.050> because<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.410> don't

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
you'll actually enjoy because you don't

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.860 
you'll actually enjoy because you don't
to<00:04:00.650> hate<00:04:00.770> your<00:04:00.890> life<00:04:00.920> for<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.610> rest<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.060> but

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
to hate your life for the rest of it but

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.870 
to hate your life for the rest of it but
if<00:04:02.959> you<00:04:03.080> are<00:04:03.110> principally<00:04:03.920> concerned<00:04:04.070> with

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
if you are principally concerned with
