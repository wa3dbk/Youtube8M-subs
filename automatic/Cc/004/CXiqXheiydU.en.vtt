and try and get some to squeeze it takes

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.250 
and try and get some to squeeze it takes
a<00:00:40.980> long<00:00:41.190> time<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> move<00:00:42.120> from<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
a long time for it to move from here to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.709 
a long time for it to move from here to
here<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.550> also<00:00:44.730> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.300> hurts<00:00:45.510> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
here and it also kind of really hurts to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.660 
here and it also kind of really hurts to
squeeze<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> out<00:00:46.260> too

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
squeeze it out too

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.410

so it is very thick shampoo and all this

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
so it is very thick shampoo and all this
smells<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.680> let<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> know<00:00:52.920> smells

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
a very heavy shampoo it's I guess that's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.030 
a very heavy shampoo it's I guess that's
the<00:01:00.570> part<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> hydrating<00:01:01.620> part<00:01:02.629> but<00:01:03.629> yeah

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

repairs damaged hair and color

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.929 
repairs damaged hair and color
protection<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.100> will<00:01:17.369> definitely<00:01:17.820> say

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
protection so this I will definitely say

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.249 
protection so this I will definitely say
is<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.090> lot<00:01:18.240> easier<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.630> get<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.960> bottle

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
is a lot easier to get out of the bottle

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.249 
is a lot easier to get out of the bottle
than<00:01:19.439> this<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.240> thick<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:24.930> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
than this and it's not as thick as this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.630 
than this and it's not as thick as this
if<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.680> makes<00:01:26.040> sense

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
if that makes sense

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.789 
if that makes sense
like<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> shampoo<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
like you do this is a shampoo it's like

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.399 
like you do this is a shampoo it's like
very<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.159> like<00:01:29.670> heavy<00:01:29.939> thick<00:01:30.420> takes<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.259> long

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
very very like heavy thick takes a long

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.140 
very very like heavy thick takes a long
time<00:01:31.439> move<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.939> move<00:01:33.470> pretty<00:01:34.470> easily

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
time move this can move pretty easily

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.140 
time move this can move pretty easily
but<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.420> very<00:01:36.689> very<00:01:37.140> hydrating<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.950> love<00:01:38.850> this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
but it's very very hydrating I love this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.889 
but it's very very hydrating I love this
system<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.650> definitely<00:01:41.720> moisturizes<00:01:42.720> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
system it definitely moisturizes it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.350 
system it definitely moisturizes it
helps<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.350> frizz<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.130> would<00:01:44.970> definitely

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
helps with frizz I would definitely

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.359 
helps with frizz I would definitely
recommend<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.619> case<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.009> didn't<00:01:47.250> know

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
recommend this in case you didn't know

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.450 
recommend this in case you didn't know
that<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:48.619> considered<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.770> drugstore

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that this is considered like drugstore

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.830 
that this is considered like drugstore
line<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.270> they're<00:01:51.390> high<00:01:51.600> ends

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
line it's not because they're high ends

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.260 
line it's not because they're high ends
but<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.310> expensive<00:01:54.030> side

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
but it's on the more of expensive side

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.450 
but it's on the more of expensive side
in<00:01:54.479> my<00:01:54.630> opinion<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> drugstore<00:01:55.829> side<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
in my opinion of the drugstore side and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.429 
in my opinion of the drugstore side and
then<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> cream<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.630> says<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
then the cream just says that it

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.649 
then the cream just says that it
conditions<00:01:58.860> conditions<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.000> hydrates<00:02:00.450> and

conditions conditions and hydrates and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.580 
conditions conditions and hydrates and
limits<00:02:00.960> furs
