00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.450
 huge hello to all dear friends with 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.250
 I cast you and in this video I will argue 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.800
 on the topic 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.960
 removing level 12 fights from randomness and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.549
 let's talk about bots on boxing fee 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.049
 I fall at the end of the beginning talk on 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.039
 about level 12 battles 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.930
 why did they remove him and since they burn 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.560
 the developers chose us the tours were screw 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.769
 in order that the eight were less in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.289
 queues and up to eight respectively 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.510
 which is not preferential eight stand in 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.480
 queues less really throws 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.629
 Now the most anal and random look 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.940
 where zacate eighes 2 waffles in a team 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.320
 God, yes, in such fights, eights are very 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.600
 hard and from this much really strong 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.219
 injured eight 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.899
 because now it is very, very often 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.420
 really very often began to lose 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.430
 a dozen well, or I'm so lucky that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.440
 G8 just very often dick 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.020
 a dozen is borscht on here I'm playing now 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 really dozen often throws okay 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.710
 on the borsch there you can still play that is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.119
 no trouble masking gun good 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.320
 then we all feel fine about ourselves 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.270
 but don't know from on other dates on t32 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 it will be a bit heavy with a gun 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.950
 break down there only on goldie if 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.759
 that we either weak points you give times 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.869
 punch through the second one 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.810
 there is already a rather controversial issue therefore 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.270
 here everyone is the ear if 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.799
 talk about the other eight here 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.229
 Already everyone decides but in essence 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.299
 really eight began to throw more 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.549
 a dozen and this i don't think that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.170
 positive rate up they stand in 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.540
 lower queues would be better in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.399
 queue sent than to get into the top ten 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.810
 is it somehow comfortable for me to play 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.180
 but again they said something test 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.250
 the regime was possibly later level 12 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.950
 fights back but do so to a dozen 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.450
 it got less often well and if you talk about 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.600
 dozens then now 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.399
 dozens began to fall more often in the top like 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.250
 Now let's say they really 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.909
 comfortable level of fighting is now not such 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.450
 in at 12 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.819
 90 15 15 10 dozen dozen 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.480
 have we fall either in 1 st furby have 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.970
 us nines or get into level 10 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.720
 fights where eights generally bear therefore 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.750
 I would say that a dozen just now 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.239
 kicks play but what I noticed in the random 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.280
 something incredible is happening 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.230
 it feels like most 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.360
 players just down at the exit 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.440
 updates either on them so new focus 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.599
 affects but this is a different viewing angle in essence 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.120
 another camera though there is a mod which 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.420
 returns old fov already each again 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.569
 same decides really do not know what happened 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.349
 but not even the only lizard Ivan noticed that 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.950
 really players with steel update release 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:00.549
 this others they do not fluff and what they do 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.480
 In general, I played dozens at first and 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.280
 it was interesting but in the end now how are you 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.840
 so explain the approximate figure at least 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.400
 show you to understand to furnish 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.819
 laid down now 1307 efficiency up but he zajana 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.560
 went there but seriously on such a large 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.310
 noticeable tanks go under fire 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.410
 the waffle that stands there still there it is 704 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.290
 there is still a prototype here well why on 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.030
 what I wanted to help in our 132 given 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.000
 hardly possibly just wanted salted 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.889
 well because i don't understand maybe i 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.109
 I do not understand something, but I do not see the point 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.000
 on a lion on such a noticeable tanks there 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.090
 to withstand 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.880
 together provided that the map 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.400
 glowed enemy under this place a lot 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.950
 who was glowing 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.920
 in general , somehow badly affected by the update 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.790
 on the basis of 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.280
 stiffness even so low down these 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.550
 fairy tales evenness of players though 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.349
 just a coincidence I do not know saying I became 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.750
 notice it that is even a player with 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.959
 normal efficiency I already play there about 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.670
 players whose efficiency is not very capable of semi 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.019
 some actions of course do it 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.370
 happened before but still now 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.069
 for some reason, really private when due 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.849
 except dozens of it is just to drain us and levi 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.880
 and even though you try to play there you take out 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.380
 6 to 7 thousand damage sometimes 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.370
 get victory where you yourself really 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.740
 great contribution to the battle 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.120
 nastrelyal put it well, or large 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.030
 Just by the light, I shot it, well, really 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.760
 something made it happen so stupid 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.919
 if you reptiles I do not even know like 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.680
 sometimes I didnâ€™t stand at all writing in 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.419
 chat let's do without drain 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.340
 or was such a case always so accurate 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.580
 ok and then in chat eat turbo drain and 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:47.390
 ran sat on the fig immediately why then 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:50.360
 I do not understand my every with even 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.250
 fighting situation is getting worse although it is just 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.950
 maybe my luck is losing me 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.270
 such teams although the winning percentage and 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.900
 still trying to raise 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.520
 Now I wanted to give about bots why 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.970
 Here I am an interesting topic at all voiced 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.700
 the works were always another 1060 by the bot 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.710
 were already but were not quite unpretentious 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.420
 they have always been there and will even be there from 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.730
 options that there antipode next 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.700
 versions will be released I do not think that will affect 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.640
 on eradicating all the year miss out and 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.890
 people who will be a little bit like 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.600
 look for illusions of place in the game and bear 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.060
 hack and make bots for yourself 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.120
 why voice this topic I have now 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.520
 each on his figuratively alyoshka who 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.400
 did not know about the existence of the bot and hearing about 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.770
 the fact that there is here and that in r 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.740
 do not permanently ban for use 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.530
 bot download it put 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.400
 and I will play it now notice 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.640
 really if earlier 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.590
 bots I did not notice got players who 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.270
 poorly played it players are not bots if 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.870
 they doubt not wrote a fig 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.390
 the team is definitely not god then now 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.130
 sixth level I sometimes go out a ton 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.890
 hulk dark classroom play to the detriment 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.360
 In short, when I go out I just notice of 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.820
 a cage them bots i.e. this is the most 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.220
 simple year that just goes into battle 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.610
 and doing nothing is based on them 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.070
 It became a lot in 2 to 3 tanks for 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.680
 one fight is standing and to the base is that 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.270
 in general, why was it necessary to raise the topic 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.340
 bots and dedicate what's now in the random 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.260
 I am going on from this act at all 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.800
 I understand why the topic of bots should be covered 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.010
 because when they don't know people let 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.380
 even problems are accordingly 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.180
 anyway so part of the players who would 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.950
 put it anyway she doesn't know 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.500
 total i'm on it is not worth playing with 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.110
 him and now 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.910
 those who did not know at all 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.130
 accordingly to use 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.830
 situation thermostat as they say 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:49.750
 I can tightly me like a paste and 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:51.100
 why it is necessary to play I do not understand 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.980
 general now this problem is already needed 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.110
 fight everybody and definitely now 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.510
 Vega reaction is required because if 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.450
 earlier somehow the problem is not much 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.760
 was covered now everyone no longer knows 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.360
 just they all say and now 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.920
 I think 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.530
 really requires a reaction from 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.900
 wargaming them either permanent ban for 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.400
 use a bot or something else 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.210
 libanova really anti system here 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.250
 which at least will affect something 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.470
 because it is kapets for now and as far as 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.560
 dozens more not so often and on the eighth 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:27.360
 but also on the sixth on the fifth there 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.950
 really botovodov became much more 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.230
 at least that's how much I go in 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.070
 I see the battle that's really what it 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.350
 sweetie 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.720
 before this was not until the topic is not 

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.300
 this was not covered with a freak in general 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.530
 how much i played 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:46.580
 and this in my opinion it was a mistake so 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:49.830
 openly cover the subject of boating and 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.050
 now it's some kind of mainstream already 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:55.129
 channel recorded video about bots all this 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.129
 on display
