00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.480
 good morning to you our pruning 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.849
 continues and even arrived 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.179
 also in puglia from filippo cassaro and da 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.190
 his father at the company Paul van era 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.500
 now we are about to go to prune 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.529
 the sapling because the saplings still 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.570
 we had never seen this in total 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.970
 filippo was sapling of things this year 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.750
 will come of primitive primitives of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.579
 manduria of joy of the hill in 400 meters 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.559
 above sea level meets from 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.350
 own historical for the primitive and the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.030
 marchesana this vineyard here this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.890
 this appreciation then these 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.070
 create yourself how old they are but these years 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.789
 they are 50 60 years old we see it from the dal 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.680
 wood that there is a 65 name change ie 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.430
 ID card this little one does 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.309
 name derives 60 from the cuts from 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.059
 here until between to do are the cuts that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.340
 we do every year counting the cuts yes 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.890
 they count the trees they look at the same 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.990
 dawn is for sure wounds 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.810
 according to the cuts we see that age in 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.520
 effects of such dinners several and now 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.210
 let's see how it is pruned 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.570
 the sapling for milia 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.030
 then let's see while we cut 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.780
 more double renovations to this 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.950
 cloth point and let this be e 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.560
 thin cut it because this 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.630
 a bit of a master of this mario nation 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.939
 this one is the one from which equal between 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.540
 how much that left 1 and 2 centers 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.939
 a gem and two gems the second is there but 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.829
 which generates and this is the first that 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.299
 we can the little one we have it 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.820
 removed that they make it went that it is not 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.750
 perfect productive let's move on 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.869
 others 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.060
 kano we always keep that level 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.210
 thin away that one there 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.280
 and we leave this and we cut it 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.979
 all yes all you misery here but not a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.439
 I cut a little too much no no and get it 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.379
 from the same two gems this what 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.150
 they eat after a year it closes but 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.540
 this was in my old this there 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.400
 we are on the wood waste 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.400
 we cut the old and left 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.709
 the world is the cuts this there 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.560
 review quantity go to count on 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.650
 column even and if I do n't know if 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.459
 it's not difficult with talia then then 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:36.480
 let's go and vote where the same is here 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:39.040
 this and we leave we are at 6 m 6 cm 6 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.819
 we get another one here 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.689
 let this be the million these in 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.060
 Italian because it is the best and most 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:52.299
 I often see the law as true 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.109
 that the gems are gm that everyone doing 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:59.889
 they can go on 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.389
 we clean because otherwise from here we say that 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.579
 there is vegetation and it is not clear 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.730
 anything 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:09.819
 must if the days we have 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.010
 quite old and clear that there are 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.840
 also deadwood then no 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.940
 we announce the founder's ability 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.739
 just to recognize the branches ve 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.470
 we want to show it well 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.959
 pruning the stretcher so let's see 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.479
 another plant while you can see 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.569
 this way that this between 80 years 60 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:33.579
 we ask him no more or less for years 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.620
 because she is a lady and therefore of table 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.620
 lord is offended 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.510
 there was an accident ours 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.419
 pasquale porcelli risked dying 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.040
 but he is always Easterly alive if I live 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.930
 thankfully we go on 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.950
 then let's see how it settles 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:56.840
 Italy this plant to its 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:01.549
 proceeding two two gems are left 2 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.090
 here I this little thinner notary 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.879
 and I leave the most perfect one is not 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.150
 easy you only need to have one eye 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:15.889
 super I do it or me or though for 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.440
 use it Italy who does not know how to do it 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:22.190
 which branch should be chosen ie for 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.919
 example on this here which is convenient 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.690
 let leave this also because me 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:32.060
 down a bit because later when it's from 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.770

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.770
