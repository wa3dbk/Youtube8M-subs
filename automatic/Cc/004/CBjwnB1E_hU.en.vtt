00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 together and welcome back to here 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.750
 song community with the takes the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.670
 next murder imaginations and that with 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.730
 the akw fm 700 ha in the v 1.0 of the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.460
 or pata so yes as said the good one 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.310
 Device is fictitious as it is here now 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.650
 but there are not 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 function as well as the style of the device 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.680
 In any case, I have to be perfect 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.269
 say 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.930
 and that's why I put the courage too 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.179
 here today 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 yes, important facts are through the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.750
 Transportation of rubbish were upwards 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.730
 the lot became the particles 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.649
 Systems changed the required performance 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 this is at 300 ps 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.379
 the more the better 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.910
 not enough power for driving 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.050
 soja what also stands the mouse 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.700
 controls have changed to one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.440
 important feature not to be overlooked 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.100
 Left mouse button moves the big flap 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.199
 and the two mouse buttons together 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.930
 small flap yes as I said to be 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.020
 Of course we also give them 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.460
 and we're going to watch it all 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.070
 go right now 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 we have here as the shop picture 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.700
 the aws it costs 42 1400 euro the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.680
 Maintenance costs amount to 50 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.979
 euro per day are the required performance 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.890
 221 kw or 300 ps with one 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.869
 Working width of 23 meters in the info 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.299
 stands with this forestry 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.700
 building materials effectively and quickly too 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.259
 Wood chips are not processed 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.780
 I lied in the whole thing 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.420
 apron we will buy us naturally 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.689
 now in murcia and become one 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.590
 powerful tractor use like 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.640
 I already stood there 300 ps or more 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.030
 I would say we go immediately 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.020
 Here already in the luxury class and pick 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.250
 the home with 435 hp buy him and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.190
 then get in there as well 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.260
 so 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.820
 we join the good part I already have 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.420
 a little something prepared there where 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:08.119
 at least with the wing is 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.160
 even a tree stump that should 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.280
 Of course, in reality, it does not happen 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.350
 logically , the good part is taking part 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.570
 As I said, one sees texture 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.070
 impeccable and the functions are also 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.870
 once free as I said the small flap 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.970
 with both mouse buttons you see the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.660
 moves and with the left mouse button 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.040
 the big flap and then we catch 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.550
 backwards almost to the tree stump 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.070
 turn on and drive out the pipe 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.840
 Of course you can see how it fixes itself 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.300
 It's automatic 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:48.710
 differently to the fil plain not so and then 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:52.220
 let's turn this good device on and on 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.470
 drive the device down and drive 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.880
 backwards to stump and already see how 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.180
 Well, of course that is not the right one now 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.020
 But perfect on earth is meant for that 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.030
 you can see it works anyway 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.220
 or you should on each 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.050
 fall a smaller or 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.709
 take a trailer a bit 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.709
 sits lower 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.940
 Let's go a bit higher 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:28.510
 now , of course , this fills up 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:31.210
 also in here and I think the fulfilled 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.610
 so what of its purpose is worth it 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.270
 definitely so now we can, of course 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.350
 that everything go a bit deeper 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.200
 which of course he is the complete one 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.200
 tree stump with eats away logically 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:56.109
 Villa was probably not on it we still one 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.109
 drive a little deeper looked wonderful 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.870
 so functionally said this 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.019
 matches in any case more than 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.689
 impressive and serves on every case 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.879
 for the purposes of the mod is definitely 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.909
 worth a recommendation and I will 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.680
 definitely a link in the description 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.060
 pack 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.859
 The whole thing is synonymous with me in the yard 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.400
 stand as I said so that works 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.820
 perfect 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.840
 the idea is totally great I implemented 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.750
 would claim 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.090
 thumbs up for the modder and everyone 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.710
 also a thumbs up for me 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.240
 But one more time I would go over 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.320
 both friend we see each other in the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.240
 next place presentations or 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.240
 other videos until then
