00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.600
 hi to all the guys here pop back there 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.610
 where today I am here on minecraft for 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.500
 show you how to create targets on 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.430
 floor 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.680
 okay this is a very big one 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.830
 sweetheart this target refers 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.320
 to a mob trap that this is 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.240
 the most widely known trap is the best known 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.820
 even the easiest to build is true 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.250
 takes a long time but essentially 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.350
 creates them with any material of 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.629
 usually kobe that maybe not sand 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.120
 water and collections are put two 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.159
 torches here that are then hidden for 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.500
 avoid ice formation where 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.530
 I'll show you how and now let's go 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.409
 the more I show you how to create it 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.400
 this is a skill 30 blocks more or 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:58.670
 minus this because 3 the block let's say 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.440
 that are enough to kill 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.930
 any kind of monster that also falls 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.089
 they fall two one behind the other and 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.810
 the second one also comes down to die 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.760
 it doesn't stay alive like it does sometimes now 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.350
 thank goodness it rains we start a 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.600
 build a 4x4 square 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.730
 then around maybe you don't come xvi why 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.910
 then I could even get angry 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:31.370
 from here we take these blocks e 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:34.630
 we extend to nine 1234567 port and 9 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:40.070
 let's try two of the last block 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:46.520
 mannato we create a wall that reaches up 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:50.570
 at 100 here is just like this 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.250
 central misunderstanding let's say now we do 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.310
 the same thing also from this other 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.310
 part 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.790
 so many I have seen on many sites that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.650
 they create the trap by doing this 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.020
 high corridor only block 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.170
 I am totally opposed because a 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.910
 nobel could also jump and save himself 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.950
 I prefer instead that you want then 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.050
 I deserve this problem when it's two hours 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.760
 I repeat the operation put him the others 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.770
 three sides is identical to this 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.489
 of course and see you soon after 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.380
 done and here is how the trap after 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.510
 having completed that operation 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.400
 Now let's go and build the floor 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.420
 of the trap which is very boring but 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.940
 fundamental in fact this is a point 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.920
 where the mobs will spur then we say 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:48.819
 fall and then commit suicide myself 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.519
 of course I only do one side then 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.830
 Stop repeating the operations on 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.180
 three others, of course, is a lot 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:06.940
 simple to do so i guess not 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:08.920
 need explanations and here it is now 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.900
 let's repeat an operation too 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.390
 on these three sides and see you later and 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.200
 or the echo here the trap 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.120
 now once made this operation 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.609
 let's take a corner and get up one 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:30.220
 two three and four squares and let's begin 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.890
 to build the number of cyan walls 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:38.230
 very much this too very boring though 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:40.209
 fundamental I make a side that does not 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.760
 you understand i only do one side e 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.959
 paste stop 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.940
 once this operation is done one 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.560
 trap and complete lowering 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.560
 of water and here we are 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.140
 I say because four blocks well 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:02.000
 four blocks because therefore two are 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.150
 for the module neglecting lines 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.210
 undermine of the buoy that so many do not 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.510
 they are suited to this trap 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:13.880
 one we keep it for the trends because there 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.360
 live darts stick to the ceiling 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.430
 so let's say let's say I consider the 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.320
 block or bob ie we put one from the first 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.090
 was attacked and a bit to do the 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:29.210
 planet so we say it maximizes 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:34.400
 mamola spawn capacity of various gods 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:38.270
 show you perfect head 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.870
 now we put so much water what 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.760
 done 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.600
 here aparo told him just why 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.570
 way tac and you're there 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.200
 as you can see it is impossible to exit the way 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.200
 will make good confidence 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:06.970
 and here it is now we see little has 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:09.729
 built the flight welcome back 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.520
 as you can see I took the opportunity to do the 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.199
 wall on all four sides and also 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.139
 the ceiling that is nice for him 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:20.639
 called floor but small details 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.020
 linked to the emotions of the first tutorial 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.070
 as you see inside I added also 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.229
 these little things 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.260
 what they are to avoid the formation of 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:31.720
 ice all this modification is not 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.060
 obligatory indeed I advise against it a 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.780
 unless you see that you are 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.570
 form the ice, but avoid it 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.660
 I show how it's done so just put 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:47.440
 two torches just above the water then yes 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.539
 creates a low wall all around two above 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.720
 but you still see the torches 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.110
 illuminated so you have to close also 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.570
 as you see 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:02.010
 and oh well on the peaceful ways then 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:05.650
 anyway and we will see though if we change e 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:11.560
 the creative mode gives us a hand 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:13.440
 we do so the mobs will start at 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.169
 fall mysteriously 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.169
 however first victim 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:23.110
 as you can see it is impossible to go up if 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:28.650
 there was only one block would be 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.650
 already vice saved is the same 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:34.570
 raining mobs with complete traps i will 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.169
 so I recommend making a small wall 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:42.449
 I don't know what kind of boundary too 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.449
 a small 4x2 can 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.770
 the video ends here I hope to be 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.300
 been useful for just about anything 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.820
 leave a comment 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.620
 if there are any misunderstandings the invitation 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.480
 to the charlot indeed I am happy to give 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.800
 explanations and if the video a good one 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.170
 feedback or a good one 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.850
 I hope to display them 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:08.170
 hurt many others easily various ideas 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.770
 for now, I invite you to leave a pleasure 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.770
 Hello
