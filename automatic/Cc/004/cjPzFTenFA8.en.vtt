00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
you're doing pretty good that way I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.180 
you're doing pretty good that way I
think<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:47.989> just<00:00:48.020> use<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.500> herbs<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.890> get<00:00:49.040> in

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
think you just use the herbs to get in

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.530 
think you just use the herbs to get in
there<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:49.489> work<00:00:49.640> with<00:00:49.670> these<00:00:50.000> kidneys<00:00:50.390> and

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
there and work with these kidneys and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.420 
there and work with these kidneys and
everything<00:00:50.989> because<00:00:51.350> when<00:00:51.950> you're<00:00:52.130> working

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
everything because when you're working

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.819 
everything because when you're working
with<00:00:52.460> animals<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.690> even<00:00:53.899> with<00:00:54.170> humans<00:00:54.559> those

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
with animals and even with humans those

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.979 
with animals and even with humans those
herbs<00:00:55.190> are<00:00:55.340> specific<00:00:55.969> for<00:00:56.149> those<00:00:56.239> tissues<00:00:56.809> I

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
herbs are specific for those tissues I

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.840 
herbs are specific for those tissues I
think<00:00:57.500> when<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:57.739> look<00:00:57.920> at<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.160> food<00:00:58.340> sources

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
think when you look at the food sources

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.549 
think when you look at the food sources
today<00:00:59.000> at<00:00:59.270> best<00:00:59.480> we<00:00:59.630> can<00:00:59.660> say<00:00:59.989> they<00:01:00.140> hold<00:01:00.350> some

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
today at best we can say they hold some

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.709 
today at best we can say they hold some
energy<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.070> nutrition<00:01:01.670> but<00:01:02.270> aren't<00:01:02.570> powerful

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
energy and nutrition but aren't powerful

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.630 
energy and nutrition but aren't powerful
enough<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.200> go<00:01:03.410> specifically<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.129> various

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
enough to go specifically to various

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.179 
enough to go specifically to various
tissues<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.239> really<00:01:05.509> expect<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.079> response<00:01:06.229> or

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
tissues and really expect a response or

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.699 
tissues and really expect a response or
effective<00:01:07.639> response<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:08.329> I<00:01:08.569> think<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.560> you'd

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:09.709 
effective response so I think that you'd

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:11.139 
effective response so I think that you'd
be<00:01:09.740> smarter<00:01:10.189> going<00:01:10.369> down<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.670> herb<00:01:10.819> way<00:01:11.090> to

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
be smarter going down the herb way to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.160 
be smarter going down the herb way to
New<00:01:11.659> Zealand<00:01:12.100> give<00:01:13.100> my<00:01:13.369> buddy<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.909> high<00:01:14.719> shot

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
New Zealand give my buddy a high shot

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.580 
New Zealand give my buddy a high shot
out<00:01:15.409> over<00:01:15.679> there<00:01:15.859> I<00:01:16.780> need<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.810> gotta<00:01:18.079> go<00:01:18.350> but<00:01:18.529> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.169 
out over there I need a gotta go but I
thought<00:01:18.770> this<00:01:18.950> was<00:01:19.159> an<00:01:19.279> internal<00:01:19.729> noise<00:01:19.909> which

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:20.179 
thought this was an internal noise which

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.639 
thought this was an internal noise which
is<00:01:20.209> worse<00:01:20.539> for<00:01:20.749> the<00:01:20.840> body<00:01:21.079> did<00:01:21.289> you<00:01:21.350> get<00:01:21.529> this
