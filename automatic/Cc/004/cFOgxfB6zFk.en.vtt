00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
just kind of dry brush the top and when

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.300 
just kind of dry brush the top and when
I<00:03:06.900> say<00:03:07.110> dry<00:03:07.440> brushes<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.950> want<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.160> make<00:03:08.280> sure

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
I say dry brushes I want to make sure

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.370 
I say dry brushes I want to make sure
that<00:03:08.610> there's<00:03:08.790> barely<00:03:09.150> any<00:03:09.480> material<00:03:10.020> on<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
that there's barely any material on the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.370 
that there's barely any material on the
brush<00:03:10.620> itself<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.850> when<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.120> dip<00:03:12.480> your<00:03:12.510> brush

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
brush itself so when you dip your brush

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.230 
brush itself so when you dip your brush
into<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.890> foundation<00:03:14.490> you're<00:03:14.970> going<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.150> want

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
into the foundation you're going to want

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.370 
into the foundation you're going to want
to<00:03:15.360> take<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.780> back<00:03:15.900> your<00:03:16.080> hand<00:03:16.230> and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
to take it to the back your hand and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.650 
to take it to the back your hand and
almost<00:03:16.650> get<00:03:16.830> all<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.100> material<00:03:17.520> off<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.150> so

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
almost get all the material off of it so

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.900 
almost get all the material off of it so
there's<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.140> very<00:03:19.500> very<00:03:19.830> light<00:03:20.340> material

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
there's just a very very light material

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.340 
there's just a very very light material
and<00:03:21.090> you're<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:21.660> going<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.840> brush<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.170> over

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
and you're just going to brush it over

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.650 
and you're just going to brush it over
the<00:03:22.530> top<00:03:22.770> which<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.760> creating<00:03:24.210> a<00:03:24.270> highlight

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
the top which is creating a highlight

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.290 
the top which is creating a highlight
which<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> really<00:03:25.860> cool<00:03:26.130> trick<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:30.120> there's

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
which is a really cool trick so there's

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.970 
which is a really cool trick so there's
the<00:03:30.510> highlight<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.500> now<00:03:31.620> what<00:03:31.740> you're<00:03:31.860> going

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
the highlight so now what you're going

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.860 
the highlight so now what you're going
to<00:03:32.070> do<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.310> kind<00:03:32.610> of<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.760> same<00:03:32.910> technique<00:03:33.390> but

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
to do is kind of the same technique but

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.500 
to do is kind of the same technique but
you're<00:03:34.020> going<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.200> do<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:34.380> wash<00:03:34.710> of<00:03:34.950> color

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
you're going to do a wash of color

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.380 
you're going to do a wash of color
underneath<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:38.250> scar<00:03:38.550> itself<00:03:38.970> just<00:03:39.270> to

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
underneath the scar itself just to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.350 
underneath the scar itself just to
create<00:03:39.540> some<00:03:39.780> age<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.550> with<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> brush

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
create some age so just with the brush

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
create some age so just with the brush
with<00:03:42.630> just<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.110> little<00:03:43.470> bit<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.680> material<00:03:44.010> on<00:03:44.310> it

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
with just a little bit of material on it

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.430 
with just a little bit of material on it
you're<00:03:46.380> gonna<00:03:46.700> shade<00:03:47.700> underneath<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:49.170> scar

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
you're gonna shade underneath the scar

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.200 
you're gonna shade underneath the scar
itself<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.130> just<00:03:50.310> use<00:03:50.460> your<00:03:50.610> finger<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:50.940> to

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
itself and just use your finger just to

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.610 
itself and just use your finger just to
blend<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.600> out<00:03:51.720> doesn't<00:03:52.170> have<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.350> be<00:03:52.440> super

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
blend it out doesn't have to be super

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.140 
blend it out doesn't have to be super
fancy<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.550> should<00:03:53.760> be<00:03:53.880> fun<00:03:55.340> just<00:03:56.340> add<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
fancy it should be fun just add the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.560 
fancy it should be fun just add the
material<00:03:57.600> in

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.480 

and<00:04:01.570> now<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.710> I'm<00:04:02.800> looking<00:04:02.830> at<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.460> looks

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
and now that I'm looking at it it looks

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.070 
and now that I'm looking at it it looks
like<00:04:03.760> it<00:04:03.880> needs<00:04:03.910> just<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.360> little<00:04:04.390> more<00:04:04.690> on<00:04:04.840> top

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
like it needs just a little more on top

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.750 
like it needs just a little more on top
so<00:04:05.410> what<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.710> were<00:04:05.800> going<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:05.950> want<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.310> do<00:04:06.490> is

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
so what you were going to want to do is

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.280 
so what you were going to want to do is

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
you're never going to draw a straight

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.840 
you're never going to draw a straight
line<00:04:08.320> of<00:04:08.680> anything<00:04:09.160> you're<00:04:09.310> gonna<00:04:09.460> want<00:04:09.730> to
