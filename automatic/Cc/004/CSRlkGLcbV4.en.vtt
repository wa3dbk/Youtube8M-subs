00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
just socially unacceptable to have real

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.319 
just socially unacceptable to have real
far<00:01:53.189> these<00:01:53.369> days<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.970> know<00:01:54.200> but<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.880> just

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
far these days you know but then it just

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.350 
far these days you know but then it just
doesn't<00:01:57.719> make<00:01:57.810> any<00:01:57.869> sense<00:01:58.229> really<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.360> I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
doesn't make any sense really and I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.840 
doesn't make any sense really and I
think<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.659> reason<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.380> because<00:02:01.850> far

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
think the reason is just because far

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.100 
think the reason is just because far
comes<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.479> fluffy<00:02:03.899> cute<00:02:04.560> animals<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.520> know
