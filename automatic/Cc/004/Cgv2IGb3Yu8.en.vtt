course and also like we said from last
year<00:02:14.160> we've<00:02:14.280> got<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:14.970> we're

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
year we've got to do this but we're

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.780 
year we've got to do this but we're
going<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.330> do<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.510> guess<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.380> weight<00:02:16.410> video<00:02:16.860> we

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
going to do a guess the weight video we

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.220 
going to do a guess the weight video we
did<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.060> some<00:02:18.120> new<00:02:18.390> scales<00:02:18.750> or<00:02:18.900> show<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.080> off

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
did get some new scales or show you off

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.370 
did get some new scales or show you off
in<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.440> next<00:02:19.560> video<00:02:19.920> also<00:02:20.160> um<00:02:20.670> but<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:22.170> you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
in the next video also um but just you

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.809 
in the next video also um but just you
know<00:02:22.470> you'll<00:02:22.680> guess<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> exact<00:02:23.370> weight<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.730> a

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
know you'll guess the exact weight of a

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.750 
know you'll guess the exact weight of a
certain<00:02:24.090> fish<00:02:24.330> yeah<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.020> real<00:02:25.290> scale<00:02:25.760> and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
certain fish yeah we have real scale and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.220 
certain fish yeah we have real scale and
then<00:02:26.880> also<00:02:27.060> probably<00:02:27.480> guess<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.660> measurement

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
then also probably guess the measurement

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.510 
then also probably guess the measurement
you<00:02:28.290> know<00:02:28.410> maybe<00:02:28.590> we'll<00:02:28.920> have<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.160> for<00:02:29.220> two

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
you know maybe we'll have that for two

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.100 
you know maybe we'll have that for two
separate<00:02:29.850> winters<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.720> all<00:02:30.989> right

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
separate winters not like that all right

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.930 
separate winters not like that all right
