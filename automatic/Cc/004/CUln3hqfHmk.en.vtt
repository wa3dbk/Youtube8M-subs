00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
here we have our conus is the very first

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.230 
here we have our conus is the very first
thing<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.180> made<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.869> entire<00:00:22.470> thing<00:00:23.240> just

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
thing we made of the entire thing just

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.980 
thing we made of the entire thing just
kind<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.570> put<00:00:24.750> together<00:00:25.050> by<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.529> um<00:00:26.960> by<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
kind of put together by this um by a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.740 
kind of put together by this um by a
kind<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.099> stick<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.820> along<00:00:30.179> here<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
kind of a stick going on along here and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.770 
kind of a stick going on along here and
then<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.960> glue<00:00:31.230> held<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.340> when<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.300> glued<00:00:33.600> it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
then we glue held it up when I glued it

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.069 
then we glue held it up when I glued it
and<00:00:34.050> then<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.440> painted<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> there's<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and then we painted it so there's the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.540 
and then we painted it so there's the
horn<00:00:41.120> housing<00:00:42.320> well<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.620> would<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
horn housing well what would be the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
horn housing well what would be the
chopper<00:00:44.969> housing<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.750> couldn't<00:00:49.170> use<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
chopper housing this we couldn't use a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.170 
chopper housing this we couldn't use a
real<00:00:49.620> chopper<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.789> like

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
real chopper because we don't have like

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.100 
real chopper because we don't have like
the<00:00:51.390> technology<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.350> or<00:00:52.770> anything<00:00:52.980> so

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
the technology to do that or anything so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.510 
the technology to do that or anything so
we<00:00:55.110> use<00:00:55.739> something<00:00:56.070> that's<00:00:56.510> like<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.520> and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
we use something that's like it and and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.599 
we use something that's like it and and
this<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.940> velcroed<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.170> take<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.039> off<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
this is velcroed on so take it off and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.910 
this is velcroed on so take it off and
the<00:01:02.730> reason<00:01:03.059> why<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.710> tape

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the reason why because that's a tape

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.120 
the reason why because that's a tape
recorder<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.720> recorded<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.530> off<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
recorder and I recorded on off the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.260 
recorder and I recorded on off the
speaker<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:14.070> recordings<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.119> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
speaker to to to recordings as like of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.670 
speaker to to to recordings as like of
the<00:01:15.869> thunderbolt<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:18.360> 1000<00:01:18.990> t

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the thunderbolt and the 1000 t

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.610 
the thunderbolt and the 1000 t
this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:21.060> thousand<00:01:21.510> two<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
this is a one thousand two and it

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.810 
this is a one thousand two and it
doesn't<00:01:22.980> have<00:01:23.040> any<00:01:23.280> solenoids<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.960> long

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
doesn't have any solenoids so long

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.400 
doesn't have any solenoids so long
that's<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.000> yep<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> attack<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.110> work

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
that's a yep the attack in the work

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.950 
that's a yep the attack in the work
cycle<00:01:30.380> now<00:01:31.380> about<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.250> rotator<00:01:32.940> let's<00:01:33.750> put

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
cycle now about the rotator let's put

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.200 
cycle now about the rotator let's put
that<00:01:34.110> back<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:35.370> a<00:01:35.400> little<00:01:35.610> screw<00:01:36.000> back

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that back on have a little screw back

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.270 
that back on have a little screw back
here<00:01:36.479> does<00:01:36.690> it<00:01:36.840> hold<00:01:37.080> it<00:01:38.720> all<00:01:39.720> right<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.830> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
here does it hold it all right now the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.930 
here does it hold it all right now the
rotator<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.380> can<00:01:43.380> turn<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.860> right<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.130> but

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
rotator I can turn it on right now but

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.700 
rotator I can turn it on right now but
hold<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.800> right<00:01:46.800> up<00:01:47.420> no<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:49.590> screwed<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.990> um<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
hold on right up no to screwed in um I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.530 
hold on right up no to screwed in um I
don't<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.550> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> big

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540

don't know if you can see it but the big
black<00:01:54.840> junk<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:56.119> we're<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.810> right<00:01:58.020> here

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
black junk like we're like right here

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.370 
black junk like we're like right here
it's<00:01:58.950> part<00:01:59.220> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> motor<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.899> shaft<00:02:01.200> of

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it's part of the motor and the shaft of

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.990 
it's part of the motor and the shaft of
the<00:02:01.440> motor<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:02.460> welded<00:02:03.979> my<00:02:04.979> dad<00:02:05.160> has<00:02:05.340> knows<00:02:05.970> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the motor was welded my dad has knows a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.190 
the motor was welded my dad has knows a
friend<00:02:06.270> who<00:02:06.840> works<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.009> company<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:09.200> he

friend who works for a company and he

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.990 
friend who works for a company and he
welded<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.880> bull<00:02:12.180> which<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.970> is

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
welded it on to a bull which so this is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.199 
welded it on to a bull which so this is
like<00:02:15.320> kind<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.650> shaft<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.520> then<00:02:18.090> when

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
like kind of on the shaft and then when

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.390 
like kind of on the shaft and then when
the<00:02:18.300> shaft<00:02:18.540> turns<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:19.020> turns<00:02:19.260> with<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.620> but

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
the shaft turns it turns with it but

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.270 
the shaft turns it turns with it but
it's<00:02:20.489> really<00:02:20.970> fast<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:22.200> used<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.560> be<00:02:22.709> like<00:02:22.860> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it's really fast this used to be like to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.050 
it's really fast this used to be like to
rpm

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.790 

but<00:02:27.660> now<00:02:27.989> it's<00:02:28.290> like<00:02:28.940> 10<00:02:29.940> 12<00:02:30.569> RPM<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.680> not

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
but now it's like 10 12 RPM it's not

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.770 
but now it's like 10 12 RPM it's not
even<00:02:31.950> possible<00:02:32.310> with<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.970> real<00:02:33.150> fun<00:02:33.450> durable

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
even possible with the real fun durable

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.150 
even possible with the real fun durable
but<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:35.700> now<00:02:36.349> here's<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.590> switch<00:02:37.890> for<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
but it is now here's the switch for the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.370 
but it is now here's the switch for the
rotator<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.510> don't<00:02:39.660> want<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.110> build<00:02:40.260> a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
rotator and I don't want to build a
