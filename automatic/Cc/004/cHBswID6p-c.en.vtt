00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 
so we wanted some not really Malcolm

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.670 
so we wanted some not really Malcolm
wise<00:03:40.209> in<00:03:40.449> there<00:03:40.629> it<00:03:40.810> looks<00:03:41.079> like<00:03:41.379> they've<00:03:41.530> got

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
wise in there it looks like they've got

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.220 
wise in there it looks like they've got
quite<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.040> few<00:03:42.400> managers<00:03:42.669> so<00:03:43.599> Malcolm<00:03:43.810> acquires

quite a few managers so Malcolm acquires
the<00:03:44.519> Cardiff<00:03:45.519> manager<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:45.879> think<00:03:46.139> so<00:03:47.280> that's

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
the Cardiff manager I think so that's

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.129 
the Cardiff manager I think so that's
good<00:03:48.489> as<00:03:48.639> well<00:03:48.669> I<00:03:48.849> quite<00:03:49.389> like<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.569> meanness<00:03:49.870> all
