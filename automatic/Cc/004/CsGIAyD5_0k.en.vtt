00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.658
 Nowadays, everyone understands the importance of exercise 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.237
 And proper nutrition for our health 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.231
 Still, I know that it is not simple to maintain and maintain a healthy lifestyle 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.646
 With all the temptations and distractions around 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.246
 In this video dietician Rona Sheffer 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.197
 Give us some basic tools and rules 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.076
 To help us start and implement the principles of a healthy lifestyle 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.748
 In a simple and immediate manner 

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:30.859
 The first rule we should adopt 

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:33.414
 When we want to make a change in our eating habits 

00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:35.085
 Is to eat every three hours 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.732
 It is important to understand that a person is hungry 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.962
 Can not manage his eating behavior 

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:41.587
 But hunger runs it 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.559
 Only a seven person can manage his eating behavior 

00:00:45.302 --> 00:00:46.788
 Now, to eat every three hours 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.457
 We must be planned and lose some of our spontaneity 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.593
 And planning should start with the supermarket 

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:55.844
 We need to take care of all the nutrients, all raw materials 

00:00:56.308 --> 00:00:57.237
 We will be at home 

00:00:57.655 --> 00:01:00.163
 And when we go to work or a day trip, take with us 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.646
 All the nutrients we want to eat that day 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.547
 There's nothing to do, just start planning our day of eating 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.658
 One can always take with us a prepared sandwich wrapped in a bag 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.144
 Or some vegetables in a box 

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:14.791
 The main thing is not to stay hungry for long 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.206
 And then attack large doses of non-nutritious food 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.343
 Next time when you shop at the supermarket 

00:01:19.853 --> 00:01:22.593
 Remember, this is the moment to choose the most nutritious and healthy things 

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:24.683
 Less snacks, more fruits 

00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:29.513
 Be sure to bring in fruit and vegetables from five different colors 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.132
 Each color, each pigment, has a different mechanism in which it provides protection to the human body 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.011
 When we consume from five different colors 

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:42.560
 We actually allow maximum protection to our body from oxidants 

00:01:43.213 --> 00:01:44.700
 So the color is not just on the plate 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.950
 It actually also provides us maximum protection for the human body 

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:49.480
 And so an important tip 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.550
 Eat five different colors of fruits and vegetables 

00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:55.610
