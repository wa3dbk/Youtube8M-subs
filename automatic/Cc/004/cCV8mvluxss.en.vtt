00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.540
 so in this exercise we are asked 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.370
 of trains these three points the lg no 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.679
 aligned ben it's like for exercise 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.660
 previous when you place a point 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.969
 you put it in there and then we 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.760
 let's start from two precisely I take here 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.560
 you had here she is too beautiful 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.779
 sister who are not aligned I put 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.990
 here the high point first thing we 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.710
 ask us to trace we recognize here 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.869
 hook to say that there is a 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.590
 beginning here seems to zinc has a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.660
 end we notice that it is a segment ef 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.140
 so sealing ef that we're going 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.629
 trace speaking will do it in blue so 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.649
 the segment is therefore the first 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.800
 ends and e 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.260
 and then the second icf explosion so 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 here the silly gaggle gold to be 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.170
 enough such as what attention do not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.390
 extend 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.760
 okay there is still a beginning and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.340
 an end for the happy segment then 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.650
 we hung two friends parentheses there 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.970
 there is a beginning and you have no 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.510
 end is good had 2000 right the 2nd 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.930
 right of origin f and that goes through the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.110
 point g so this one I trace earthquake 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.740
 to do so we do not deny we use 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.020
 always the rule is to pass this kind 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.689
 two girls of just drawing so 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.579
 here it starts in f 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.729
 and then it goes on to walk that one 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.189
 beginning but it goes through g if you 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.090
 stop here for example again be careful 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.810
 not especially prolonged by the shore 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.299
 beginning in f 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.220
 and this year page there you have 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.479
 plot your 2000 right and i finally have 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.950
 one recognizes parenthesis well 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.070
 parenthesis it's a right one 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.530
 okay the right e g it's right there 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.899
 will pass the points e and g this one I 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.670
 let's put it in red 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.119
 in this case you can place your 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.060
 rule level of these two points of agreement 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.229
 the coutras view and here we extend a 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.729
 little bit and then there too at the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.269
 border show that it's your right 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.530
 who goes through the two points a bit and 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:20.180
 now they will be red 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:26.319
 we did the right in blue the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.319
 bleeding and then towards the 2009
