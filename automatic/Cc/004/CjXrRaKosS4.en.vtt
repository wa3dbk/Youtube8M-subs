the video now but um last time we left
off<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:30.029> were<00:00:30.060> around<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:31.109> with<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
off we were around here with the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.280 
off we were around here with the
aspirational<00:00:32.009> buildings<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.290> escalator

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
