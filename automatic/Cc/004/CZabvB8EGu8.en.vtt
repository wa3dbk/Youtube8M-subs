00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
undeclared and just kind of thought I'd

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.429

eventually declaring a biology major and

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.760 
eventually declaring a biology major and
it<00:00:24.009> was<00:00:24.190> definitely<00:00:24.430> influences<00:00:25.240> of<00:00:25.770> friends

shadowing<00:00:31.359> down<00:00:31.660> at<00:00:31.810> Creighton<00:00:32.080> University

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
shadowing down at Creighton University

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.369 
shadowing down at Creighton University
in<00:00:32.680> undergrad<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:34.600> decided<00:00:35.050> that<00:00:35.080> would<00:00:35.260> be<00:00:35.350> a

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
in undergrad and decided that would be a

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.229 
in undergrad and decided that would be a
good<00:00:35.559> fit<00:00:35.769> for<00:00:35.830> what<00:00:36.190> I<00:00:36.220> was<00:00:36.489> looking<00:00:36.610> for<00:00:36.850> as

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
good fit for what I was looking for as

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:44.869 
good fit for what I was looking for as
far<00:00:37.300> as<00:00:37.629> a<00:00:37.660> career<00:00:38.080> and<00:00:38.230> also<00:00:38.559> my<00:00:38.769> my<00:00:39.430> interest

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.979 

family<00:00:45.879> medicine<00:00:46.059> is<00:00:46.420> such<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.629> great

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
family medicine is such a great

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.020 
family medicine is such a great
specialty<00:00:47.769> I<00:00:47.799> think<00:00:48.159> a<00:00:48.250> lot<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.460> us<00:00:48.699> end<00:00:48.909> up

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
specialty I think a lot of us end up

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.210 
specialty I think a lot of us end up
going<00:00:49.360> into<00:00:49.449> family<00:00:49.900> medicine<00:00:50.170> because<00:00:50.530> we're

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
going into family medicine because we're

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.579 
going into family medicine because we're
drawn<00:00:51.519> to<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.729> lot<00:00:51.940> of<00:00:52.059> different<00:00:52.420> things<00:00:52.589> and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
drawn to a lot of different things and

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.200 
drawn to a lot of different things and
eventually<00:00:54.100> decide<00:00:54.430> that<00:00:54.640> family<00:00:54.940> medicine

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
eventually decide that family medicine

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.049 
eventually decide that family medicine
is<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.479> good<00:00:55.690> fit<00:00:55.900> for<00:00:55.930> us<00:00:56.140> because<00:00:56.440> we<00:00:56.799> can

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
is a good fit for us because we can

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.850 
is a good fit for us because we can
practice<00:00:58.059> all<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.989> our<00:00:59.110> different<00:00:59.229> interests

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
practice all of our different interests

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.920 
practice all of our different interests
without<00:00:59.949> really<00:01:00.430> limiting<00:01:00.879> ourselves<00:01:01.030> we<00:01:01.720> can

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
without really limiting ourselves we can

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.930 
without really limiting ourselves we can
go<00:01:02.049> into<00:01:02.290> a<00:01:02.320> lot<00:01:02.619> of<00:01:02.650> different<00:01:03.309> fields<00:01:03.610> as

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
go into a lot of different fields as

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.000 
go into a lot of different fields as
clinic<00:01:04.420> family<00:01:04.780> medicine<00:01:05.110> whether<00:01:05.680> it<00:01:05.890> be

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
clinic family medicine whether it be

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.590 
clinic family medicine whether it be
urgent<00:01:06.430> care<00:01:06.640> or<00:01:06.670> lots<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.299> different

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
urgent care or lots of different

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.789 
urgent care or lots of different
possibilities<00:01:08.110> but<00:01:08.229> it<00:01:08.350> gives<00:01:08.470> us<00:01:08.650> the

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
possibilities but it gives us the

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.130 
possibilities but it gives us the
training<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.729> have<00:01:09.880> really<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.210> broad<00:01:10.479> spectrum

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
training to have really a broad spectrum

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.910 
training to have really a broad spectrum
of<00:01:11.200> possibilities<00:01:11.350> as<00:01:12.010> far<00:01:12.219> as<00:01:12.340> our<00:01:12.460> jobs

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.149

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
really is it really makes our practice

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.279 
really is it really makes our practice
so<00:01:34.320> much<00:01:34.560> more<00:01:34.860> fulfilling<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.170> add

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
so much more fulfilling and we can add

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.679 
so much more fulfilling and we can add
so<00:01:37.440> much<00:01:37.560> more<00:01:37.710> insight<00:01:38.190> to<00:01:38.399> it<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.450> do

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
so much more insight to it because we do

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.870 
so much more insight to it because we do
see<00:01:39.930> multiple<00:01:40.590> generations<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
see multiple generations we know the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
see multiple generations we know the
dynamics<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> what's<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.229> not<00:01:43.500> just
