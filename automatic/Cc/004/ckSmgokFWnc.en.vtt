00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:16.130
 1:30 am 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:20.010
 1h20 repressive here and we stroll 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.640
 shirtless in a village in the countryside 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.470
 so the only one to prove that they are worth 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:32.160
 these beautiful or the night 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:34.050
 wow it's cold already I wanted to go 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.649
 apologize for the number of videos are 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.180
 also lately because 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.450
 medical problems that's it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.719
 easily his request what am I 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.890
 in the comments it is to deprive 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:57.629
 the voice happy new year merry christmas 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.079
 function that brought subscribers up 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.649
 you have a good end of the world 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.670
 it's too easy 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.530
 the blood is not excessively good no 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.560
 not that these strong signals it's for not 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.000
 not wake everyone up yours 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.700
 my opinion there are very few people who 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.700
 are gone these hours there 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:30.910
 so that's fine, I think 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:33.910
 why no one would be right 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:46.960
 for your information it's less -5 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:54.910
 degrees we appreciate so I was already 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:59.890
 in front of an air marshal judge that's very 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:07.720
 loudly we do not make any challenges to 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:10.600

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.430

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:21.480

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.480

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.870

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.690

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.600
 will have virtually no cut scene 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.110
