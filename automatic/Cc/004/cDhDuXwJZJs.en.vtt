punjah geese in Madagascar incest as
Klaus<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> aga<00:00:46.920> would<00:00:47.190> say<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
Klaus from the aga would say this is a

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.410 
Klaus from the aga would say this is a
great<00:00:49.530> plant<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.399> plant<00:00:50.460> requires<00:00:50.940> high

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
great plant this plant requires high

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.439 
great plant this plant requires high
light<00:00:51.690> good<00:00:52.020> substrate<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
light good substrate and is not a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.180 
light good substrate and is not a
beginner<00:00:54.840> plant<00:00:55.079> I'll<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.770> say<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.070> it's

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
beginner plant I'll just say that it's

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.080 
beginner plant I'll just say that it's
not<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> beginner<00:00:56.820> plant<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:58.550> really<00:00:59.550> cool<00:00:59.760> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
not a beginner plant but really cool it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
not a beginner plant but really cool it
does<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.780> well<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.649> size<00:01:01.920> substrate

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
does really well in this size substrate

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
does really well in this size substrate
if<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:03.989> small<00:01:04.229> substrate<00:01:04.650> obviously

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
if you can get small substrate obviously

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.410 
if you can get small substrate obviously
I've<00:01:05.430> never<00:01:05.460> even<00:01:05.820> I've<00:01:06.090> never<00:01:06.299> even

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
I've never even I've never even

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
I've never even I've never even
attempted<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.080> keep<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.439> without<00:01:07.530> dirt<00:01:07.920> nor

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
attempted to keep it without dirt nor

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.910 
attempted to keep it without dirt nor
what<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> recommend<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.360> because<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
what I recommend that you do because it

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.460 
what I recommend that you do because it
needs<00:01:11.250> good<00:01:11.490> nutrients<00:01:12.290> comes<00:01:13.290> from

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
needs good nutrients comes from

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.380 
needs good nutrients comes from
nutrient-rich<00:01:13.950> waters<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.850> actually

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
nutrient-rich waters and it's actually

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.190 
nutrient-rich waters and it's actually
from<00:01:16.340> fast-moving<00:01:17.340> streams<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.540> comes<00:01:18.840> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
from fast-moving streams it comes in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.570 
from fast-moving streams it comes in
really<00:01:19.500> fast<00:01:19.770> moving<00:01:20.100> streams<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
really fast moving streams and the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.510 
really fast moving streams and the
reason<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.890> if<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.040> blows<00:01:23.220> in

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
reason for that is this if it blows in

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.520 
reason for that is this if it blows in
the<00:01:23.549> wind<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:24.090> whatever

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
the wind or whatever

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.420 
the wind or whatever
like<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.830> fast-moving<00:01:26.670> stream<00:01:27.240> will<00:01:28.250> hold<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
like the fast-moving stream will hold it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.130 
like the fast-moving stream will hold it
because<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> fast-moving<00:01:30.030> stream<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:31.020> go

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
because the fast-moving stream can go

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.600 
because the fast-moving stream can go
through<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> holes<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.250> plant<00:01:32.460> won't

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
through the holes and the plant won't

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.310 
through the holes and the plant won't
get<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.939> beat<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.079> see<00:01:34.200> I'm

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
get like beat up so if you can see I'm

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
get like beat up so if you can see I'm
like<00:01:34.500> messing<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:36.030> doesn't

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
like messing with it but it's it doesn't

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.940 
like messing with it but it's it doesn't
really<00:01:36.420> respond<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:37.860> got

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
really respond to that because it's got

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.300 
really respond to that because it's got
holes<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.460> great<00:01:39.240> plant<00:01:39.630> um<00:01:40.100> got<00:01:41.100> another

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
holes in it great plant um got another

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.520 
holes in it great plant um got another
one<00:01:41.490> over<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.810> good<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:43.049> ain't<00:01:43.229> good<00:01:43.500> for

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
one over here good for ain't good for

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.069 
one over here good for ain't good for
like<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.540> tank<00:01:45.540> that's<00:01:45.630> gonna<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> little

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
like a tank that's gonna have a little

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.300 
like a tank that's gonna have a little
bit<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.320> flow<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.860> tank<00:01:47.040> actually

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
bit of flow in it this tank actually

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889 
bit of flow in it this tank actually
doesn't<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.640> much<00:01:47.790> flow<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.869> I

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
doesn't have that much flow but I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.969 
doesn't have that much flow but I
probably<00:01:49.079> should<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.619> babies<00:01:49.890> are

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
probably should because the babies are

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.609 
probably should because the babies are
getting<00:01:50.040> bigger<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.640> some<00:01:51.079> good<00:01:52.079> plant<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
getting bigger but some good plant you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.139 
getting bigger but some good plant you
can<00:01:52.740> break<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.130> off<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.579> bottom<00:01:53.729> that's
