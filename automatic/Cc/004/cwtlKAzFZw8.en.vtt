know<00:00:45.300> how<00:00:45.719> that's<00:00:46.260> gonna<00:00:46.469> change<00:00:46.739> things

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
know how that's gonna change things

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.619 
know how that's gonna change things
obviously<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.390> Doug

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
obviously that we now we have Doug

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.020 
obviously that we now we have Doug
Petrie<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.079> Marco<00:00:49.469> Ramirez<00:00:49.770> who<00:00:49.980> are<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:50.460> who

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
I don't know I have no idea that I I

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.930 
I don't know I have no idea that I I
mean<00:03:21.109> possibly<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.799> know<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:22.160> Luke<00:03:22.459> Cage<00:03:22.730> is

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940

bit is in the Jessica Jones and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.490 
bit is in the Jessica Jones and
obviously<00:03:26.690> it'd<00:03:26.780> be<00:03:26.900> very<00:03:27.079> difficult<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.380> make

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
obviously it'd be very difficult to make

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.780 
obviously it'd be very difficult to make
just<00:03:27.650> good<00:03:27.769> eyes<00:03:27.859> without<00:03:28.069> having<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.400> Cajun

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
just good eyes without having a Cajun

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.379 
just good eyes without having a Cajun
and<00:03:28.970> vice<00:03:29.299> versa<00:03:30.160> but<00:03:31.160> but<00:03:31.910> there<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.209> this

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
and vice versa but but there is this

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.259 
and vice versa but but there is this
there<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:32.870> this<00:03:33.049> kind<00:03:33.349> of<00:03:33.620> intent<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.579> to

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
there is this kind of intent to to

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.300 
there is this kind of intent to to
maintain<00:03:36.019> an<00:03:36.200> anonymity<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.859> each<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.190> the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
maintain an anonymity to each of the

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.699 
maintain an anonymity to each of the
shows<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:38.750> get<00:03:39.019> to<00:03:39.139> really<00:03:39.290> live<00:03:39.530> with

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
shows so you get to really live with

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.860 
shows so you get to really live with
them<00:03:39.980> independently<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.239> then<00:03:41.450> when<00:03:41.599> we<00:03:41.720> come

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
them independently and then when we come

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.849 
them independently and then when we come
together<00:03:42.019> we<00:03:42.319> get<00:03:42.410> to<00:03:42.560> see<00:03:42.709> them<00:03:42.889> collaborate
