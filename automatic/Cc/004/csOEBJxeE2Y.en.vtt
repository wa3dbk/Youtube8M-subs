slime<00:00:41.570> molds<00:00:42.110> what<00:00:43.100> are<00:00:43.250> they<00:00:43.510> slime<00:00:44.510> molds

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
slime molds what are they slime molds

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.290 
slime molds what are they slime molds
are<00:00:44.960> amoeba<00:00:45.350> like<00:00:45.620> single-cell<00:00:46.460> organisms

are amoeba like single-cell organisms

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.510 
are amoeba like single-cell organisms
they<00:00:48.020> feed<00:00:48.320> on<00:00:48.350> decaying<00:00:48.650> plant<00:00:49.280> and

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
they feed on decaying plant and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.300 
they feed on decaying plant and
vegetable<00:00:49.940> matter<00:00:50.120> so<00:00:50.990> you<00:00:51.740> might<00:00:51.890> find<00:00:52.010> these

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
vegetable matter so you might find these

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
like reddish orange blobs that you see

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.140 
like reddish orange blobs that you see

mulch slime molds lead a pretty simple
life<00:01:01.850> what<00:01:02.480> they<00:01:02.570> do<00:01:02.630> is<00:01:02.750> they<00:01:02.870> absorb

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
life what they do is they absorb

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.800 
life what they do is they absorb

microorganisms they secrete a little
waist<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:06.440> then<00:01:06.800> they<00:01:06.890> can<00:01:07.040> sort<00:01:07.220> of<00:01:07.280> move<00:01:07.430> on

waist and then they can sort of move on

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.820 
waist and then they can sort of move on
about<00:01:07.880> their<00:01:08.060> day<00:01:08.240> they<00:01:08.750> don't<00:01:08.930> white<00:01:09.470> plays

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
about their day they don't white plays

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.560 
about their day they don't white plays
or<00:01:10.250> watch<00:01:10.400> television<00:01:10.640> they<00:01:11.180> don't<00:01:11.330> ride

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
or watch television they don't ride

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.170 
or watch television they don't ride
bikes<00:01:11.840> or<00:01:12.020> anything<00:01:12.260> like<00:01:12.290> that<00:01:12.940> slime<00:01:13.940> molds

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
bikes or anything like that slime molds

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.820 
bikes or anything like that slime molds
are<00:01:14.270> interesting<00:01:14.750> though<00:01:14.930> because<00:01:15.229> when

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
are interesting though because when

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.800 
are interesting though because when
under<00:01:16.100> stress<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.850> by<00:01:17.030> stress<00:01:17.360> here<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.630> mean

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
under stress and by stress here I mean

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.990 
under stress and by stress here I mean
just<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.020> lack<00:01:18.229> of<00:01:18.260> a<00:01:18.470> food<00:01:18.710> source<00:01:19.000> when

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
just a lack of a food source when

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.730 
just a lack of a food source when
they're<00:01:20.119> stressed<00:01:20.420> we've<00:01:21.229> got<00:01:21.350> nothing<00:01:21.500> to

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
they're stressed we've got nothing to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.890 
they're stressed we've got nothing to
eat<00:01:21.890> what<00:01:22.610> an<00:01:22.729> individual<00:01:23.180> slime<00:01:23.510> mold<00:01:23.780> will

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
eat what an individual slime mold will

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.350 
eat what an individual slime mold will
do<00:01:24.050> is<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> secrete<00:01:24.860> an<00:01:24.979> enzyme<00:01:25.180> so<00:01:26.180> you<00:01:26.240> can

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
do is a secrete an enzyme so you can

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.230 
do is a secrete an enzyme so you can
think<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:26.630> as<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.900> warning<00:01:27.200> signal<00:01:28.240> nearby

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
think of this as a warning signal nearby

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.300 
think of this as a warning signal nearby
slime<00:01:29.630> molds<00:01:29.960> will<00:01:30.110> sense<00:01:30.410> this<00:01:30.680> enzyme<00:01:31.100> and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
slime molds will sense this enzyme and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.160 
slime molds will sense this enzyme and
if<00:01:32.030> they're<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.300> similar<00:01:32.630> straits<00:01:32.720> they'll

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
if they're in similar straits they'll

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.230 
if they're in similar straits they'll
sort<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.470> move<00:01:33.740> in<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.100> direction<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.820> the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
sort of move in the direction of the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.820 
sort of move in the direction of the
other<00:01:35.390> slime<00:01:35.750> mold<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.229> when<00:01:36.650> they<00:01:36.740> do

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
other slime mold and when they do

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.370 
other slime mold and when they do
they'll<00:01:37.009> secrete<00:01:37.430> this<00:01:37.550> enzyme<00:01:37.910> as<00:01:38.090> well<00:01:38.380> this

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
they'll secrete this enzyme as well this

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.260 
they'll secrete this enzyme as well this
creates<00:01:39.770> sort<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.100> an<00:01:40.160> even<00:01:40.340> stronger<00:01:40.670> enzyme

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
creates sort of an even stronger enzyme

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.390 
creates sort of an even stronger enzyme
path<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.320> you<00:01:42.410> can<00:01:42.500> think<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.680> this<00:01:42.770> as<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:42.979> party

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
path so you can think of this as a party

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.580 
path so you can think of this as a party
that's<00:01:43.520> spreading<00:01:43.909> by<00:01:44.659> word<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.930> mouth<00:01:44.990> except

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
that's spreading by word of mouth except

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.170 
that's spreading by word of mouth except
for<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.770> fact<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:46.040> slime<00:01:46.340> molds<00:01:46.640> don't<00:01:47.000> have

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
for the fact that slime molds don't have

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.030 
for the fact that slime molds don't have
mouths<00:01:47.450> what<00:01:47.720> they're<00:01:47.840> doing<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.140> secreting

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
mouths what they're doing is secreting

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.250 
mouths what they're doing is secreting
so<00:01:49.340> it's<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.520> party<00:01:49.760> spreading<00:01:50.210> by<00:01:50.540> secretion

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
so it's a party spreading by secretion

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.410 
so it's a party spreading by secretion
if<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:51.710> will<00:01:51.860> now<00:01:52.730> it's<00:01:52.909> not<00:01:53.090> hard<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.330> figure

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
if you will now it's not hard to figure

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.060 
if you will now it's not hard to figure
what's<00:01:53.659> going<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.870> happen<00:01:54.200> as<00:01:54.350> all<00:01:54.979> these

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
what's going to happen as all these

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.440 
what's going to happen as all these
little<00:01:55.310> creatures<00:01:55.430> start<00:01:55.880> heading<00:01:56.150> toward

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
little creatures start heading toward

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.870 
little creatures start heading toward
some<00:01:56.870> source<00:01:57.200> that's<00:01:57.920> releasing<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.520> enzyme

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
some source that's releasing the enzyme

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.190 
some source that's releasing the enzyme
they're<00:01:59.270> releasing<00:01:59.510> more<00:01:59.810> of<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.050> you're

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
they're releasing more of it you're

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.630 
they're releasing more of it you're
going<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.380> get<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.530> colony<00:02:01.070> that<00:02:01.100> begins<00:02:01.460> to

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
going to get a colony that begins to

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.670 
going to get a colony that begins to
form<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.540> this<00:02:02.720> colony<00:02:03.110> looks<00:02:03.320> sort<00:02:03.590> of<00:02:03.620> like

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
form so this colony looks sort of like

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.920 
form so this colony looks sort of like
jello<00:02:04.430> like<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.760> glob<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.090> love<00:02:05.330> jello<00:02:05.630> and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
jello like a glob you love jello and

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.510 
jello like a glob you love jello and
like<00:02:06.140> jello<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:06.530> colony<00:02:07.040> consists<00:02:07.400> of

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
like jello the colony consists of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.609 
like jello the colony consists of
identical<00:02:08.390> cells<00:02:08.750> there's<00:02:09.080> no<00:02:09.260> cell

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
identical cells there's no cell

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.920 
identical cells there's no cell
differentiation<00:02:10.030> each<00:02:11.030> slime<00:02:11.420> mold<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:11.780> the

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
differentiation each slime mold is the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.410 
differentiation each slime mold is the
same<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.769> colony<00:02:13.190> has<00:02:13.310> no<00:02:13.519> heart<00:02:13.760> no<00:02:13.970> brain

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
same so the colony has no heart no brain

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.080 
same so the colony has no heart no brain
and<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.230> line<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.590> has<00:02:15.709> no<00:02:15.950> courage<00:02:16.340> it's

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
and like the line it has no courage it's

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.699 
and like the line it has no courage it's
just<00:02:17.330> one<00:02:17.540> hundred<00:02:17.750> thousand<00:02:18.140> or<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.290> little

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
just one hundred thousand or so little

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.979 
just one hundred thousand or so little
creatures<00:02:19.160> banding<00:02:19.670> together<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.269> form<00:02:20.930> a

creatures banding together to form a
bigger<00:02:21.200> creature<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.709> this<00:02:21.799> bigger<00:02:22.010> creature

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
bigger creature and this bigger creature

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.610

in<00:02:46.580> fact<00:02:46.790> early<00:02:47.480> scientists<00:02:48.080> thought<00:02:48.410> of

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
in fact early scientists thought of

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.680 
in fact early scientists thought of
these<00:02:48.709> pseudo<00:02:49.040> plasmodia<00:02:49.730> as<00:02:49.880> creatures<00:02:50.330> they

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
these pseudo plasmodia as creatures they

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.750 
these pseudo plasmodia as creatures they
thought<00:02:50.840> they<00:02:50.930> were<00:02:51.020> slugs<00:02:51.380> but<00:02:51.890> they're<00:02:52.040> not

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
thought they were slugs but they're not

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.220 
thought they were slugs but they're not
they're<00:02:52.879> just<00:02:52.909> colonies<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.569> individual

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
they're just colonies of individual

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.190 
they're just colonies of individual
identical<00:02:54.950> cells<00:02:55.540> but<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.689> gets<00:02:56.750> even<00:02:56.989> better

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
identical cells but it gets even better

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.649 
identical cells but it gets even better
than<00:02:57.409> this<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.610> at<00:02:58.730> some<00:02:58.909> point<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.420> it's<00:02:59.569> got

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
than this so at some point so it's got

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.270 
than this so at some point so it's got

all<00:03:11.750> not<00:03:11.989> think<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:12.290> like<00:03:12.349> circus

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
all not think of this like circus

videos<00:03:34.069> of<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:34.609> so<00:03:35.359> these<00:03:35.450> things<00:03:35.629> started

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
videos of this so these things started

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.199 
videos of this so these things started
out<00:03:36.109> as<00:03:36.200> identical<00:03:36.700> but<00:03:37.700> now<00:03:37.849> they<00:03:38.000> start

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
out as identical but now they start

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.849 
out as identical but now they start
forming<00:03:38.540> different<00:03:38.870> roles<00:03:39.109> some<00:03:39.530> form<00:03:39.769> the

stock and some create the spores this is

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.640 
stock and some create the spores this is

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
known as breaking symmetry what started

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.229 
known as breaking symmetry what started
out<00:03:45.739> as<00:03:45.769> symmetric<00:03:46.190> is<00:03:46.280> no<00:03:46.430> longer<00:03:46.700> symmetric

this<00:03:47.720> idea<00:03:48.049> of<00:03:48.139> breaking<00:03:48.560> symmetry<00:03:49.159> is<00:03:49.459> going

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
this idea of breaking symmetry is going

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.129 
this idea of breaking symmetry is going
to<00:03:49.790> be<00:03:49.849> a<00:03:49.879> core<00:03:50.180> concept<00:03:50.720> when<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:50.959> talk<00:03:51.109> about

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
to be a core concept when you talk about

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.099 
to be a core concept when you talk about
emergence<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:52.760> this<00:03:53.329> is<00:03:53.510> really<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.840> slime

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
emergence so this is really the slime

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.229 
emergence so this is really the slime
mold<00:03:54.319> is<00:03:54.470> an<00:03:54.650> epic<00:03:55.069> emergen<00:03:55.730> right<00:03:56.060> we've<00:03:56.209> got

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
mold is an epic emergen right we've got

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.330 
mold is an epic emergen right we've got
individual<00:03:56.780> parts<00:03:57.079> two<00:03:57.199> identical<00:03:57.680> produce

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
individual parts two identical produce

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.099 
individual parts two identical produce
something<00:03:58.549> in<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.790> aggregate<00:03:59.180> that's<00:03:59.540> for

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
something in the aggregate that's for

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.319 
something in the aggregate that's for
lack<00:04:00.199> of<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.349> better<00:04:00.379> word<00:04:00.560> just<00:04:01.069> amazing<00:04:01.639> right

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
lack of a better word just amazing right

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.589 
lack of a better word just amazing right
and<00:04:02.480> they<00:04:02.540> do<00:04:02.599> this<00:04:02.930> as<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.139> way<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.319> survive<00:04:04.599> now

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
and they do this as a way to survive now

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.970 
and they do this as a way to survive now
it's<00:04:05.900> always<00:04:06.290> it's<00:04:06.379> difficult<00:04:06.650> not<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.829> be

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
it's always it's difficult not to be

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.500 
it's always it's difficult not to be
awestruck<00:04:07.489> by<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.760> example<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.269> slime

awestruck by the example of the slime

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.059 
awestruck by the example of the slime
molds<00:04:08.930> but<00:04:09.109> really<00:04:09.379> if<00:04:09.470> you<00:04:09.530> think<00:04:09.560> about<00:04:09.769> it

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
molds but really if you think about it

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.890 
molds but really if you think about it
slime<00:04:10.340> molds<00:04:10.549> are<00:04:10.639> nothing<00:04:11.120> compared<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.840> the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
slime molds are nothing compared to the
