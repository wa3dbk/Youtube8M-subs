three thousand of these cars made um and
that's<00:03:03.940> actually<00:03:04.620> total<00:03:05.620> production<00:03:05.980> from<00:03:06.280> 66

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
that's actually total production from 66

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.259 
that's actually total production from 66
and<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.209> there<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.260> about<00:03:08.760> 96,000<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.880> total

have not tried this thing I have for the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.830 
have not tried this thing I have for the
circuit<00:03:37.129> definitely<00:03:38.090> go<00:03:38.180> have<00:03:38.360> a<00:03:38.390> look<00:03:38.629> at<00:03:38.810> it

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
circuit definitely go have a look at it

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.570 
circuit definitely go have a look at it
i'll<00:03:39.379> be<00:03:39.530> posting<00:03:39.769> that<00:03:40.010> circuit<00:03:40.400> build

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
i'll be posting that circuit build

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.910 
i'll be posting that circuit build
