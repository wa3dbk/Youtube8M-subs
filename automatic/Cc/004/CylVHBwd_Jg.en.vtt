00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:07.134
 Water - Without this key flux, man can live only 4 days. 

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:09.097
 Why is that so? 

00:00:09.098 --> 00:00:13.027
 And why is mineral water not so healthy, as it claims? 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.240
 "So we need water, which is almost completely pure, almost without minerals." 

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:22.688
 Part of our drinking water is stored in underground tanks. 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.676
 Mineral water. The most popular refreshing drink of the Germans. 

00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:33.404
 Prof. Dr. Ingo FrobÃ¶se from High School Sports in Cologne ... 

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.477
 ... has been dealing with water and man for years. 

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:39.393
 "It's hard to believe, but we have something to do with a 70 kg man ... 

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:44.536
 ... almost 40 lit. water in the body. A fair amount, almost two thirds of the body's water ... 

00:00:44.537 --> 00:00:50.922
 ... like a cucumber, almost, rough. Much of that, almost 60% are in the stations ... 

00:00:50.923 --> 00:00:57.306
 ... we have millions of them. 10 kg, from opportunity, is in space between station ... 

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.451
 ... and 4 to 5 liters, in fact, is in the blood. " 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.685
 Drinking water keeps a man alive ... 

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:08.419
 Problem: The human body does not have a water tank, it can not save the fluid. 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:14.231
 That is why it is very important to give the body a sufficient amount of fluid every day. 

00:01:15.394 --> 00:01:20.196
 Without water, a man would die within 4 days. 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.437
 "2 and a half, even 3 liters, each should drink. We lose water during the day ... 

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:31.928
 ... on the one hand, through hydration, which means, we breathe the water ... 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.322
 ... dripping wet, we know that. Let's swim. During the night, eg sometimes 1 to 2 liters ... 

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:43.266
 ... although we are not moving, but we're warmly covered. Besides, we need water ... 

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:47.623
 ... for many energy processes. It collapses, spends and expels. " 

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:52.053
 But not just for the metabolism of water is responsible. It regulates ... 

00:01:52.054 --> 00:01:57.125
 ... and our physical heat, because it has to be steady at about 37 degrees. 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.021
 "Water takes care that the heat that is constantly generated in the body is run out. 

00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:06.241
 We do not have in vain 30,000,000 sweat glands all over the body. 

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:11.293
 And if, for example, we do sports, 60% to 70% of the sweat is thrown through the head ... 

00:02:11.294 --> 00:02:14.110
 ... to keep the body cold and capable. " 

00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:18.338
 "The mineral water industry has done a wonderful job since it claims ... 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:25.073
 ... that there are many minerals that can be introduced into the cells with mineral water. 

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:30.220
 This has not been scientifically proven. We are thinking, just the opposite ... 

00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:35.775
 ... we need water, which has a large capacity for income, which means ... 

00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:39.894
 ... almost absolutely pure, almost without minerals, without any repellent substance ... 

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:44.792
 ... because it can only quickly and efficiently fulfill its transport function. " 

00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:46.627
 TROUBLE WATERS IN TUSCLE 

00:02:46.628 --> 00:02:49.903
 Problem with mineral water: she can not fulfill her basic task ... 

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:55.021
 ... because its molecules are full of minerals and so can not accept it ... 

00:02:55.022 --> 00:02:59.121
 ... feed nutrients from the food, or remove harmful substances from the cells. 

00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:03.215
 In addition, critics argue that minerals in mineral water ... 

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.472
 ... a lot terrible, that they could reach the cells at all.
