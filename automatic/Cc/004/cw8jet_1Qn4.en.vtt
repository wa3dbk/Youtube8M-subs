it<00:03:32.250> run<00:03:32.549> okay<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:34.260> i've<00:03:34.680> got<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:35.190> side<00:03:35.579> panel

we<00:07:13.430> have<00:07:13.580> some<00:07:13.759> other<00:07:13.909> things<00:07:14.180> coming<00:07:14.889> for

we have some other things coming for

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:18.790 
we have some other things coming for
