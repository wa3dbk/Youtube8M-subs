headphones to have a listen to if you've

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.820 
headphones to have a listen to if you've
been<00:00:15.839> watching<00:00:16.170> my<00:00:16.260> videos<00:00:16.289> from<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
been watching my videos from the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.870 
been watching my videos from the
beginning<00:00:17.190> you'll<00:00:17.369> know<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
beginning you'll know that the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.670 
beginning you'll know that the
Sennheiser<00:00:18.270> momentum<00:00:18.869> was<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.350> very<00:00:19.590> first

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
Sennheiser momentum was the very first

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.580 
Sennheiser momentum was the very first
headphone<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.760> looked<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:22.050> my<00:00:22.230> channel

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
headphone that I looked at on my channel

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.460 
headphone that I looked at on my channel
and<00:00:23.119> in<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.300> video<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.600> absolutely<00:00:24.960> gushed

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and in that video I absolutely gushed

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.410 
and in that video I absolutely gushed
over<00:00:25.710> them<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.130> thought<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.849> Sennheiser

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
over them I thought that the Sennheiser

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.750 
over them I thought that the Sennheiser
momentum<00:00:27.930> was<00:00:28.199> an<00:00:28.380> amazing<00:00:28.890> combination<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
momentum was an amazing combination of

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.209 
momentum was an amazing combination of
build<00:00:30.150> quality<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.900> comfort<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.560> sound<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
build quality and comfort and sound and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.549 
build quality and comfort and sound and
even<00:00:33.090> though<00:00:33.180> I've<00:00:33.270> looked<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> number<00:00:34.410> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
even though I've looked at a number of

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.470 
even though I've looked at a number of
great<00:00:35.010> portable<00:00:35.489> headphone<00:00:35.850> since<00:00:36.120> then<00:00:36.329> I

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
great portable headphone since then I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.240 
great portable headphone since then I
still<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.230> think<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> Sennheiser

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
still do think that the Sennheiser

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.400 
still do think that the Sennheiser
momentum<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.870> best<00:00:40.170> overall

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
momentum is one of the best overall

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.290 
momentum is one of the best overall
packages<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> terms<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
packages that you can get in terms of a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.229 
packages that you can get in terms of a
portable<00:00:42.629> headphone<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.250> since<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.940> video

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
portable headphone and since that video

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.000 
portable headphone and since that video
I've<00:00:45.390> also<00:00:45.600> gotten<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> pair<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> sennheiser

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I've also gotten a pair of sennheiser

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.040 
I've also gotten a pair of sennheiser
amperior<00:00:47.100> x'<00:00:47.700> which<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> huge<00:00:48.539> fan<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.780> as

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
amperior x' which I'm a huge fan of as

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.430 
amperior x' which I'm a huge fan of as
well<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.070> when<00:00:50.610> Sennheiser<00:00:51.270> announced<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
well so when Sennheiser announced the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.130 
well so when Sennheiser announced the
Sennheiser<00:00:52.920> momentum<00:00:53.460> on-ear<00:00:53.870> which<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
Sennheiser momentum on-ear which is the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
Sennheiser momentum on-ear which is the
on-air<00:00:55.860> version<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.090> Sennheiser

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
on-air version of the Sennheiser

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
on-air version of the Sennheiser
momentum<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.250> kind<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> excited

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
momentum I was really kind of excited

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.279 
momentum I was really kind of excited
because<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.329> wanted<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.690> know<00:01:00.840> whether<00:01:01.079> they

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
because I wanted to know whether they

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.590 
because I wanted to know whether they
could<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:01.710> basically<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:03.180> same<00:01:03.359> great

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
could get basically the same great

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
could get basically the same great
qualities<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.320> Sennheiser<00:01:04.710> momentum<00:01:05.309> but

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
qualities of the Sennheiser momentum but

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.940 
qualities of the Sennheiser momentum but
in<00:01:05.760> an<00:01:05.909> even<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.360> portable<00:01:07.110> package<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
in an even more portable package so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.280 
in an even more portable package so
here's<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> momentum<00:01:08.970> on-ear<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.750> here's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
here's the momentum on-ear and here's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920 
here's the momentum on-ear and here's
the<00:01:10.560> classic<00:01:11.100> full-size<00:01:11.670> momentum<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the classic full-size momentum as you

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
the classic full-size momentum as you
can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.860> pretty<00:01:14.369> much<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.850> smaller

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
can see one is pretty much a smaller

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.320 
can see one is pretty much a smaller
version<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.619> other<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.970> only<00:01:18.180> thing

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
version of the other the only thing

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
version of the other the only thing
that's<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.720> changed<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> size

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that's really changed is just the size

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.039 
that's really changed is just the size
of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> ear<00:01:20.580> cups<00:01:20.970> not<00:01:21.240> even<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> headband

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
of the ear cups not even the headband

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.550 
of the ear cups not even the headband
has<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.740> changed<00:01:23.189> much<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.610> size

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
has really just changed much in size

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.990 
has really just changed much in size
though<00:01:25.560> there<00:01:25.770> are<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> number<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.520> differences

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
though there are a number of differences

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.120 
though there are a number of differences
with<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> momentum<00:01:27.930> on-ear<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.829> are<00:01:28.920> worth

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
with the momentum on-ear that are worth

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.359 
with the momentum on-ear that are worth
pointing<00:01:29.549> out<00:01:29.869> number<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.890> momentum

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
pointing out number one the momentum

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.660 
pointing out number one the momentum
on-ear<00:01:32.579> has<00:01:33.000> gone<00:01:33.240> down<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> weight<00:01:33.900> now<00:01:34.140> from

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
on-ear has gone down and weight now from

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.580 
on-ear has gone down and weight now from
190<00:01:35.670> grams<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.299> standard<00:01:36.869> momentum<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
190 grams on the standard momentum to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.310 
190 grams on the standard momentum to
160<00:01:38.579> grams<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.600> even<00:01:39.930> more<00:01:39.960> lightweight

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
160 grams so it's even more lightweight

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.999 
160 grams so it's even more lightweight
now<00:01:40.939> in<00:01:41.939> terms<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.600> colors<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.560> momentum

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
now in terms of colors the momentum

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
now in terms of colors the momentum
on-ear<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.610> comes<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.060> four<00:01:45.420> different

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
on-ear now comes in four different

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840 
on-ear now comes in four different
colors<00:01:46.229> none<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.920> which<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.220> black<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.790> you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
colors none of which are black so you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.999 
colors none of which are black so you
get<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.180> ivory<00:01:48.450> color<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.439> also<00:01:49.470> there's<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
get this ivory color but also there's a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.460 
get this ivory color but also there's a
blue<00:01:50.310> there's<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> green<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> pink<00:01:51.720> are<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
blue there's a green and a pink are the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.100 
blue there's a green and a pink are the
ear<00:01:52.710> pads<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.280> now<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.869> synthetic<00:01:54.869> suede

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
ear pads and now a synthetic suede

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.709 
ear pads and now a synthetic suede
material<00:01:55.649> instead<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.460> leather<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.570> this

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
material instead of leather and this

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.139 
material instead of leather and this
synthetic<00:01:58.200> suede<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.770> called<00:01:59.159> Alcantara<00:01:59.850> now

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
synthetic suede is called Alcantara now

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.240 
synthetic suede is called Alcantara now
I<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.450> found<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.810> material<00:02:01.290> are<00:02:01.649> really

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
I just found this material are really

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.950 
I just found this material are really
soft<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:03.240> quite<00:02:03.479> nice

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
soft it's really quite nice

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.840 
soft it's really quite nice
and<00:02:05.230> they're<00:02:05.620> still<00:02:05.800> quite<00:02:05.980> breathable<00:02:06.640> so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
and they're still quite breathable so

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.670 
and they're still quite breathable so
the<00:02:07.210> momentum<00:02:07.630> on-ear<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:08.260> still<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> very

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
the momentum on-ear is still a very

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.570 
the momentum on-ear is still a very
comfortable<00:02:09.430> headphone<00:02:10.230> the<00:02:11.280> headband<00:02:12.280> is

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
comfortable headphone the headband is

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.250 
comfortable headphone the headband is
also<00:02:13.000> slightly<00:02:13.270> different<00:02:13.690> in<00:02:13.750> texture

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
also slightly different in texture

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.080 
also slightly different in texture
though<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> don't<00:02:15.100> know<00:02:15.370> if<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.850> also

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
though I don't know if this is also

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.460 
though I don't know if this is also
Alcantara<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.730> other<00:02:19.030> thing<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
Alcantara the other thing is that the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.130 
Alcantara the other thing is that the
Sennheiser<00:02:21.040> logo<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:22.060> now<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.720> slightly

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
Sennheiser logo is now a slightly

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.500 
Sennheiser logo is now a slightly
holographic<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.250> effect<00:02:24.880> if<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.180> can<00:02:25.330> see

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
holographic in effect if you can see

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.420 
holographic in effect if you can see
that<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.290> personally<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:26.860> would<00:02:27.070> prefer<00:02:27.220> just

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
that and personally I would prefer just

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.670 
that and personally I would prefer just
the<00:02:27.760> standard<00:02:28.060> chrome<00:02:28.510> logo<00:02:28.930> but<00:02:29.140> some<00:02:29.380> people

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
the standard chrome logo but some people

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.260 
the standard chrome logo but some people
might<00:02:29.830> like<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.250> kind<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.820> holographic

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
might like the kind of holographic

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.410 
might like the kind of holographic
effect<00:02:32.190> one<00:02:33.190> more<00:02:33.370> thing<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.820> that<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> cable

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
effect one more thing is that the cable

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.140 
effect one more thing is that the cable
is<00:02:34.870> still<00:02:35.650> detachable<00:02:36.250> like<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.790> on<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
is still detachable like it is on the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.210 
is still detachable like it is on the
classic<00:02:37.660> momentum<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.710> get<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.040> iPhone

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
classic momentum you get the iPhone

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.930 
classic momentum you get the iPhone
remote<00:02:40.000> as<00:02:40.180> well<00:02:40.270> as<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.930> standard<00:02:41.650> non<00:02:42.340> remote

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610

the sennheiser momentum / although this

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.820 
the sennheiser momentum / although this
is<00:02:57.280> pretty<00:02:57.550> much<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:58.330> same<00:02:58.630> headphone<00:02:59.350> as<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
is pretty much the same headphone as the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.190 
is pretty much the same headphone as the
sennheiser<00:03:00.490> momentum<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.330> terms<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.900> build

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
sennheiser momentum in terms of build

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.730 
sennheiser momentum in terms of build
and<00:03:03.190> that's<00:03:03.520> not<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.300> bad<00:03:04.660> thing<00:03:04.990> because<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
and that's not a bad thing because the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.980 
and that's not a bad thing because the
sennheiser<00:03:06.130> momentum<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.940> built<00:03:07.300> brilliantly

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
sennheiser momentum is built brilliantly

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.590 
sennheiser momentum is built brilliantly
and<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.920> momentum<00:03:09.520> on-ear<00:03:09.730> preserves<00:03:10.330> all

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
and the momentum on-ear preserves all

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.390 
and the momentum on-ear preserves all
the<00:03:10.750> qualities<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.440> still<00:03:11.739> has<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:12.100> really

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
the qualities it still has that really

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.120 
the qualities it still has that really
nice<00:03:12.870> metal<00:03:13.870> construction<00:03:14.560> if<00:03:14.770> it<00:03:14.890> was<00:03:14.980> really

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
nice metal construction if it was really

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.090 
nice metal construction if it was really
solid<00:03:15.720> really<00:03:16.720> premium<00:03:17.350> feeling<00:03:17.590> headphone

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
solid really premium feeling headphone

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.250 
solid really premium feeling headphone
so<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> nice<00:03:19.120> touch<00:03:19.360> with<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.600> momentum<00:03:20.050> on-ear

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
so a nice touch with the momentum on-ear

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.080 
so a nice touch with the momentum on-ear
is<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:20.950> get<00:03:21.070> two<00:03:21.310> different<00:03:21.520> carrying

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
is that you get two different carrying

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.080 
is that you get two different carrying
cases<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.840> get<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.320> standard<00:03:24.220> kind<00:03:24.580> of<00:03:24.790> hard

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
cases you get a standard kind of hard

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.370 
cases you get a standard kind of hard
case<00:03:25.450> that's<00:03:25.690> going<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.870> protect<00:03:26.230> your

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
case that's going to protect your

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.340 
case that's going to protect your
headphones<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.670> also<00:03:27.910> get<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.660> carrying

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
headphones and you also get a carrying

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.840 
headphones and you also get a carrying
bag<00:03:29.380> in<00:03:29.739> case<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.010> want<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.250> just<00:03:30.430> be<00:03:30.670> more

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
bag in case you want to just be more

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.670 
bag in case you want to just be more
lightweight<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.930> would<00:03:32.110> stop<00:03:32.380> getting

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
lightweight and this would stop getting

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.010 
lightweight and this would stop getting
scratches<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.550> that's<00:03:33.850> pretty<00:03:34.000> cool

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
scratches so that's pretty cool

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.080 
scratches so that's pretty cool
in<00:03:35.200> terms<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.650> comfort<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.430> momentum<00:03:36.880> on-ear

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
in terms of comfort the momentum on-ear

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.449 
in terms of comfort the momentum on-ear
is<00:03:37.390> remarkably<00:03:38.260> comfortable<00:03:38.920> for<00:03:39.190> an<00:03:39.250> on-ear

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
is remarkably comfortable for an on-ear

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.250 
is remarkably comfortable for an on-ear
headphone<00:03:40.090> as<00:03:40.330> i<00:03:40.720> said<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.050> quite

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
headphone as i said it's quite

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.930 
headphone as i said it's quite
lightweight<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:42.010> doesn't<00:03:42.070> press<00:03:42.580> very<00:03:42.790> hard

lightweight it doesn't press very hard
against<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.660> ears<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.890> comfort<00:03:45.640> is<00:03:45.760> pretty

against the ears and comfort is pretty

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.610 
against the ears and comfort is pretty
much<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.480> best<00:03:46.630> I've<00:03:46.900> felt<00:03:47.170> for<00:03:47.320> an<00:03:47.440> on-ear

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
much the best I've felt for an on-ear

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.410 
much the best I've felt for an on-ear
headphone<00:03:48.130> except<00:03:48.640> for<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.880> audio<00:03:49.209> technica

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
headphone except for the audio technica

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.570

es

they're<00:03:52.180> still<00:03:52.690> an<00:03:52.810> on-ear<00:03:53.080> headphone<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:53.860> it

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
they're still an on-ear headphone so it

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.710 
they're still an on-ear headphone so it
does<00:03:54.190> still<00:03:54.489> press<00:03:54.700> against<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.120> ears<00:03:55.360> it

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
does still press against the ears it

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.660 
does still press against the ears it
might<00:03:56.200> still<00:03:56.500> make<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.800> ear<00:03:57.010> sore<00:03:57.310> after<00:03:57.640> a

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
might still make it ear sore after a

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.620 
might still make it ear sore after a
couple<00:03:57.880> of<00:03:58.030> hours

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
couple of hours

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.120 
couple of hours
so<00:03:58.900> if<00:03:58.989> comforts<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.440> top<00:03:59.590> priority<00:03:59.769> I'd

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
so if comforts a top priority I'd

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.949 
so if comforts a top priority I'd
probably<00:04:00.340> recommend<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:01.209> full-size

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
probably recommend the full-size

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.729 
probably recommend the full-size
momentum<00:04:02.940> noise<00:04:03.940> isolation<00:04:04.570> is<00:04:05.019> pretty<00:04:05.530> much

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
momentum noise isolation is pretty much

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.430 
momentum noise isolation is pretty much
average<00:04:05.890> for<00:04:06.550> an<00:04:06.640> on-ear<00:04:07.000> headphone<00:04:07.600> so<00:04:07.989> you

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
average for an on-ear headphone so you

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.420 
average for an on-ear headphone so you
know<00:04:08.530> it's<00:04:08.650> going<00:04:08.769> to<00:04:08.860> block<00:04:09.040> out<00:04:09.190> some

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
know it's going to block out some

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.920 
know it's going to block out some
external<00:04:09.910> noise<00:04:10.150> though<00:04:10.390> it's<00:04:10.540> not<00:04:10.690> going<00:04:10.870> to

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
external noise though it's not going to

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.330 
external noise though it's not going to
be<00:04:11.019> quite<00:04:11.290> as<00:04:11.470> good<00:04:11.890> as

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
be quite as good as

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.479 
be quite as good as
that<00:04:12.550> just<00:04:12.700> cuts<00:04:12.940> around<00:04:13.150> your<00:04:13.629> entire<00:04:13.989> ear

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
that just cuts around your entire ear

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.849 
that just cuts around your entire ear
but<00:04:15.489> overall<00:04:16.000> as<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.480> package<00:04:17.169> I<00:04:17.350> think<00:04:17.650> the

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
but overall as a package I think the

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.550 
but overall as a package I think the
momentum<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.609> quite<00:04:18.970> well<00:04:19.239> designed<00:04:19.480> but<00:04:20.019> how

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
momentum is quite well designed but how

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.830 
momentum is quite well designed but how
does<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.769> sound<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.459> if<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.120> watch<00:04:22.300> my<00:04:22.479> early

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
does it sound so if you watch my early

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.439 
does it sound so if you watch my early
impressions<00:04:23.470> video<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.340> momentum<00:04:24.880> on<00:04:25.030> ER

you'll<00:04:26.020> know<00:04:26.229> that<00:04:26.260> my<00:04:26.620> friends<00:04:27.040> and<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.340> had

you'll know that my friends and I had

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.240 
you'll know that my friends and I had
some<00:04:27.910> mixed<00:04:28.180> feelings<00:04:28.330> about<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.650> sound<00:04:30.070> of

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
some mixed feelings about the sound of

some mixed feelings about the sound of
this<00:04:30.370> headphone<00:04:30.669> and<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.690> might<00:04:31.840> be

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
this headphone and you might be

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.870 
this headphone and you might be
wondering<00:04:32.139> in<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.740> week<00:04:32.919> since<00:04:33.250> then<00:04:33.460> have<00:04:33.699> my

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
wondering in the week since then have my

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.110 
wondering in the week since then have my
opinions<00:04:34.389> changed<00:04:35.050> well<00:04:35.710> unfortunately<00:04:36.250> they

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
opinions changed well unfortunately they

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.540 
opinions changed well unfortunately they
haven't<00:04:37.449> so<00:04:37.960> first<00:04:38.350> of<00:04:38.560> all<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:39.040> momentum

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
haven't so first of all the momentum

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.610 
haven't so first of all the momentum
on-ear<00:04:39.760> doesn't<00:04:40.419> really<00:04:40.600> sound<00:04:40.900> much<00:04:41.290> like

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
on-ear doesn't really sound much like

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.760 
on-ear doesn't really sound much like
the<00:04:41.889> full-size<00:04:42.729> momentum<00:04:43.620> whereas<00:04:44.620> the

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
the full-size momentum whereas the

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.370 
the full-size momentum whereas the
full-size<00:04:45.160> momentum<00:04:45.729> is<00:04:45.970> kind<00:04:46.330> of<00:04:46.479> a<00:04:46.690> warm

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
full-size momentum is kind of a warm

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.100 
full-size momentum is kind of a warm
mellow<00:04:48.040> kind<00:04:48.460> of<00:04:48.580> laid-back<00:04:48.880> easy<00:04:49.570> listening

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
mellow kind of laid-back easy listening

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.010 
mellow kind of laid-back easy listening
kind<00:04:50.350> of<00:04:50.440> headphone<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.570> momentum<00:04:52.570> on<00:04:52.750> is

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
kind of headphone the momentum on is

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.180 
kind of headphone the momentum on is
much<00:04:53.680> more<00:04:54.460> of<00:04:54.760> an<00:04:54.850> aggressive<00:04:55.800> v-shaped<00:04:56.800> kind

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
much more of an aggressive v-shaped kind

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.850 
much more of an aggressive v-shaped kind
of<00:04:57.340> sound<00:04:57.639> and<00:04:57.970> what<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:58.630> mean<00:04:58.930> about<00:04:59.139> v-shaped

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
of sound and what I mean about v-shaped

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.800 
of sound and what I mean about v-shaped
is<00:05:00.070> that<00:05:00.370> on<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.610> spectrum<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.150> sound<00:05:01.479> the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
is that on the spectrum of sound the

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.409 
is that on the spectrum of sound the
bass<00:05:02.200> is<00:05:02.470> relatively<00:05:02.950> emphasized<00:05:03.610> so<00:05:04.060> all<00:05:04.270> the

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
bass is relatively emphasized so all the

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.750 
bass is relatively emphasized so all the
drums<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.080> kind<00:05:05.320> of<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.470> bass<00:05:05.680> notes<00:05:06.010> and

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
drums and kind of the bass notes and

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.020 
drums and kind of the bass notes and
treble<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.539> strings<00:05:08.470> are<00:05:08.950> particularly<00:05:09.370> kind

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
treble the strings are particularly kind

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.520 
treble the strings are particularly kind
of<00:05:10.180> high-pitched<00:05:10.720> sounds<00:05:11.229> are<00:05:11.350> quite

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
of high-pitched sounds are quite

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.590 
of high-pitched sounds are quite
emphasized<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.850> middle<00:05:13.270> there's

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
emphasized and in the middle there's

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.950 
emphasized and in the middle there's
kind<00:05:13.810> of<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:14.020> dip<00:05:14.320> so<00:05:14.979> that<00:05:15.310> our<00:05:15.610> vocal<00:05:16.600> is<00:05:16.750> kind

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
kind of a dip so that our vocal is kind

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.670 
kind of a dip so that our vocal is kind

lively and exciting to listen to the

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:39.050 
lively and exciting to listen to the
thing<00:05:37.930> with<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.200> momentum<00:05:38.500> on-ear

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
thing with the momentum on-ear

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.690 
thing with the momentum on-ear
unfortunately<00:05:40.060> is<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:41.070> bass<00:05:42.070> on<00:05:42.460> the

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
unfortunately is that the bass on the

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.810 
unfortunately is that the bass on the
momentum<00:05:42.940> on-ear<00:05:43.360> is<00:05:43.900> so<00:05:44.740> emphasized<00:05:45.400> to<00:05:45.700> the

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
momentum on-ear is so emphasized to the

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.020 
momentum on-ear is so emphasized to the
point<00:05:46.150> where<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:47.020> has<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:48.160> slightly<00:05:48.610> loose

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
point where it has a slightly loose

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.450 
point where it has a slightly loose
quality<00:05:49.599> to<00:05:49.810> it<00:05:49.990> it<00:05:50.169> almost<00:05:50.680> takes<00:05:51.010> on<00:05:51.220> a<00:05:51.250> kind

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
quality to it it almost takes on a kind

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.550 
quality to it it almost takes on a kind
of<00:05:51.550> droning<00:05:52.300> note<00:05:52.570> if<00:05:52.810> you're<00:05:52.960> listening<00:05:53.349> to<00:05:53.530> a

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
of droning note if you're listening to a

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.400 
of droning note if you're listening to a
song<00:05:53.919> with<00:05:54.130> a<00:05:54.280> lot<00:05:54.820> of<00:05:55.030> bass<00:05:55.330> notes<00:05:55.690> now<00:05:56.320> if

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
song with a lot of bass notes now if

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.500 
song with a lot of bass notes now if
you're<00:05:56.560> listening<00:05:56.680> to<00:05:57.280> you<00:05:58.090> know<00:05:58.180> something

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
you're listening to you know something

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.969 
you're listening to you know something
that<00:05:58.599> doesn't<00:05:58.840> really<00:05:58.930> have<00:05:59.229> that<00:05:59.260> much<00:05:59.500> bass

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
that doesn't really have that much bass

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.420 
that doesn't really have that much bass
the<00:06:00.610> momentum<00:06:01.030> on<00:06:01.180> here<00:06:01.510> is<00:06:01.660> a<00:06:02.349> quite<00:06:03.099> a<00:06:03.130> nice

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
the momentum on here is a quite a nice

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.610 
the momentum on here is a quite a nice
listen<00:06:03.880> it's<00:06:04.090> quite<00:06:04.270> articulate<00:06:05.080> it's<00:06:05.349> quite

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
listen it's quite articulate it's quite

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.940 
listen it's quite articulate it's quite
clean<00:06:06.330> it's<00:06:07.330> got

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
clean it's got

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.470 
clean it's got
nice<00:06:08.130> soundstage<00:06:08.700> maybe<00:06:08.940> slightly<00:06:09.240> even

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
nice soundstage maybe slightly even

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.110 
nice soundstage maybe slightly even
wider<00:06:09.990> than<00:06:10.560> the<00:06:10.770> standard<00:06:11.490> momentum<00:06:11.970> just

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
wider than the standard momentum just

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.200 
wider than the standard momentum just
because<00:06:12.540> the<00:06:13.400> treble<00:06:14.400> was<00:06:14.520> relatively<00:06:15.000> a<00:06:15.030> bit

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
because the treble was relatively a bit

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.930 
because the treble was relatively a bit
more<00:06:15.360> emphasized<00:06:15.930> but<00:06:16.590> as<00:06:16.770> soon<00:06:17.220> as<00:06:17.520> like<00:06:17.910> a

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
more emphasized but as soon as like a

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.420 
more emphasized but as soon as like a
throbbing<00:06:18.450> kind<00:06:19.020> of<00:06:19.140> bass<00:06:19.380> note<00:06:19.680> kicks<00:06:19.980> in<00:06:20.160> it

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
throbbing kind of bass note kicks in it

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.030 
throbbing kind of bass note kicks in it
really<00:06:21.300> kicks<00:06:21.600> in<00:06:21.780> on<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:22.050> Anya<00:06:22.500> and<00:06:22.710> it

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
really kicks in on the Anya and it

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.400 
really kicks in on the Anya and it
honestly<00:06:23.280> gets<00:06:23.730> a<00:06:23.910> little<00:06:24.300> distracting<00:06:25.020> now

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
honestly gets a little distracting now

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.780 
honestly gets a little distracting now
I've<00:06:25.560> said<00:06:25.770> it<00:06:25.860> before<00:06:25.890> and<00:06:26.220> I'll<00:06:26.550> say<00:06:26.580> it

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
I've said it before and I'll say it

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.420 
I've said it before and I'll say it
again<00:06:26.910> I<00:06:27.360> don't<00:06:27.540> mind<00:06:28.170> my<00:06:28.410> bass<00:06:28.650> and<00:06:29.010> I<00:06:29.280> own<00:06:29.400> a

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
again I don't mind my bass and I own a

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.400 
again I don't mind my bass and I own a
number<00:06:29.820> of<00:06:30.150> really<00:06:30.330> basic<00:06:30.600> headphones<00:06:31.260> that

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
number of really basic headphones that

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.100 
number of really basic headphones that
are<00:06:31.500> quite<00:06:31.770> like<00:06:32.100> I<00:06:32.480> love<00:06:33.480> the<00:06:33.720> sennheiser

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
are quite like I love the sennheiser

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
are quite like I love the sennheiser
amperior<00:06:34.260> I<00:06:35.070> love<00:06:35.280> the<00:06:35.430> audio<00:06:35.760> technica<00:06:35.940> es10

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
amperior I love the audio technica es10

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.800 
amperior I love the audio technica es10
and<00:06:38.130> recently<00:06:39.000> I've<00:06:39.150> got<00:06:39.300> a<00:06:39.330> pair<00:06:39.510> of<00:06:39.540> the

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
and recently I've got a pair of the

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.920 
and recently I've got a pair of the
v-moda<00:06:40.710> m-80s<00:06:41.580> which<00:06:41.790> I<00:06:42.000> think<00:06:42.270> are<00:06:42.450> really

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
v-moda m-80s which I think are really

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.470 
v-moda m-80s which I think are really
nice<00:06:43.650> warm<00:06:44.250> kind<00:06:44.520> of<00:06:44.640> bass<00:06:44.910> you<00:06:45.120> on<00:06:45.270> your

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
nice warm kind of bass you on your

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.680 
nice warm kind of bass you on your
headphone<00:06:45.960> ah<00:06:46.620> the<00:06:47.430> thing<00:06:47.730> with<00:06:47.910> the<00:06:48.030> momentum

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
headphone ah the thing with the momentum

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.570 
headphone ah the thing with the momentum
on<00:06:48.810> ears<00:06:49.140> bass<00:06:49.470> is<00:06:49.710> that<00:06:49.740> unfortunately<00:06:50.220> I

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
on ears bass is that unfortunately I

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.220 
on ears bass is that unfortunately I
just<00:06:50.700> don't<00:06:50.970> think<00:06:51.270> it<00:06:51.360> sounds<00:06:51.750> very<00:06:51.870> natural

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.230 
just don't think it sounds very natural

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.930 
just don't think it sounds very natural
it<00:06:52.740> doesn't<00:06:53.040> sound<00:06:53.160> very<00:06:53.310> well<00:06:53.610> integrated

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
it doesn't sound very well integrated

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.970 
it doesn't sound very well integrated
into<00:06:54.510> the<00:06:54.570> rest<00:06:54.750> of<00:06:54.840> the<00:06:54.930> spectrum<00:06:55.410> and<00:06:55.650> it

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
into the rest of the spectrum and it

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.370 
into the rest of the spectrum and it
really<00:06:56.340> caused<00:06:56.730> attention<00:06:57.330> to<00:06:57.480> itself<00:06:57.870> now<00:06:58.350> I

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
really caused attention to itself now I

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.320 
really caused attention to itself now I
don't<00:06:58.590> know<00:06:58.860> maybe<00:06:59.250> you<00:06:59.430> might<00:06:59.670> like<00:07:00.060> this

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
don't know maybe you might like this

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.690 
don't know maybe you might like this
kind<00:07:00.600> of<00:07:00.660> really<00:07:01.230> aggressive<00:07:01.350> bass<00:07:01.980> tone<00:07:02.370> and

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700 
kind of really aggressive bass tone and

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.150 
kind of really aggressive bass tone and
by<00:07:03.660> all<00:07:03.870> means<00:07:04.140> if<00:07:04.380> it<00:07:04.500> sounds<00:07:04.770> like<00:07:04.890> something

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
by all means if it sounds like something

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.890 
by all means if it sounds like something
that<00:07:05.190> you<00:07:05.400> might<00:07:05.520> like<00:07:05.580> go<00:07:06.210> ahead<00:07:06.330> and<00:07:06.660> check

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900 
that you might like go ahead and check

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.360 
that you might like go ahead and check
it<00:07:07.050> out<00:07:07.110> in<00:07:07.290> the<00:07:07.380> store<00:07:07.650> and<00:07:07.740> have<00:07:07.920> a<00:07:07.950> listen

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
it out in the store and have a listen

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.650 
it out in the store and have a listen
because<00:07:08.520> this<00:07:08.790> should<00:07:08.910> be<00:07:09.030> relatively<00:07:09.480> easy

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
because this should be relatively easy

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.480 
because this should be relatively easy
to<00:07:09.990> find<00:07:10.110> I<00:07:10.650> don't<00:07:10.920> think<00:07:11.070> it's<00:07:11.160> a<00:07:11.190> technically

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
to find I don't think it's a technically

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.490 
to find I don't think it's a technically
bad<00:07:11.760> headphone<00:07:12.300> and<00:07:12.540> I've<00:07:12.600> read<00:07:12.780> a<00:07:12.810> number<00:07:12.870> of

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
bad headphone and I've read a number of

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.200 
bad headphone and I've read a number of
comments<00:07:13.980> from<00:07:14.100> people<00:07:14.190> who<00:07:14.550> do<00:07:14.700> quite<00:07:15.000> like

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
comments from people who do quite like

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.270 
comments from people who do quite like
the<00:07:15.360> sound<00:07:15.570> of<00:07:15.780> it<00:07:15.900> so<00:07:16.410> I<00:07:16.470> guess<00:07:17.040> this<00:07:17.220> is

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
the sound of it so I guess this is

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.590 
the sound of it so I guess this is
something<00:07:17.430> that<00:07:17.700> you<00:07:17.970> might<00:07:18.180> want<00:07:18.240> to<00:07:18.420> have<00:07:18.570> a

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
something that you might want to have a

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.110 
something that you might want to have a
listen<00:07:19.020> to<00:07:19.050> just<00:07:19.470> to<00:07:19.620> make<00:07:19.860> up<00:07:20.010> your<00:07:20.130> own<00:07:20.190> mind

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
listen to just to make up your own mind
