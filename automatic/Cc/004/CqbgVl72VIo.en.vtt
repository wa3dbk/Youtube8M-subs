my<00:01:00.480> whole<00:01:00.660> steps<00:01:00.989> optimator<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
my whole steps optimator this is

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.119 
my whole steps optimator this is
alternating<00:01:03.059> between<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.690> root<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.129> second

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
alternating between the root and second

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.960 
alternating between the root and second
inversion<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> 2nd<00:01:06.960> inversion

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
inversion here we go to 2nd inversion

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.370 
inversion here we go to 2nd inversion
talk<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.210> notes<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.600> by<00:01:09.840> whole<00:01:10.049> step

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
talk to you notes down by whole step

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.020 
talk to you notes down by whole step
route<00:01:11.070> again

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
route again

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.490 
route again
to<00:01:13.630> second<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.840> root<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.909> second<00:01:19.390> always<00:01:20.200> buy

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
to second to root the second always buy

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:31.649 
to second to root the second always buy
whole<00:01:20.830> steps<00:01:27.720> back<00:01:28.720> down<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.140> see<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
whole steps back down to see the

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.109 
whole steps back down to see the
movement<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.590> same<00:01:32.890> as<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.520> major<00:01:33.759> sevens

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
movement is the same as the major sevens

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.719 
movement is the same as the major sevens
work<00:01:34.509> but<00:01:35.050> now<00:01:35.200> we're<00:01:35.409> in<00:01:35.500> minor<00:01:35.740> once<00:01:36.549> we've

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
work but now we're in minor once we've

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.749 
work but now we're in minor once we've
got<00:01:36.940> this<00:01:37.119> down<00:01:37.619> with<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.710> right<00:01:38.920> hand<00:01:39.220> we're

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
got this down with the right hand we're

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.760 
got this down with the right hand we're
going<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.940> once<00:01:40.180> again<00:01:40.330> add<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:41.200> left<00:01:41.440> hand

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
going to once again add the left hand

00:01:41.770 --> 00:02:04.350 
going to once again add the left hand
circle<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.670> fifths

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.410 

slowing<00:02:05.360> even<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.049> key<00:02:06.290> take<00:02:07.100> your<00:02:07.220> time

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
slowing even is the key take your time

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.639 
slowing even is the key take your time
once<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.509> get<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.720> know<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:08.989> you'll<00:02:09.289> pick<00:02:09.500> up

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
once you get to know it you'll pick up

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.440 
once you get to know it you'll pick up
speed<00:02:09.979> let's<00:02:10.489> take<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> look<00:02:10.880> at<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.330> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
speed let's take a look at this on the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:23.780 
speed let's take a look at this on the
board

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.979 

you

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.930 

here<00:02:32.989> are<00:02:33.200> all<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.530> minor<00:02:33.800> 7th<00:02:34.370> structures

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
here are all the minor 7th structures

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.750 
here are all the minor 7th structures
and<00:02:35.239> root<00:02:35.989> 2<00:02:36.170> 2nd<00:02:36.500> inversion<00:02:36.769> alternating

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
and root 2 2nd inversion alternating

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.949 
and root 2 2nd inversion alternating
following<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.360> circle<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.810> fifths

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
following the circle of fifths

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.320 
following the circle of fifths
counterclockwise<00:02:39.530> as<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:40.190> can<00:02:40.340> see<00:02:40.610> let's

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
counterclockwise as you can see let's

00:02:41.330 --> 00:03:04.589 
counterclockwise as you can see let's
add<00:02:41.629> this<00:02:41.900> now<00:02:42.170> with<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.010> left<00:02:43.250> hand

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.080 

so<00:03:05.599> let's<00:03:05.959> play<00:03:06.260> these<00:03:06.530> minor<00:03:06.950> 7<00:03:07.489> structures

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
so let's play these minor 7 structures

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.589 
so let's play these minor 7 structures
in<00:03:08.450> sequence<00:03:09.140> here<00:03:09.860> we<00:03:09.980> go<00:03:10.129> with<00:03:10.340> C<00:03:10.700> minor<00:03:10.940> 7<00:03:11.420> in
