 programs that we are installed this 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.909
 Well the truth does not serve any purpose 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.250
 they take away a little space 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.100

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.030

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.099

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.190

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.819
 all the programs that you 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.650

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.180
