00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
of problem with the gearing I always

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.450 
of problem with the gearing I always
felt<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.080> was<00:02:40.230> coming<00:02:40.410> between<00:02:40.710> second

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
felt like I was coming between second

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.850 
felt like I was coming between second
and<00:02:41.520> third<00:02:41.640> gear<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.330> medium<00:02:42.990> speed<00:02:43.290> going<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
and third gear in medium speed going and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.760 
and third gear in medium speed going and
I<00:02:44.160> was<00:02:44.790> kind<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.720> second<00:02:46.140> gear<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.380> was<00:02:46.530> over

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
I was kind of in second gear it was over

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.110 
I was kind of in second gear it was over
revving<00:02:46.980> quite<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.310> lot<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.820> was<00:02:47.940> quite

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
revving quite a lot and it was quite

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.540 
revving quite a lot and it was quite
hard<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:49.350> make<00:02:49.560> forward<00:02:49.980> progress<00:02:50.010> you

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
hard to to make forward progress you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.690 
hard to to make forward progress you
just<00:02:50.760> didn't<00:02:51.060> want<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.390> go<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.350> just<00:02:52.410> spin<00:02:52.830> in

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
just didn't want to go and just spin in

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.970 
just didn't want to go and just spin in
third<00:02:54.060> gear<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.540> go<00:02:54.840> much<00:02:55.050> better<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.590> work<00:02:55.800> in

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
third gear it go much better we work in

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.740 
third gear it go much better we work in
the<00:02:56.040> clutch<00:02:56.250> really<00:02:56.640> hard<00:02:56.850> all<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.090> time<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the clutch really hard all the time and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.270 
the clutch really hard all the time and
kind<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:59.880> wasn't<00:03:00.120> quite<00:03:00.390> right<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.280> we

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
kind of it it wasn't quite right so we

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.760 
kind of it it wasn't quite right so we
went<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> 52<00:03:03.540> because<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:04.110> was<00:03:04.230> all<00:03:04.350> talent

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
went to a 52 because that was all talent

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.710 
went to a 52 because that was all talent
could<00:03:05.160> provide<00:03:05.760> us<00:03:05.940> with<00:03:06.000> at<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.330> time<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
could provide us with at the time and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.850 
could provide us with at the time and
they're<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.900> only<00:03:06.930> people<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.470> kind<00:03:07.830> of

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
they're the only people that kind of

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.290 
they're the only people that kind of
makes<00:03:08.070> pockets<00:03:08.520> other

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
makes pockets other

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.380 
makes pockets other
spot<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.460> is<00:03:11.610> quite<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.210> bit

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
spot it and it is a bit is quite a bit

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.570 
spot it and it is a bit is quite a bit
better<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:13.380> much<00:03:13.530> easier<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.040> cut<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> hole

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
better it's much easier to cut a hole

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.850 
better it's much easier to cut a hole
straight<00:03:14.790> here<00:03:15.090> than<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.360> was<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.170> runs

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
straight here than it was and it runs

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.440 
straight here than it was and it runs
through<00:03:17.010> much<00:03:17.280> cleaner<00:03:17.520> I'd<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.210> try<00:03:18.390> if

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
through much cleaner I'd like to try if

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.030 
through much cleaner I'd like to try if
if<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.780> are<00:03:18.930> not<00:03:19.110> thinking

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.369 

the<00:03:27.040> other<00:03:27.160> major<00:03:27.459> thing<00:03:27.730> that<00:03:27.940> we've<00:03:28.319> had<00:03:29.319> to

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
the other major thing that we've had to

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.009 
the other major thing that we've had to
do<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.830> slow<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.190> exhaust<00:03:30.489> out<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.030> it's

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
do is slow the exhaust out and it's

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.869 
do is slow the exhaust out and it's
proven<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.620> standard<00:03:33.069> exhaust<00:03:33.310> proves<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.849> be

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
proven the standard exhaust proves to be

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.690 
proven the standard exhaust proves to be
quite<00:03:34.239> soft<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.769> doesn't<00:03:36.129> take<00:03:36.280> much<00:03:36.489> to

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
quite soft and it doesn't take much to

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.210 
quite soft and it doesn't take much to
dent<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.300> seems<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.629> happen

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.600 

and<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.730> had<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:42.970> do<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.210> again<00:03:43.270> since<00:03:43.800> so

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
and I had to do it again since so

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:59.940 
and I had to do it again since so
that's<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.330> little<00:03:46.540> bit<00:03:46.720> frustrating

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.860 

a<00:04:00.160> bit<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.819> them<00:04:01.000> quite<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.420> bit<00:04:01.569> different

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
a bit of them quite a bit different

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.839 
a bit of them quite a bit different
racing<00:04:02.230> on<00:04:02.349> it<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.040> it's<00:04:03.280> performing

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
racing on it and and it's performing

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.240 
racing on it and and it's performing
really<00:04:04.090> well<00:04:04.209> I<00:04:04.360> did<00:04:04.629> a<00:04:04.660> few<00:04:04.930> gonna<00:04:05.860> feel<00:04:06.099> the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
really well I did a few gonna feel the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.339 
really well I did a few gonna feel the
AMC<00:04:06.580> a<00:04:06.760> quick<00:04:07.090> showing<00:04:07.330> hands<00:04:07.540> championships

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.280 

the<00:04:20.910> bikes<00:04:21.150> been<00:04:21.389> really<00:04:21.870> really<00:04:22.049> good

there's<00:04:22.770> no<00:04:22.919> problems<00:04:23.400> with<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.730> it<00:04:23.880> seems<00:04:24.120> to

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
there's no problems with it it seems to

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.340 
there's no problems with it it seems to
be<00:04:24.960> holding<00:04:25.139> strong<00:04:25.650> he's<00:04:26.370> got<00:04:26.610> almost<00:04:27.350> 50

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
be holding strong he's got almost 50

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.470

hours<00:04:28.680> on<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.580> doesn't<00:04:29.790> need<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.030> piston

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
hours on it and it doesn't need a piston

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.210 
hours on it and it doesn't need a piston
it<00:04:30.600> still<00:04:30.810> feels<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.139> same<00:04:31.410> as<00:04:31.620> when<00:04:31.740> I<00:04:31.770> got<00:04:32.040> it

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
it still feels the same as when I got it

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.170 
it still feels the same as when I got it
it<00:04:33.090> still<00:04:33.450> stronger<00:04:33.960> than<00:04:34.139> a<00:04:34.260> KTM<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:35.730> live<00:04:35.940> one

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180

it still stronger than a KTM to live one
it's<00:04:36.720> been<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:36.960> joy<00:04:37.260> really<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:37.800> been<00:04:38.010> much

better<00:04:38.430> than<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.910> last<00:04:39.120> bike<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.840> had<00:04:40.050> which

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
better than the last bike I had which

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.590 
better than the last bike I had which
had<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.280> lot<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.520> bits<00:04:41.730> falling<00:04:42.030> off<00:04:42.270> get<00:04:42.480> it

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
had a lot of bits falling off get it

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.420 
had a lot of bits falling off get it
just<00:04:42.750> do<00:04:43.110> not<00:04:43.380> and<00:04:43.500> bolt<00:04:43.680> check<00:04:43.919> before<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.250> go

racing<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.230> nothing<00:04:46.230> really<00:04:46.410> seems<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.889> break

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
racing and nothing really seems to break

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.610 
racing and nothing really seems to break
