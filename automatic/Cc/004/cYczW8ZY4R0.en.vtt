00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
Wednesday March 13 2013 well gold and

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.040 
Wednesday March 13 2013 well gold and
silver<00:00:07.410> prices<00:00:07.980> have<00:00:08.730> been<00:00:08.760> following<00:00:09.510> pretty

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
silver prices have been following pretty

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.589 
silver prices have been following pretty
much<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> past<00:00:10.889> four<00:00:11.610> or<00:00:11.730> five<00:00:12.000> months

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
much for the past four or five months

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.480 
much for the past four or five months
and<00:00:12.780> i<00:00:12.960> think<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> correction

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
and i think that the correction

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.689 
and i think that the correction
represents<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.330> great<00:00:15.630> buying<00:00:15.990> opportunity

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
represents a great buying opportunity

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.140 
represents a great buying opportunity
for<00:00:17.699> savers<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.570> investors<00:00:19.430> because<00:00:20.430> first

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
for savers for investors because first

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.570 
for savers for investors because first
of<00:00:21.270> all<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.170> correction<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.949> based<00:00:23.250> on

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
of all the the correction is based on

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.500 
of all the the correction is based on
the<00:00:24.269> false<00:00:24.570> premise<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.849> the<00:00:26.849> economy<00:00:27.210> is

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the false premise that the economy is

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.950 
the false premise that the economy is
improving<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.550> stock<00:00:29.849> market<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.510> making

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
improving and the stock market is making

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.549 
improving and the stock market is making
new<00:00:31.109> highs<00:00:32.180> therefore<00:00:33.180> there's<00:00:33.719> no<00:00:33.809> reason<00:00:34.530> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
new highs therefore there's no reason to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.220 
new highs therefore there's no reason to
buy<00:00:34.829> gold<00:00:35.160> anymore<00:00:35.520> after<00:00:35.820> all<00:00:36.180> gold<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
buy gold anymore after all gold was a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.979 
buy gold anymore after all gold was a
safe<00:00:37.590> haven<00:00:37.879> we<00:00:38.879> were<00:00:39.000> buying<00:00:39.300> gold<00:00:39.629> because

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
safe haven we were buying gold because

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.990 
safe haven we were buying gold because
we<00:00:40.140> were<00:00:40.260> worried<00:00:40.649> about<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.190> markets<00:00:41.730> we

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
we were worried about the markets we

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.880 
we were worried about the markets we
were<00:00:42.090> worried<00:00:42.360> about<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.690> economy<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.410> now

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
were worried about the economy and now

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.840 
were worried about the economy and now
there's<00:00:44.129> nothing<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.520> worry<00:00:44.760> about

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
there's nothing to worry about

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.049 
there's nothing to worry about
everything<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.110> great<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.370> gold<00:00:47.760> prices

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
everything is great and so gold prices

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.940 
everything is great and so gold prices
are<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> collapse<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.410> that's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.739> nice

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
are going to collapse now that's a nice

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.240 
are going to collapse now that's a nice
story<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:51.270> isn't<00:00:51.600> true<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.079> fact<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
story but it isn't true in fact the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.760 
story but it isn't true in fact the
truth<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.480> problems<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.379> largely

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
truth is that our problems are largely

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.060 
truth is that our problems are largely
in<00:00:56.100> front<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.579> us<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:57.539> behind<00:00:58.109> us<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.739> only

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
in front of us not behind us the only

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.330 
in front of us not behind us the only
reason<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.420> economy<00:01:00.780> appears<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:02.190> be

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
reason that the economy appears to be

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.640 
reason that the economy appears to be
recovering<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.719> stock<00:01:03.960> market<00:01:04.379> appears

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
recovering and the stock market appears

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.190 
recovering and the stock market appears
to<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.949> rising<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.670> because<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> government

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
to be rising is because the government

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.630 
to be rising is because the government
is<00:01:07.260> debasing<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.070> money<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.490> federal

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
is debasing the money the federal

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.550 
is debasing the money the federal
reserve<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.180> printing<00:01:09.630> money<00:01:09.780> call<00:01:10.409> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
reserve is printing money call it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.350 
reserve is printing money call it
quantitative<00:01:11.250> easing<00:01:11.400> whatever<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.119> want

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
quantitative easing whatever you want

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.140 
quantitative easing whatever you want
but<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.110> old-fashioned<00:01:14.010> debt<00:01:14.549> monetization

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
but it's old-fashioned debt monetization

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.899 
but it's old-fashioned debt monetization
money<00:01:16.080> printing<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.369> what's<00:01:17.610> going

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
money printing and that's what's going

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
money printing and that's what's going
on<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.600> haven't<00:01:18.780> solved<00:01:19.380> our<00:01:19.470> problems<00:01:20.040> we're

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
on we haven't solved our problems we're

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.789 
on we haven't solved our problems we're
papering<00:01:20.880> them<00:01:21.000> over<00:01:21.360> temporarily<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.680> all

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
papering them over temporarily and all

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.679 
papering them over temporarily and all
this<00:01:22.950> cheap<00:01:23.280> money<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:24.030> into<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> stock

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
this cheap money is going into the stock

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.440 
this cheap money is going into the stock
market<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.860> ultimately<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.299> go

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
market but ultimately it's going to go

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
market but ultimately it's going to go
right<00:01:27.750> back<00:01:27.990> into<00:01:28.380> gold<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.950> silver

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
right back into gold and silver

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
right back into gold and silver
everything<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> government<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.840> doing<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
everything the government is doing to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620 
everything the government is doing to
artificially<00:01:32.280> stimulate<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> economy<00:01:33.000> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
artificially stimulate the economy and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.649 
artificially stimulate the economy and
prop<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> stock<00:01:34.920> market<00:01:35.430> all<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.360> is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
prop up the stock market all of that is

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.850 
prop up the stock market all of that is
fuel<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> fire<00:01:38.659> beneath<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.079> gold<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
fuel to the fire beneath the gold and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.219 
fuel to the fire beneath the gold and
silver<00:01:41.280> mean<00:01:41.820> inflation<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.079> be

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
silver mean inflation is going to be

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.100 
silver mean inflation is going to be
much<00:01:43.500> stronger<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.579> much<00:01:44.850> better<00:01:45.210> when<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
much stronger or much better when it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.830 
much stronger or much better when it
comes<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.759> rising<00:01:47.759> prices<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.450> gold<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
comes to rising prices for gold and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.080 
comes to rising prices for gold and
silver<00:01:49.229> than<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> stock<00:01:50.610> market

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
silver than it is for the stock market

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.600 
silver than it is for the stock market
so<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.390> investors<00:01:52.259> who<00:01:52.799> are<00:01:52.829> jumping<00:01:53.430> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so I think investors who are jumping to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.060 
so I think investors who are jumping to
the<00:01:53.700> wrong<00:01:53.729> conclusion<00:01:54.630> are<00:01:54.899> doing<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.920> wrong

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
the wrong conclusion are doing the wrong

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920 
the wrong conclusion are doing the wrong
thing<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.670> respect<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.329> their<00:01:57.450> gold<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
thing with respect to their gold and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
thing with respect to their gold and
silver<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.009> represents<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.850> great

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
silver but that represents a great

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.510 
silver but that represents a great
opportunity<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.899> those<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.799> us<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.009> really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
opportunity for those of us that really

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700 
opportunity for those of us that really
understand<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> big<00:02:03.420> picture<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:04.049> remember

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
understand the big picture and remember

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.590 
coming in fact i think the lion's share
the<00:03:39.140> gains<00:03:39.410> are<00:03:39.830> still<00:03:40.640> ahead<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.940> us<00:03:41.150> i<00:03:41.360> think

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
the gains are still ahead of us i think

to protect it than by having real money
gold<00:06:52.909> or<00:06:53.149> silver<00:06:53.360> as<00:06:53.689> part<00:06:54.050> of<00:06:54.169> that<00:06:54.229> IRA

gold or silver as part of that IRA

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.040 
gold or silver as part of that IRA
especially<00:06:56.270> now<00:06:56.419> that<00:06:56.449> we've<00:06:56.719> had<00:06:56.839> this

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
especially now that we've had this

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.499 
especially now that we've had this
correction<00:06:57.649> in<00:06:57.800> both<00:06:58.279> the<00:06:58.459> price<00:06:58.699> of<00:06:58.969> gold<00:06:59.029> and

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
correction in both the price of gold and

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.419 
correction in both the price of gold and
silver<00:06:59.839> I<00:06:59.869> think<00:07:00.199> it's<00:07:00.319> even<00:07:00.619> better<00:07:00.889> time<00:07:01.219> for

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:01.429 
silver I think it's even better time for

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:03.279 
silver I think it's even better time for
