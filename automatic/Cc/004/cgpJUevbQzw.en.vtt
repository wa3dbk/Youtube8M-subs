now the thing that strikes me about this
this<00:02:41.220> portable<00:02:41.580> turntable<00:02:41.820> let's<00:02:42.420> get

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
this portable turntable let's get

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.320 
this portable turntable let's get
another<00:02:43.320> good<00:02:43.530> look<00:02:43.680> at<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.950> here<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
another good look at it here that is the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.950 
another good look at it here that is the
unit<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.810> Crossley<00:02:46.320> revolution<00:02:47.600> as<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.840> can

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
unit the Crossley revolution as you can

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.730 
unit the Crossley revolution as you can
see<00:02:49.170> very<00:02:49.470> compact<00:02:50.040> very<00:02:51.170> small<00:02:52.170> there's<00:02:52.590> the

see very compact very small there's the
battery<00:02:52.950> hatch<00:02:53.310> right<00:02:53.640> there<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.530> there<00:02:55.530> is

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
battery hatch right there and there is

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.890 
battery hatch right there and there is
even<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.100> transmitter<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.090> off<00:02:57.180> switch<00:02:57.600> and

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
a frequency select which see if you can

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.910 
a frequency select which see if you can
see<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:02.330> but<00:03:03.330> yes<00:03:03.900> right<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.710> box

me<00:03:17.700> opening<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.570> up<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.300> see<00:03:21.570> that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
me opening this up is you can see that

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.070 
me opening this up is you can see that
there's<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.740> needle<00:03:22.950> guard<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.490> there

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
there's a needle guard on there

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.650 
there's a needle guard on there
protecting<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.830> needle<00:03:26.130> from<00:03:26.820> bouncing<00:03:27.540> up

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
protecting the needle from bouncing up

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.410 
protecting the needle from bouncing up
and<00:03:27.750> down<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:29.570> platter<00:03:30.570> here<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:32.390> would<00:03:33.390> not

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
and down on the platter here I would not

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.199 
and down on the platter here I would not
want<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.200> lose<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.500> little<00:03:35.100> piece<00:03:35.490> of<00:03:35.790> white

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
want to lose that little piece of white

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.020 
want to lose that little piece of white
plastic<00:03:36.840> because<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:37.890> essentially<00:03:38.490> resting

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
plastic because it's essentially resting

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.330 
plastic because it's essentially resting
directly<00:03:39.570> on<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:42.540> rubber<00:03:42.750> here<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.709> that

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
directly on the the rubber here and that

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.730 
directly on the the rubber here and that
would<00:03:44.550> be<00:03:44.760> very<00:03:45.360> bad<00:03:45.600> for<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.470> needle

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
would be very bad for the needle

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.070 
would be very bad for the needle
obviously<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.400> mean<00:03:47.850> we're<00:03:48.360> taken<00:03:48.630> come<00:03:48.780> on

little white piece of plastic and

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.820 
little white piece of plastic and
everything<00:03:54.330> will<00:03:54.450> be<00:03:54.480> okay

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
everything will be okay

everything will be okay
as<00:03:56.310> far<00:03:56.580> as<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.090> batteries<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:58.350> requires<00:03:58.790> six

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
as far as the batteries it requires six

double<00:04:10.410> A's<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.860> have<00:04:11.400> no<00:04:11.550> idea<00:04:11.820> but<00:04:12.270> in<00:04:12.870> our

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
double A's I have no idea but in our

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.940 
double A's I have no idea but in our
next<00:04:14.220> few<00:04:14.370> videos<00:04:14.550> while<00:04:15.239> I'm<00:04:15.680> playing<00:04:16.680> the

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
next few videos while I'm playing the

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.970 
next few videos while I'm playing the
vinyl<00:04:17.280> finds<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:18.810> I've<00:04:19.109> had<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.470> far<00:04:19.500> on<00:04:19.739> the

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
vinyl finds that I've had so far on the

vinyl finds that I've had so far on the
trip<00:04:20.010> we'll<00:04:20.910> get<00:04:21.120> an<00:04:21.209> idea<00:04:21.540> of<00:04:21.810> just<00:04:22.140> how<00:04:22.530> much

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
trip we'll get an idea of just how much

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.310 
trip we'll get an idea of just how much
longevity<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.820> can<00:04:23.940> get<00:04:24.150> out<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.540> a

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
longevity you can get out of a

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.700 
longevity you can get out of a
of<00:04:25.640> double<00:04:26.640> a<00:04:26.730> alkaline<00:04:27.230> that's<00:04:28.230> it<00:04:28.440> for<00:04:28.590> now

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
of double a alkaline that's it for now
