I<00:00:07.859> want<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.010> do<00:00:08.160> is<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.280> want<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.490> divide<00:00:08.820> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
I want to do is you want to divide a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.280 
I want to do is you want to divide a
line<00:00:09.240> almost<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.440> half<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.570> upper<00:00:12.570> body<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
line almost in half the upper body the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.140 
line almost in half the upper body the
upper<00:00:13.590> part<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> little<00:00:14.099> bit<00:00:14.190> longer<00:00:14.790> than

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
upper part is a little bit longer than

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.700 
upper part is a little bit longer than
the<00:00:15.240> lower<00:00:15.389> part<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.900> then<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.230> upper<00:00:16.500> part

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
the lower part and then the upper part

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.250 
the lower part and then the upper part
you<00:00:16.800> divide<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.130> half<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.720> basically<00:00:18.720> her<00:00:19.020> head

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
you divide in half so basically her head

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.160 
you divide in half so basically her head
takes<00:00:19.500> up<00:00:19.650> half<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> upper<00:00:20.310> portion<00:00:21.170> if

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170

drawing<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.320> comics<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:30.090> already

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
drawing in in comics then you already

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.730 
drawing in in comics then you already
know<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.539> basics<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.990> drawing<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.470> human

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.500 
know the basics of drawing the human
figure<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.309> then<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.460> just<00:00:32.610> plug<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.390> these

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
figure and then you just plug in these

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270 
figure and then you just plug in these
proportions<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:34.770> really<00:00:35.010> how

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
proportions to it and that's really how

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.690 
proportions to it and that's really how
you<00:00:35.809> draw<00:00:36.809> any<00:00:37.079> sort<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.860> cartoon<00:00:38.219> character

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so you know it wouldn't be very

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.380 
so you know it wouldn't be very

draw<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> character<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.150> Starfire<00:01:33.810> any

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
draw a character like Starfire any

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
draw a character like Starfire any
character<00:01:34.470> first<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.220> want<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.400> study<00:01:35.579> her

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
character first you want to study her

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.160 
character first you want to study her
start<00:01:36.210> her<00:01:36.240> proportions<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:36.990> very

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
start her proportions it's very

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.450 
start her proportions it's very
important<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.799> her<00:01:37.950> proportion

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
important that you know her proportion

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.670 
important that you know her proportion
so<00:01:38.700> figure<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.509> where<00:01:39.750> her<00:01:39.869> halfway<00:01:40.110> point<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
so figure out where her halfway point is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.370 
so figure out where her halfway point is
on<00:01:40.860> her<00:01:40.950> body<00:01:41.130> figure<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.240> how<00:01:42.390> much<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.869> her

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
on her body figure out how much of her

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.840 
on her body figure out how much of her
body<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> upper<00:01:44.070> half<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> how<00:01:44.729> much

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
body is in the upper half and how much

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.060 
body is in the upper half and how much
of<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> lower<00:01:45.899> half<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.890> with

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
of it is in the lower half so with

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.670 
of it is in the lower half so with
Starfire<00:01:47.490> what<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> found<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.450> when

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
Starfire what I found out is that when

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.319 
Starfire what I found out is that when
you<00:01:49.680> divide<00:01:49.920> her<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.189> half<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.970> crotch

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
you divide her and half at the crotch

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.170 
you divide her and half at the crotch
her<00:01:52.049> upper<00:01:52.409> body<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.979> actually<00:01:53.790> longer<00:01:53.970> than

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
her upper body is actually longer than

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
her upper body is actually longer than
her<00:01:54.390> lower<00:01:54.570> body<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:55.590> she<00:01:55.649> has<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> big

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
her lower body because she has a big

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
her lower body because she has a big
head<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.549> includes<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> big<00:01:57.119> head<00:01:57.299> also<00:01:58.049> notice

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
head so includes a big head also notice

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 
head so includes a big head also notice
that<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.710> upper<00:01:59.369> portion<00:02:00.210> her<00:02:00.570> head<00:02:00.750> takes

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
that that upper portion her head takes

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.569 
that that upper portion her head takes
up<00:02:01.140> about<00:02:01.229> half<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.590> proportion<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.430> her

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
up about half that proportion so her

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.749 
up about half that proportion so her
torso<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> very<00:02:03.719> tiny<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.350> then<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> rest<00:02:05.610> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
torso is very tiny and then the rest is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.310 
torso is very tiny and then the rest is
her<00:02:05.880> lake<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.360> makes<00:02:06.540> her<00:02:06.689> legs<00:02:06.930> look<00:02:07.049> very

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
her lake so it makes her legs look very

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109 
her lake so it makes her legs look very
long<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.160> reason<00:02:08.369> why<00:02:08.459> her<00:02:08.550> legs<00:02:08.759> look<00:02:08.849> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
long the reason why her legs look so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.559 
long the reason why her legs look so
long<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.509> cuz<00:02:09.720> her<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.259> her<00:02:10.349> torso<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.039> tiny

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
long as cuz her to her torso is so tiny

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.850 
long as cuz her to her torso is so tiny
so<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.930> basic<00:02:13.260> proportions

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so that's the basic proportions

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.900 
so that's the basic proportions
of<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.010> character<00:02:14.280> once<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> know<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
of this character once you know the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.030 
of this character once you know the
proportion<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> character<00:02:15.900> then<00:02:16.770> all<00:02:17.010> you

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
proportion of the character then all you

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.290 
proportion of the character then all you
do<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.400> take<00:02:17.430> your<00:02:17.580> knowledge<00:02:18.030> from

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
do is you take your knowledge from

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.060 
do is you take your knowledge from
either<00:02:18.570> one<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:18.990> my<00:02:19.080> courses<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.800> figure

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
either one of my courses on figure

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.890 
either one of my courses on figure
drawing<00:02:20.400> or<00:02:20.790> somebody<00:02:21.180> else's<00:02:21.450> courses<00:02:21.780> on

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
drawing or somebody else's courses on

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.530 
drawing or somebody else's courses on
finger<00:02:22.140> drawing<00:02:22.490> or<00:02:23.490> what<00:02:23.820> however<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.360> have

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
finger drawing or what however you have

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.570 
finger drawing or what however you have
learned<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.990> draw<00:02:25.530> figures<00:02:25.950> from<00:02:25.980> imagination

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
learned to draw figures from imagination

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.090 
learned to draw figures from imagination
to<00:02:26.850> draw<00:02:27.000> poses<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.480> imagination<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.350> once

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
to draw poses for imagination and once

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.140 
to draw poses for imagination and once
you<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.310> do<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.400> they<00:02:29.670> need<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.880> figure<00:02:30.060> out

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
you can do that they need to figure out

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.060 
you can do that they need to figure out
a<00:02:30.240> pose<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.840> then<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.050> plug<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.620> her

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
a pose and then you plug in her

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.520 
a pose and then you plug in her
proportions<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:33.150> pose<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:34.350> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
proportions to that pose and that's it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.990 
proportions to that pose and that's it
you<00:02:34.710> can<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.430> take<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.640> exact

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you can you can you can take this exact

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.880 
you can you can you can take this exact
same<00:02:36.180> pose<00:02:36.420> right<00:02:36.630> here<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.050> plug<00:02:37.710> in

same pose right here and plug in

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.260 
same pose right here and plug in
somebody<00:02:38.220> else's<00:02:38.460> proportions<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.120> can

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
somebody else's proportions you can

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.390 
somebody else's proportions you can
actually<00:02:39.390> take<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.860> know<00:02:40.890> plug-in

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
actually take it and you know plug-in

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.310 
actually take it and you know plug-in
supergirls<00:02:42.240> proportions<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.959> know<00:02:43.050> from

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
supergirls proportions you know from

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.260 
supergirls proportions you know from
from<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.980> typical<00:02:44.160> comic<00:02:44.670> book<00:02:44.940> type

character and you know more more of a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.460 
character and you know more more of a
realistic<00:02:47.850> looking<00:02:48.090> body<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:49.140> know<00:02:49.230> it's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
realistic looking body and you know it's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.750 
realistic looking body and you know it's
gonna<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.830> same<00:02:49.980> pose<00:02:50.220> but<00:02:50.520> you're<00:02:50.670> going

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
gonna be the same pose but you're going

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.550 
gonna be the same pose but you're going
to<00:02:50.820> apply<00:02:51.390> totally<00:02:51.870> different<00:02:52.110> proportions

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
to apply totally different proportions

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.310 
to apply totally different proportions
to<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.390> what<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.540> did<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.930> did<00:02:55.080> an<00:02:55.170> initial

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
to it so what I did is I did an initial

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.740 
to it so what I did is I did an initial
sketch<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.130> blue<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:57.300> when<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.510> come

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
sketch and in blue and then when I come

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.090 
sketch and in blue and then when I come
back<00:02:57.810> over<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.320> add<00:02:58.410> some<00:02:58.590> details<00:02:58.950> with

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
back over to add some details with

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.470 
back over to add some details with
clothing<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.670> stuff<00:02:59.730> like<00:02:59.850> that<00:02:59.910> going<00:03:00.239> red

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
clothing and stuff like that going red

this<00:04:29.580> color<00:04:29.789> is<00:04:29.849> not<00:04:30.030> going<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.210> work<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.830> at

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
this color is not going to work and at

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.469 
this color is not going to work and at
the<00:04:31.979> time<00:04:32.189> I<00:04:32.430> didn't<00:04:32.789> know<00:04:32.849> how<00:04:32.969> to<00:04:33.030> change<00:04:33.330> the

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
the time I didn't know how to change the

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.600 
the time I didn't know how to change the
brightness<00:04:33.719> and<00:04:34.169> color<00:04:34.349> hue<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.830> know<00:04:35.370> how<00:04:35.520> to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
brightness and color hue I know how to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.240 
brightness and color hue I know how to
do<00:04:35.729> it<00:04:35.849> now<00:04:35.969> I<00:04:36.229> figured<00:04:37.229> it<00:04:37.319> out<00:04:37.439> but<00:04:37.740> while<00:04:38.219> i

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
do it now I figured it out but while i

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.559 
do it now I figured it out but while i
was<00:04:38.370> doing<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.699> video<00:04:38.969> i<00:04:39.030> didn't<00:04:39.449> know<00:04:39.509> how

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
was doing this video i didn't know how

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.320 
was doing this video i didn't know how
to<00:04:39.659> do<00:04:39.750> it<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:39.870> i<00:04:39.990> just<00:04:40.139> like<00:04:40.289> repainted<00:04:40.830> her

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
to do it so i just like repainted her

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.149 
to do it so i just like repainted her
but<00:04:42.330> anyway<00:04:42.629> um<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:43.080> go<00:04:43.710> ahead<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:43.919> you<00:04:44.069> know

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
but anyway um I go ahead and you know

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.649 
but anyway um I go ahead and you know
choose<00:04:44.400> all<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.669> colors<00:04:44.939> and<00:04:45.180> just<00:04:45.330> fill<00:04:45.539> them

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
choose all the colors and just fill them

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:47.809 
choose all the colors and just fill them
in<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.110> with<00:04:46.740> this<00:04:46.770> ink<00:04:47.099> brush<00:04:47.280> there<00:04:47.580> I'm

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
in and with this ink brush there I'm

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.939 
in and with this ink brush there I'm
telling<00:04:48.120> me<00:04:48.210> was<00:04:48.449> so<00:04:48.659> awesome<00:04:48.900> and<00:04:49.349> you<00:04:49.800> can

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
telling me was so awesome and you can

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:51.679 
telling me was so awesome and you can
make<00:04:50.069> it<00:04:50.189> both<00:04:50.340> vector<00:04:50.729> or<00:04:50.909> regular<00:04:51.360> roster

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
make it both vector or regular roster

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.399 
make it both vector or regular roster
and<00:04:51.990> what's<00:04:52.169> cool<00:04:52.379> about<00:04:52.409> number<00:04:52.770> five<00:04:52.949> now

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
and what's cool about number five now

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.230 
and what's cool about number five now
exs<00:04:55.409> five<00:04:55.650> and<00:04:55.860> general<00:04:56.099> mango<00:04:56.699> studio<00:04:57.000> five

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
exs five and general mango studio five

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.290 
exs five and general mango studio five
is<00:04:57.539> that<00:04:58.439> you<00:04:58.590> could<00:04:58.830> use<00:04:59.490> a<00:04:59.520> vector<00:04:59.879> layer<00:05:00.060> and

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
is that you could use a vector layer and

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.790 
is that you could use a vector layer and
it<00:05:00.449> works<00:05:00.599> almost<00:05:00.810> just<00:05:01.080> like<00:05:01.199> a<00:05:01.259> raster<00:05:01.650> layer

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
it works almost just like a raster layer

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.260 
it works almost just like a raster layer
like<00:05:02.370> when<00:05:02.490> you're<00:05:02.610> raised<00:05:02.819> up<00:05:03.029> it<00:05:03.180> doesn't

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
like when you're raised up it doesn't

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.879 
like when you're raised up it doesn't
like<00:05:03.539> get<00:05:03.719> rid<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.870> big<00:05:04.080> portions<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:04.710> things

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
like get rid of big portions and things

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.589 
like get rid of big portions and things
like<00:05:05.039> that<00:05:05.099> so<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.490> works<00:05:05.639> very<00:05:05.909> similar<00:05:06.389> and

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
like that so it works very similar and

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.189 
like that so it works very similar and
so<00:05:07.289> it<00:05:07.620> makes<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:07.919> much<00:05:08.039> easier<00:05:08.099> to<00:05:08.550> get<00:05:09.199> vector

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
so it makes it much easier to get vector

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.010 
so it makes it much easier to get vector
artwork<00:05:11.000> but<00:05:12.000> feeling<00:05:12.509> like<00:05:12.539> you're<00:05:12.870> working

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
artwork but feeling like you're working

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.779 
artwork but feeling like you're working
on<00:05:13.319> on<00:05:13.560> raster<00:05:14.099> so<00:05:14.250> you'll<00:05:14.400> feel<00:05:14.550> like<00:05:14.580> you're

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
on on raster so you'll feel like you're

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.459 
on on raster so you'll feel like you're
you<00:05:15.360> know<00:05:15.419> painting<00:05:15.779> and<00:05:15.900> photoshop<00:05:16.229> even

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
you know painting and photoshop even

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:17.779 
you know painting and photoshop even
better<00:05:16.650> though<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:16.860> think<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.219> engine<00:05:17.580> all

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
better though I think the engine all

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.399 
better though I think the engine all
together<00:05:18.000> is<00:05:18.240> better<00:05:18.360> I<00:05:18.689> show<00:05:19.199> a<00:05:19.229> quick

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
together is better I show a quick

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.140 
together is better I show a quick
technique<00:05:19.830> here<00:05:20.069> and<00:05:20.219> I<00:05:20.279> explain<00:05:20.669> in<00:05:20.819> detail

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
technique here and I explain in detail

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.360 
technique here and I explain in detail
in<00:05:21.180> there<00:05:21.509> in<00:05:21.629> the<00:05:21.719> real<00:05:21.810> time<00:05:21.990> video<00:05:22.370> where

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
in there in the real time video where

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.950 
in there in the real time video where
you<00:05:23.400> can<00:05:23.610> make<00:05:23.759> a<00:05:23.789> just<00:05:24.300> like<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.449> photoshop<00:05:24.930> you

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
you can make a just like a photoshop you

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.260 
you can make a just like a photoshop you
can<00:05:25.110> make<00:05:25.289> a<00:05:25.319> copy<00:05:25.650> of<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:26.129> of<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.819> layer<00:05:27.000> and

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
can make a copy of the of the layer and

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.499 
can make a copy of the of the layer and
then<00:05:27.360> take<00:05:27.569> that<00:05:27.599> layer<00:05:27.990> and<00:05:28.229> add<00:05:29.509> multiply

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
then take that layer and add multiply

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.600 
then take that layer and add multiply
and<00:05:30.750> then<00:05:30.900> make<00:05:31.080> a<00:05:31.110> mask<00:05:31.979> over<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:32.430> then<00:05:32.520> you

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
and then make a mask over and then you

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.399 
and then make a mask over and then you
can<00:05:32.789> draw<00:05:33.449> on<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:33.690> mask<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.080> reveal<00:05:34.110> that

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
can draw on the mask to reveal that

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.869 
can draw on the mask to reveal that
layer<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:34.949> it's<00:05:35.069> an<00:05:35.310> easy<00:05:35.460> way<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.699> add

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:35.879 
layer and it's an easy way to add

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.059 
layer and it's an easy way to add
shadows<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:37.259> your<00:05:37.409> character<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:37.800> you<00:05:37.949> can

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069 
shadows to your character and you can

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:39.439 
shadows to your character and you can
also<00:05:38.190> do<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.490> same<00:05:38.520> thing<00:05:38.909> to<00:05:39.089> add<00:05:39.210> highlights

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
also do the same thing to add highlights

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.050 
also do the same thing to add highlights
to<00:05:39.750> your<00:05:39.870> character<00:05:40.169> and<00:05:40.789> obviously<00:05:41.789> you<00:05:41.940> know

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
to your character and obviously you know

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.339 
to your character and obviously you know
in<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.360> cartoon<00:05:42.690> she's<00:05:42.900> not<00:05:43.020> going<00:05:43.139> to<00:05:43.199> have

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
in the cartoon she's not going to have

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.649 
in the cartoon she's not going to have
all<00:05:43.589> this<00:05:43.740> stuff<00:05:44.009> it<00:05:44.819> takes<00:05:45.060> longer<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:45.509> do

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
all this stuff it takes longer to do

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.600 
all this stuff it takes longer to do
that<00:05:45.839> when<00:05:46.020> you're<00:05:46.080> animating<00:05:46.319> some<00:05:47.219> cartoons

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
that when you're animating some cartoons

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.579 
that when you're animating some cartoons
do<00:05:47.819> do<00:05:47.969> have<00:05:48.150> shadows<00:05:48.479> like<00:05:48.719> boondocks<00:05:49.440> and

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:49.589 
do do have shadows like boondocks and

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:52.040 
do do have shadows like boondocks and
stuff<00:05:49.830> but<00:05:50.039> for<00:05:50.219> the<00:05:50.279> most<00:05:50.400> part<00:05:51.050> American

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
stuff but for the most part American

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.209 
stuff but for the most part American
cartoons<00:05:52.469> don't<00:05:52.680> have<00:05:52.919> shadows<00:05:53.310> in<00:05:53.460> them<00:05:53.610> and

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:55.219 
cartoons don't have shadows in them and

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:57.350 
cartoons don't have shadows in them and
so<00:05:56.219> it's<00:05:56.370> pretty<00:05:56.460> much<00:05:56.580> it<00:05:56.849> i<00:05:56.879> just<00:05:56.969> finished

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
so it's pretty much it i just finished

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.089 
so it's pretty much it i just finished
her<00:05:57.449> up<00:05:57.599> here<00:05:57.870> add<00:05:58.409> a<00:05:58.469> little<00:05:58.560> bit<00:05:58.770> highlights

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
her up here add a little bit highlights
