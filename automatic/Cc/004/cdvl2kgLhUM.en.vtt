00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
times too and if you put it once more

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.600 
times too and if you put it once more
and<00:01:44.849> collect<00:01:45.090> another<00:01:45.390> coin<00:01:46.369> it's<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.580> to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.130 
and collect another coin it's going to
you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.030> actually<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.509> break<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.869> max

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
you can actually going to break the max

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.010 
you can actually going to break the max
of<00:01:49.410> allowed<00:01:49.679> coins<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.690> reset

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
of allowed coins so it's going to reset

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.150 
of allowed coins so it's going to reset
you<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> zero<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.440> get<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.830> high

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
you a zero so if I just get that high

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.749 
you a zero so if I just get that high
number<00:01:56.459> again<00:01:58.459> now<00:01:59.459> it's<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.849> to<00:01:59.910> say<00:02:01.759> that

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
number again now it's going to say that

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.690 
number again now it's going to say that
I<00:02:02.789> have<00:02:02.970> zero<00:02:03.000> coins<00:02:03.569> in<00:02:03.690> my<00:02:03.810> stash<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.700> I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
I have zero coins in my stash and I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.240 
I have zero coins in my stash and I
can't<00:02:05.970> buy<00:02:06.090> anything<00:02:06.709> but<00:02:07.709> if<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.099> play

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
