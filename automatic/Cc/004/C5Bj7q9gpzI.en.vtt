right<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.020> numbers<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.770> got<00:01:37.979> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
right here the numbers are here I got a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.819 
right here the numbers are here I got a
twelve<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.490> sixteen<00:01:38.610> percent<00:01:39.150> increase<00:01:39.829> with
