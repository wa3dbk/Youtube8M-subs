 hi friends from you tube i'm what came through iván master 146 and I 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.180
 I bring this tutorial where I will tell you a web page where to find 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.340
 servers from Spain and around the world from games like kunter explain 1 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.159
 points 6 counter strike surs colotl and upyd 1 2 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:20.949
 4 exeter and other games like the alpha faithful batel and 'f1' two and many many 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.569
 more games 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:24.409
 good let's start 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.099
 the page left in the description of the video so they do not have problems 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.050
 with the directive in 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.870
 the page is very good I found it searching the internet and I 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.710
 helped to have Spanish servers in the context and that the 1 points 6 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.540
 As you can see, there are quite a few games like the ones I mentioned before like the CS 1 points 6 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.540
 cs surs colotl and uti exeter a 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.360
 the languages ​​you have are strapping and the best you can do is choose 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.860
 country where they are since in games like and contain tricker 1 points 6 if the 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.570
 server is from outside of your country usually gives you a lot of latency and make the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.560
 game does not respond well 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.010
 it also has a type of server search that looks for those that are 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.050
 find so many kilometers of your geographical situation but advised 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.050
 use the servers that are displayed when we put a country 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.310
 let's try the ones that told them about the search by km 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.830
 which is pretty good and is one of the things that I like about this page 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.170
 in addition to the variety of servers you have for games 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.039
 we change from game to try try out and two and we'll see that it also has 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:19.119
 pretty Spanish servers and from all over the world like all games 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.119
 of this page 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:35.959
