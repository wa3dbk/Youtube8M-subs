00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 greetings guys here noe choice today in 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.960
 This video will explain how 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.469
 install new spaak created by 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.269
 me with the texture of the fei full of 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.990
 sounds of the old but also in life 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.570
 for minecraft 1.6.1 initially a da 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.720
 keep in the description and download the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.369
 to mediafire the texture and what it is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.849
 the zip package perreta pirlo stefano 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.099
 winzip or winrar consequences enough that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.170
 graduates enough that degree thesis suffices 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.480
 decker and that is this folder that knows 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.520
 who is just spaak you don't have to open the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.530
 you have to leave it like this and now we can 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.890
 go in search with windows 8 like 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:52.230
 start simply look for percentage 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 it was percentage and you send and it is 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 which opens roaming and black on point 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.320
 minecraft and let's go down to resource 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.769
 pack you can have no circle of these 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.600
 and telecom and shader packs or cormons why 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.010
 precisely they are of certain fashions that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.460
 add these folders left 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.490
 to lose 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.229
 we take spaak seriously now that there is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.909
 I've already installed it but to install it 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 you just have to simply drag 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.200
 his spaak the folder inside the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.270
 minecraft stitch folder splits from 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.840
 hence from the seven chip from win from the rows 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.009
 zip inside the resource pack folder 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.159
 we can close but first let's see 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.310
 precisely in and the credits that Pakistan 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.140
 made up by me with the sounds coming 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.840
 however from minecraft from the beta of 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.750
 minecraft with obviously covered with 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.950
 eramo zhang and the facebook texture where it is 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.729
 created by vatic 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.040
 this is the minecraft topic here 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.049
 texture forum always a day 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.960
 point 6 of batik so if not 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.070
 you want to have old sounds 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.299
 just go into the texture 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.870
 go to this one on this link and 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.790
 download it from there 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.980
 the normal texture without sounds do it 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.360
 same procedure then matrix renzi 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.080
 you drag in here 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.510
 ok we can close everything now 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.980
 open minecraft if you didn't know 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.290
 need a new launcher so no 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.290
 you can use the old launcher for 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.670
 come to minecraft 1.6.1 to the sky 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.400
 which they quietly have from minecraft 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.810
 puntonet and this is how it is here 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.280
 screen that you should see if not 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.220
 you have other spaak beings we go into 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.020
 pack resort options and we put shaqiri 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.110
 source pac and we see that it is everything 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:42.350
 2 for the fei della full now I do not have 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:46.050
 neither kid peace friends or do you but also the 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.360
 the text would be customized if there is 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.890
 pits also fein vegetable gardens obviously now 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.440
 it is not there because I am even if it is already 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.890
 came out had 1.6 anyway here we are 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.080
 we see that the texture works that 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.710
 let's try some new sounds for example 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.710
 with the bow 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.849
 let's say the sound is the old one 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.689
 at least split the ears with 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.689
 that soil is the old one 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.420
 or it can happen we feel that the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.970
 sound is always from the beta of minecraft 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.329
 I preferred to keep these sounds because 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.250
 there and I like them more simply 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.780
 I saw that there was a company that did 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.849
 can also change the sound is said 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.319
 why not take advantage of it 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.060
 instead of making a texture pack the 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.590
 day we do a favor undergo 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.950
 script if the spot with the sounds also the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.950
 doors 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.579
 we feel that we are the old 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.579
 elements there are various types of sounds of 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.889
 fall of damage etc. etc. 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.849
 so nothing this here was a video on 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:56.040

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.560
 video liked and I like to comment and
