00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
some people put jam in the middle so

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.100 
some people put jam in the middle so
you're<00:01:58.090> gonna<00:01:58.210> mix<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.570> up<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:58.810> have<00:01:58.929> vanilla

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
you're gonna mix it up and have vanilla

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.419 
you're gonna mix it up and have vanilla
and<00:01:59.440> yep<00:02:00.750> yeah<00:02:01.750> so<00:02:02.679> it<00:02:02.740> needs<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.979> go<00:02:03.070> in<00:02:03.220> for

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
and yep yeah so it needs to go in for

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.590 
and yep yeah so it needs to go in for
about<00:02:03.520> five<00:02:03.789> minutes<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.420> hottest

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
about five minutes and the hottest

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.990 
about five minutes and the hottest
temperature<00:02:04.990> your<00:02:05.410> oven<00:02:05.679> my<00:02:06.460> ovens<00:02:06.759> actually

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
temperature your oven my ovens actually

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.040 
temperature your oven my ovens actually
quite<00:02:07.210> hot<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:10.030> probably<00:02:10.390> put<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.869> in<00:02:10.929> for

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
quite hot so I probably put it in for

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.070 
quite hot so I probably put it in for
about<00:02:11.200> three<00:02:11.500> minutes<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:12.750> then<00:02:13.750> I'll<00:02:13.870> check

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
about three minutes and then I'll check

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
about three minutes and then I'll check
on<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:15.310> all<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.090> do<00:02:16.269> is<00:02:16.720> smear<00:02:17.530> this<00:02:17.830> over

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
on it now all you do is smear this over

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.759 
on it now all you do is smear this over
making<00:02:18.730> sure<00:02:18.880> everything's<00:02:19.390> covered<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:20.050> think

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
making sure everything's covered I think

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.050 
making sure everything's covered I think
I<00:02:21.040> would<00:02:21.160> pour<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.550> would<00:02:21.640> just<00:02:21.760> kind<00:02:22.000> of

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
I would pour that it would just kind of

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.729 
I would pour that it would just kind of
collapse<00:02:22.360> but<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.660> doesn't<00:02:22.959> does<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.260> cuz<00:02:23.470> it

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
collapse but it doesn't does it cuz it

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.620 
collapse but it doesn't does it cuz it
really<00:02:23.769> holds<00:02:24.190> its<00:02:24.430> shape<00:02:24.459> pick<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.150> keys<00:02:25.360> to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
really holds its shape pick the keys to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.569 
really holds its shape pick the keys to
get<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.930> oven<00:02:26.019> quite<00:02:26.290> quickly<00:02:26.530> yeah

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
get in the oven quite quickly yeah

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.400 
get in the oven quite quickly yeah
and<00:02:27.730> cuz<00:02:27.880> it's<00:02:28.000> hot<00:02:28.269> could<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.959> blow<00:02:29.110> off<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
and cuz it's hot could just blow off the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.560 
and cuz it's hot could just blow off the
outside<00:02:29.530> really<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.040> doesn't<00:02:30.280> really<00:02:30.570> blast

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
outside really it doesn't really blast

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.140 
outside really it doesn't really blast
the<00:02:32.019> inside<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.400> be<00:02:33.489> look<00:02:33.610> quite<00:02:33.790> rough<00:02:34.030> it

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
the inside it can be look quite rough it

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.130 
the inside it can be look quite rough it
doesn't<00:02:34.420> matter<00:02:34.720> too<00:02:35.650> much<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.459> here<00:02:36.820> goes<00:02:37.000> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
doesn't matter too much so here goes the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:48.630 
doesn't matter too much so here goes the
nerve-wracking<00:02:38.140> bit<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:47.190> think<00:02:48.190> my<00:02:48.280> oven<00:02:48.579> is

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
nerve-wracking bit I think my oven is

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.190 
nerve-wracking bit I think my oven is
hotter<00:02:48.910> than<00:02:49.030> most<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.600> can<00:02:49.780> smell<00:02:49.989> even

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
hotter than most so I can smell even

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.520 
hotter than most so I can smell even
after<00:02:50.410> two<00:02:50.590> minutes<00:02:50.709> but<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.130> looks<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:52.000> me

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.190
