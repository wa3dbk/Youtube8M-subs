baseball<00:00:22.109> hitting<00:00:22.320> mechanics<00:00:22.529> we're<00:00:23.490> going

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
baseball hitting mechanics we're going

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.120 
baseball hitting mechanics we're going
to<00:00:23.699> go<00:00:23.850> over<00:00:24.119> four<00:00:24.900> things<00:00:25.199> as<00:00:25.470> they<00:00:25.830> relate<00:00:26.099> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
to go over four things as they relate to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.640 
to go over four things as they relate to
what<00:00:26.789> we're<00:00:26.939> working<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.359> within<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
what we're working on within is the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.080 
what we're working on within is the
catapult<00:00:29.099> loading<00:00:29.400> system<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:29.910> we're<00:00:30.000> going

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
catapult loading system so we're going

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.420 
catapult loading system so we're going
to<00:00:30.150> look<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.449> how<00:00:31.170> Ian<00:00:31.500> hides<00:00:31.740> his<00:00:31.920> hands<00:00:32.309> we're

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
to look at how Ian hides his hands we're

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.549 
to look at how Ian hides his hands we're
going<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> look<00:00:32.759> at<00:00:32.880> his<00:00:33.000> front<00:00:33.719> elbow<00:00:33.960> then

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
going to look at his front elbow then

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.380 
going to look at his front elbow then
we're<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> look<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.100> how<00:00:35.219> Robinson<00:00:36.180> Cano

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
we're going to look at how Robinson Cano

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.970 
we're going to look at how Robinson Cano
is<00:00:36.450> baseball<00:00:36.899> hitting<00:00:37.050> mechanics<00:00:37.230> how<00:00:37.800> they

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
is baseball hitting mechanics how they

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.459 
is baseball hitting mechanics how they
fare<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.610> we're<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:40.170> Ian

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
fare and we're going to get what Ian

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.229 
fare and we're going to get what Ian
needs<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> work<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.100> make<00:00:41.790> his<00:00:41.969> baseball

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
needs to work on make his baseball

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.330 
needs to work on make his baseball
hitting<00:00:42.600> mechanics<00:00:42.690> better<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.980> let's<00:00:44.190> take<00:00:44.309> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
hitting mechanics better so let's take a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.910 
hitting mechanics better so let's take a
look<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.789> Ian's<00:00:45.149> swing<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.170> slow<00:00:46.500> motion

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
look at Ian's swing one in slow motion

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.389 
look at Ian's swing one in slow motion
here<00:00:48.320> as<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.590> see<00:00:49.739> his<00:00:49.860> footwork<00:00:50.219> is

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
here as you can see his footwork is

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.920 
here as you can see his footwork is
actually<00:00:50.700> pretty<00:00:50.910> good<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:51.629> why<00:00:51.750> we're

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
actually pretty good that's why we're

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.420 
actually pretty good that's why we're
working<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.320> our<00:00:54.770> catapult<00:00:55.770> loading<00:00:56.070> system

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
working on our catapult loading system

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.410 
working on our catapult loading system
so<00:00:57.030> what<00:00:57.180> you'll<00:00:57.329> see<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> within<00:00:59.420> he's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so what you'll see here is within he's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.630 
so what you'll see here is within he's
doing<00:01:00.690> pretty<00:01:00.870> good<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.829> down<00:01:02.190> shoulder

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
doing pretty good with a down shoulder

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.030 
doing pretty good with a down shoulder
angle<00:01:02.789> has<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:04.170> bit<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.500> solder<00:01:04.769> Haro

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
angle has a little bit of a solder Haro

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.109 
angle has a little bit of a solder Haro
type<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:06.170> type<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> catapult<00:01:07.770> load<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
type of type of catapult load but you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.670 
type of type of catapult load but you
can<00:01:09.270> see<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:09.900> shoulder<00:01:10.229> angle<00:01:10.619> is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
can see that now shoulder angle is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
can see that now shoulder angle is
pretty<00:01:10.860> good<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:11.850> thing<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.210> he's<00:01:12.299> not

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
pretty good the one thing that he's not

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.469 
pretty good the one thing that he's not
doing<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.990> tucking<00:01:13.200> his<00:01:13.470> hands<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.479> towards

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
doing is tucking his hands in towards

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.840 
doing is tucking his hands in towards
his<00:01:15.750> rib<00:01:16.259> cage<00:01:16.500> right<00:01:16.530> under<00:01:17.070> his<00:01:17.189> armpit<00:01:17.700> as

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
his rib cage right under his armpit as

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.580 
his rib cage right under his armpit as
you<00:01:18.330> would<00:01:18.479> see<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> boxer<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.470> they're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you would see a boxer do if they're

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.320 
you would see a boxer do if they're
going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> throw<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> knockout<00:01:20.310> punch<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:21.240> know

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
going to throw a knockout punch you know

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.990 
going to throw a knockout punch you know
see<00:01:21.659> his<00:01:21.869> hands<00:01:22.170> move<00:01:22.439> back<00:01:22.740> any<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.790> just

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
see his hands move back any they just

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.289 
see his hands move back any they just
kind<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.210> stay<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.650> whole<00:01:25.680> time

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
kind of stay there the whole time

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.730 
kind of stay there the whole time
whereas<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.420> need<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.200> because<00:01:28.560> we

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
whereas we need to get that because we

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.100 
whereas we need to get that because we
need<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.070> front<00:01:29.610> shoulder<00:01:30.000> moving<00:01:30.360> down<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
need this front shoulder moving down and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.800 
need this front shoulder moving down and
back<00:01:31.320> towards<00:01:31.680> his<00:01:31.770> back<00:01:31.979> hip<00:01:32.600> now<00:01:33.600> what

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
back towards his back hip now what

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.230 
back towards his back hip now what
happens<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.380> sets<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.950> motion<00:01:35.240> doesn't

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
happens is that sets in motion doesn't

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.140 
happens is that sets in motion doesn't
lock<00:01:36.479> his<00:01:36.630> hands<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.079> enough<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.880> where<00:01:38.909> his

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
lock his hands up enough to where his

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.020 
lock his hands up enough to where his
torso<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:40.070> can<00:01:41.070> chime<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.369> which<00:01:41.759> you'll<00:01:41.909> see

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
torso can can chime in which you'll see

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.749 
torso can can chime in which you'll see
his<00:01:42.150> hands<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.659> drift<00:01:42.930> away<00:01:43.670> see<00:01:44.670> his

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
his hands kind of drift away see his

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.100 
his hands kind of drift away see his
hands<00:01:44.939> drift<00:01:45.240> away<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.780> because<00:01:45.990> they're

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
hands drift away here because they're

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.160 
hands drift away here because they're
not<00:01:46.229> locked<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.420> what'll<00:01:48.420> happen<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
not locked up and what'll happen is is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.560 
not locked up and what'll happen is is
his<00:01:49.770> front<00:01:50.070> elbow<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.490> he<00:01:50.640> comes<00:01:50.850> through<00:01:50.970> will

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
his front elbow as he comes through will

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.350 
his front elbow as he comes through will
be<00:01:52.020> pointing<00:01:52.470> down<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:53.310> isn't<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.880> low<00:01:54.060> pitch

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
be pointing down this isn't a low pitch

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.020 
be pointing down this isn't a low pitch
but<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.470> elbow<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> front<00:01:56.250> elbow<00:01:56.399> sets<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
but the elbow the front elbow sets the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.249 
but the elbow the front elbow sets the
barrel<00:01:57.570> plane<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.280> what<00:01:59.280> you'll<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.700> is

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
barrel plane and what you'll see is

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.690 
barrel plane and what you'll see is
especially<00:02:01.259> right<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.399> elbow

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
especially right here you see is elbow

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.959 
especially right here you see is elbow
really<00:02:02.850> tuck<00:02:03.240> down<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.229> that's<00:02:05.189> happening

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
really tuck down and that's happening

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.910 
really tuck down and that's happening
that<00:02:06.119> motion<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.540> happening<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.200> these<00:02:07.409> two

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
that motion is happening in these two

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.850 
that motion is happening in these two
frames<00:02:08.780> here<00:02:09.780> he's<00:02:10.110> starting<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.410> pull<00:02:10.709> that

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
frames here he's starting to pull that

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.020 
frames here he's starting to pull that
elbow<00:02:11.160> down<00:02:11.510> versus<00:02:12.510> keeping<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
elbow down versus keeping it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.590 
elbow down versus keeping it
up<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:14.310> causes<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.550> really<00:02:16.209> weak<00:02:16.390> position

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
up and causes this really weak position

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.199 
up and causes this really weak position
in<00:02:17.020> his<00:02:17.200> hands<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:18.340> we<00:02:18.400> got<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.640> tuck<00:02:19.030> those

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
in his hands so we got to tuck those

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.600 
in his hands so we got to tuck those
hands<00:02:19.750> at<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.110> start<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.800> then<00:02:21.220> we<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.520> get

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
hands at the start and then we can get

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.260 
hands at the start and then we can get
that<00:02:21.670> elbow<00:02:22.060> up<00:02:22.090> now<00:02:22.780> how<00:02:22.959> does<00:02:24.209> robinson<00:02:25.209> cano

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
that elbow up now how does robinson cano

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.690 
that elbow up now how does robinson cano
do<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.140> here's<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.410> swing<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.370> can<00:02:27.520> see

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
do it so here's a swing that you can see

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.229 
do it so here's a swing that you can see
we'll<00:02:27.940> put<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.240> in<00:02:28.360> slow<00:02:28.600> motion<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.880> can<00:02:31.060> see

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
we'll put it in slow motion you can see

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.990 
we'll put it in slow motion you can see
what<00:02:31.450> he<00:02:31.720> does<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.530> he'll<00:02:32.980> tuck<00:02:33.370> those<00:02:33.550> hands

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
what he does is he'll tuck those hands

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.750 
what he does is he'll tuck those hands
in<00:02:34.150> now<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.020> is<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.620> best<00:02:35.890> view<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.430> can<00:02:36.580> see

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
in now this is the best view you can see

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.040 
in now this is the best view you can see
that<00:02:36.910> from<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.180> front<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:37.600> his<00:02:37.720> hands<00:02:37.930> will

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
that from the front but his hands will

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.479 
that from the front but his hands will
actually<00:02:38.290> disappear<00:02:38.770> from<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.040> pitcher<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
actually disappear from the pitcher the

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.800 
actually disappear from the pitcher the
pitcher<00:02:39.730> won't<00:02:39.910> be<00:02:39.970> able<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.150> see<00:02:40.390> his<00:02:40.540> hands

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
pitcher won't be able to see his hands

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.010 
pitcher won't be able to see his hands
when<00:02:41.050> he<00:02:41.140> goes<00:02:41.319> in<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.650> load<00:02:42.450> I'll<00:02:43.450> stop<00:02:43.840> it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
when he goes in to load I'll stop it

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.780

up then it starts to come down but it's
not<00:03:12.010> as<00:03:12.340> drastic<00:03:12.610> as<00:03:12.970> Ian<00:03:13.300> was<00:03:13.480> doing<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:16.390> you

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
not as drastic as Ian was doing so you

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.400 
not as drastic as Ian was doing so you
go<00:03:16.660> here<00:03:17.049> elbows<00:03:17.590> up<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.510> then<00:03:19.510> he<00:03:19.840> starts<00:03:20.200> to
