00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.920
 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.490
 video of stories told point is where 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.450
 let's teach a problem a failure its 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.950
 life that we have detected a 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.200
 application of outstanding applications 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.150
 nokia surely when you see this video 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.410
 this problem will have been solved already 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.569
 which it is already made known both 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.010
 Nokia and Microsoft to Spain 

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:24.360
 are trying to contact right now 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.890
 with the central network to try 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.170
 solve the problem we do not know very 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.640
 well if the problem is due to the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.140
 Nokia application to the servers of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.700
 nokia or where is exactly what 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.730
 which I have not yet been able to report 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.230
 with details of what the problem is 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.570
 but they are working on their 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.310
 solution 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.190
 let's see for example the search for 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.090
 tuenti which is through which has 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.860
 emerged 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.220
 well it has been revealed better said everything 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.629
 this this security and good 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.400
 as you can see when we look for it 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.230
 in popular does not appear the 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.260
 application but if we go to the more 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.089
 valued 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.050
 to them we have the two applications of 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.090
 tuenti 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.410
 we do not want you to become special 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.760
 illusions regarding these 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.979
 obligations although you already have them 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.300
 installed since what we have 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.229
 understood and it's something that we're still 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.790
 pending confirmation 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.200
 applications are not applications 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.460
 definitive tuenti but they were 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.119
 versions of tests that had their 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.759
 time and they finally ruled out how 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.229
 you can remember enough months ago 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.509
 that tuenti announced his departure to 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.890
 windows phones and finally it's gone 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.619
 and delaying the moment is not yet 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.740
 available in the marketplace this is 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.110
 application that is released on 27 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.580
 June with which are already a few 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.280
 months and there has not been any kind of 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.179
 modification follows a version 10.04 0.0 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.250
 with which according to our sources this 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.250
 application was a discarding of nokia I say 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.640
 forgiveness of tuenti 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.170
 now let's teach how this problem 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.820
 not only affects the applications 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.830
 of the developers that have 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.680
 expected to present and may have in 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.590
 the marketplace singh of form let's say 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.570
 testing in beta form but oil 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.710
 also applications of Nokia of use 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.660
 internal 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.340
 well here we have the popular ones that 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.020
 simply show the applications 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.710
 with the word not that most popular but 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.900
 if we go to more valued 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.980
 we go further down and start to see 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.900
 a series of applications that do not 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.370
 They should appear in these 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.450
 applications for example there we have 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.450
 nokia news 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.860
 nokia news nokia place 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.980
 I do not want that as you can check 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.580
 all many times forgiveness appear with 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.900
 this little icon that says it's for 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.030
 internal use of Nokia this already gives us 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.490
 understand that of course they should not 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.709
 to be able to see or could and should 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.940
 be available in principle many of 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.470
 these applications can not be 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.569
 download gives us directly as that 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.780
 we are not authorized 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.300
 but this is not something 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.150
 let's say they all pass as you can see 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.910
 here we have been able to download the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.400
 Nokia application connect to vic what to 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.890
 me not that 'news and good some 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.390
 more applications that we have tried and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.060
 as seen that indeed yes that 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.920
 you have the option of being able to download them 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.870
 This is a serious security problem 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.830
 which also affects some application 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.830
 from microsoft 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.459
 again we go to the most valued 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.400
 in principle the applications seem 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.810
 normal microsoft 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.950
 but we also started to see 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.950
 applications like this one here 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.980
 lizÃ¡rraga microsoft which is also from 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.840
 Microsoft internal use would not necessarily 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.340
 what to appear on the Mars page good 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.800
 we apologize for not having 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.210
 waited before is this news but 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.660
 we consider that in this case 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.720
 plus the security of applications that 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.130
 the fact of being the first to give them to 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.690
 this new 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.690
 we do not think it takes long in 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.190
 fix it 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.990
 and well this is all we can 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.510
 count to the moment to follow attentive to 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.430
 our website because we are already trying 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.650
 find out what he has been able to 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.420
 happen that whose fault is 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.970
 who is the fault and of all this 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.110
 We will keep you informed through the 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.110
 website greetings
