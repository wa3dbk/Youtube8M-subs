Honda's addressed that for 2013 and 2014

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.120 
Honda's addressed that for 2013 and 2014
but<00:02:22.920> 2012<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.580> absolutely<00:02:25.239> horrible<00:02:26.130> moving

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130

to<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.370> outside<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:28.060> love<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.840> exterior

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
to the outside I love the exterior

to the outside I love the exterior
styling<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.220> car<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.730> was<00:02:30.850> one<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.480> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
styling of this car it was one of the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.020 
styling of this car it was one of the
reasons<00:02:31.989> why<00:02:32.560> I<00:02:32.590> purchased<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.819> actually

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
reasons why I purchased it and actually

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.070 
reasons why I purchased it and actually
liked<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.720> bit<00:02:34.930> better<00:02:35.140> than<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.910> 2013<00:02:36.910> of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
liked it a bit better than the 2013 of

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.740 
liked it a bit better than the 2013 of
2014<00:02:38.080> si<00:02:38.440> sedans<00:02:38.860> because<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:40.209> doesn't<00:02:40.660> have

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
2014 si sedans because it doesn't have

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.720 
2014 si sedans because it doesn't have
the<00:02:40.780> spoiler<00:02:41.470> wing<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.100> back<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.550> one

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
the spoiler wing on the back this one

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.240 
the spoiler wing on the back this one
just<00:02:42.850> has<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.330> al<00:02:43.450> lip<00:02:43.840> spoiler<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:44.650> think<00:02:45.160> it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
just has that al lip spoiler I think it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.670 
just has that al lip spoiler I think it
looks<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.550> lot<00:02:45.670> more<00:02:45.730> classy<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
looks a lot more classy I like the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.770 
looks a lot more classy I like the
17-inch<00:02:48.160> alloys<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.300> car<00:02:49.540> actually

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
17-inch alloys on this car actually

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.350 
17-inch alloys on this car actually
better<00:02:50.440> than<00:02:52.350> 18-inch<00:02:53.350> alloys<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:54.239> 2014<00:02:55.239> I

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
better than 18-inch alloys the 2014 I

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.479 
better than 18-inch alloys the 2014 I
really<00:02:55.810> dislike<00:02:56.290> though<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:56.799> far<00:02:56.829> from<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
really dislike though so far from the

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.880 
really dislike though so far from the
exterior<00:02:57.970> styling<00:02:58.420> perspective<00:02:59.049> loved<00:02:59.769> the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
exterior styling perspective loved the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.460 
exterior styling perspective loved the
car<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.400> got<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:00.970> white<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.600> think<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.079> think<00:03:02.350> it

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
car I got it in white I think I think it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.970 
car I got it in white I think I think it
looks<00:03:02.650> awesome<00:03:04.019> drivability<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.739> first

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
looks awesome drivability the first

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.680 
looks awesome drivability the first
thing<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.250> noticed<00:03:06.640> with<00:03:06.820> this<00:03:06.970> car<00:03:07.299> it's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
thing I noticed with this car it's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.039 
thing I noticed with this car it's
definitely<00:03:08.530> got<00:03:08.709> more<00:03:09.489> torque<00:03:09.970> than<00:03:10.299> I<00:03:10.660> can

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
definitely got more torque than I can

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.039 
definitely got more torque than I can
weight<00:03:11.200> Civic<00:03:11.650> Si<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:12.660> it's<00:03:13.660> kind<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.840> fun

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
weight Civic Si and it's kind of fun

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.470 
weight Civic Si and it's kind of fun
around<00:03:14.320> town<00:03:14.590> having<00:03:15.190> a

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
around town having a

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.430 
around town having a
Tork<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.409> really<00:03:16.739> gets<00:03:17.099> up<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.489> it

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
Tork and that really gets up in it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.960 
Tork and that really gets up in it
it<00:03:19.130> was<00:03:19.280> pretty<00:03:19.460> quickly<00:03:19.730> talked<00:03:20.090> about<00:03:20.420> in

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
it was pretty quickly talked about in

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.170 
it was pretty quickly talked about in
terms<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.210> handling<00:03:24.310> comparable<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.490> my<00:03:25.610> o8<00:03:25.910> so

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
terms of handling comparable to my o8 so

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.170 
terms of handling comparable to my o8 so
I<00:03:26.210> guess<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.720> wasn't<00:03:27.620> blown<00:03:28.250> away<00:03:28.580> when<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:28.910> got

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
I guess I wasn't blown away when I got

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.440 
I guess I wasn't blown away when I got
into<00:03:29.480> this<00:03:29.630> car<00:03:29.930> from<00:03:30.230> do<00:03:30.470> eight<00:03:31.450> overall

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
into this car from do eight overall

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.410 
into this car from do eight overall
drivability<00:03:32.960> quite<00:03:33.620> similar<00:03:34.190> similar<00:03:34.790> clutch

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
drivability quite similar similar clutch

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.160 
drivability quite similar similar clutch
feels<00:03:35.810> similar<00:03:36.490> shifter<00:03:37.490> feel<00:03:37.870> yeah<00:03:38.870> the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
feels similar shifter feel yeah the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.840 
feels similar shifter feel yeah the
biggest<00:03:39.350> difference<00:03:39.860> is<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.340> engine<00:03:40.670> has

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
biggest difference is the engine has

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.090 
biggest difference is the engine has
more<00:03:40.880> torque<00:03:41.420> it's<00:03:41.780> a<00:03:41.870> bit<00:03:42.020> less<00:03:42.260> rubbing<00:03:42.800> so

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
more torque it's a bit less rubbing so

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.720 
more torque it's a bit less rubbing so
maybe<00:03:43.730> not<00:03:44.000> as<00:03:44.150> exciting<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.980> drive<00:03:46.310> but

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
maybe not as exciting to drive but

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.020 
maybe not as exciting to drive but
nonetheless<00:03:47.720> overall<00:03:48.790> probably<00:03:49.790> an

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
nonetheless overall probably an

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.080 
nonetheless overall probably an
improvement<00:03:50.360> in<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.460> drivetrain<00:03:52.460> Burton

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
improvement in the drivetrain Burton

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.510 
improvement in the drivetrain Burton
eight<00:03:53.360> weeks<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.140> guess<00:03:54.350> I'd<00:03:54.590> so<00:03:55.400> that's

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
eight weeks and I guess I'd so that's

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.100 
eight weeks and I guess I'd so that's
kind<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:55.760> been<00:03:55.880> my<00:03:56.060> experience<00:03:56.209> with<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.870> car

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
kind of been my experience with the car

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.110 
kind of been my experience with the car
I<00:03:57.380> haven't<00:03:57.770> really<00:03:57.920> had<00:03:58.070> any<00:03:58.130> issues<00:03:58.760> it's<00:03:59.000> had

I haven't really had any issues it's had

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.600 
I haven't really had any issues it's had
a<00:03:59.150> few<00:03:59.209> rattles<00:03:59.840> in<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.050> dash<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.980> couple<00:04:01.520> of

horrible sounded like a marble rolling

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.440 
horrible sounded like a marble rolling
back<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.740> forth<00:04:06.950> whenever<00:04:07.459> I<00:04:07.640> took<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.970> corner

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
back and forth whenever I took a corner
