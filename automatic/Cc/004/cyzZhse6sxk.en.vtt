00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
order it basically I'm going to dig it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.940 
order it basically I'm going to dig it
up<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.600> then<00:00:42.600> make<00:00:42.930> sure<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.829> little

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
up and then make sure it's it's a little

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.889 
up and then make sure it's it's a little
bit<00:00:44.129> more<00:00:44.370> level<00:00:44.730> because<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
bit more level because it's kind of on a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.830 
bit more level because it's kind of on a
hill<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.840> there

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
hill I don't know if you can see there

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.350 
hill I don't know if you can see there
you<00:00:48.930> go<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.180> do

you go so that's what I'm going to do
and<00:00:52.699> hopefully<00:00:53.699> I'll<00:00:54.570> dig<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:56.250> get<00:00:56.789> rid

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
of all the top lawn because it's kind of

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
of all the top lawn because it's kind of
like<00:00:59.940> mix<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.620> fescue<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.800> all<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.039> other

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
stuff you don't want on a putting green

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.250 
stuff you don't want on a putting green
and<00:01:04.379> I'm<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> hopefully<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:07.049> just

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and I'm just going to hopefully I'm just

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.830 
and I'm just going to hopefully I'm just
going<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.549> real<00:01:08.549> ants<00:01:08.790> keep<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.600> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
going to real ants keep it kind of and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.300 
going to real ants keep it kind of and
also<00:01:10.140> put<00:01:10.500> those<00:01:10.680> up

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
also put those up

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
also put those up
dig<00:01:12.119> those<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.900> sides<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:14.640> edges<00:01:15.439> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
dig those the sides in the edges and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.770 
dig those the sides in the edges and
it's<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> little<00:01:17.820> bit<00:01:18.090> sloped<00:01:18.570> up

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
it's going to be a little bit sloped up

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.080 
it's going to be a little bit sloped up
so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.860> edges<00:01:20.369> will<00:01:20.520> also<00:01:20.790> hold<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so that will edges will also hold the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.660 
so that will edges will also hold the
soil<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.780> bit<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.950> let's<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
soil up a little bit so let's go do it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
soil up a little bit so let's go do it
I<00:01:23.850> own<00:01:24.570> folks<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.080> I've<00:01:25.200> put<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> edging<00:01:26.070> down

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I own folks so I've put the edging down

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.600 
I own folks so I've put the edging down
so<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.180> want<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.860> bottom<00:01:28.860> side<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> little

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so I want the bottom side to be a little

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.690 
so I want the bottom side to be a little
bit<00:01:29.790> higher<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> inside<00:01:31.979> too<00:01:32.130> almost<00:01:32.400> all

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
bit higher and the inside too almost all

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
bit higher and the inside too almost all
the<00:01:32.820> way<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.420> way<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.840> slope<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.500> little

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the way that way I can slope it a little

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.370 
the way that way I can slope it a little
bit<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.909> very<00:01:36.119> slow<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.049> can

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
bit because it's very slow so I can

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.160 
bit because it's very slow so I can
level<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.340> bit<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:39.720> still<00:01:39.960> want<00:01:40.110> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
level out a little bit you still want a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.889 
level out a little bit you still want a
little<00:01:40.320> slope<00:01:40.680> for<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> water<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.329> drain<00:01:42.360> well

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
little slope for the water to drain well

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.230 
little slope for the water to drain well
yeah<00:01:43.860> I'm<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.189> go<00:01:44.310> dig<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> rest<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
yeah I'm going to go dig up the rest of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.499 
yeah I'm going to go dig up the rest of
it<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.600> flatten<00:01:46.350> out<00:01:46.850> perhaps<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it and flatten out perhaps take all the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.069 
it and flatten out perhaps take all the
grass<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:50.030> put<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.149> my<00:01:51.270> compost<00:01:51.720> bin<00:01:51.810> over

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
grass out put in my compost bin over

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.520 
grass out put in my compost bin over

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.270 
and then I'm going to put another three
inches<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.440> garden<00:02:29.370> soil<00:02:29.490> on<00:02:29.730> top<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.200> then

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.550 
put the seeds then I put a light layer
of<00:02:34.320> ass<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:36.170> hopefully<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:38.220> should<00:02:38.940> have

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
of ass and hopefully I should have

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.730 
of ass and hopefully I should have
enough<00:02:40.560> soil<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.490> looks<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.880> do<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.530> that's

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
enough soil it looks like I do so that's

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.170 
enough soil it looks like I do so that's
my<00:02:43.860> goal<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.340> let's<00:02:44.520> see<00:02:44.580> what<00:02:44.700> happens

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140

but I've actually leveled it pretty good
it's<00:03:31.800> not<00:03:32.010> as<00:03:32.220> steep<00:03:32.790> as<00:03:32.970> before<00:03:33.420> as<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.470> can

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650

it's not as steep as before as you can
see<00:03:34.830> this<00:03:34.980> levels<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.489> little<00:03:35.640> bit<00:03:35.880> higher<00:03:36.170> it's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
see this levels a little bit higher it's

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.140 
see this levels a little bit higher it's
just<00:03:37.320> perfect<00:03:37.709> for<00:03:37.769> putty<00:03:38.070> so<00:03:38.820> I'll<00:03:38.910> be<00:03:39.000> back

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
just perfect for putty so I'll be back

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.210 
just perfect for putty so I'll be back
because<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.600> don't<00:03:39.660> know<00:03:39.780> if<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.959> can<00:03:40.110> see<00:03:40.350> see

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
because I don't know if you can see see

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.580 
because I don't know if you can see see

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
that the new green I made is a little

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.120 
that the new green I made is a little
bit<00:03:43.709> less<00:03:44.430> slanted<00:03:44.970> than<00:03:45.120> my<00:03:45.300> yard<00:03:46.290> which<00:03:47.100> is

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
bit less slanted than my yard which is

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.040 
bit less slanted than my yard which is

will<00:06:15.990> go<00:06:16.110> well<00:06:16.320> because<00:06:17.100> I<00:06:17.420> used<00:06:18.420> to<00:06:18.480> work<00:06:18.540> at

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
will go well because I used to work at

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.860 
will go well because I used to work at
the<00:06:18.930> golf<00:06:19.050> course<00:06:19.410> and<00:06:19.710> this<00:06:20.250> is<00:06:20.310> actually

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
the golf course and this is actually

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.550 
the golf course and this is actually
Kentucky<00:06:21.870> bluegrass

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
Kentucky bluegrass

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.970 
Kentucky bluegrass
I<00:06:22.590> grew<00:06:23.100> last<00:06:23.670> couple<00:06:24.300> weeks<00:06:24.330> ago<00:06:24.830> this<00:06:25.830> is

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
I grew last couple weeks ago this is

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.620 
I grew last couple weeks ago this is
actually<00:06:26.310> used<00:06:26.460> for<00:06:26.640> most<00:06:26.820> fairways<00:06:27.270> but<00:06:27.600> uh

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
actually used for most fairways but uh

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.290 
actually used for most fairways but uh
bent<00:06:28.590> grass<00:06:28.770> is<00:06:29.070> the<00:06:29.190> way<00:06:29.310> to<00:06:29.370> go<00:06:29.640> for<00:06:30.030> putting

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
bent grass is the way to go for putting

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.720 
bent grass is the way to go for putting
green<00:06:30.480> so<00:06:30.510> you<00:06:30.690> can't<00:06:30.930> really<00:06:31.110> use<00:06:31.520> blue<00:06:32.520> grass

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
green so you can't really use blue grass

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.600 
green so you can't really use blue grass
is<00:06:32.940> slightly<00:06:33.210> a<00:06:33.390> bigger<00:06:33.720> type

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
is slightly a bigger type

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.600 
is slightly a bigger type
that<00:06:34.759> one's<00:06:34.939> a<00:06:35.060> small<00:06:35.360> small<00:06:35.840> kite<00:06:36.080> anyway<00:06:36.860> let

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
that one's a small small kite anyway let

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.969 
that one's a small small kite anyway let
me<00:06:37.639> go<00:06:37.699> water<00:06:38.000> it<00:06:38.210> it's<00:06:39.050> all<00:06:39.259> done<00:06:39.500> see<00:06:39.919> you
