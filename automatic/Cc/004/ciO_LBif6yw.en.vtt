00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
functions for each one of these keys for

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.090 
functions for each one of these keys for
pressing<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.769> little<00:03:05.040> plus<00:03:05.400> sign<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.860> can

the donkey and here you can specify a
keyboard<00:03:31.769> mapping<00:03:32.160> file<00:03:32.570> which<00:03:33.570> we<00:03:34.170> will

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
keyboard mapping file which we will

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.270 
keyboard mapping file which we will
discuss<00:03:34.560> in<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:36.180> separate<00:03:36.870> tutorial<00:03:37.130> but<00:03:38.130> you

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
discuss in a separate tutorial but you

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520 
discuss in a separate tutorial but you
can<00:03:38.430> have<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> different<00:03:39.000> file<00:03:39.450> for<00:03:39.870> DVD<00:03:40.290> mode

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
can have a different file for DVD mode

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.900 
can have a different file for DVD mode
and<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.829> different<00:03:41.220> file<00:03:41.459> for<00:03:42.239> many<00:03:42.480> mode

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
and a different file for many mode

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.270 
and a different file for many mode
that's<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.180> for<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.840> using<00:03:46.350> zoom<00:03:46.860> player<00:03:47.070> with

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
that's it for the using zoom player with

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.160 
that's it for the using zoom player with
the<00:03:47.370> keyboard<00:03:47.579> tutorial<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.510> hope<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:49.049> have
