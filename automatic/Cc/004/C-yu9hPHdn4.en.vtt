00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.869
 very ordinary that is a little drunk in the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.550
 bottom of the ranking 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.230
 their goal to others this season 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.720
 maybe finished penultimate 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.289
 third think maybe the phoenix 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.090
 from sherbrooke 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.730
 last one it takes at least that ends 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.349

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.340
 two days with the team michael abbott 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.800
 I believe he is always with 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.910
 the team we live them we will lift cooper 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.540
 best player of the team this season 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.379
 to date 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.120
 there is another who is very 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.050
 interesting too type expansion 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.390
 interrupt we will put it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.739
 we want to put olivier leblanc also 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.750
 it takes me absolutely olive leblanc 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.239
 absolutely letters and also this moment it 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.350
 it's a lot of players who are the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.879
 best currently heads 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.050
 posted saint john's sea dogs 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.480
 as you see it's pretty ordinary 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.199
 and seb ogier very good guardian of st 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.760
 that's really all I had 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.729
 say it on it directly from my 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.350
 in love is very happy with him who has 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.430
 besides exceeded good season then we 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.290
 knew it was disturbing in the Bantam 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 the midget foot we talked about the way to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.159
 just in vogue in his life he was very 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.360
 very very dominant there are others also 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.130
 which is not too far from us 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.590
 olivier leblanc defender will require 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.970
 later perhaps because 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.470
 pass your against the young louis leblanc 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.380
 foot tectona second marker of his 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.640
 team being defensive just have that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.350
 would be fun because his last year 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.549
 may say is invited to the camp 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 of julian's equipped canada what they 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.259
 do for him also answers maybe 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.490
 their most recent recruit nathan christmas who 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.979
 is really strong as a choice 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.860
 seventh in total launches or not to 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.030
 Eagles at bay scares at the falls at 15h 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.040
 when was going to run the water while I 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.409
 do not focus check this boom heart and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.049
 where I have no practice and it was 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.820
 so much of the kiosk and we do not know 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.990
 how did I do I 'll never do them 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.640
 because it's impossible that I have 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.950
 managed to agree but wow i'm 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.450
 happy that it starts me a day of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.070
 good foot keys like when he 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.869
 rained in 5th grade little pony title 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.110
 Vitamins afro stone to go the sides 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.009
 it starts a fantastic day 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.950
 was asking for it to move not less 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.140
 excellent is deserved 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.459
 like to pack the go is a fact what 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.450
 here we want to play we want to play Bedie 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.340
 because I do not have much to do 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.290
 his sea dogs now this is only I 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.730
 totally against me I really like 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.080
 better the players a dj than their 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.780
 teams are way too far 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.800
 we see them never played this time we 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.239
 hear that there had been berdos of a 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.950
 time who won memorial cups 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.690
 but for now it's very 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.480
 ordinary sea dogs will be without bag 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.739
 I do not care less about otters of erie than 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.760
 saint john's sea dogs it's not 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.989
 funny because of an obvious lack 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.730
 obviously but it's still crazy 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.410
 so there until the rafts of gaulle the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.720
 big cons small jouy and ordinary but 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.920
 astor the water in the day the week 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.989
 it's normal that I do not really find 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.480
 of match but well the important will be 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.340
 to be a good entertainment for you 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.140
 but for your good wishes it goes wrong you 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:55.819
 rolls real machine car at tent campus 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.410
 or worse if you come you always beautiful 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.810
 the balls so dredge 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.220
 I think that's what's not dead 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.130
 as an indication that I have each time 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.000
 but we know they will not have a beautiful face 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.440
 mess 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.359
 if I kept it I would have done since 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.730
 dark back I do not know if the 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.350
 whistled whistle whistles after when I 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.600
 escaped the poc not after so I'm going 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.410
 not even able to score so try when 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.000
 even I worked a lot or the 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.670

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.350
