00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.860
 how about friends here sarasÃ­n embedded to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.110
 a new video of several fill 4 today 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.000
 I bring a secret that personally is 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.590
 one of the ones that I liked the most 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.240
 this is because it really is 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.010
 awesome more the challenge they will see 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.170
 I want first of all to tell you a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.849
 little that is a megalodon already as its 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.279
 name says it in the title is a 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.199
 giant shark that is a species 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.029
 extinct shark its meaning is 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.369
 large tooth although to my liking it must have 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.010
 have meant something like shark 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.829
 super giant super huge or something like that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.350
 because this shocking friends right now 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.969
 they will see how I repeat and good before 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 that I do not want to tell you anything I want 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.600
 tell you a little about the history of everything 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.399
 this because I think it's interesting not 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.430
 Just show them how they can do it 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.260
 and bring them from gameplay of these fate 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.690
 also a little bit behind 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.550
 all this so all this started does 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 some months when a guy who does 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 videos only from varela 4 like that 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.059
 he put his head in there was a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.550
 megalodon even made a video about 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.830
 theories about it literally what 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.510
 only thing that was missing was finding it but 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.490
 back then there were not many maps 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.409
 where a shark like that could appear 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.439
 that recently when the ad fil is worth 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.719
 the strike if you are made 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.210
 think a little neiva strike gives us the 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.549
 idea of â€‹â€‹maps in the water was when 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.530
 he said surely the shark is going to be 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.719
 on these maps and I have a theory about 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.549
 how did you find it if you were 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.719
 they fix here we are on the map today that 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.250
 I thought about the tutorial in addition 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.469
 I quickly told them that we are in 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.359
 the strike spots map and here I am 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.189
 just in the buoy where the 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.159
 shark and if you notice they have a 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.229
 alert that says shark alert but 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.539
 The most interesting thing of all is that no 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.060
 another map anywhere else in this 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.590
 same map there is a buoy and if you 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.689
 they think when you are the sea 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.640
 and they see a buoy, it's usually because 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.039
 there is danger in some way I think that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.799
 this was what alerted jack franks to 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.899
 say surely this is where that 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.700
 shark and now let's see how you 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.020
 we do to activate it 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.459
 then now yes friends I'm going to 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.770
 teach them the tutorial so they can 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.509
 activate this interest that is actually 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 very simple although I will not lie to them 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.769
 in its complicated parts to me they are going to 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.629
 see why the first step is to have the 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.459
 black strike map package that 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.260
 currently only available 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.060
 for premium but 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.709
 the question of a week maybe less 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.319
 so that it is available to all as 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.209
 dlc the second step is to enter a 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.209
 server on the map of strike boats 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.530
 can be in conquest the assault or in 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.209
 any game mode that you 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.290
 want though I recommend you to be 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.569
 conquest because there will be more 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.909
 players after this we have to 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.579
 get 9 more people you and 9 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.260
 more for them to be 10 and they have to go to 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.730
 swim around the buoy I think not 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.709
 there is lost because it is the only one 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.709
 as I told you a while ago and is the one 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.209
 is between a and b in conquest and therefore 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.940
 it's basically the only thing that's needed 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.769
 to be able to make this super come out 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.959
 super shark to me I really loved it 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.329
 well what do you think 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.540
 the only bad thing as I told you a while ago 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.549
 to do this is that good and good 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.799
 bad the good thing is that right now it is 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.150
 something that many people want to do is very 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.069
 likely that even if you do not have 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.109
 many friends just mess with a 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.730
 server on this map and go to 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.920
 find doing this and it's going to be a lot 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.470
 easier for you to see it the 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.639
 negative part is that just as there are people 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.829
 who wants to help there are people who want 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.310
 hurt and will not let them 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.500
 it's just going to be killing and killing 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.989
 and then it 's the negative part outside of 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.670
 this seems to me that this instrument is 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.190
 of the most incredible that say all my 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.660
 life and in you for the time being I 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.000
 dismissal I hope you liked this 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.250
 video if it was like that I would appreciate them very much 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.260
 friends who share the video with their 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.580
 friends or with whom you want to share it 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.680
 but at least share it with 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.830
 someone to support me with a like 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.330
 because that helps me too and also 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.550
 thank you for your good wishes for me 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.860
 recovery I am reading your messages 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.050
 on twitter on facebook on xbox something 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.610
 wonderful so I thank you 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.060
 we see in the next video and until the 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.510
 next 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.510
 bye
