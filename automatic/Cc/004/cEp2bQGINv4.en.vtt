00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello I take you today in 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.189
 the universe of cosmetics with sandrine 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.630
 lambard who is a fan of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.860
 beauty and that will show us everything from 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.480
 following how to make an oil 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.009
 capillaries to make your hair 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.900
 even prettier then he the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.840
 capillary to my shampoo that will help 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.660
 your hair to be more beautiful more 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.170
 brilliant and especially to feed your 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.359
 tips 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.660
 avoid putting on the root 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.699
 but of course all let go of the book and in 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.679
 particular insisted on the spikes 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.050
 it will save you or at least reduce 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.870
 clearly forked hair then 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.290
 for that I took only oils well 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.140
 heard that are good for the hair 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.610
 but you can of course these 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.200
 al assad oils be a mixture but 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.989
 you can very well take one 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.270
 for example and you apply it on 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.250
 your scalp and do like that a 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.680
 pre- shampoo mask just with a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.050
 only life I decided to put in 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.820
 fractionated coconut oil then 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.670
 the fractionated coconut oil is going to be 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.650
 a liquid oil 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.340
 so here you go find in store 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.250
 food of coconut oil as 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.189
 it's solid so who will have to put 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.689
 underwater to melt and be able to 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.310
 use your coconut oil 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.270
 I use coconut oil 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.220
 fractional which so is already liquid the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.950
 next I will use oil from 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.659
 castor borage oil bio 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.320
 organic olive oil of almond oil 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.710
 sweet and then I decided to integrate 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.409
 just to please the monoi I 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.689
 decided to take a container of his 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.729
 minister because it's just my 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.560
 notice the right size since all that 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.490
 is home better to make a 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.180
 small quantity 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.549
 if only for conservation and 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.770
 then a small measuring cup that goes to me 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.049
 allow to correctly dose all 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 the oils then normally nothing none 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.909
 danger on his oils what I 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.100
 always advises including for this 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.500
 type of 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.560
 mills and do a test in the crease of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.939
 your elbow for 24 to 48 hours if 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.800
 you have a reaction 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.980
 in this case do not use the product 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.120
 is thrown on May 2nd the if you do not have 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.010
 of reaction that's from you can 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.750
 use it without any problem and that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.550
 it's good for the hair 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.510
 or for the skin so there it is always necessary 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.730
 disinfect everything 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.250
 i will start with infected my 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.090
 plan of work then hands and then 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.620
 my little graduated open bottle and there 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.030
 we will be able to start making a 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.650
 other oil mixture there is no age 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.230
 or in what are really matters 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.610
 first so there is no danger by 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.319
 relative to dosages I will start 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.920
 by my split coconut oil I 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.920
 20 milliliters 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.810
 see them very gently 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.190
 so the monoi it freezes to some 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.930
 temperature so to use it the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.190
 see them freeze in his bottle for 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:02.140
 use it he'll have to pass him 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:06.430
 in shock and put 10 ministers 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.380
 I will add my sweet almond oil 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.720
 I will also put 10 mm I'm going 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.370
 now take my olive oil 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.110
 10min to be also and there we see 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.860
 that we come to half of our 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.109
 preparation 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.140
 we get to 50 milliliters I'm going 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:23.180
 take my castor oil and there I 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.070
 so take him half so 25 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.310
 milliliters and in finland lendl 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.620
 borage and I will finish like that 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.060
 my oil preparation then 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.720
 now it remains more than 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.920
 the oil in their little bottles and 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.900
 to pour the preparation 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.930
 so now for conservation 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.910
 as these two oils must be added 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.120

 several weeks so here we have a 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.220
 oil that can be that can be 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.070
 used as is 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.420
