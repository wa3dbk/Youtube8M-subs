00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:26.589 
saw a video similar to this I figured I

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.339 
saw a video similar to this I figured I
do<00:00:26.650> one<00:00:26.859> myself

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
do one myself

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.580 
do one myself
alright<00:00:29.349> but<00:00:29.679> again<00:00:29.919> so<00:00:30.989> contest<00:00:31.989> first<00:00:32.259> one

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
alright but again so contest first one

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.750 
alright but again so contest first one
it'll<00:00:32.950> be<00:00:32.980> a<00:00:33.070> little<00:00:33.310> harder<00:00:33.520> because<00:00:33.550> you're

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
it'll be a little harder because you're

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.950 
it'll be a little harder because you're
going<00:00:33.850> to<00:00:33.910> actually<00:00:34.030> have<00:00:34.239> cones<00:00:34.510> out<00:00:34.720> you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
going to actually have cones out you

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.930 
going to actually have cones out you
know<00:00:35.050> they're<00:00:35.230> like<00:00:35.320> maybe<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:35.980> foot<00:00:36.340> high

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
know they're like maybe a foot high

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.610 
know they're like maybe a foot high
maybe<00:00:37.420> a<00:00:37.510> little<00:00:37.629> bit<00:00:37.809> maybe<00:00:38.199> a<00:00:38.350> little<00:00:38.469> bit

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
maybe a little bit maybe a little bit

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.060 
maybe a little bit maybe a little bit
taller<00:00:38.769> so<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:39.730> makes<00:00:39.910> it<00:00:40.000> feel<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.269> lot<00:00:40.480> more

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
taller so it makes it feel a lot more

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.400 
taller so it makes it feel a lot more
space<00:00:42.070> than<00:00:42.100> than<00:00:42.489> when<00:00:42.579> it<00:00:42.670> really<00:00:42.879> is<00:00:43.289> so<00:00:44.289> the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
space than than when it really is so the

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.560 
space than than when it really is so the
cone<00:00:44.620> test<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.219> then<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:45.730> turn<00:00:46.059> however<00:00:46.480> you

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
cone test and then you turn however you

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.329 
cone test and then you turn however you
want<00:00:46.780> but<00:00:47.109> make<00:00:47.320> sure<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:47.649> stop<00:00:47.980> in<00:00:48.309> that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
want but make sure you stop in that

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.729 
want but make sure you stop in that
yellow<00:00:48.699> box<00:00:49.570> right<00:00:49.899> there<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.170> rectangle

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
yellow box right there that rectangle

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.770 
yellow box right there that rectangle
and<00:00:50.890> then<00:00:51.670> you're<00:00:51.820> going<00:00:51.910> to<00:00:52.000> come<00:00:52.179> around<00:00:52.329> and

and then you're going to come around and

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.479 
and then you're going to come around and
you're<00:00:53.260> going<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.440> go<00:00:53.530> up<00:00:53.620> on<00:00:53.800> this<00:00:53.980> tee<00:00:54.219> right

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489

you're going to go up on this tee right
here<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.059> then<00:00:55.660> you're<00:00:55.749> going<00:00:55.839> to<00:00:55.899> do<00:00:56.109> the<00:00:56.230> 90

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
here and then you're going to do the 90

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.979 
here and then you're going to do the 90
degree<00:00:56.739> turn<00:00:57.039> and<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:58.660> you're<00:00:58.839> going<00:00:58.929> to

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
degree turn and then you're going to

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.430 
degree turn and then you're going to
turn<00:00:59.140> inside<00:00:59.379> that<00:00:59.710> box

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
to turn around in that box stopping that

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.770 
to turn around in that box stopping that
line<00:01:10.370> again<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:10.850> then<00:01:11.090> you're<00:01:11.480> going<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.660> come

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
line again and then you're going to come

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.530 
line again and then you're going to come

going<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.690> do<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.400> breaking<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:16.610> then<00:01:16.790> the

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
going to do the breaking and then the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.970 
going to do the breaking and then the
weaving<00:01:17.300> so<00:01:17.810> one<00:01:18.020> more<00:01:18.200> time<00:01:18.230> I'm<00:01:18.680> not<00:01:18.830> going

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
weaving so one more time I'm not going

00:01:18.980 --> 00:03:08.559 
weaving so one more time I'm not going
to<00:01:19.070> talk<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:19.430> time<00:01:19.640> I'm<00:01:19.790> going<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:19.970> focus

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.280 

all<00:03:09.569> right<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.950> that's<00:03:11.160> pretty<00:03:11.430> much<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:12.290> I'm

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
all right so that's pretty much it I'm

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.500 
all right so that's pretty much it I'm
rusty<00:03:13.890> again<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.760> sound<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.180> came<00:03:15.390> out

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
rusty again it sound like I came out

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.390 
rusty again it sound like I came out
here<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.780> practiced<00:03:16.379> so<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.560> looked<00:03:16.830> good<00:03:17.040> I

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
here and practiced so I looked good I

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.770 
here and practiced so I looked good I
wanted<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.569> look<00:03:18.690> real<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.319> it<00:03:19.590> was<00:03:20.300> as<00:03:21.300> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
wanted to look real and it was as you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.050 
wanted to look real and it was as you
can<00:03:21.900> see<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.080> wasn't<00:03:22.410> great<00:03:22.739> at<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:23.700> I

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
can see I wasn't great at it but I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.540 
can see I wasn't great at it but I
wasn't<00:03:24.900> terrible<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.620> think<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.040> last<00:03:26.280> time

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
wasn't terrible I think that last time

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.620 
wasn't terrible I think that last time
right<00:03:26.730> there<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:26.970> definitely<00:03:27.480> would<00:03:27.599> have

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
right there I definitely would have

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.990 
right there I definitely would have
passed<00:03:27.930> my<00:03:28.769> they'd<00:03:29.010> gotten<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.280> point<00:03:29.550> off<00:03:29.700> here

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
passed my they'd gotten a point off here

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.070 
passed my they'd gotten a point off here
too<00:03:31.700> maybe<00:03:32.700> because<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.360> weaved<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.810> little

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
too maybe because I weaved a little

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.589 
too maybe because I weaved a little
early<00:03:34.380> on<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.590> last<00:03:34.890> one<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.580> always<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.540> I

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
early on the last one I always do that I

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.259 
early on the last one I always do that I
don't<00:03:37.140> know<00:03:37.319> why<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:40.370> almost<00:03:41.370> put<00:03:41.940> my<00:03:42.060> foot

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
don't know why and I almost put my foot
