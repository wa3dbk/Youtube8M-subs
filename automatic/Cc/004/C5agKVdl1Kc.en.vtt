 coccyx in general many of us know that 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.700
 originally someone appeared as a map 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:42.110

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.870

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:58.489
 one of strife I mean aus enough 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.740
 the team was four people each 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.580
 there was no character pumping but 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.560
 the graphics were 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.670
 and proper sulphide warcraft 3 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.050
 domination of chaos 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.990
 all was immediately moved 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.000

 ice throne l issues dota 2 card 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.280

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.810
 the number of gods and loading which 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.390
 lasted about eternity shorter than dota 2 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.960
 no one drove further for the card took 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.670
 green for 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.220
 just with his arrival on the map 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.229
 rashan appears by the way the beast was named 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.509
 in honor of the bowling ball itself 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.929
 the card has gained enough popularity 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.240
 Japan began to hold whole tournaments 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.369
 2005 for the card is taken aysfrog he 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.009
 made a huge amount of change and 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.220
 improvements completely redone vader and 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.170
 add the famous invoker to the game 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.360
 Further Valve already taken up the case 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.360
 which is under the guidance of icefrog from 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.700
 just cards make a full game 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.610
 originally dota was supposed to be called 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.480
 dota allstar just blizzard it's late 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.670
 realized 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.010
 We managed to break the copyright on it 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.110
 title but always for name 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.110
 There is a time-tested option and 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.180
 gone-gone millions of tournament players 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.549
 world tournaments the best game of the century so 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.500
 further shorter what will be next 100 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.360
 only time will tell 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.040
 the information was much more just hers 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.110
 it was so dead that I had to 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.790
 make it all the most important and so 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.920
 say give you a maximum of a minimum 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.980
 time and finally I would like to tell 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.569
 interesting fact the aforementioned icefrog 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.519
 only panic is known 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.129

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.549
