00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
like internal organs but you don't see

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.090 
like internal organs but you don't see
any<00:03:19.090> external<00:03:19.660> wounds<00:03:20.140> going<00:03:20.620> on<00:03:20.739> so<00:03:20.920> there's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
any external wounds going on so there's

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.010 
any external wounds going on so there's
like<00:03:21.310> no<00:03:21.520> external<00:03:21.970> wounds<00:03:22.330> but<00:03:22.780> all<00:03:22.900> the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
like no external wounds but all the

like no external wounds but all the
internal<00:03:23.560> stuff<00:03:23.860> it<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:24.070> looks<00:03:24.730> like<00:03:24.820> your

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
internal stuff it just looks like your

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.820 
internal stuff it just looks like your
insides<00:03:25.420> are<00:03:25.600> being<00:03:25.690> scrambled<00:03:26.380> by<00:03:26.800> a

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
insides are being scrambled by a

freaking<00:03:27.310> night<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.520> guess<00:03:27.820> a<00:03:27.850> butcher<00:03:28.360> or

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.670 
freaking night I guess a butcher or
something<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.900> don't<00:03:29.170> know<00:03:29.380> how<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.560> describe

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
something I don't know how to describe

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.370 
something I don't know how to describe
that<00:03:30.070> besides<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.550> but<00:03:31.300> yeah<00:03:31.810> Dolphy's

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
that besides that but yeah Dolphy's

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.340 
that besides that but yeah Dolphy's
organs<00:03:32.860> got<00:03:33.070> destroyed<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:34.350> supposedly

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
organs got destroyed and supposedly

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.229 
organs got destroyed and supposedly
Dolphy<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.280> middle<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.550> chapter<00:03:37.000> said

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
Dolphy in the middle of chapter said

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.479 
Dolphy in the middle of chapter said
like<00:03:37.390> oh<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.570> can<00:03:37.989> use<00:03:38.170> my<00:03:38.200> strings<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.100> I'm

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
like oh I can use my strings and I'm

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.250 
like oh I can use my strings and I'm
just<00:03:39.670> like<00:03:39.760> stitching<00:03:40.300> back<00:03:40.480> up<00:03:40.660> my<00:03:40.780> organs<00:03:41.140> is

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
just like stitching back up my organs is

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.780 
just like stitching back up my organs is
that<00:03:41.440> really<00:03:41.800> a<00:03:41.830> hundred<00:03:41.920> percent<00:03:42.250> healing

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
that really a hundred percent healing

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.640 
that really a hundred percent healing
he's<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.120> just<00:03:43.600> stitching<00:03:43.840> his<00:03:44.140> body<00:03:44.380> back

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
he's like just stitching his body back

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.840 
he's like just stitching his body back
together<00:03:45.040> with<00:03:45.250> their<00:03:45.340> strengths<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:45.730> it

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
together with their strengths and it

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.750 
together with their strengths and it
kind<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.420> makes<00:03:47.230> sense<00:03:47.590> if<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.280> think<00:03:48.310> about<00:03:48.610> I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
kind of makes sense if you think about I

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.820 
kind of makes sense if you think about I
mean<00:03:48.850> he<00:03:49.090> is<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.270> string<00:03:49.780> user<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.200> string<00:03:50.590> string

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
mean he is a string user a string string

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.760 
mean he is a string user a string string
user<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.880> yeah<00:03:52.570> I<00:03:52.600> mean<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.320> makes<00:03:53.620> sense

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
user and so yeah I mean it makes sense

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.260 
user and so yeah I mean it makes sense
how<00:03:54.130> you'd<00:03:54.340> be<00:03:54.459> able<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:54.670> stitch<00:03:54.910> yourself

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
how you'd be able to stitch yourself

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.210 
how you'd be able to stitch yourself
back<00:03:55.480> up<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.989> mean<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.380> know<00:03:56.500> how<00:03:56.770> some<00:03:57.070> would

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
back up I mean I know how some would

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.760 
back up I mean I know how some would
have<00:03:57.430> issues<00:03:58.000> with<00:03:58.239> Dolphy<00:03:58.720> doing<00:03:59.440> that<00:03:59.560> type

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
have issues with Dolphy doing that type

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.170 
have issues with Dolphy doing that type
of<00:03:59.800> operation<00:04:00.310> or<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.670> know<00:04:00.790> healing

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
of operation or you know healing

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.400 
of operation or you know healing
yourself<00:04:01.239> kind<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.900> with<00:04:02.080> you<00:04:02.170> know<00:04:02.290> he

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
yourself kind of with you know he

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.140 
yourself kind of with you know he
strings<00:04:02.709> inside<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.130> his<00:04:03.250> body<00:04:03.280> but<00:04:03.910> we<00:04:04.030> have

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
strings inside of his body but we have

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.870 
strings inside of his body but we have
to<00:04:04.239> figure<00:04:04.420> he<00:04:04.720> is<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.260> stream<00:04:05.590> user<00:04:05.830> in<00:04:06.250> he<00:04:06.700> can

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
to figure he is a stream user in he can

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.449 
to figure he is a stream user in he can
do<00:04:07.120> stuff<00:04:07.360> like<00:04:07.480> that<00:04:07.660> so<00:04:08.200> i<00:04:08.500> guess<00:04:08.980> i<00:04:09.190> can<00:04:09.340> look

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
do stuff like that so i guess i can look

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.930 
do stuff like that so i guess i can look
past<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:10.000> but<00:04:10.780> I'm<00:04:11.050> glad<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.550> wall<00:04:12.550> did<00:04:12.880> a

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
past that but I'm glad that wall did a

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.030 
past that but I'm glad that wall did a
lot<00:04:13.150> of<00:04:13.180> damage<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.660> Dolphy<00:04:14.230> like<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:14.620> mean<00:04:14.800> he

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
lot of damage to Dolphy like I mean he

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.349

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
was just that big so yeah that's

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.879 
was just that big so yeah that's
also<00:05:21.669> how<00:05:21.879> almost<00:05:22.810> able<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.199> do<00:05:23.349> all<00:05:23.620> these

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
also how almost able to do all these

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.010 
also how almost able to do all these
things<00:05:23.949> so<00:05:24.819> regardless<00:05:25.300> of<00:05:25.509> that<00:05:25.539> that<00:05:25.900> is

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
things so regardless of that that is

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.959 
things so regardless of that that is
pretty<00:05:26.229> much<00:05:26.439> this<00:05:26.620> chapter<00:05:27.099> of<00:05:27.129> one<00:05:27.610> piece<00:05:27.789> it

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
pretty much this chapter of one piece it

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.820 
pretty much this chapter of one piece it
was<00:05:28.060> a<00:05:28.090> good<00:05:28.300> chapter<00:05:28.690> it's<00:05:29.289> not<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:29.589> best

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830

was a good chapter it's not the best
it's<00:05:30.159> definitely<00:05:30.370> not<00:05:30.639> the<00:05:30.759> best<00:05:30.909> trap<00:05:31.120> here

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
it's definitely not the best trap here

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.579 
it's definitely not the best trap here
but<00:05:31.389> there's<00:05:31.509> a<00:05:31.539> good<00:05:31.659> chapter<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.169> ending<00:05:32.469> is

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:32.589 
but there's a good chapter the ending is

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:36.300 
but there's a good chapter the ending is
