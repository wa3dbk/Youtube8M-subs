00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.110 

so<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.439> new<00:00:01.589> controller<00:00:01.979> truly<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.760> very

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
so the new controller truly is a very

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.120 
so the new controller truly is a very
amazing<00:00:03.449> piece<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:03.929> kit<00:00:04.110> because<00:00:04.380> it<00:00:04.710> has<00:00:04.920> a

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
amazing piece of kit because it has a

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.039 
amazing piece of kit because it has a
lot<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.310> simple<00:00:05.910> inputs<00:00:06.270> but<00:00:06.540> when<00:00:06.720> we<00:00:06.839> combine

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
lot of simple inputs but when we combine

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.430 
lot of simple inputs but when we combine
them<00:00:07.350> together<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.980> becomes<00:00:08.099> very<00:00:08.429> very<00:00:08.639> rich

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.499 

we<00:00:13.440> talked<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.309> lot<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.580> developers<00:00:15.120> saw

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
we talked with a lot of developers saw

we talked with a lot of developers saw
what<00:00:15.780> they<00:00:16.020> really<00:00:16.230> want<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.940> what<00:00:17.940> they

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
what they really want and what they

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.660 
what they really want and what they

it actually really helps the flow of the
game<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:20.009> helps<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> intuitiveness<00:01:21.450> of

the whole console most important
arguably<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.470> touchpad<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.520> top<00:01:26.729> of

arguably is this touchpad on the top of

arguably is this touchpad on the top of

the controller touched by these

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
the controller touched by these
multi-touch<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.310> you're<00:01:30.060> able<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.329> have

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
multi-touch and you're able to have

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.819 
multi-touch and you're able to have
touch<00:01:30.689> interactions<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.530> very

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
touch interactions that are very

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.410 
touch interactions that are very
comfortable<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.460> play<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.240> use<00:01:33.329> your

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
thermal you could be freaking freaking

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.039 
thermal you could be freaking freaking
things<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.570> add<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.720> fact

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
things out and then you add the fact

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
things out and then you add the fact
that<00:01:37.110> there's<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.439> speaker<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.040> controller

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
that there's a speaker on the controller

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.800 
that there's a speaker on the controller
it<00:01:39.450> adds<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.990> lot<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.549> dynamic<00:01:41.549> sound<00:01:42.060> when<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
it adds a lot of dynamic sound when you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.440 
it adds a lot of dynamic sound when you
are<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> shooter<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:43.920> example<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> you've

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
are in a shooter for example and you've
