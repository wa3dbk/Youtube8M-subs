00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
format and it was a very young team no

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.020 
format and it was a very young team no
one<00:01:00.110> expected<00:01:00.739> that<00:01:00.800> we<00:01:01.070> would<00:01:01.219> win<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:01.850> we

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
with fire and let's give our best shot

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.219 
with fire and let's give our best shot
because<00:01:10.670> whatever<00:01:11.180> we<00:01:11.450> go<00:01:11.630> onto<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.930> ground

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
because whatever we go onto the ground

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.469 
because whatever we go onto the ground
if<00:01:12.409> we<00:01:12.530> can<00:01:12.740> give<00:01:13.010> our<00:01:13.130> best<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:14.270> rest

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
if we can give our best and the rest

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:15.070

will follow
so<00:01:15.500> I<00:01:15.530> think<00:01:15.710> we<00:01:16.340> played<00:01:16.610> fearless<00:01:17.030> cricket

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
so I think we played fearless cricket

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.149 
so I think we played fearless cricket
that<00:01:17.720> is<00:01:17.840> one<00:01:18.049> thing<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.409> if<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:18.890> play

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
that is one thing and if you play

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.830 
that is one thing and if you play
fearless<00:01:19.640> pickett<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.240> rewards<00:01:20.570> are<00:01:20.689> there

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
fearless pickett the rewards are there

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.289 
fearless pickett the rewards are there
and<00:01:21.049> that's<00:01:21.200> how<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.740> think<00:01:21.950> we've<00:01:22.220> won<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:22.549> t20

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
and that's how I think we've won the t20

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.149 
and that's how I think we've won the t20
inaugural<00:01:23.930> World<00:01:24.110> Cup<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.530> think<00:01:24.979> a<00:01:25.010> lot<00:01:25.130> of

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
one pattern was robbed it's a bug and

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.929
