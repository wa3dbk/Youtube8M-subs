00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.750
 when you want to upload several pictures 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.430
 édgar power point 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.840
 can not do insert 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.709
 p 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:10.529
 image by image no 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.729
 much more practical to put photo album 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:15.969
 disk file 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.969
 you go to our desk case 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.199
 and here we had previously 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.109
 prepared images of gran canaria and a folder all these photos that have 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.919
 what's wrong with it 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.830
 at 2400 per thousand three hundred and one 1 57 - a barbarity 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.130
 wolf 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.320
 800 for 600 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.700
 each of them I remember that being good 800 by 600 thousand by default 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 some its closer weighting for what I know 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.940
 in agreement 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.040
 what we have to do come here and say insert 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.040
 we tell you to create 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.410
 and automatically see that we have it here 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.200
 now we are going strobel blow 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.050
 and we have them and 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.820
 we are going to use this to make a presentation with a 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.790
 let's say an audience and such p facilitates us here to note in each 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.230
 Photography 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.570
 anything that occurs to us 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.660
 put it on p no 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.150
 in the form in the form worksheet but in the form slides where each 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.460
 photo takes the whole screen 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.580
 let's see how you can do that 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.230
 at the time of saving if we tell you to save as 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.230
 powerpoint presentation default format 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.570
 from here 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.740
 and where are we going to save it on the desktop? 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.500
 will have been saved let's check it 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 has been deleted here as some of photography 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.509
 yes however 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.490
 I tell him to save as 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.940
 PowerPoint presentation see that this team does not 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.140
 qinetiq comuna pantallita for slide show says good 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.470
 of the presentation 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.030
 so that it always opens in the presentation view 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.309
 the one above that was ppt which is ppt the power point 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:12.150
 quenching 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.299
 I'm here pp complains power points the law 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.449
 who tested positive 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.219
 because we are going to give it here 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:19.429
 is embroidering 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:21.689
 and we say guard 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.569
 agree one is not going to crush the other 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.519
 because he said hemingway that this one 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.639
 the dt and this 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.869
 points pts let's see it if I give it here 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.029
 what is going to happen that we are going to open 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.029
 the slides that do not occupy the entire screen 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.279
 we'll see 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.489
 it occupies all the screen to me as it happens photograph album 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.279
 we keep giving this agreement 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.680
 pedro díaz that etc to leave and now I give to this other 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.130
 in the nyse 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.500
 some of the same photography but the big difference is that here the 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.749
 tool 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.669
 and here we are going to see 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.549
 the ribbon with all the 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.939
 everywhere 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.939
 the part that has what is the tool itself 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.519
 another interesting thing yes to the qirbi 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.519
 send us a slide show 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:21.869
 and we want to make some change 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:25.789
 that is the possibility unless the document is protected 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.719
 open first what is the tool 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.549
 and once the tenth tool is 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.249
 lopez we locate 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.049
 what is this 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.069
 we can act on the slides that you send us 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.639
 I hope this is from a to
