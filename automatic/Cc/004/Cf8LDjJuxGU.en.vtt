bug which has a unique adjustable cam
system<00:01:12.430> that<00:01:12.970> allows<00:01:13.330> us<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.690> fit<00:01:14.350> this<00:01:14.530> bow<00:01:14.800> to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
system that allows us to fit this bow to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.779 
system that allows us to fit this bow to
anyone<00:01:16.000> from<00:01:16.509> a<00:01:16.600> 19-inch<00:01:17.140> draw<00:01:17.649> to<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.280> 30-inch

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
anyone from a 19-inch draw to a 30-inch

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:19.590 
anyone from a 19-inch draw to a 30-inch
drawer<00:01:19.060> okay

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
drawer okay

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.990 
drawer okay
so<00:01:19.780> realistically<00:01:20.590> all<00:01:20.890> all<00:01:21.430> of<00:01:21.610> us<00:01:21.729> in<00:01:21.910> this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
so realistically all all of us in this

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.210 
so realistically all all of us in this
room<00:01:22.240> could<00:01:22.479> shoot<00:01:22.750> this<00:01:22.960> same<00:01:23.200> bow<00:01:23.500> by

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
room could shoot this same bow by

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.940 
room could shoot this same bow by
changing<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.030> drawl<00:01:25.330> weight<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.710> draw

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
changing the drawl weight and the draw

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.430 
changing the drawl weight and the draw
length<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:27.970> we've<00:01:28.270> taken<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:28.810> measurement<00:01:29.170> of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
length so we've taken a measurement of

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.440 
length so we've taken a measurement of
your<00:01:29.740> draw<00:01:29.950> length<00:01:29.979> and<00:01:30.520> we're<00:01:31.060> gonna<00:01:31.149> set

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
your draw length and we're gonna set

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.440 
your draw length and we're gonna set
this<00:01:31.600> bow<00:01:31.810> at<00:01:31.960> 25<00:01:32.410> inch<00:01:32.649> draw<00:01:32.860> okay<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.610> we've

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
this bow at 25 inch draw okay and we've

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.120 
this bow at 25 inch draw okay and we've
adjusted<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.960> weight<00:01:35.229> down<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.830> a

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
adjusted the weight down to a

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.639 
adjusted the weight down to a
comfortable<00:01:36.580> draw<00:01:37.300> weight<00:01:37.570> after<00:01:38.200> all

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
comfortable draw weight after all

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.499 
comfortable draw weight after all
shooting<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.369> bow<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.729> really<00:01:40.000> not<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.149> strength

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
shooting a bow is really not a strength

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.340 
shooting a bow is really not a strength
contest<00:01:41.080> it's<00:01:41.619> about<00:01:41.920> being<00:01:42.190> comfortable<00:01:42.520> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
contest it's about being comfortable and

is<00:04:01.200> going<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.260> provide<00:04:02.500> adequate<00:04:02.830> clearance

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
is going to provide adequate clearance

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.100 
is going to provide adequate clearance
for<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.550> bowstring<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.390> way<00:04:04.540> we<00:04:04.690> do<00:04:04.870> that

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
for the bowstring and the way we do that

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.290 
for the bowstring and the way we do that
okay<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:06.100> was<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.459> lot<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.850> people<00:04:07.120> make<00:04:07.270> the

okay it was a lot of people make the

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.030 
okay it was a lot of people make the
mistake<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.690> putting<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.200> shoulder<00:04:08.590> up<00:04:08.770> and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
mistake of putting the shoulder up and

into the string okay so what we want to

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.160 
into the string okay so what we want to
do<00:04:11.709> is<00:04:11.890> we<00:04:12.040> want<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.310> set<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.180> shoulder<00:04:13.660> by

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
do is we want to set the shoulder by

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.070 
do is we want to set the shoulder by
pre-drilling<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.980> bow<00:04:15.190> here<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.299> then

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
pre-drilling the bow here and then

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.680 
pre-drilling the bow here and then
rolling<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.680> arm<00:04:17.859> out<00:04:18.190> of<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.430> way<00:04:18.549> okay<00:04:19.270> so

here<00:04:53.530> on<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.740> nose<00:04:53.890> rather<00:04:54.669> than<00:04:54.970> back<00:04:55.180> in

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
here on the nose rather than back in

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
to fit this bow much more closely to the

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.530 
to fit this bow much more closely to the
size<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:05.770> shape<00:05:06.010> of<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.520> archer

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
size and shape of the archer

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.230 
size and shape of the archer
and<00:05:07.630> in<00:05:07.810> doing<00:05:08.050> that<00:05:08.790> these<00:05:09.790> bowls<00:05:10.060> are

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
and in doing that these bowls are

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.360 
and in doing that these bowls are
precision<00:05:10.990> tools<00:05:11.380> they're<00:05:11.650> machines<00:05:12.040> and

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
precision tools they're machines and

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.440 
precision tools they're machines and
they<00:05:13.180> store<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:14.170> same<00:05:14.500> amount<00:05:14.830> of<00:05:14.890> energy

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
they store the same amount of energy

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.290 
they store the same amount of energy
every<00:05:16.450> single<00:05:16.810> shot<00:05:17.380> so<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:18.010> the<00:05:18.730> archer<00:05:19.120> if

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
every single shot so that the archer if

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.530 
every single shot so that the archer if
we<00:05:19.990> complete<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.590> same<00:05:20.800> action<00:05:21.420> during<00:05:22.420> the

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
we complete the same action during the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.660 
we complete the same action during the
shot<00:05:22.810> sequence<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.890> arrow<00:05:24.040> is<00:05:24.190> going<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.430> land

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
shot sequence the arrow is going to land

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.100 
shot sequence the arrow is going to land
in<00:05:24.820> exactly<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.360> same<00:05:25.390> place<00:05:25.720> every<00:05:25.990> time

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
in exactly the same place every time

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.160 
in exactly the same place every time
they're<00:05:26.440> very<00:05:26.470> accurate<00:05:27.250> machines<00:05:28.000> and<00:05:28.900> as

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
they're very accurate machines and as

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.560 
they're very accurate machines and as
we'll<00:05:29.350> see<00:05:29.500> when<00:05:29.650> we<00:05:29.710> get<00:05:29.830> out<00:05:29.950> on<00:05:29.980> the<00:05:30.160> range
