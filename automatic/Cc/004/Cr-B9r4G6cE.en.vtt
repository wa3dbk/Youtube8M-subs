00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 we continue our route we will return to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.080
 vera de moncayo to learn more about 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.760
 near and inside the new museum 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.480
 of the wine of the lands of the field of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.570
 borja 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.790
 susana hello again good afternoon 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.890
 new good morning we are already inside the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.890
 museum of wine and although it may not seem 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.619
 I'm singing and I think it has a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.180
 velvety texture nah yes we 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 we find in the workshop of the senses 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.400
 of the wine museum that is a very 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.180
 novel because here it is allowed to taste the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.280
 came but not live but a little 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 using our senses the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.870
 The sensation is that the wine provokes in the mouth 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.390
 we have transferred them to the human touch and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.700
 here we are singing in our mouth a 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.710
 wine that is velvety a wine that is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.780
 very soft on the mouth, you never notice 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.489
 difference because if I now put the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.350
 hand here what I notice is cold what I 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.449
 would indicate to see if it will look bad that is 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.489
 a young wine exactly the wines 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.770
 mostly young white and pink 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.199
 that soon they will want us very much 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.290
 of being fresh and that feeling of 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.210
 freshness is what can be observed 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.320
 putting your hand in this drawer and so 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.640
 before we commented 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.680
 that there were people visiting the monastery 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.630
 can you imagine how many people 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.970
 which is in the wine museum and here 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
 is this gentleman or where are you from 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.260
 moncayo's novel de veras el moncayo / 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.330
 wine will be understood a bit little to what 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.640
 You think this museum is very good and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.770
 will make you see that you are perceiving I am 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.550
 touching and what is not so that 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.440
 it's a lot of coolness inside and that can 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.170
 indicate that a wine then I have to 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.340
 to drink fresh very fresh 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.229
 Well, enjoy this visit 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.150
 we see that it is very participative perhaps 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.369
 we are in the area where people can 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.430
 the workshop of the senses is where the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.100
 more people can perceive sensations is 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.190
 a wine from a museum of sensations and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.960
 here you can see colors you can 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.410
 also smell 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.110
 the aromas of the wine can touch the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.869
 Tactile sensations of wine people 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.910
 You can can transmit it quite well in 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.520
 this museum and now let's get closer to 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.560
 another one of the areas where it is causing 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.390
 enough excitement and here we have to 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.400
 people who are looking at wine and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.049
 gastronomy someone can tell us with 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.420
 What can a red wine accompany? 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:19.110
 a red wine per quintal doctor only 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.660
 with meat and white instead the bank 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.930
 with scout point with fish they put it 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.180
 here I knew no no I think not that 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.700

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.070
 he explains it to us in a good good icon 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.510
 how many people are like open 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.190
 recently by people had many 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.640
 desire in this month of April we have 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.890
 received about 10,000 visitors then 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.100

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.799
 people of free visits families 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.959
 groups of friends and now midweek is 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.690

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.670
 associations we have already 10,000 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.340
 visits in a month we also see here 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.440
 many young and good people I did not know to 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.790
 na the amount of aromas that can 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.620
 get to have a wine and we have them 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.650

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.420
 we only have 16 are 16 spice 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.030
 in which you can 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.340
 see the aromas of our wines 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.200
 and especially the aromas of 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.050
 our variety of native grape that 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.360
 Grenache flame but that 's what it has 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.870
 Garnacha, as Garnacha has 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.860
 aromas from floral fruity aromas to 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.170
 roses to violets to blackberries to fruits of the 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.620
 forest is a very complex world but 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.420
 real 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.650
 in that wine story here you 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.810
 can participate and what we see is 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.260
 we move the roulette a little bit 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.450
 and effectively ana smells of coffee 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.540
 exactly we can find aromas 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.459
 primary floral fruit aromas 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.860
 proper to the fermentation of wines 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.630
 and more complex aromas product of 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.160
 aging of the wines I am already 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.380
