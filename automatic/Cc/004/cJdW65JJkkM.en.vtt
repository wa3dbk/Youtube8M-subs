we<00:02:30.340> actually<00:02:30.730> have<00:02:30.939> 4<00:02:31.450> miles<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.930> ocean<00:02:32.079> front

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
we actually have 4 miles of ocean front

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.649 
we actually have 4 miles of ocean front
of<00:02:32.590> which<00:02:32.739> -<00:02:32.980> or<00:02:33.129> beaches<00:02:33.519> down<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.480> bottom

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
of which - or beaches down on the bottom

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.869 
of which - or beaches down on the bottom
but<00:02:35.319> we<00:02:35.500> also<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.890> two<00:02:36.069> miles<00:02:36.310> of<00:02:36.549> cliffs

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
but we also have two miles of cliffs

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.670 
but we also have two miles of cliffs
that<00:02:37.120> drop<00:02:37.329> about<00:02:37.569> 300<00:02:38.079> feet<00:02:38.260> into<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.650> ocean

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
that drop about 300 feet into the ocean

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.250 
that drop about 300 feet into the ocean
and<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.939> really<00:02:40.390> makes<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.900> very<00:02:40.989> unique

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
and so that really makes it very unique

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.809 
and so that really makes it very unique
particularly<00:02:41.859> for<00:02:42.129> them<00:02:42.250> from<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.640> golf

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
particularly for them from the golf

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.970 
particularly for them from the golf
course<00:02:43.120> perspective<00:02:43.989> maybe<00:02:44.560> I'll<00:02:44.739> brag<00:02:44.920> a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
course perspective maybe I'll brag a

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.890 
course perspective maybe I'll brag a
little<00:02:45.190> bit<00:02:45.430> but<00:02:45.609> I<00:02:45.639> think<00:02:45.760> we<00:02:46.180> probably<00:02:46.510> are

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
little bit but I think we probably are

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.619 
little bit but I think we probably are
the<00:02:47.109> most<00:02:47.409> outstanding<00:02:47.709> golf<00:02:48.250> course<00:02:48.519> in<00:02:49.480> the

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
the most outstanding golf course in the

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.940 
the most outstanding golf course in the
