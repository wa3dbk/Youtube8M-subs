00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.579
 really good apart you also have to 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 have the blog work mod installed 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.769

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.320
 video of how to install good once 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.390
 installed our recovery to have their 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.509
 files on the sd card we will pass to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.970
 restart we will not restart it and to 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.310
 be able to access the club by molt recovery 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.799
 this one we have to activate three keys the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.899
 key to lock the home key and the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.280
 volume up key all three at the same 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.500
 time at the moment we're 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.240
 restarting I 'm fine first of the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.460
 three keys and we'll see how it enters 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.320
 our recovery already flashed 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.479
 I wait in a moment for the one that leaves 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.490
 samsung logo and after the 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.680
 shandong logo let's let's go 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.470
 the keys and so is 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.390
 we will activate or enter a location 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.020
 our record in this installation is 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.750
 very very easy the truth 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.210
 if they have to do the steps I will 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.860
 I say because otherwise they could have a 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.280
 problem 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.840
 the first west 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.970
 so what we have to do is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.820
 we must dismantle our system we 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.729
 let's go to the last tab remember that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.740
 to raise and lower the boxes is with 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.990
 the volume up and down key 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.439
 let's go to the penultimate dam of monte el 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.289
 storage we select it with the key 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.180
 to block 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.700
 and we show disassembled our 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.670
 system 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.720
 it is not to be in an amount only the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.819
 system an amount and from there we will go to 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.599
 install sip 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.599
 and external to the sdk and we install the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.250
 but here you can see serious lollipop and 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.310
 we give in 10 this one 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.190
 this will start installing what 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.070
 it's seeing all the rom for being a little the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.300

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.760

 installed the rom we will install 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.870
 our from our patch we go to the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.739
 part where we have saved our day 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.390
 which in this case is the external or the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.609
 micro sd that we understand 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.510

 10 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.940
 and it is expected to start installing what 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.940
 what they are told 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.360
 this will not take long anyway 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.950
 for being a bit so I do not move 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.350

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.330
 recoil and we will give in reboot 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.080
 system 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.300
 do not exist or once the system is started 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.380
 we will have to start the logo of 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.850
 sandro and later will have to 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.740
 show the wood animation that has 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.600
 this rom in this case I have the 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.150
 previous the samsung because I already have 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.319
 lump installed spend a little video 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.780
 so that it does not take so long 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.700
 good friend and once installed our 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.189
 rom the moment that we were 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.420
 waiting for everyone here is installing the 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.789
 new operating system is doing 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.130
 some changes never focus well 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.860
 crazy but I do not know why and here we can 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.509
 see the logo that has already changed up 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.070
 the logo is but it can be good 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:28.370
 a bit the video what optimizes all 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.370
 the applications 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.009
 good friends here I bring you the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.039
 small review what is this rom for 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.650
 defect bring the blockage that brings 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.949
 defect the firmware that comes from the factory 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.479
 this this good device that we can 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.310
 find this new rom apart from 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.100
 our bar notifications that is semi 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.590
 transparent and apart it has a few 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.110
 as well as very interesting but in which 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.870
 a little focused fame 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.620
 and also remove the bar from 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.930
 good notifications this is something that I 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.000
 I really like this rom that gives you this 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.310
 animation that when it goes down is that 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.630
 there is no more list if it is like a 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.390
 small a semiaxis of a good oval that 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.160
 another thing brings us by default this rom 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.530
 this a very nice calendar the truth 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.380
 I was reviewing that we can see 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.060
 he tells you blas 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.120
 if you have events or planned this day 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.320
 one other very important thing because I 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.420
 liked were the contacts 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.540
 although you can see it changes a bit the 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.480
 color style 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.550
 another thing that I really liked about this 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.010
 application where we can change the 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.830
 gradient for example in this case I 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.410
 I will use green since the bar moves 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.470
 notifications that another interesting thing 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.100
 brings us this new rum apart from what 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.100
 we already mentioned 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.650
 the messenger the conversations of 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.710
 text message was very father the 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.260
 it's really an animation that I liked not 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.270
 personally 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.780
 another thing brings us this rom I think that 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.350
 would all this good 3 of 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.600
 player musician trailer play music 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:18.600
 and I think this would be everything too 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.950
 have a good new calculator me 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.380
 I think this would be all friends 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.600
