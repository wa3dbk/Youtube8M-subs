so<00:01:55.740> now<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:55.979> telling<00:01:56.280> us<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.549> trigger<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.939> bug

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
so now it's telling us to trigger a bug

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.730 
so now it's telling us to trigger a bug
report<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.750> that's<00:01:57.899> part<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> exploit<00:01:58.680> we

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
report so that's part of the exploit we

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.859 
report so that's part of the exploit we
have<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.979> trigger<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.310> bug<00:01:59.610> report<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.719> by

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
have to trigger a bug report and so by

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.749 
have to trigger a bug report and so by
doing<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.200> all<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.829> do<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.250> hold

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
doing that all we have to do is hold

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.780 
doing that all we have to do is hold
volume<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:03.509> +<00:02:03.810> power<00:02:03.890> Simon<00:02:04.890> simultaneously

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
volume up + power Simon simultaneously

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.479 
volume up + power Simon simultaneously
so<00:02:05.939> these<00:02:06.149> two<00:02:06.329> buttons<00:02:06.509> here<00:02:07.310> we're<00:02:08.310> waiting

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
so these two buttons here we're waiting

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:17.500 
so these two buttons here we're waiting
on<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.789> little<00:02:11.090> vibration<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.360> let's<00:02:12.840> see

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.000 

so<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.690> got<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.840> vibration<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.860> have

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
so if you got that vibration so you have

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.560 
so if you got that vibration so you have
that<00:02:20.130> volume<00:02:20.430> vibration<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.390> then<00:02:21.450> you'll

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
that volume vibration and then you'll

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.690 
that volume vibration and then you'll
have<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> secondary<00:02:22.350> vibration<00:02:23.280> once<00:02:23.490> that's

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
have a secondary vibration once that's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.490 
have a secondary vibration once that's
finished<00:02:23.880> you'll<00:02:24.150> press<00:02:24.360> any<00:02:25.230> key<00:02:25.350> to

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
finished you'll press any key to

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.850 
finished you'll press any key to
continue<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:27.050> is<00:02:28.050> getting<00:02:28.380> rude<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.710> may

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
rebooting our device when it comes back

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.050 
rebooting our device when it comes back
we<00:02:48.300> should<00:02:48.330> have<00:02:48.600> root<00:02:49.290> access<00:02:49.640> with<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> super

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
we should have root access with a super

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.830 
we should have root access with a super
user<00:02:54.740> ok<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:55.800> once<00:02:56.070> we're<00:02:56.250> booted<00:02:56.520> up<00:02:56.750> we'll<00:02:57.750> go

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
user ok so once we're booted up we'll go

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.600 
user ok so once we're booted up we'll go
to<00:02:57.900> our<00:02:58.050> app<00:02:58.200> drawer<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.920> if<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.250> super

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.560 
to our app drawer and see if the super
user<00:02:59.850> application<00:03:00.750> has<00:03:00.960> shown<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:03.270> there

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
user application has shown up and there

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.080 
user application has shown up and there
it<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.810> there's<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.170> super<00:03:04.500> user<00:03:04.680> application

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.190 

so<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.180> next<00:03:09.330> thing<00:03:09.510> we'll<00:03:09.660> do<00:03:09.780> is<00:03:09.810> head<00:03:10.170> to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
so the next thing we'll do is head to

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
the market and download root checker

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.460 
the market and download root checker
just<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.980> double-check<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.640> be<00:03:14.790> sure<00:03:15.470> so

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.300 
we'll go ahead and download and install
root<00:03:18.630> checker<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.590> as<00:03:25.709> soon<00:03:25.860> as<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.100> is

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
root checker and as soon as that is

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.590 
root checker and as soon as that is
finished<00:03:26.820> installing<00:03:27.060> we'll<00:03:27.300> go<00:03:27.360> ahead<00:03:27.510> and

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
finished installing we'll go ahead and

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.850 
finished installing we'll go ahead and
open<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.110> check<00:03:28.500> for<00:03:28.530> root<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:31.500> verify

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
open it and check for root so verify

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.830 
open it and check for root so verify
root<00:03:31.920> access<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.610> there<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.209> have<00:03:33.240> it<00:03:33.450> we
