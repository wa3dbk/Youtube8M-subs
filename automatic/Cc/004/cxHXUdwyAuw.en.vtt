00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
to do one of these at a time because the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.660 
to do one of these at a time because the
waffle<00:00:34.620> iron<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.070> don't<00:00:35.340> think<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.579> big

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
waffle iron I don't think it's big

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.340 
waffle iron I don't think it's big
enough<00:00:35.730> really<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.329> put<00:00:36.540> more<00:00:36.750> than<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:36.930> yeah

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
enough really to put more than one yeah

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
enough really to put more than one yeah
it<00:00:37.500> might<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.910> because<00:00:38.910> i<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> small<00:00:39.540> ones

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
it might be because i got the small ones

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.619 
it might be because i got the small ones
i'm<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> try<00:00:40.110> doing<00:00:40.379> four<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> time<00:00:40.860> i
