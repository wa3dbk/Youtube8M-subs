 british home notebooks best dining experience 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.390
 PCs and notebooks with June 2009 he worked with March 30 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.029
 during three more adibi devices for libya, a few things are groping 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.689
 but we also got five of expectations actually is just okay 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.609
 for both companies 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.150
 you are sitting the second part and that's about 30 and 59 seconds 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.869
 with the swede 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.539
 the three points higher on the 500m the users could 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.010
 actually get there in those thirteen more outside the city in practice 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.560
 can get up to an external hard drive yes year signed the modern 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.390
 her divorce is a lot quicker than beeing than that is the second 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.660
 purpose 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.500
 they are asking questions 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.120
 another writes he already had sixty megabits per second and if you do that 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.690
 want to make big pelvis it is better if he can do it very slow 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.920
 do even better compared to the network 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.320
 And then they finally come now that says Marc Weyts offers three external hard 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.019
 disk a boy's book are more expensive 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.689
 then it now this is a new country variants after a while clearly the same 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.200
 type of disk this is just a normal sata disk is in it and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.369
 all checks in after that sp3 check this is slightly more expensive than the wit week 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.020
 still among those normally bet 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.960
 but the rest remains the same and in particular is in the test results that those 30 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.510
 megabytes per second that dividend guests are the best this is a disk company 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.260
 passed 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.410
 and the left back three specimens under these waters that had been there for years 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.370
 same tendency or with the regular nsb external hard drive and cables 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.240
 are that also fits just in September next season 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.950
 full with old computer off so it's no problem at all 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.820
 actually it will just be a good story if you have a new one now 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.050
 computer would get cheaper says calker's broken hip and knee too 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.579
 to get 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.120
 on a ticket in the stopera 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.270
 painful when 16 stables exist also talks about the sprinter gibril 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.499
 refuse memory stick after changing reason 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:55.870
 in other words, waiting 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.770
 it took a long time to see why on the back of it it was crazy 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.180
 This year, USB left usb standard as a real green issue 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.530
 now the first in sweden is this very much adata to data and mobility 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.899
 trade 5 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.329
 he became that is always everything with that external hard drive also with those two 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.439
 cities you always get the reading speed above 30 megabytes per second 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.749
 not as with all knowledge with all the fastest it is for the limit of part 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:20.889
 from the stock market 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.840
 and with this copy of data coming through was well above the 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.099
 read eighty megabits per second 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.599
 and if you look at the writing speed that goes towards the forty employees 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.790
 Could it be that as the year is the fastest this is writing a messy stitches with 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.059
 writing is something of van twente 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:39.789
 so press writing finally a clear doubling of the staring 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:41.839
 college was nearly three times as fast 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.979
 then we can actually start using it as an internal disk and yes 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.809
 that is also a bit for the eta would also just include software on it 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.279
 can turn what we hope just myspace the job and possible yes well it is 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.109
 It should not be forgotten about the space that is getting bigger 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.489
 this one is a 64 gigabyte with one also in 32 and 36 all not small 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.989
 but it is the title 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.419
 138 euros believe yes that is 100 aggression about the four sisters who taste it 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.700
 to write the right facts they are going to use other things 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.579
 if tripoli look a little ahead the start time put one here and there 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.469
 document and an mp3 file on a usb disk 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.529
 In the time of 16 disappeared in four sessions that shines the complete HD movies 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:20.249
 if it has to 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.189
 on you always put on you and then the legal dispute will die 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.189
 over the number 80 megabits per second with 30 megabytes per second 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.239
 you get used to the transport 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.590
 it is only a disadvantage the space is at three pieces because there is no special 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.329
 a check must go 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.719
 Joop Munsterman must be able to control several bottles at the same time 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.569
 In the meantime, a playful way was to play 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.549
 it's a lot bigger look if you view piece with almost all this is one 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.709
 becoming centerone bit smaller it kinda like going to the very first one 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.819
 to watch the us we were also five big ones that Friday 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.539
 commuters from the past, yes exactly that may be a problem with data 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:59.369
 If the patient is on his way to life, they can now stop because of it 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:03.799
 to make a very little bit because it is the second cycle d66 will be alone 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.709
 but smaller but this is the relationship 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.239
 had to tell and this is the four gigabyte variant year and it has just arrived 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.379
 as large as a transmitter that was also with a wireless keyboard or mouse 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.099
 has delivered yes and that you can just put in your walk and put wpci 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.469
 put 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.409
 gent yes and actually forget about it in the connections 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:24.149
 no one will be surprised there that he was not recovered in time 7 

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:29.159
 questions and ideas work out how has this year significantly increased the closure he 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:34.409
 reiterated that he also said open revive use of 615 euros it is work 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.989
 The big advantage of this format is that it has more small tendons 

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:40.240
 textiles are suddenly just because he 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.360
 nothing stuck this way stop your laptop and that the premiums 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.200
 before it was also pretty sure that it was put in the home it is not yet 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.919
 Lots of loose reunion parties in it as a hopeless being not too far takes place 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.409
 leave it in the top 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:59.110
 year old man from heelsum is this and 0 0 4 van van dater also i know who you are 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.289
 device yes I like the box 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.009
 Lee takes the men out 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.379
 it is actually a nsb i know him just as normal it is the use 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.669
 and he let go a malaysia 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.740
 connection then said when seated is at the connection to I can all 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.979
 applications where we think there are coming for patients with new ones purchased 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.430
 Cristiano Ronaldo has the faster data transfer everything goes to new one 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.879
 scenario sp therefore also as a move outside 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.699
 Can use that thing for the sequel to True Love PC 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.319
 contest no more dialogue to test were maybe not yet state you 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.399
 via the r4 states yes it can be adjusted with a few years so incredibly 

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.199
 funny to begin with 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.490
 and it is also where the product and nahda make work from that if 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.960
 this per foot check is actually for that his successor to marco van 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.080
 bast putin announced the checks from you where you actually do not process 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.360
 now if you look a bit like a comparison with the ministers 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.400
 to agree later everyone vote for spain will also be happy 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.120
 it's a bit on two thirds three quarters of the performance of such 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.139
 a thousand babies more 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.520
 two thirds of the shares ocÃ© bet for in-depth 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.939
 come from what is in numerous intal and then it must have made him 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:13.110
 Another small scoop of Paris Media that his company Vattenfall from as one 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.699
 half via van via 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.909
 and that is to buy a sata in 2000 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:22.300
 and all this also that this device whole book if your nose with three does not connect 

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:25.989
 so much slower first as four sata so adjust late says that can 

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:30.069
 great use on it now have p3 system play fourth trinita interests 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.069
 other system than just clear four sata whistles 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.699
 for around 150 euros 145 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.740
 about as quickly as a rose bet for the x2 also from the eu these four sets 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.559
 gigabyte 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:43.779
 how they put them around 60 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:48.799
 and so yes he blamed Rutte would have been about 3 points ahead of 

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:49.550
 fall 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.360
 midfielder grigoris advantage with it
