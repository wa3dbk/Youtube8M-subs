guessed<00:00:20.259> it's<00:00:20.470> an<00:00:20.590> electric<00:00:21.009> peg<00:00:21.250> winder

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430

this really good video on YouTube by

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this really good video on YouTube by
elixir<00:00:35.140> strings<00:00:35.700> where<00:00:36.700> they<00:00:37.110> described<00:00:38.110> the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
elixir strings where they described the

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.889 
elixir strings where they described the
optimal<00:00:39.340> way<00:00:39.489> to<00:00:39.520> string<00:00:40.030> an<00:00:40.149> acoustic<00:00:40.600> guitar

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
optimal way to string an acoustic guitar

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.950 
optimal way to string an acoustic guitar
also<00:00:41.530> applies<00:00:41.980> to<00:00:42.010> electric<00:00:42.550> and<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:43.750> to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
also applies to electric and really to

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.930 
also applies to electric and really to
do<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.620> need<00:00:44.829> an<00:00:45.129> electric<00:00:45.519> peg<00:00:45.730> winder

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
do it you need an electric peg winder

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.639 
do it you need an electric peg winder
just<00:00:46.329> for<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.780> video<00:00:46.989> just<00:00:47.199> made<00:00:47.410> it<00:00:47.499> look<00:00:47.589> so

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
just for the video just made it look so

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.029 
just for the video just made it look so
easy<00:00:47.980> so<00:00:48.399> I<00:00:48.629> figured<00:00:49.629> I<00:00:49.719> could<00:00:49.749> part<00:00:50.350> with<00:00:50.379> $20

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
easy so I figured I could part with $20

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.919 
easy so I figured I could part with $20
to<00:00:51.190> buy<00:00:51.309> one<00:00:51.550> of<00:00:51.579> these<00:00:51.730> things<00:00:51.789> so<00:00:52.600> let's<00:00:52.780> take

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
to buy one of these things so let's take

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.630 
to buy one of these things so let's take
a<00:00:52.960> look<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.620> it's<00:00:56.769> like<00:00:56.890> this<00:00:57.039> little<00:00:57.309> power

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
a look so it's like this little power

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.540 
a look so it's like this little power

lock on it to lock the the drive which
I'm<00:01:06.970> not<00:01:07.210> sure<00:01:07.420> why<00:01:07.570> that's<00:01:07.840> on<00:01:08.020> there<00:01:08.229> anyway

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950

goes<00:01:19.360> in<00:01:19.630> both<00:01:20.080> directions<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:23.350> one<00:01:23.590> speed

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
goes in both directions it's one speed

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.310 
goes in both directions it's one speed
it's<00:01:24.130> not<00:01:24.220> variable<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.110> know<00:01:26.200> it's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
it's not variable but you know it's

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.660 
it's not variable but you know it's
pretty<00:01:26.470> light<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:27.010> works<00:01:27.220> it<00:01:27.460> moves

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
pretty light and it works it moves

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.910 
pretty light and it works it moves
pretty<00:01:27.820> quick<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.570> I<00:01:28.960> actually<00:01:29.320> used<00:01:29.650> this<00:01:29.770> to

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
pretty quick and I actually used this to

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.120 
pretty quick and I actually used this to
string<00:01:30.190> up<00:01:30.280> my<00:01:30.400> Marten<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:30.990> got<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.110> say<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.410> it

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
string up my Marten and got to say it it

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.730 
string up my Marten and got to say it it
did<00:01:33.370> take<00:01:33.550> less<00:01:33.790> time<00:01:34.060> I<00:01:34.090> was<00:01:34.390> able<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
did take less time I was able to you

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.900 
did take less time I was able to you
know<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:35.980> wasn't<00:01:36.160> turning<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.700> with<00:01:36.790> my

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
know it wasn't turning it with my

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.610 
know it wasn't turning it with my
fingers<00:01:37.270> or<00:01:37.390> using<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.660> peg<00:01:37.840> winder<00:01:38.050> just<00:01:38.470> and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
fingers or using the peg winder just and

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.800 
fingers or using the peg winder just and
also<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.340> was<00:01:39.430> able<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.700> tune<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.330> string<00:01:40.780> it

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
also I was able to tune it to string it

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.750 
also I was able to tune it to string it
the<00:01:40.990> right<00:01:41.140> way<00:01:41.320> which<00:01:41.590> was<00:01:41.740> kind<00:01:41.980> of<00:01:42.010> cool<00:01:42.070> so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
the right way which was kind of cool so

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.100 
the right way which was kind of cool so
how<00:01:42.850> does<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:43.030> work<00:01:43.120> I<00:01:43.480> don't<00:01:43.570> think<00:01:43.690> I<00:01:43.870> really

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
how does it work I don't think I really

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.930 
how does it work I don't think I really
need<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.320> explain<00:01:44.710> this<00:01:44.890> but<00:01:45.160> you<00:01:45.580> know<00:01:45.700> just

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
need to explain this but you know just

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.110 
need to explain this but you know just
in<00:01:46.090> case<00:01:46.150> you<00:01:46.350> haven't<00:01:47.350> figured<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.770> out<00:01:48.120> you

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
in case you haven't figured it out you

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.100 
in case you haven't figured it out you
basically<00:01:49.510> put<00:01:50.230> this<00:01:50.350> on<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.650> peg<00:01:50.860> like<00:01:51.430> that

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
basically put this on the peg like that

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.750 
basically put this on the peg like that
okay<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.260> you<00:01:53.440> basically<00:01:53.920> spin<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.460> like<00:01:54.610> that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
okay and you basically spin it like that

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.440 
okay and you basically spin it like that
that's<00:01:55.060> it

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
that's it

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.450 
that's it
you<00:01:56.380> don't<00:01:56.500> want<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.710> over<00:01:56.860> spin<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.160> obviously

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
you don't want to over spin it obviously
