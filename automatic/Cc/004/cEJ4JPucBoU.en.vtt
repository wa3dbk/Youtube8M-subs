just do the highest and I like to place
the<00:01:56.040> curling<00:01:56.310> iron<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.969> below<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.840> midway

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the curling iron just below the midway

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.499 
the curling iron just below the midway
point<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:59.729> roll<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:01.939> I<00:02:02.939> don't<00:02:03.000> put

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.600 
to hold it there for a few seconds and
then<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.050> kind<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.590> pulse<00:02:10.830> my<00:02:11.099> curling<00:02:11.459> iron

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
then I kind of pulse my curling iron

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.120 
then I kind of pulse my curling iron
down

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
down

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.270 
down
-<00:02:12.730> right<00:02:13.090> before<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.720> gets<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.500> ends<00:02:14.770> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
- right before it gets to the ends so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.680 
- right before it gets to the ends so
right<00:02:15.430> about<00:02:15.610> there<00:02:15.820> so<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.420> ends<00:02:16.600> are

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
right about there so the ends are

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.810 
right about there so the ends are
sticking<00:02:16.990> out<00:02:17.050> just<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.350> touch<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.430> roll<00:02:18.700> it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
sticking out just a touch and I roll it

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.440 
sticking out just a touch and I roll it
back<00:02:19.030> up

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
back up

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.960 
back up
I<00:02:19.480> take<00:02:20.110> hairspray<00:02:20.620> at<00:02:21.100> this<00:02:21.460> point<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:21.910> I

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
I take hairspray at this point and I

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.450 
I take hairspray at this point and I
just<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.870> one<00:02:23.050> little<00:02:23.200> spritz<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:23.890> there<00:02:24.280> like

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
just do one little spritz on there like

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.520 
just do one little spritz on there like
that<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.900> hold<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.260> for

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that and then I like to hold it for

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.240 
that and then I like to hold it for
about<00:02:27.220> eight<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.550> ten<00:02:27.820> seconds<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.920> reason<00:02:30.190> I

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
about eight to ten seconds the reason I

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.830 
about eight to ten seconds the reason I
don't<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.700> ends<00:02:30.940> right<00:02:31.090> away<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.480> because

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
don't do the ends right away is because

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.630 
don't do the ends right away is because
your<00:02:32.230> ends<00:02:32.440> can<00:02:32.590> get<00:02:32.710> fried<00:02:32.950> really<00:02:33.340> easily

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
your ends can get fried really easily

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.270 
your ends can get fried really easily
when<00:02:33.850> you're<00:02:33.970> applying<00:02:34.180> heat<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.510> them<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.280> by

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
when you're applying heat to them and by

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.030 
when you're applying heat to them and by
curling<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.880> up<00:02:37.510> towards<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.080> root<00:02:38.230> first<00:02:38.650> I

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
curling it up towards the root first I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.280 
curling it up towards the root first I
feel<00:02:39.670> like<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:39.970> gives<00:02:40.060> more<00:02:40.360> volume<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:41.020> your

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
feel like it gives more volume to your

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.660 
feel like it gives more volume to your
hair<00:02:41.560> especially<00:02:41.710> if<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.220> have<00:02:42.310> really<00:02:42.460> long

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
hair especially if you have really long

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.070 
hair especially if you have really long
hair<00:02:42.730> like<00:02:43.120> me

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
hair like me

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.590 
hair like me
so<00:02:44.590> anyways<00:02:44.980> then<00:02:45.250> ice<00:02:45.460> then<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.120> unroll<00:02:46.480> it

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
so anyways then ice then I unroll it

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.310 
so anyways then ice then I unroll it
just<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.930> little<00:02:47.050> bit

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
just a little bit

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.650 
just a little bit
I<00:02:47.500> grab<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:48.040> top<00:02:48.430> part<00:02:48.760> here<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.210> I<00:02:49.330> gently

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
I grab the top part here and I gently

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.330 
I grab the top part here and I gently
let<00:02:50.620> go<00:02:50.740> of<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.920> clamp

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
let go of the clamp

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.370 
let go of the clamp
I<00:02:51.400> don't<00:02:51.640> tug<00:02:51.970> at<00:02:52.240> all<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.720> let<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> go<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:55.380> there

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
I don't tug at all I let it go and there

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.760 
I don't tug at all I let it go and there
we<00:02:56.470> go

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
we go

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.410 
we go
left<00:02:56.950> with<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.130> pretty<00:02:57.340> curl<00:02:57.610> just<00:02:57.910> like<00:02:58.030> that

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
left with a pretty curl just like that

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.960 
left with a pretty curl just like that
so<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.200> don't<00:02:59.620> run<00:02:59.980> my<00:03:00.130> fingers<00:03:00.490> through<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.850> at

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
so I don't run my fingers through it at

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.330 
so I don't run my fingers through it at
this<00:03:01.090> point<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.630> just<00:03:01.810> leave<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.170> alone<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.740> place

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
this point I just leave it alone I place

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.980 
this point I just leave it alone I place
it<00:03:03.460> on<00:03:03.520> the<00:03:03.640> back<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.030> then<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.330> go<00:03:04.720> ahead<00:03:04.810> and

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
it on the back and then I go ahead and

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.650 
it on the back and then I go ahead and
just<00:03:05.980> continue<00:03:06.430> doing<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.850> same<00:03:06.880> thing<00:03:07.420> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
just continue doing the same thing and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.420 
just continue doing the same thing and
I'll<00:03:08.020> do<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.350> both<00:03:08.530> sides<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.160> I'll<00:03:09.280> be

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
I'll do that to both sides and I'll be

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.910 
I'll do that to both sides and I'll be
right<00:03:09.580> back<00:03:10.170> okay<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.230> once<00:03:11.560> you're<00:03:11.710> finished
