00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.500
 Sure I'd be trying to throw Lee Voro 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:11.430
 Many as the beginning can corresponding sand yell No. 1 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.410
 Connect the mall 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:18.779
 Next time while Haseya 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.779
 Firmly dancing and throwing in the air 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:31.450
 This time we did the you actually turn the ball just acceptable catch ball 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.450
 While taking it step is always Issu 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:41.530
 I think that most of the rest is a game in particular, but what to say and use 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.530
 I think there are cases where you have to throw 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.530
 This time I'm practicing linkage play by position 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.410
 This time is first 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.360
 Bay Stars 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.360
 Right 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:10.860
 Normal grip Which is you have reversed Attari such the same way as usual grip 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:13.340
 It would be great if you could try to raise your mind as much as possible 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.050
 I think so luxurious 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.810
 Well this pitcher is 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.570
 All Kyushu is 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.740
 Rise up before the rise drop 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.790
 Not all 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:33.680
 It is a little device of this player 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.470
 The angle of the foot is very different, but with the drop 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.700
 the sale of a rise 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.360
 Step width will be changed slightly more 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:52.440
 large de In the case of rise 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:56.370
 In the case of a drop than the step width of the soybean has become minute short discouraging on whether the pair 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:04.120
 When I throw a rise, my grip is firm 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:09.450
 I am raising my arm and throwing it so that I put a finger on the seam and put a rotation near my knee 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:17.480
 Unlike straight, a little body weight 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.480
 Throw it through the arm from the state left behind at a stretch or near the knee 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.720
 Catcher firmly to 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.110
 I think I'm giving instructions 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.930
 At the cut line 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.930
 Hey But it masu do 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.330
