much<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.079> forced<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.670> how<00:02:05.670> many<00:02:05.729> slag

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
much so now be forced to how many slag

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.100 
much so now be forced to how many slag
up<00:02:06.360> 0<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.039> this<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.190> definitely<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.520> good<00:02:08.610> thing

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
up 0 so this is definitely a good thing

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.500 
up 0 so this is definitely a good thing

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to put the shotgun here obviously just

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.890

flying enemies but you know you get an

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.630 
flying enemies but you know you get an
idea<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.470> what<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.519> weapons<00:02:21.790> going<00:02:21.909> to<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:23.640> see

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
idea of what the weapons going to do see

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.979 
idea of what the weapons going to do see
if<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.760> can<00:02:24.879> there<00:02:25.150> we<00:02:25.209> go<00:02:25.299> i<00:02:25.329> can<00:02:25.510> balance<00:02:25.810> it

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
if I can there we go i can balance it

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.170 
if I can there we go i can balance it
off<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.230> wall<00:02:26.379> over<00:02:26.620> there<00:02:27.090> definitely<00:02:28.090> be

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
off the wall over there definitely be

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.339 
off the wall over there definitely be
good<00:02:28.299> for<00:02:28.510> crowd<00:02:28.659> control<00:02:28.689> you<00:02:29.140> know<00:02:29.230> if<00:02:29.290> you

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
good for crowd control you know if you

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.720 
good for crowd control you know if you
shouldn't<00:02:29.620> big<00:02:29.709> crowds<00:02:29.920> probably<00:02:30.280> bounce<00:02:30.549> all

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
shouldn't big crowds probably bounce all

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.030 
shouldn't big crowds probably bounce all
around<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.540> take<00:02:32.409> out<00:02:32.590> more<00:02:32.739> than<00:02:32.829> one<00:02:32.920> enemy
