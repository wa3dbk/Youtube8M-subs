what<00:02:30.840> else<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.200> got<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.739> bought<00:02:32.010> another<00:02:32.340> iphone

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
what else I got I bought another iphone

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.030 
what else I got I bought another iphone
case<00:02:33.120> i<00:02:33.390> really<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.200> look<00:02:34.500> at<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.769> one

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
case i really like a look at this one

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
case i really like a look at this one
this<00:02:35.280> one<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.330> alon<00:02:36.720> form<00:02:37.349> etch<00:02:37.680> case<00:02:38.670> and

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
this one is the alon form etch case and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.780 
this one is the alon form etch case and
I<00:02:39.750> think<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.260> green<00:02:40.560> color<00:02:40.920> they<00:02:41.519> call

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
I think this is a green color they call

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.080 
I think this is a green color they call
it<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.269> chest<00:02:42.780> pattern<00:02:43.489> kind<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.579> looks<00:02:44.760> green

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it the chest pattern kind of looks green

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.420 
it the chest pattern kind of looks green
kind<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.810> looks<00:02:45.959> tan<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.680> can't<00:02:46.980> really<00:02:47.160> make<00:02:47.370> it

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
kind of looks tan I can't really make it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.850 
kind of looks tan I can't really make it
out<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:47.970> it's<00:02:48.660> kind<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.079> leathery<00:02:49.380> feeling

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
out but it's kind of a leathery feeling

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.890 
out but it's kind of a leathery feeling
case<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:50.970> alon<00:02:51.269> form<00:02:51.690> that

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
case and it's just the alon form that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.630 
case and it's just the alon form that
you<00:02:51.959> guys<00:02:52.110> are<00:02:52.290> probably<00:02:52.410> familiar<00:02:53.099> with<00:02:53.370> but

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
you guys are probably familiar with but

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.130

it's<00:02:53.790> got<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.060> checkerboard<00:02:54.480> pattern<00:02:55.049> on

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it's got that checkerboard pattern on

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.479 
it's got that checkerboard pattern on
the<00:02:55.230> back<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.560> really<00:02:55.829> like<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.010> look<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.459> a

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
wasn't the time to get it so decided to

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.940 
wasn't the time to get it so decided to
get<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.310> one<00:03:14.459> for<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> ipod<00:03:15.030> touch<00:03:15.799> like<00:03:16.799> the

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
look of it doesn't come with a holster

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.270 
look of it doesn't come with a holster
like<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.660> one<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:18.989> iphone<00:03:19.350> does<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:19.889> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
like the one for the iphone does but the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.920 
like the one for the iphone does but the
case<00:03:20.519> itself<00:03:20.880> looks<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.329> be<00:03:21.450> pretty<00:03:21.480> similar

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
speakers so you know the headphones are

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.970

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
really that portable these are the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.629 
really that portable these are the
pocket<00:03:52.019> ones<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.470> really<00:03:52.950> loved<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.280> idea<00:03:53.340> of

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
pocket ones I really loved the idea of

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.970 
pocket ones I really loved the idea of
the<00:03:53.790> tangle-free<00:03:54.180> cord<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.349> can't<00:03:55.709> wait<00:03:55.950> to

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
the tangle-free cord so I can't wait to

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.860 
the tangle-free cord so I can't wait to
try<00:03:56.280> these<00:03:56.370> out<00:03:56.669> there<00:03:56.940> obviously<00:03:57.120> much<00:03:57.510> less

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870
