screwdrivers<00:03:19.150> is<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.479> easiest<00:03:19.840> way<00:03:20.109> and<00:03:20.409> then

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
screwdrivers is the easiest way and then

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.149 
screwdrivers is the easiest way and then
you<00:03:21.009> flip<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.489> teeth<00:03:21.729> around<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:23.099> they<00:03:24.099> were

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
you flip the teeth around so they were

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.939 
you flip the teeth around so they were
facing<00:03:24.519> on<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.540> don't<00:03:25.959> know<00:03:26.109> but<00:03:26.349> you<00:03:26.439> just<00:03:26.470> just

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
facing on I don't know but you just just

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:28.860 
facing on I don't know but you just just
flip<00:03:27.159> them<00:03:27.310> around<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.970> then<00:03:28.299> that'll<00:03:28.720> make

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
flip them around and then that'll make

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.679 
flip them around and then that'll make
it<00:03:28.900> for<00:03:29.199> your<00:03:29.319> wheels<00:03:29.530> left<00:03:29.829> side<00:03:30.549> -<00:03:30.849> once<00:03:31.569> you

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
it for your wheels left side - once you

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.649 
it for your wheels left side - once you
do<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:31.919> you<00:03:32.919> slide<00:03:33.340> your<00:03:33.579> cassette<00:03:34.180> you

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
do that you slide your cassette you

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.159 
do that you slide your cassette you
think<00:03:35.169> it<00:03:35.829> should<00:03:36.040> just<00:03:36.069> slide<00:03:36.250> back<00:03:36.699> on<00:03:37.169> then

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
think it should just slide back on then

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.559 
think it should just slide back on then
