present the q5 here why don't you give

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.569 
present the q5 here why don't you give
us<00:00:19.810> a<00:00:19.839> little<00:00:19.960> history<00:00:20.230> of<00:00:20.589> what's<00:00:20.980> led<00:00:21.429> up<00:00:21.550> to

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579 
us a little history of what's led up to

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:22.679 
us a little history of what's led up to
the<00:00:21.849> speakers

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
the speakers

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.329 
the speakers
well<00:00:23.589> we've<00:00:24.519> first<00:00:25.390> built<00:00:25.810> our<00:00:26.650> all-aluminum

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339 
well we've first built our all-aluminum

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.509 
well we've first built our all-aluminum
speakers<00:00:27.789> in<00:00:27.970> 1996<00:00:28.839> so<00:00:29.079> we<00:00:29.380> go<00:00:29.529> way<00:00:29.949> back<00:00:30.130> when

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
speakers in 1996 so we go way back when

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.490 
speakers in 1996 so we go way back when
it<00:00:30.640> comes<00:00:30.849> to<00:00:31.060> designing<00:00:31.899> this<00:00:32.140> kind<00:00:32.410> of

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
it comes to designing this kind of

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.660 
it comes to designing this kind of
product<00:00:33.660> Beck<00:00:34.660> at<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.440> time<00:00:35.680> we<00:00:36.550> were

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
product Beck at the time we were

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
product Beck at the time we were
building<00:00:37.140> one<00:00:38.140> or<00:00:38.350> two<00:00:38.500> offs<00:00:38.710> for<00:00:39.210> custom

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
building one or two offs for custom

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.370 
building one or two offs for custom
application<00:00:41.950> and<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:43.480> was<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.630> very<00:00:43.990> expensive

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
application and it was a very expensive

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.500 
application and it was a very expensive
ordeal<00:00:44.950> to<00:00:45.250> build<00:00:45.460> an<00:00:45.670> enclosure<00:00:45.970> like<00:00:46.150> this

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
ordeal to build an enclosure like this

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.710 
ordeal to build an enclosure like this
with<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:48.000> facilities<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.240> amenities<00:00:49.390> that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
with the facilities and amenities that

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.430 
with the facilities and amenities that
we<00:00:50.020> had<00:00:50.230> back<00:00:50.860> then<00:00:51.630> it<00:00:52.630> was<00:00:52.870> always<00:00:53.050> our<00:00:53.380> goal

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
we had back then it was always our goal

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.130 
we had back then it was always our goal
to<00:00:54.010> eventually<00:00:54.550> arrive<00:00:54.880> at<00:00:54.990> proposition<00:00:55.990> like

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
to eventually arrive at proposition like

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.330 
to eventually arrive at proposition like
that<00:00:56.400> it<00:00:57.400> became<00:00:58.329> available<00:00:58.900> to<00:00:59.079> us<00:00:59.260> last<00:01:00.070> year

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
that it became available to us last year

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.130 
that it became available to us last year
when<00:01:00.579> we<00:01:00.610> finally<00:01:01.270> were<00:01:01.420> in<00:01:01.540> a<00:01:01.600> position<00:01:01.720> to

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
when we finally were in a position to

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.320 
when we finally were in a position to
purchase<00:01:02.320> our<00:01:02.650> own<00:01:02.800> machine<00:01:03.100> shop<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.550> we

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
purchase our own machine shop and we

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.570 
purchase our own machine shop and we
have<00:01:04.360> now<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.809> shop<00:01:05.290> with<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.800> five<00:01:06.070> CNC

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
have now a shop with the five CNC

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.790 
have now a shop with the five CNC
machines<00:01:07.000> that<00:01:07.480> will<00:01:07.720> allow<00:01:07.930> us<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.170> produce<00:01:08.560> a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
machines that will allow us to produce a

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.750 
machines that will allow us to produce a
product<00:01:09.159> like<00:01:09.310> this<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.760> cost

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
product like this at the cost

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.490 
product like this at the cost
effectiveness<00:01:13.300> that<00:01:13.659> were<00:01:13.810> able<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:14.200> do<00:01:14.320> that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
effectiveness that were able to do that

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.969 
effectiveness that were able to do that
it's<00:01:14.800> not<00:01:15.630> an<00:01:16.630> affordable<00:01:17.110> product<00:01:17.530> by<00:01:17.620> domain

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
it's not an affordable product by domain

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.120 
it's not an affordable product by domain
however<00:01:18.430> if<00:01:18.760> we<00:01:19.000> had<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.450> build<00:01:19.840> this<00:01:20.130> under

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
however if we had to build this under

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.780 
however if we had to build this under
the<00:01:21.460> normal<00:01:22.229> way<00:01:23.229> things<00:01:23.860> are<00:01:24.040> done<00:01:24.220> in<00:01:24.550> this

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
the normal way things are done in this

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.430 
the normal way things are done in this
industry<00:01:25.060> which<00:01:25.330> is<00:01:25.479> usually<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:25.990> farm<00:01:26.229> out

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
industry which is usually to farm out

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.219 
industry which is usually to farm out
these<00:01:26.950> kind<00:01:27.250> of<00:01:27.400> production<00:01:28.360> it<00:01:28.960> would<00:01:29.140> have

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
these kind of production it would have

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.469 
these kind of production it would have
been<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.530> lot<00:01:29.799> more<00:01:30.040> expensive<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.940> probably

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
been a lot more expensive and probably

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.130 
been a lot more expensive and probably
impossible<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:32.140> build<00:01:32.680> so<00:01:33.400> this<00:01:33.670> is<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.960> long<00:01:34.960> in

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
impossible to build so this is a long in

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.530 
impossible to build so this is a long in
the<00:01:35.200> making<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.799> we<00:01:36.310> are<00:01:36.610> finally<00:01:36.940> showing<00:01:37.090> it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
the making and we are finally showing it

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.390 
the making and we are finally showing it
and<00:01:37.840> this<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.350> second<00:01:38.710> time<00:01:38.860> in<00:01:39.130> Europe

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
and this is the second time in Europe

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.289 
and this is the second time in Europe
we've<00:01:39.610> shown<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.390> now<00:01:40.570> in<00:01:40.900> Munich<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.640> also<00:01:43.030> in

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
we produce the M and the V lines which

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.930 
we produce the M and the V lines which
were<00:03:52.290> extremely<00:03:52.500> popular<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.400> allowed<00:03:53.670> us<00:03:53.700> to
