00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
looked pretty neat like I thought like

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.790 
looked pretty neat like I thought like
one<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> reasons<00:00:36.570> why<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> wasn't<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.440> eager

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
one of the reasons why I wasn't so eager

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.500 
one of the reasons why I wasn't so eager
to<00:00:37.829> watch<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.399> raid<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.090> because<00:00:39.360> like

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
to watch the raid one it's because like

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.000 
to watch the raid one it's because like
oh<00:00:39.660> they're<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:39.960> climbing<00:00:40.559> up<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.800> building

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
