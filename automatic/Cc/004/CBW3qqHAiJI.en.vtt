00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.960
 to spell started differently we're going to talk about a theme 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.169
 different 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.009
 a subject in which I particularly like very much 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.459
 we will show how the horses are made in the classification of the 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.159
 Brazilian championship accompanies them every Sunday in the fantastic 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.880
 here the art editor the whole globe tv computing 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
 graphic that you see on the world screen is made here in 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.630
 lets go in 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.849
 you may come in 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.699
 I ask Bruno Caesar 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.699
 and here the horses he does not smoke will tell you how 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 filipe vieira nery 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.740
 A little later I change 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 7 I hope the staff like it stays 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.210
 the commission cabaret made the horses sleep championship every round as 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.600
 the one in which the canarians walk there how to mount the castration 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.660
 we wait first 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.010
 of the round 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.809
 people carry punitive 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.480
 given the shape that also lies on the ground 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.170
 and he already spoke 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.170
 with the difference the previous points of each team 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.030
 the fact points of each team 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.360
 mathematically is to redistribute 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.360
 is the fishing lane 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.830
 the horse allows it to stand for 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.330
 tie 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.340
 another team he was walking the march this time she walks by ax here and yes 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.920
 when he wins he still warns her that she was out of the volcker rule 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.830
 opposition tactics trying to manage the distance between them and the 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.840
 distance 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.170
 it's not a math 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.490
 is proportional to the Christian distance 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.360
 in the championship we have there will take a tour of the whole table to see comments 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.320
 with max by him the works are like this 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.400
 in 3d politini smiling 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.520
 but the basis of much simpler way like talking with whom 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.860
 invented the works this way 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.720
 a simpler one 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.740
 up in the air 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.570
 back now 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.570
 his health at the tonon art editor working here 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.960
 and singing one thing 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.960
 that it denies that most of the 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.819
 computers have a nickname 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.459
 pituca and outside 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.459
 was to treat everyone with the name of health care 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.449
 Iran has learned 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:22.849
 I think I have matured 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.149
 Let's talk to him 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.149
 with fernanda it's cool it's pac 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.239
 it was cool 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.799
 if Fernanda 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.180
 the Canada that made the first horses promotion the classification 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.959
 of the Brazilian championship in the Senate 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.329
 This madness started per cent 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.299
 a person who wanted to show here 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.799
 on the return of 9:20 am in cribs unbelievable spots 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.299
 then the idea of 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.780
 while the first agent to have three people was one of the first to become 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:55.140
 complicate the initial idea is that it shows that the difference between them was 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.909
 one of the few to achieve coal support in the 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.359
 the entrance of the favela 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.980
 It makes one of the horses to show us 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.759
 this difference aircraft 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:09.279
 You've done a lot of things, we'll have lots of fun too, huh? 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:11.769
 celebrate the good Paraguayan scenario 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.280
 in court but it's very cool very light and modern my great-grandfather had fun 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.359
 a lot with the horses 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.709
 brazilwiki 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:20.989
 the player 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.349
 but the team wants you to have a gentleman and that's the way it's going to be. 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.969
 that you had 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.020
 in mind for 2008 and 2009 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.879
 because that's where I wanted to do something 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.380
 can not stop watching tv revealed 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.009
 what to do one thing 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:37.099
 but increases 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.129
 but the truth does not have much better deal to attack 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.019
 according to fpf's note 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.529
 you can lose interactivity 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:48.799
 there appeared this or that format reminds the doctor was at the door as 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.779
 introduction by the 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:52.349
 general image being 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.529
 he pondered on the asphalt of the candomblé horsebacks there is nothing too much 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:57.569
 he will be surprised 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.299
 tower of moncorvo 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.090
 We've made new riders ready enough but they'll get a lot done here. 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:04.289
 for example 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.289
 that's what prepares them to work at the event to park 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.199
 the first major controversy 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.929
 the police are only our 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:15.589
 I passed the sanasa won by the art publisher starts again with the 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:17.719
 greeted 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:19.639
 about 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.819
 about your activities there are a lot of people going jambiski what I like about this 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.219
 computer graphics 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.900
 and I really want to do this kind of thing that works in this field 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.039
 Do you want me to say that you think I started? 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.289
 I like animation leaves for a photo with the athlete 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.430
 quite simple 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.180
 It's very accessible from these people. 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.610
 the expectation with golf 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.819
 Glad you create a template. 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.750
 and with a digital camera law 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.539
 You'll take a picture of each move. 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.469
 left the job aside gives a damn job more super simple tips 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:54.889
 from cp to step 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.430
 anyone can start 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.210
 to develop a taste for computer graphics 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.750
 and after that I start the same computer graphics 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.249
 other factors 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.359
 what do we use 3d mark studio but play here I want to work with what 

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:13.409
 to work in the art editor of the globe tv he has to do what is 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.050
 own 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.300
 and that I really enjoyed everything said movie the television is very 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.520
 training of the young 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.039
 everyone here says that it's a barbarity now they only make themselves 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.270
 present during a meeting with politicians linked to the 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.789
 it was all half of us talking about alliances at work 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.920
 the staff of my contract 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.439
 the women's league has one more challenge to katia of 27 years são paulo 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:46.180
 She does not want to know about housing anymore. What she wants now is to get married. 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.590
 or will it solve the problem of cati 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.099
 and there's more 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.379
 child Party 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.360
 which logics I think I particularly like more 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.469
 who knows what he does and that this can also be a trap in his turn 1 to 0 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:01.650
 the show for folks that kids party can also be a big trap 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.159
 Fantastic dominates have women's trend cell 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.529
 and the Brazilian championship horses are also clear
