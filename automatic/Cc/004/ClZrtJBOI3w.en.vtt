screen also in the video description now
it's<00:00:38.520> time<00:00:38.730> let's<00:00:39.570> cut<00:00:40.100> to<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.129> solution<00:00:42.739> all

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it's time let's cut to the solution all

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.049 
it's time let's cut to the solution all
right<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.010> once<00:00:44.190> again<00:00:44.309> we're<00:00:44.579> looking<00:00:44.610> at<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
right so once again we're looking at the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.369 
right so once again we're looking at the
chart<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.230> have

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
chart and what you do is you have

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.459 
chart and what you do is you have
somebody<00:00:46.649> choose<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> number<00:00:47.370> between<00:00:47.820> 1<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
somebody choose a number between 1 and

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.689 
somebody choose a number between 1 and
60<00:00:49.469> let's<00:00:50.100> say<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.579> choose<00:00:51.379> 14<00:00:52.520> okay<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
60 let's say they choose 14 okay the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.740 
60 let's say they choose 14 okay the
next<00:00:53.879> thing<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.600> them

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
next thing you do is you have them

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.459 
next thing you do is you have them
identify<00:00:55.440> which<00:00:55.860> groups<00:00:57.050> that<00:00:58.050> their<00:00:58.230> number

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
identify which groups that their number

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.520 
identify which groups that their number
appears<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.219> we're<00:00:59.520> looking<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.030> +<00:01:00.449> 14<00:01:01.379> does

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
appears so we're looking at a + 14 does

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.219 
appears so we're looking at a + 14 does
not<00:01:01.739> appear<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:03.030> don't<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.300> anything<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
not appear so they don't do anything you

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.130 
not appear so they don't do anything you
over<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.589> B<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.610> there's<00:01:06.150> 14<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.020> have

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
over to B and there's 14 so you have

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.539 
over to B and there's 14 so you have
them<00:01:07.260> write<00:01:07.439> down<00:01:07.470> letter<00:01:08.430> B<00:01:08.840> go<00:01:09.840> over<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> see

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
them write down letter B go over to see

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.950 
them write down letter B go over to see
there<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.729> again<00:01:11.909> 14<00:01:12.659> write<00:01:13.080> down<00:01:13.290> C

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
there it is again 14 write down C

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.219 
there it is again 14 write down C
looking<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.080> D<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:18.030> 14<00:01:18.540> C<00:01:19.020> write

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
looking at D also you have 14 C write

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.010 
looking at D also you have 14 C write
down<00:01:19.439> D<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.950> far<00:01:20.100> we've<00:01:20.280> got<00:01:20.310> B<00:01:20.640> C<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.390> D<00:01:21.600> for

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
down D so so far we've got B C and D for

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.640 
down D so so far we've got B C and D for
14<00:01:22.490> you<00:01:23.490> look<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.759> E<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.900> doesn't<00:01:25.380> appear

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
14 you look at E and it doesn't appear

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.999 
14 you look at E and it doesn't appear
it's<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.280> Group<00:01:26.610> E<00:01:26.820> also<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
it's not in Group E also it's not in

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.020 
it's not in Group E also it's not in
Group<00:01:29.189> F<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.619> those<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.799> your<00:01:31.920> answers<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.369> 14

you add four plus a plus two and you get
their<00:01:52.649> number<00:01:52.799> 14<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.079> work<00:01:55.229> for

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
their number 14 now this will work for
