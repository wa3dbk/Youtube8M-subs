00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 and kepa are sold good as this is the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.150
 last minute on card 5 I just got 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.880
 to find out one I knew that gta 5 does not 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.340
 could be for pc for a few simple 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.510
 issues 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.280
 but until today they could not guide me from 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.150
 everything until today I was able to 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.210
 say and apparently gta 5 is going to continue 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.580
 for pc but maybe it comes later and 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.379
 I already knew there were surveys to do 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.270
 that they would get them out before and others but 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.629
 final amos comes out later or does not come out anymore 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.480
 late but everything is because they used 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.930
 a graphic ability and a lot much 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.380
 much higher than the allowed and 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.760
 then maybe it takes longer because 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.360
 org 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.760
 my little contacts 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.540
 they told me we go in the 100 the store 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.970
 as always is always that friend of yours 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.699
 He has told me the subject that they have to 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.130
 lower performance because a computer 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.190
 normal as he told me like yours 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.200
 like mine even though I 'm good not 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.200
 It has so much capacity to be able to 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.840
 support the game because graphically it is 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.330
 ultra too good and where they have to 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.070
 lower performance and make it worse 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.960
 I guess what they will do is keep 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.880
 the performance that they had that is abusive 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.700
 for what we have been able to verify in the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.710
 trailer and others that is recorded to pc 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.689
 and what will go down will surely be the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.750
 performance by the plan when the organ 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:40.409
 have the plan option high quality low 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.390
 This will be very low, as it will stop a 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.340
 normal but hopefully they will not lower us to 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.020
 we are a good pc the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.520
 performance but keep it and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.100
 let's say they have worse one worse 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.569
 but do not let ours get down and for 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.679
 that the best comes out later and there's no 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.659
 date of departure for gta 5 and I hope 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.950
 that you liked and give to the aek and if 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.950
 we are not in the next video
