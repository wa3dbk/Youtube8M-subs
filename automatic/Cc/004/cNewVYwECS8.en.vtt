00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.409
 know 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.210
 I'm going to explain a change like this 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.000
 of a horse that has gone from black 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.950
 Then omens that he has done 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.170
 thousands of changes that your hair has 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.140
 made many many changes you have 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.570
 had many colors and good because you 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.970
 that you go a little parched mistreated 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.310
 It is and is asking is 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.500
 help not a few days I had told them 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.250
 that I loved a treatment that 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.900
 he puts it where I go and sells it and I 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.700
 they had put on when I made my little 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.400
 already after an end of my hair 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.770
 black again and again it will 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.560
 dye and then I really wanted to 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.750
 buy me that treatment after I 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.750
 I bought the treatment of that milk and such 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.780
 and what am I going to put here so that 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.030
 chicken that is very very good and the one that 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.759
 buy it was just the one that I had already 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.680
 said in my last video that I made myself 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.080
 changed the shoulder pads and many of 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.280
 you asked him his name there 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.630
 where can we get it 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.700
 and good girls the treatment that I 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.320
 they put the last time in the room of bs 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.000
 they always put me when I make a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.860
 treatment as well as new rayitos 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.950
 when he has known me a drastic change 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.060
 they recommend me a lot this and it's the one that 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.890
 they always call an emergency 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 reconstruct that it's really worth it 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.080
 I like very much 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.760
 this kitsch art to and the first one that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.310
 understands this crystal and why it smells 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.470
 divine was like I fell in love with that 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.090
 for the smell but also because it helps 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.550
 a lot in the hair but I do not know I think 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.950
 I earn more the smell but I know that this 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.140
 He was the one who does more than worth 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.180
 It's worth it, but that's the one 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.459
 he pretends that he is the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.850
 perfect equipment does not apply with the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.470
 wet hair and it's just going to be a 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.750
 little what they are going to use they are going 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.630
 to put on wet hair and they will 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.290
 pick up and they will put a hat on and go to 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:52.320
 put this in your dryer in all your 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.080
 hair only 10 minutes go to 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.270
 use the dryer and then leave 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.670
 to go to sleep yes yes with everything and bag and 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.560
 everything like that they go to sleep and if it is not 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.050
 just a little monkey but it's 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.600
 preferable this a bag or that 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.310
 next they are going to remove this they are going to 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.800
 use cold water 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.489
 those shampoos or rinse and I already know 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.800
 they arrange as usual as usual 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.840
 they will only use it once every 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.599
 two weeks girls 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.220
 you have to like this product not like this 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.050
 like there we are going to use it between 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.349
 more light in my hair is going to look better 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.590
 not because it is very strong but it is worth 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.319
 sorry this because it serves a lot this 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.849
 help to see even this 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.650
 help to make your hair a 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.660
 little bit thicker because after that 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.000
 when we make many changes in our 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.310
 hair what will happen is cut into 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.110
 that part becomes thinner and this 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.000
 is what will help us is that it is 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.129
 repair and then so that it comes out a little 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.579
 harder is a little bit stronger it has 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.709
 the quantity of 117 milliliters 6 ounces what 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.560
 you can find I think that by online 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.360
 you can look for the page this to see if 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.430
 you can find it and then put here in 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.329
 the information box so they go h 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.459
 that its smell smells like syrup a 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.910
 little strong at the moment it 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.220
 applies already after I do not know if I do not know 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.430
 they can move because it's hard hard 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.310
 well as when we use a lot more like that 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.310
 how do you lose like that? 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.919
 and at the beginning when they put it on me 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.780
 for me something new but already after 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.240
 when they told me this time is that I 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.770
 they were going to put it like that as well as 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.050
 I have to last all night with 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.810
 this but it's worth the worthy guy 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.020
 because really if we look at the changes 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.720
 the change the amount is 25 dollars 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.940
 of this size I think there's a little 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.530
 biggest one is that I think look 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.940
 is the professional that can 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.800
 find why you can find it in 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.360
 you go from the navel of chiquitito 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.360
 so they can see how they can use it 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.610
 and that has been everything I hope you like it 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.860
