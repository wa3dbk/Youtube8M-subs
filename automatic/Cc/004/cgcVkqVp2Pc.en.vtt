important<00:02:02.340> distinction<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.880> make<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.329> gun

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
important distinction to make this gun

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.789 
important distinction to make this gun
is<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:04.079> beast<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:05.280> close<00:02:05.909> quarters<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:07.619> is

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
is a beast in close quarters that is

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.800 
is a beast in close quarters that is
undeniable<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.330> that's<00:02:09.509> not<00:02:09.629> what

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
undeniable and you know that's not what

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.860 
undeniable and you know that's not what
I'm<00:02:09.869> arguing<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.470> however<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:12.330> drawback<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
I'm arguing here however the drawback is

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.820 
I'm arguing here however the drawback is
pretty<00:02:13.110> clear<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.650> gun

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
pretty clear that the gun

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.450 
pretty clear that the gun
sucks<00:02:14.420> outside<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.570> its<00:02:15.720> engagement<00:02:16.050> range

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
sucks outside of its engagement range

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.730 
sucks outside of its engagement range
you<00:02:17.460> know<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.200> it's

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
you know it's just like the it's

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.830 
you know it's just like the it's
basically<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.190> exact<00:02:20.520> opposite<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.480> AK

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
basically the exact opposite of the AK

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.880 
basically the exact opposite of the AK
74<00:02:22.230> m<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.520> 85<00:02:24.060> those<00:02:24.600> guns<00:02:24.870> both<00:02:25.350> suck<00:02:25.710> in

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
74 m and the 85 those guns both suck in

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.650 
74 m and the 85 those guns both suck in
close<00:02:26.070> quarters<00:02:26.490> however<00:02:26.880> at<00:02:27.150> long<00:02:27.300> range

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
close quarters however at long range

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.580 
close quarters however at long range
they<00:02:28.590> destroy<00:02:28.920> people<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.380> just<00:02:31.380> remember

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
they destroy people so just remember

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.630 
they destroy people so just remember
that<00:02:31.950> Hamas<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.090> close-quarters<00:02:33.540> weapon<00:02:33.720> is

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
that Hamas is a close-quarters weapon is

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.210 
that Hamas is a close-quarters weapon is
not<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:36.030> long-range<00:02:36.780> weapon<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:38.070> you're

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
not a long-range weapon if you're

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.970 
not a long-range weapon if you're
getting<00:02:38.430> torn<00:02:38.730> up<00:02:38.880> by<00:02:39.000> famosos<00:02:39.740> maybe<00:02:40.740> you

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
getting torn up by famosos maybe you

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.380 
getting torn up by famosos maybe you
need<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.280> back<00:02:41.430> up<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.760> little<00:02:41.880> bit<00:02:42.090> play<00:02:42.360> a

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
need to back up a little bit play a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.390 
need to back up a little bit play a
little<00:02:42.540> bit<00:02:42.690> further<00:02:42.900> back<00:02:43.170> or<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:44.100> need<00:02:44.280> to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
little bit further back or you need to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.580 
little bit further back or you need to
take<00:02:44.700> something<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.240> PDW<00:02:45.600> or<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.110> shotgun

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
take something like a PDW or a shotgun

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.490 
take something like a PDW or a shotgun
and<00:02:46.800> just<00:02:47.310> kind<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.580> maximize<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.930> advantages

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
and just kind of maximize the advantages

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.410 
and just kind of maximize the advantages
that<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.770> can<00:02:50.690> that's<00:02:51.690> my<00:02:51.900> thoughts<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:53.420> I'm

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
that you can that's my thoughts and I'm

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.730 
that you can that's my thoughts and I'm
sticking<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.840> dispatch<00:02:55.290> didn't<00:02:55.590> really

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
sticking to a dispatch didn't really

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.640 
sticking to a dispatch didn't really
change<00:02:55.950> anything<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:56.640> regard<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.650> that's

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
change anything in that regard so that's

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.020 
change anything in that regard so that's
that<00:02:59.660> anyways<00:03:00.660> let's<00:03:01.700> talk<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> little<00:03:02.820> bit

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that anyways let's talk a little bit

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.760 
that anyways let's talk a little bit
about<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.360> application<00:03:03.900> with<00:03:04.230> moss<00:03:04.470> the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
about the application with moss the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.520 
about the application with moss the
usage<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.750> might<00:03:06.930> see<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.350> have<00:03:07.410> a

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
usage and you might see that I have a

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.800 
usage and you might see that I have a
kind<00:03:07.770> of<00:03:07.830> weird<00:03:08.040> technique<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.150> using<00:03:09.180> famas

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
kind of weird technique of using famas

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.990 
kind of weird technique of using famas
that<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.010> basically<00:03:11.190> run<00:03:11.520> around<00:03:11.730> with<00:03:11.880> it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
that is I basically run around with it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.870 
that is I basically run around with it
in<00:03:12.090> burst<00:03:12.330> firing<00:03:12.510> mode<00:03:12.840> half<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.200> time<00:03:13.880> now

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
in burst firing mode half the time now

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.970 
in burst firing mode half the time now
let<00:03:15.060> me<00:03:15.090> go<00:03:15.420> ahead<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.690> explain<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.620> because

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
let me go ahead and explain this because

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.300 
let me go ahead and explain this because
this<00:03:17.100> might<00:03:17.250> seem<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.520> little<00:03:18.140> goofy<00:03:19.310> seeing

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
this might seem a little goofy seeing

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.740 
this might seem a little goofy seeing
how<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.430> gun<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.820> obviously<00:03:21.209> known<00:03:21.450> for<00:03:21.630> its

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
how the gun is obviously known for its

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.050 
how the gun is obviously known for its
high<00:03:21.870> rate<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.110> fire<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.739> just<00:03:23.519> ability<00:03:23.910> to

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
high rate of fire and just ability to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.400 
high rate of fire and just ability to
drop<00:03:24.300> people<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.870> close<00:03:25.050> quarters<00:03:27.290> let<00:03:28.290> me

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
drop people in close quarters let me

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.170 
drop people in close quarters let me
make<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.680> straight<00:03:29.010> here<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.459> this<00:03:29.790> type<00:03:30.150> of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
make it straight here that this type of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.240 
make it straight here that this type of
range<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.630> I'm<00:03:30.750> at<00:03:30.900> right<00:03:30.930> now<00:03:31.110> if<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.160> was

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
range that I'm at right now if I was

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.550 
range that I'm at right now if I was
being<00:03:32.430> serious<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.970> would<00:03:33.150> not<00:03:33.300> even<00:03:34.140> bother

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
being serious I would not even bother

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.350 
being serious I would not even bother
with<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:34.800> guy<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.850> do<00:03:36.000> see<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.209> am

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
with that guy and you do see I am

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.440 
with that guy and you do see I am
running<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.989> foregrip<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.680> suppressor<00:03:38.459> our

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
running the foregrip and suppressor our

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.190 
running the foregrip and suppressor our
flash<00:03:40.050> suppressor<00:03:40.560> i<00:03:40.590> should<00:03:40.920> say<00:03:42.200> flash

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
flash suppressor i should say flash

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.020 
flash suppressor i should say flash
suppressor<00:03:43.620> obviously<00:03:44.130> supposedly<00:03:44.489> reduces

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
suppressor obviously supposedly reduces

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.550 
suppressor obviously supposedly reduces
the<00:03:45.120> recoil<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.510> little<00:03:45.720> bit<00:03:45.840> which<00:03:46.530> is

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
the recoil a little bit which is

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.890 
the recoil a little bit which is
obviously<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.070> good<00:03:47.310> thing<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:48.570> when<00:03:48.810> you're

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
obviously a good thing and when you're

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.180 
obviously a good thing and when you're
talking<00:03:49.290> about<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.620> gun<00:03:49.830> because<00:03:50.040> the

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
talking about this gun because the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.240 
talking about this gun because the
recoil<00:03:50.550> can<00:03:50.730> get<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> little<00:03:51.150> bit<00:03:51.739> unruly<00:03:52.739> let's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
recoil can get a little bit unruly let's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.750 
recoil can get a little bit unruly let's
say<00:03:53.459> but<00:03:54.450> by<00:03:54.720> no<00:03:54.780> means<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.230> uncontrollable

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
say but by no means is it uncontrollable

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.509 
say but by no means is it uncontrollable
it's<00:03:56.760> just<00:03:57.470> there's<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.560> tremendous<00:03:58.830> amount<00:03:59.250> of

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
it's just there's a tremendous amount of

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.610 
it's just there's a tremendous amount of
first<00:03:59.820> shot<00:04:00.000> recoil<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.750> seems<00:04:01.019> like<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.500> it

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
first shot recoil it seems like and it

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.540 
first shot recoil it seems like and it
just<00:04:01.830> kind<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.070> Thor's<00:04:02.700> your<00:04:02.880> name<00:04:02.970> off<00:04:04.489> but<00:04:05.489> I

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
just kind of Thor's your name off but I

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.210 
just kind of Thor's your name off but I
do<00:04:05.610> use<00:04:05.820> this<00:04:05.970> gun<00:04:06.180> in<00:04:06.360> burst<00:04:06.600> fire<00:04:06.810> mode<00:04:07.220> think

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
do use this gun in burst fire mode think

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.979 
do use this gun in burst fire mode think
of<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.400> as<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.670> burst<00:04:09.090> firing<00:04:09.330> assault<00:04:09.600> rifle

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
of it as a burst firing assault rifle

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.910 
of it as a burst firing assault rifle
with<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.260> option<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.190> go<00:04:12.060> full<00:04:12.269> auto<00:04:12.830> sort<00:04:13.830> of

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
with the option to go full auto sort of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.840 
with the option to go full auto sort of
like<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.040> reverse<00:04:14.220> an-94<00:04:15.120> where<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.669> full<00:04:17.669> auto

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
like a reverse an-94 where the full auto

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.000 
like a reverse an-94 where the full auto
mode<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.450> really<00:04:18.720> super<00:04:19.049> slow<00:04:19.380> when<00:04:19.680> you<00:04:19.769> want

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
mode is really super slow when you want

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.659 
mode is really super slow when you want
to<00:04:20.100> use<00:04:20.250> them<00:04:20.430> perspire<00:04:21.299> if<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.630> can<00:04:22.520> this<00:04:23.520> is

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
to use them perspire if you can this is

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.399 
to use them perspire if you can this is
basically<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.090> opposite<00:04:24.539> where

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
basically the opposite where

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:29.010 
basically the opposite where
the<00:04:26.409> burst<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.979> this<00:04:27.159> quote<00:04:27.999> unquote<00:04:28.120> slow

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
the burst is this quote unquote slow

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.200 
the burst is this quote unquote slow
rate<00:04:29.319> of<00:04:29.349> fire<00:04:29.439> around<00:04:29.879> however<00:04:30.879> the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
rate of fire around however the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.080 
rate of fire around however the
full-auto<00:04:31.419> is<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.439> you<00:04:32.889> know<00:04:32.979> time<00:04:33.819> to<00:04:33.939> drop

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
full-auto is the you know time to drop

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.050 
full-auto is the you know time to drop
the<00:04:34.300> hammer<00:04:34.749> and<00:04:35.080> drop<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.740> bodies<00:04:36.069> because

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
the hammer and drop the bodies because

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.390 
the hammer and drop the bodies because
it<00:04:37.180> will<00:04:37.300> still<00:04:37.569> do<00:04:37.719> that<00:04:37.900> but<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:39.099> are<00:04:39.249> gonna

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
it will still do that but you are gonna

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.679 
it will still do that but you are gonna
burn<00:04:39.610> through<00:04:39.759> animal<00:04:40.029> if<00:04:40.150> you<00:04:40.180> stick<00:04:40.479> it<00:04:40.599> on

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
burn through animal if you stick it on

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.809 
burn through animal if you stick it on
full<00:04:40.870> auto<00:04:41.080> there's<00:04:42.039> obviously<00:04:42.520> some

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
full auto there's obviously some

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.689 
full auto there's obviously some
advantages<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.539> using<00:04:44.069> the<00:04:45.069> burst<00:04:45.400> firing

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
advantages to using the burst firing

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.179 
advantages to using the burst firing
setting<00:04:46.210> rather<00:04:46.360> than<00:04:46.599> just<00:04:46.810> doing<00:04:47.189> automatic

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:48.189 
setting rather than just doing automatic

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.309 
setting rather than just doing automatic
and<00:04:48.370> manual<00:04:48.400> reverse<00:04:49.060> firing<00:04:49.539> seems<00:04:50.080> like<00:04:50.229> the

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
and manual reverse firing seems like the

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.200 
and manual reverse firing seems like the
recoil<00:04:50.620> is<00:04:50.740> much<00:04:50.919> more<00:04:51.099> vertical<00:04:51.639> much<00:04:52.029> more

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
recoil is much more vertical much more

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.790 
recoil is much more vertical much more
straight<00:04:52.479> up<00:04:52.599> and<00:04:52.719> down<00:04:52.749> which<00:04:53.139> is<00:04:53.289> a<00:04:53.319> pretty

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
straight up and down which is a pretty

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.550 
straight up and down which is a pretty
big<00:04:53.979> change<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.990> go<00:04:56.169> ahead<00:04:56.259> and<00:04:56.349> take

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
big change so go ahead and take

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.540 
big change so go ahead and take
advantage<00:04:56.710> of<00:04:57.129> that<00:04:58.889> it<00:04:59.889> really<00:05:00.039> is<00:05:00.159> pretty

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
advantage of that it really is pretty

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.999 
advantage of that it really is pretty
much<00:05:00.750> that<00:05:01.750> simple<00:05:02.199> I<00:05:02.349> would<00:05:02.860> definitely

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
much that simple I would definitely

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.260 
much that simple I would definitely
suggest<00:05:03.279> going<00:05:03.669> with<00:05:03.849> one<00:05:04.029> of<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.150> close

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
suggest going with one of the close

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.209 
suggest going with one of the close
quarters<00:05:04.539> objects<00:05:05.139> such<00:05:05.349> as<00:05:05.379> the<00:05:05.650> Cobra<00:05:06.069> or

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:06.219 
quarters objects such as the Cobra or

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.510 
quarters objects such as the Cobra or
the<00:05:06.460> reflex<00:05:06.819> sight<00:05:07.029> whichever<00:05:07.389> you<00:05:07.539> prefer<00:05:07.659> I

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
the reflex sight whichever you prefer I

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.830 
the reflex sight whichever you prefer I
think<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.669> holographic<00:05:10.270> does<00:05:10.509> provide<00:05:10.779> a

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
think the holographic does provide a

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.300 
think the holographic does provide a
little<00:05:11.110> bit<00:05:11.199> too<00:05:11.319> much<00:05:11.409> zoom<00:05:11.650> for<00:05:11.860> this<00:05:11.949> gun<00:05:12.129> it

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
little bit too much zoom for this gun it

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.860 
little bit too much zoom for this gun it
just<00:05:12.550> kind<00:05:12.729> of<00:05:12.759> gives<00:05:12.849> me<00:05:13.029> a<00:05:13.060> terrible<00:05:13.629> sight

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
just kind of gives me a terrible sight

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.800 
just kind of gives me a terrible sight
picture<00:05:14.139> that<00:05:14.319> I<00:05:14.409> don't<00:05:14.529> like<00:05:14.710> so<00:05:15.479> that's<00:05:16.479> that

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
picture that I don't like so that's that

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.480 
picture that I don't like so that's that
and<00:05:17.849> remember<00:05:18.849> use<00:05:19.629> burst<00:05:19.870> fire<00:05:20.080> it's<00:05:20.680> it's

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
and remember use burst fire it's it's

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.659 
and remember use burst fire it's it's
for<00:05:21.699> the<00:05:21.789> win<00:05:21.819> right<00:05:22.419> by
