00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
with it now I'm thinking it's working

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.060 
with it now I'm thinking it's working
pretty<00:00:19.730> pretty<00:00:20.300> well<00:00:20.510> it's<00:00:21.230> a<00:00:21.320> very<00:00:21.529> signet

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
pretty pretty well it's a very signet

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.340 
pretty pretty well it's a very signet
heavy<00:00:22.279> build<00:00:22.580> as<00:00:22.939> you'll<00:00:23.180> see<00:00:23.539> it<00:00:23.750> makes<00:00:23.990> much

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
heavy build as you'll see it makes much

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.750 
heavy build as you'll see it makes much
more<00:00:24.380> sense<00:00:24.590> when<00:00:24.949> you<00:00:25.070> look<00:00:25.100> at<00:00:25.340> the<00:00:25.400> traits

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
more sense when you look at the traits

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.950 
more sense when you look at the traits
as<00:00:26.029> to<00:00:26.660> why<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:26.810> did<00:00:27.109> select<00:00:27.529> those<00:00:28.510> so<00:00:29.510> let's<00:00:29.720> go

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
as to why I did select those so let's go

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.180 
as to why I did select those so let's go
ahead<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.260> go<00:00:30.890> into<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:31.369> trait<00:00:31.640> system<00:00:32.119> first

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
ahead and go into the trait system first

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.950 
ahead and go into the trait system first
alright<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:34.430> we're<00:00:34.730> pretty<00:00:34.910> heavy<00:00:35.239> into<00:00:35.629> fire

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
alright so we're pretty heavy into fire

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.810 
alright so we're pretty heavy into fire
which<00:00:36.290> of<00:00:36.440> course<00:00:36.470> gives<00:00:36.949> us<00:00:37.070> power<00:00:37.309> and

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
which of course gives us power and

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.270 
which of course gives us power and
increased<00:00:38.540> condition<00:00:39.320> duration<00:00:39.830> which<00:00:40.040> will

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
increased condition duration which will

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.539 
increased condition duration which will
come<00:00:41.030> in<00:00:41.059> handy<00:00:41.210> for<00:00:41.720> the<00:00:42.620> major<00:00:42.769> traits<00:00:43.159> i<00:00:43.370> won

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:43.549 
come in handy for the major traits i won

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.140 
come in handy for the major traits i won
with<00:00:43.729> burning<00:00:44.210> fire<00:00:44.739> mainly<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:46.100> buff<00:00:46.670> up<00:00:46.879> my

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
with burning fire mainly to buff up my

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.539 
with burning fire mainly to buff up my
signet<00:00:47.690> of<00:00:47.809> fire<00:00:48.080> which<00:00:48.890> will<00:00:49.129> now<00:00:49.250> increase

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
signet of fire which will now increase

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.410 
signet of fire which will now increase
burning<00:00:50.150> from<00:00:50.930> nine<00:00:51.530> seconds<00:00:52.159> to<00:00:52.369> 12<00:00:52.850> seconds

actually<00:00:53.839> a<00:00:54.140> little<00:00:54.350> bit<00:00:54.589> longer<00:00:54.890> because<00:00:55.220> of

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
actually a little bit longer because of

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.259 
actually a little bit longer because of
some<00:00:56.540> of<00:00:56.659> the<00:00:56.750> other<00:00:56.960> sigils<00:00:57.949> i<00:00:58.100> have<00:00:58.309> all

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.850 
some of the other sigils i have all
right<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.629> then<00:00:59.750> i<00:00:59.839> have<00:00:59.869> fires<00:01:00.290> in<00:01:00.559> bricks

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
right and then i have fires in bricks

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.090 
right and then i have fires in bricks
which<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.089> like<00:01:02.239> one<00:01:02.420> of<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.600> main

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
which this is like one of the main

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.679 
which this is like one of the main
traits<00:01:04.100> for<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:04.430> build<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.479> is

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
traits for this build and that is

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.140 
traits for this build and that is
whenever<00:01:05.900> i<00:01:06.110> activate<00:01:06.799> a<00:01:06.830> signet<00:01:07.340> I<00:01:07.490> gained<00:01:07.970> a

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
whenever i activate a signet I gained a

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.240 
whenever i activate a signet I gained a
fire<00:01:08.570> shield<00:01:09.020> for<00:01:09.350> three<00:01:09.590> seconds<00:01:10.010> which<00:01:10.220> is

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
fire shield for three seconds which is

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
believe it's a five second bump i'm

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.950 
believe it's a five second bump i'm
pretty<00:01:34.490> sure<00:01:34.760> that's<00:01:35.000> how<00:01:35.120> long<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.480> so

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
pretty sure that's how long it is so

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.840 
pretty sure that's how long it is so
yeah<00:01:36.140> every<00:01:36.440> time<00:01:36.620> I<00:01:36.650> hit<00:01:36.890> a<00:01:36.920> signet<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:37.550> get

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
yeah every time I hit a signet I get

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.630 
yeah every time I hit a signet I get
that<00:01:38.000> aura<00:01:38.300> from<00:01:38.659> flame<00:01:39.530> fire<00:01:40.070> shield<00:01:40.340> and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
that aura from flame fire shield and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.620 
that aura from flame fire shield and
then<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:40.940> also<00:01:40.970> get<00:01:41.630> fury<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.110> swiftness<00:01:42.500> and

into earth magic which gives me some
toughness<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:48.010> a<00:01:49.010> more<00:01:49.430> conditioned<00:01:49.940> damage

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
toughness and a more conditioned damage

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.770 
toughness and a more conditioned damage
again<00:01:50.659> very<00:01:50.960> good<00:01:51.229> for<00:01:51.530> elementalists<00:01:52.810> first

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
again very good for elementalists first

again very good for elementalists first
train<00:01:55.470> i'm<00:01:55.650> into<00:01:56.190> is<00:01:56.460> signet<00:01:57.150> mastery<00:01:57.690> which

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
train i'm into is signet mastery which

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.690 
train i'm into is signet mastery which
very<00:01:59.510> obvious<00:02:00.510> lie<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
very obvious lie to get that that

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.560 
very obvious lie to get that that
reduces<00:02:02.700> my<00:02:02.909> cygnets<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:04.140> twenty<00:02:04.619> percent

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
reduces my cygnets with twenty percent

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.150 
reduces my cygnets with twenty percent
then<00:02:06.570> i<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.810> elemental<00:02:07.409> shielding<00:02:07.920> which

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
then i have elemental shielding which

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.870 
then i have elemental shielding which
another<00:02:08.640> above<00:02:09.600> i<00:02:10.069> gained<00:02:11.069> protection<00:02:11.730> for

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
another above i gained protection for

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.090

look at those all right now for the gear

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.190 
look at those all right now for the gear
i<00:03:04.410> originally<00:03:05.280> was<00:03:05.760> going<00:03:05.850> with<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.570> superior

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
i originally was going with the superior

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.930 
i originally was going with the superior
runes<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.720> elementalist<00:03:10.549> but<00:03:11.549> i<00:03:11.579> felt

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
runes of the elementalist but i felt

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.360 
runes of the elementalist but i felt
that<00:03:12.000> i<00:03:12.090> needed<00:03:12.180> some<00:03:12.660> more<00:03:12.840> protection<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:14.340> i

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
that i needed some more protection so i

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.940 
that i needed some more protection so i
went<00:03:14.790> ahead<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.180> switched<00:03:15.540> over<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:15.989> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
went ahead and switched over to the

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.240 
went ahead and switched over to the
superior<00:03:17.730> rooms<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.360> Earth<00:03:18.769> which<00:03:19.769> gives<00:03:20.100> me

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
superior rooms of Earth which gives me

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.160 
superior rooms of Earth which gives me
toughness<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:21.090> also<00:03:21.420> increases<00:03:21.780> my

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
toughness it also increases my

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.720 
toughness it also increases my
protection<00:03:22.620> duration<00:03:23.489> by<00:03:24.329> twenty<00:03:24.660> percent

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
protection duration by twenty percent

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.180 
protection duration by twenty percent
and<00:03:26.730> also<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> nice<00:03:27.450> little<00:03:27.989> buff<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.769> whenever

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
and also a nice little buff is whenever

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.430 
and also a nice little buff is whenever
I<00:03:29.459> my<00:03:29.970> health<00:03:30.180> reaches<00:03:30.600> twenty<00:03:30.870> percent<00:03:31.230> i

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
I my health reaches twenty percent i

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.590 
I my health reaches twenty percent i
will<00:03:31.620> gain<00:03:31.799> magnetic<00:03:32.370> are<00:03:32.549> 0<00:03:32.609> for<00:03:32.790> 5<00:03:33.120> seconds

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
will gain magnetic are 0 for 5 seconds

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.630 
will gain magnetic are 0 for 5 seconds
which<00:03:33.780> again<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.320> isn't<00:03:34.620> aura<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.190> i<00:03:35.220> will

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
which again that isn't aura so i will

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.240 
which again that isn't aura so i will
gain<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.209> Furies<00:03:36.989> witness<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.709> protection

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
gain the Furies witness and protection

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.240 
gain the Furies witness and protection
as<00:03:38.370> well<00:03:38.400> as<00:03:39.500> reflecting<00:03:40.500> any<00:03:40.680> projectiles

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
as well as reflecting any projectiles

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.200 
as well as reflecting any projectiles
that<00:03:41.459> are<00:03:41.700> flowing

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
that are flowing

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.330 
that are flowing
so<00:03:43.210> it's<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:43.540> very<00:03:43.570> useful<00:03:43.990> trait<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:45.040> that's

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
so it's a very useful trait and that's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.340 
so it's a very useful trait and that's
why<00:03:45.490> I<00:03:45.520> switched<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.120> but<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.990> balance

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
why I switched to that but to balance

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.860 
why I switched to that but to balance
out<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.980> loss<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:48.610> power<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:49.270> went<00:03:49.600> ahead<00:03:49.660> and

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
out the loss in power I went ahead and

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.370 
out the loss in power I went ahead and
kept<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.740> carrion<00:03:51.700> amulet<00:03:52.270> I<00:03:52.510> was

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
kept the carrion amulet I was

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.790 
kept the carrion amulet I was
considering<00:03:53.860> using<00:03:54.720> what<00:03:55.720> is<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.260> soldier

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
considering using what is it the soldier

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.370 
considering using what is it the soldier
1<00:03:56.980> or<00:03:57.580> no<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.120> rabid<00:03:58.510> one<00:03:58.660> for<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.960> extra

1 or no the rabid one for the extra

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.530 
1 or no the rabid one for the extra
toughness<00:03:59.860> but<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.490> decided<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:01.060> go<00:04:01.210> back<00:04:01.240> to

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
toughness but I decided to go back to

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.940 
toughness but I decided to go back to
the<00:04:01.810> power<00:04:02.410> vitality<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.960> then<00:04:04.960> for<00:04:05.320> my<00:04:05.590> Sid
