 event only holds that he is 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.009
 popular the arwing but popular it is 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.580
 present on TV he is with us 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.849
 him to reindeer 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.880
 hello denis samassa goes your iphone 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.469
 via also for name yannick couture it's 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.710
 yannick couture who is designer of 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.539
 costumes actually not why he 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.789
 must be manic reitmans Sabine 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.070
 even actually I was looking for everything 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.289
 simply a pastor occupy the evenings 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.880
 had the idea is to gather my passions 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.230
 cinema video games sculpture painting 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.059
 I think I know it's okay 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.600
 but it looks very comfortable considering a 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.090
 hand the sport can not move in the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.120
 flexibility still quite limited there 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.850
 hotter than the 60-pound 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.230
 file green on the back is because 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.360
 that you work in the industry of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.969
 3d video game what yes actually does more 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.460
 especially video game videogame 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.320
 actually and so you know yourself 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 and this comic book there I 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.010
 do not know cassava it's when a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.899
 series I saw this summer the issues 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.550
 that we said that the bridle to nice you are 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.559
 the best in there and you why 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.159
 do you like in iron man what is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.100
 special 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.619
 my personal opinion if the character of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.659
 this coolest hero father who opposes this 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.369
 chaos struggling banks where 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.159
 two forget guards comes to know 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.960
 but he's cooler than superman or at 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.909
 my opinion the armor is really 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.640
 interesting and timely also 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.700
 so the strategic challenge 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.080
 there we see the film he dresses like that 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.640
 he gets dressed in a few seconds the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.049
 bubble in the jokes la vlaamse women 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.930
 only that's not how it works 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.409
 so much to do there because we avoid 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.150
 actually in real life 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.159
 fights two dozen of our 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.259
 fathers by wire and of course with the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.720
 remains of an assistant because he has 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.310
 it's too much phew it's too much for a 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.320
 only person and her name is how much 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.000
 all and for all 60 books movies 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.909
 of horror of friends how long for 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.020
 design then made everything everywhere 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.450
 took 14 months I started like this or 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.290
 2012 to finish last week 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.790
 always accumulate milla work 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.580
 was doing that why to pass 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.760
 halloween 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.640
 to the poster louis may be persuaded 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.960
 convention competition and is that 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.000
 I read that you wanted to do the 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.590
 school tour went to see the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.370
 sick children are you sure any 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.400
 motivation 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.040
 actually I had envisioned this project 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.140
 they just have 6 months to 6 months 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.630
 I was just halfway through the process 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.130
 so I was quite a bit of courage and I 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.630
 am set to think of sick children 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.040
 precisely that they can not 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.950
 allow you to let go in their 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.260
 fight it motivates me and to finish the project 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.930
 for only the remaining Liberals 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.560
 and then it can serve as an example 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.360
 well went to visit their do 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.190
 let go for you are my heroes because 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.900
 that you have little feet 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.030
 children who came here three years 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.530
 still it must be special daddy 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:58.570
 who dresses in home wanting more 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:01.330
 it's impressive and it's done 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.450
 do it is to make glass of fiberglass 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.310
 wood and so had to sink that made 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.590
 to make mussels or like that actually 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.050
 part of 3d models other dimension 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.820
 I used the method actually regani 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.650
 to use the reprimand 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.440
 conventional simply I 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.000
 printed all the costume on cardboard for 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.350
 to have the right dimensions to assure me 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.140
 that my body really get into 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.180
 each piece and then the fiber 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.970
 of glass inside then the putty the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.400
 definition to make the surface and get 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.709
 tut tut manufacture itself decor 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.970
 a mischief drawn from there it had to be the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.350
 do since we think a whole 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.110
 pretty concept your job 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.120
 Video of this you design business 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.330
 between designing and then doing things there 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.370
 is at the same time that you do that in 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.060
 your house at home yes quite but 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.290
 in the cabanon of the Russian rear 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.980
 that parents tomorrow and in a 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.989
 shed 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.220
 Paschal officially the history and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.200
 waters has a foundation of a chic 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.140
 superman was born for sure 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.489
 krypton planet but iron man the suit 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.010
 and receives originally he does it in 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.599
 an Afghan cave and then by the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.300
 sub-prefect several dance versions 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.400
 and the basement at home in his house 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.959
 ok but it's a human being events 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.959
 yes actually quite like us 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:20.859
 on the other hand endowed according to the comic of other 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:22.750
 extreme intelligence then to invent 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.070
 quit his costume does not know when to 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.389
 sees donned his costume in great 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.550
 speed in the movie that's it 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.310
 difference is a superhero to bail 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.229
 costumes actually a good who 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.760
 fight against the wicked and that's it and 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.070
 so what do you want to do with this 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.540
 halloween style is so much more that 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.860
 pact could not think of them far so 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.630
 it is not the test of luz and could 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.550
 to stop electronics when 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.780
 you see the person is not 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.150
 evidence of the water so I took the 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.729
 chance to go out under the support of times 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.100
 that's so high but that's it today 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.210
 the ages the outings and do you 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.620

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.580
 commitments or else went to see 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.889
 someone is surely for schools 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.450
 not yet a journey for hospitals 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.930
 it's already starting the process is 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.880
 started 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.500
 Oh, that must make an impact when we 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.900
 ask to crawl to the hospital and you are 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.400
 went to the hospital for specific children 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.530

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.550
 to pass things there are some 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.860
 technicalities to respect what is 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.050
 reports among others to Jean Labour for 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.630
