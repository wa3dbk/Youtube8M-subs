00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
here you work a way up and this is how

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.210 
here you work a way up and this is how
it<00:01:06.000> happens<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:07.619> when<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:08.010> that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
it happens and just when you know that
it's<00:01:08.340> possible<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.380> helps<00:01:10.380> people

player<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.049> X<00:01:19.740> Y<00:01:19.920> &amp;<00:01:20.159> Z<00:01:20.220> during<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.270> time

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
player if I do X Y &amp; Z during this time

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.149 
player if I do X Y &amp; Z during this time
the<00:01:21.869> Union<00:01:22.140> put<00:01:22.259> together<00:01:22.380> their<00:01:22.740> first<00:01:22.950> ever

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the Union put together their first ever

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.539 
the Union put together their first ever
I<00:01:24.090> guess<00:01:24.930> Academy<00:01:25.830> team<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.340> drew

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
I guess Academy team but they drew

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.370 
I guess Academy team but they drew
players<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> local<00:01:27.600> teams<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
players from the local teams like the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990 
players from the local teams like the
best<00:01:28.500> kids<00:01:28.740> from<00:01:28.860> local<00:01:29.009> teams<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.820> did

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
best kids from local teams so we did

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
best kids from local teams so we did
that<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.299> about<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.509> year<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.079> then<00:01:31.770> that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
that for about a year and then that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.480 
that for about a year and then that
upcoming<00:01:32.820> summer<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.210> guess<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.810> first

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490
