just didn't want to talk about it then

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.660 
just didn't want to talk about it then
because<00:02:31.360> there's<00:02:31.600> not<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.170> right<00:02:32.740> timing<00:02:33.130> to

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
because there's not the right timing to

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.050 
because there's not the right timing to
talk<00:02:33.910> about<00:02:34.260> because<00:02:35.260> we<00:02:35.500> are<00:02:35.530> eating<00:02:36.040> but<00:02:37.000> I

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.280 
talk about because we are eating but I
thought<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.420> was<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> perfect<00:02:37.840> time<00:02:38.170> to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
thought that was the perfect time to

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.960 
thought that was the perfect time to
talk<00:02:38.410> about<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.830> because<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.340> was<00:02:39.670> looking<00:02:39.790> at

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
talk about it because I was looking at

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.670 
talk about it because I was looking at
the<00:02:40.030> food<00:02:40.180> on<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.390> table<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.990> know<00:02:41.170> it's<00:02:41.470> like
