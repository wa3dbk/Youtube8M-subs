00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 Let's learn how to solve the problem. 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.519
 windows 7 temporary profile and the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.519
 windows 8 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.490
 the process is the same for both systems 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.350
 and you can solve this problem 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.529
 you must have a user 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.910
 administrator trained in teaching in the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.960
 your computer 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:31.130
 In case you do not have access the link below 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.130
 and learn how to enable the administrator 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 in this case you already have the user of a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.620
 server enabled so I will do 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.620
 logoff of the user with the problem 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:56.530
 and access the administrator with the user 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.340
 administrator or from the start menu 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.950
 digit reg 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.950
 edit pressed 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:13.280
 the network was already open but let's 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:21.940
 follow from the beginning of the hq 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:24.980
 expanded local machine software option 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.440
 find microsoft expanded 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:33.650
 now let's find the windows option 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:38.780
 nt within where you will expand the 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:43.190
 current reverse option and locate the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.290
 profile list with the option to happy 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:52.130
 localized 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:55.940
 here is this key with the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.040
 end point back we identified her 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.490
 the prof 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:07.810
 efe refers to co2 point barrios barre 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.810
 grg is my user name 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.740
 we will apply it with the button 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.540
 right in the excluded option 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.800
 I'm sure you want to delete it for me. 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.910
 it is permanent 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.850
 yes after deleted 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.600
 close the registry editor and let's 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.600
 restart the machine 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.640
 the computer restarted 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.120
 let's enter again with the eyes of 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.120
 a dictator 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:50.320
 now we need to rename the 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.410
 our user 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:03:01.700
 so let's open - explore in the option 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:04.270
 computer says put them in the folder 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.270
 users 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.470
 this we should almost name then 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.940
 that we should name if you have 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.450
 some saved file 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.790
 already in the user as my documents 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.470
 pictures and music or videos 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.880
 all your files are still 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.190
 inside this folder 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.340
 so we'll rename there so that 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.940
 when the new folder is created 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.980
 your user can copy 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:44.030
 your files back to the new 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:47.550
 paste no make for r general ould 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.390
 Renamed now we 're leaving the 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:57.530
 computer user with the option off 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.530
 and enter our user 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.030
 is already preparing the desktop 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.680
 beauty so far has not appeared 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.540
 balloon saying that we 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.850
 we did it soon with the season profile 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.600
 It does not mean that for now it's 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:30.190
 everything working to confirm them let's go 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:34.210
 open people explore a computer said 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.500
 put them in the users folder and 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.160
 we confirmed that the rg folder 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.160
 referring to a user 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.470
 now just copy the files that are 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:52.030
 in the rg andriod folder for the new rg rg 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.450
 and you will not lose any of your 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.450
 files
