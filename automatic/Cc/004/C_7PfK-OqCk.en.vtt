00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.340 

alright<00:00:09.510> today<00:00:09.750> we're<00:00:09.840> going<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.020> talk<00:00:10.170> about

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
alright today we're going to talk about

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.990 
alright today we're going to talk about
I<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:10.710> it's<00:00:11.160> going<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> be<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.430> pretty<00:00:11.580> short<00:00:11.700> one

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
I so it's going to be a pretty short one

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.660 
I so it's going to be a pretty short one
but<00:00:12.180> nonetheless<00:00:12.809> it's<00:00:13.260> important<00:00:13.650> okay<00:00:14.490> as

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
but nonetheless it's important okay as

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.220 
but nonetheless it's important okay as
we<00:00:14.910> talked<00:00:15.150> about<00:00:15.240> couple<00:00:15.690> weeks<00:00:15.840> ago<00:00:15.930> there

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
we talked about couple weeks ago there

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.930 
we talked about couple weeks ago there
are<00:00:16.260> three<00:00:16.560> elements<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.190> try<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> get<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
are three elements to try to get the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.820 
are three elements to try to get the
correct<00:00:18.119> exposure<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.840> your<00:00:18.960> photo<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.680> is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
correct exposure on your photo one is

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.590 
correct exposure on your photo one is
aperture<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> other<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.910> shutter<00:00:21.150> speed<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
aperture the other is shutter speed and

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.750 
aperture the other is shutter speed and
the<00:00:21.720> third<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.140> ISIL<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.070> aperture<00:00:23.520> is<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the third is ISIL so aperture is the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.030 
the third is ISIL so aperture is the
opening<00:00:24.120> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.240> back<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.570> your<00:00:24.660> lens<00:00:25.040> and

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
opening in the back of your lens and

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.100 
opening in the back of your lens and
shutter<00:00:26.640> speed<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.850> how<00:00:27.210> long<00:00:27.450> the<00:00:27.660> flap<00:00:27.870> in

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
shutter speed is how long the flap in

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.960 
shutter speed is how long the flap in
front<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> sensor<00:00:28.770> stays<00:00:29.100> open<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.580> then

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
front of the sensor stays open and then

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.139 
front of the sensor stays open and then
I<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> sensitivity<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.620> the<00:00:31.650> light<00:00:32.149> so

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
I so is the sensitivity to the light so

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.970 
I so is the sensitivity to the light so
if<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.690> are<00:00:33.899> stuck<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.770> dark

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
if you are stuck in a really really dark

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
if you are stuck in a really really dark
place<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> lens<00:00:36.539> that<00:00:36.750> doesn't

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
place and you have the lens that doesn't

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.189 
place and you have the lens that doesn't
have<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> really<00:00:37.379> good<00:00:37.500> aperture<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.199> you

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
have a really good aperture and you

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.079 
have a really good aperture and you
don't<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.620> your<00:00:40.679> photos<00:00:40.949> to<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.159> blurry<00:00:41.399> it's

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
don't want your photos to be blurry it's

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:43.459 
don't want your photos to be blurry it's
really<00:00:42.420> important<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.050> play<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.350> your

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
really important that you play with your

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.689 
really important that you play with your
ISO<00:00:43.649> because<00:00:44.100> that's<00:00:44.280> really<00:00:44.460> your<00:00:44.640> only

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
ISO because that's really your only

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.729 
ISO because that's really your only
other<00:00:45.120> element<00:00:45.569> besides<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.199> creature<00:00:46.530> that

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
other element besides a creature that

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.119 
other element besides a creature that
you<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.129> play<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.429> so<00:00:48.679> what<00:00:49.679> I<00:00:49.710> would<00:00:49.859> say

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
you can play with so what I would say

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.969 
you can play with so what I would say
normally<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.909> that<00:00:51.569> on<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.839> sunny<00:00:52.379> day<00:00:52.589> and<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 
normally is that on a sunny day and a

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.619 
normally is that on a sunny day and a
place<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.429> good<00:00:53.670> light<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.179> really<00:00:54.420> want<00:00:54.569> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
place with good light you really want to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.959 
place with good light you really want to
keep<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:54.870> aperture<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.769> solo<00:00:56.519> so<00:00:56.909> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
keep your aperture your I solo so you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.819 
keep your aperture your I solo so you
want<00:00:57.179> to<00:00:57.239> keep<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> 100<00:00:57.839> which<00:00:58.319> is<00:00:58.469> normally

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
want to keep it to 100 which is normally

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.419 
want to keep it to 100 which is normally
the<00:00:58.889> average<00:00:59.309> lowest<00:00:59.729> it<00:00:59.819> will<00:00:59.969> get<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:01.429> 100

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
the average lowest it will get and 100

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.009 
the average lowest it will get and 100
will<00:01:02.550> give<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> crisp<00:01:02.969> images<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.839> can

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
will give you crisp images that you can

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
will give you crisp images that you can
process<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.100> actually<00:01:05.400> print<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.850> will<00:01:05.940> be

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
process and actually print and will be

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
process and actually print and will be
clear<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.770> raise<00:01:08.040> from<00:01:08.340> 100<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.920> way

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
clear as you raise from 100 the the way

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.680 
clear as you raise from 100 the the way
the<00:01:11.220> increases<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> goes<00:01:11.970> 100<00:01:12.570> 200<00:01:13.260> 400<00:01:13.650> 800

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
the increases it goes 100 200 400 800

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.610 
the increases it goes 100 200 400 800
1600<00:01:15.690> so<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.640> doubles<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.440> want

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
1600 so it doubles up and what you want

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.390 
1600 so it doubles up and what you want
to<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.120> go<00:01:21.240> higher<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.540> 800<00:01:22.440> 1630

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to do is as you go higher so 800 1630

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.850 
to do is as you go higher so 800 1630
200<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.300> pictures<00:01:24.900> will<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.200> grainier<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
200 your pictures will get grainier and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
200 your pictures will get grainier and
grain<00:01:26.070> years<00:01:26.370> so<00:01:26.610> they<00:01:26.850> will<00:01:26.970> look<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.330> an

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
grain years so they will look like an

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.210 
grain years so they will look like an
old<00:01:27.810> vintage<00:01:28.230> pictures<00:01:28.590> or<00:01:28.800> pictures<00:01:29.070> with

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
old vintage pictures or pictures with

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.690 
old vintage pictures or pictures with
noise<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.700> them<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:31.680> that's<00:01:31.920> not<00:01:32.460> something

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
noise in them and that's not something

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.460 
noise in them and that's not something
that<00:01:33.030> normally<00:01:33.210> people<00:01:33.720> would<00:01:33.750> want<00:01:34.140> unless

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that normally people would want unless

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.100 
that normally people would want unless
you're<00:01:34.680> trying<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.950> create<00:01:35.160> a<00:01:35.220> certain<00:01:35.520> effect

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
you're trying to create a certain effect

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.330 
you're trying to create a certain effect
so<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.830> do<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.010> you<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> be

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
able to keep your f so as low as

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.330 
able to keep your f so as low as
possible<00:01:39.600> however<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.830> know<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.190> don't

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
have a really good aperture ISO is your

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.560 
have a really good aperture ISO is your
next<00:01:43.530> best<00:01:43.710> bet<00:01:43.800> there<00:01:44.130> are<00:01:44.310> post<00:01:45.120> processing

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
next best bet there are post processing

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.570 
next best bet there are post processing
software<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.740> allows<00:01:46.980> you<00:01:47.160> to<00:01:47.250> take<00:01:47.400> the

there<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.600> your<00:02:00.720> life<00:02:00.900> so<00:02:02.510> when<00:02:03.510> you<00:02:03.630> are<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.900> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
there in your life so when you are in a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
there in your life so when you are in a
good<00:02:03.990> light<00:02:04.200> situation<00:02:04.770> keep<00:02:05.010> your<00:02:05.130> eyes<00:02:05.280> solo

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
good light situation keep your eyes solo

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.180 
good light situation keep your eyes solo
100<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.659> trick<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:07.080> if<00:02:07.590> you're<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> low

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
100 is the trick and if you're in a low

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.090 
100 is the trick and if you're in a low
light<00:02:08.399> situation<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.479> raise<00:02:09.660> it

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
light situation then you can raise it

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.260 
light situation then you can raise it
here's<00:02:11.100> my<00:02:11.160> eye<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.580> showing<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.150> it's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
here's my eye so it's showing that it's

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.699 
here's my eye so it's showing that it's
hundred<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.840> can<00:02:12.959> see<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:13.380> as<00:02:13.560> I

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
hundred and you can see that if as I

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.090 
hundred and you can see that if as I
move<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.120> it'll<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.300> from<00:02:15.510> 100<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.080> 200<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.800> 400

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
move it it'll go from 100 to 200 to 400

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.670 
move it it'll go from 100 to 200 to 400
to<00:02:17.520> 800<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:18.209> 1600<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:18.959> that's<00:02:19.110> as<00:02:19.260> high<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:19.410> my

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
to 800 to 1600 and that's as high as my

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.140 
to 800 to 1600 and that's as high as my
camera<00:02:20.040> goes<00:02:20.220> some<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.820> things<00:02:21.000> your

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
camera goes some of the things your

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.510 
camera goes some of the things your
camera's<00:02:21.480> go<00:02:21.630> higher<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.840> higher<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.489> when<00:02:23.489> I

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
camera's go higher and higher and when I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.100 
camera's go higher and higher and when I
post<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:23.940> photo<00:02:24.300> but<00:02:24.600> when<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.720> post<00:02:24.989> this

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
post this photo but when I post this

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.320 
post this photo but when I post this
video<00:02:25.260> I'll<00:02:25.500> also<00:02:25.680> post<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.310> different<00:02:27.060> images

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
video I'll also post on different images

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.190 
video I'll also post on different images
so<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.660> see<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> difference<00:02:28.170> between

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
so you can see the difference between

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.850 
so you can see the difference between
100<00:02:28.830> iso<00:02:29.160> 200<00:02:29.670> ISO<00:02:29.940> 400<00:02:30.239> iso<00:02:30.540> 1600<00:02:31.260> x<00:02:31.590> 0<00:02:31.709> and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
100 iso 200 ISO 400 iso 1600 x 0 and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.250 
100 iso 200 ISO 400 iso 1600 x 0 and
i'll<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.190> without<00:02:32.459> processing

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
i'll do that without processing

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.300 
i'll do that without processing
post-processing<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:34.800> see<00:02:34.980> exactly

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
post-processing so you can see exactly

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.920 
post-processing so you can see exactly
while<00:02:35.700> images<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.269> come<00:02:36.360> out<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.540> my<00:02:36.690> camera

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
while images that come out of my camera

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.410 
while images that come out of my camera
and<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.350> difference<00:02:37.680> between<00:02:37.800> them<00:02:38.420> for

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
and the difference between them for

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.759 
and the difference between them for
small<00:02:39.720> photos<00:02:40.050> that<00:02:40.230> you're<00:02:40.320> not<00:02:40.500> going<00:02:40.709> to

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
small photos that you're not going to

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.020 
small photos that you're not going to
print<00:02:40.950> out<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.250> difference<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.850> always

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
print out the difference is not always

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.580 
print out the difference is not always
discernible<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:42.989> not<00:02:43.140> worth<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.470> if

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
discernible so it's not worth it if

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.479 
discernible so it's not worth it if
you're<00:02:43.650> going<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.890> put<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.130> your<00:02:44.310> web<00:02:44.459> page

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
you're going to put it on your web page

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.160 
you're going to put it on your web page
you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.030> go<00:02:45.150> ahead<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.390> up<00:02:45.570> your<00:02:45.750> eye<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.019> you

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
you can go ahead and up your eye so you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.990 
you can go ahead and up your eye so you
should<00:02:46.350> probably<00:02:46.380> be<00:02:46.769> ok<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:47.880> you're

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
should probably be ok but if you're

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.490 
should probably be ok but if you're
going<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.180> print<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.959> larger<00:02:49.380> you

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
going to print it and the larger you

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.690 
going to print it and the larger you
want<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.709> print<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:50.220> instead<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.489> printing

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
want to print it so instead of printing

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.190 
want to print it so instead of printing
a<00:02:50.940> 4<00:02:51.120> x<00:02:51.239> 6<00:02:51.269> photo<00:02:51.720> if<00:02:51.810> you're<00:02:51.900> going<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.080> prove

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
a 4 x 6 photo if you're going to prove

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.380 
a 4 x 6 photo if you're going to prove
an<00:02:52.290> 8<00:02:52.440> x<00:02:52.590> 10<00:02:52.830> photo<00:02:52.860> or<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.340> poster<00:02:53.970> size<00:02:54.150> photo

an 8 x 10 photo or a poster size photo
the<00:02:54.959> larger<00:02:55.350> your<00:02:55.470> photo<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.070> more<00:02:56.250> you

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the larger your photo is the more you

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.920 
the larger your photo is the more you
will<00:02:56.519> notice<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.910> noise<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.450> more<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.690> will

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
will notice the noise the more you will

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.569 
will notice the noise the more you will
notice<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.410> pixelation<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.190> that's<00:02:59.370> really

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
notice the pixelation so that's really

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.400 
notice the pixelation so that's really
important<00:03:00.120> if<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.930> know<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.200> you're<00:03:01.290> going

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
important if you know that you're going

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.750 
important if you know that you're going

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
more reason you want to keep your eyes
