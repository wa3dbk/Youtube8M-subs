00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.920 
bass stop right now here we go
now<00:00:59.399> recording<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.000> bass<00:01:00.149> guitar<00:01:00.629> isn't

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
now recording a bass guitar isn't

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.979 
now recording a bass guitar isn't
necessarily<00:01:01.590> very<00:01:01.890> hard<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.730> fact<00:01:03.149> recording

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
necessarily very hard in fact recording

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.750 
necessarily very hard in fact recording
a<00:01:04.049> bass<00:01:04.199> guitar<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:05.010> very<00:01:05.309> similar<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
a bass guitar is very similar to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.929 
a bass guitar is very similar to
recording<00:01:06.450> an<00:01:06.600> electric<00:01:07.350> guitar<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.430> when

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
recording an electric guitar so when

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.399 
recording an electric guitar so when
you're<00:01:09.060> recording<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.540> bass<00:01:09.689> guitar<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you're recording a bass guitar it's a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.980 
you're recording a bass guitar it's a
really<00:01:10.650> good<00:01:10.770> idea<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.490> either<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
really good idea to either like to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.070 
really good idea to either like to
probably<00:01:13.320> mic<00:01:13.710> hand<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.840> whole

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
probably mic hand now I do a whole

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.899 
probably mic hand now I do a whole
entire<00:01:16.320> video<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.920> how<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.040> record<00:01:17.520> guitars

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
entire video on how to record guitars

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.999 
entire video on how to record guitars
and<00:01:18.150> Viking<00:01:18.479> amps<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> same<00:01:19.680> exact

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and Viking amps but it's the same exact

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.340 
and Viking amps but it's the same exact
concept<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.729> how<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.970> Mike<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> amp<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.170> that's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
concept on how to Mike and amp so that's

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.340 
concept on how to Mike and amp so that's
gonna<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.590> available<00:01:23.100> right<00:01:23.509> here<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.259> you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
a bass cabinet or buy a bass amp but I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.469 
a bass cabinet or buy a bass amp but I
do<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.340> suggestions<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.180> move<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
mic farther away from the amplifier and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
mic farther away from the amplifier and
you<00:01:37.020> lower<00:01:37.290> down<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.770> settings<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> mic<00:01:38.520> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
you lower down the settings on the mic a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.679 
you lower down the settings on the mic a
little<00:01:38.880> bit<00:01:39.030> because<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.420> gonna<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.659> a

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
little bit because it's gonna be a

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.090 
little bit because it's gonna be a
ladder<00:01:39.930> instrument<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:40.710> want<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.890> blow

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
ladder instrument you don't want to blow

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.450 
ladder instrument you don't want to blow
it<00:01:41.220> away<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.700> fact<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.659> would<00:01:42.840> also<00:01:42.990> suggest

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
it away in fact I would also suggest

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.770 
it away in fact I would also suggest
playing<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.729> bass<00:01:44.939> at<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> relatively<00:01:45.659> low

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
playing the bass at a relatively low

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
playing the bass at a relatively low
volume<00:01:46.439> because<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:46.979> need<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.399> of

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
volume because you don't need a lot of

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
volume because you don't need a lot of
volume<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:47.939> else<00:01:48.060> you're<00:01:48.210> gonna<00:01:48.299> start

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
volume or else you're gonna start

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.819 
volume or else you're gonna start
overpowering<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:49.290> mic<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> you're<00:01:49.740> just

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
overpowering your mic and you're just

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.170 
overpowering your mic and you're just
gonna<00:01:49.950> hear<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> lot<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> Rumble<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:51.030> on

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
gonna hear a lot of Rumble going on

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.389 
gonna hear a lot of Rumble going on
whenever<00:01:51.990> you're<00:01:52.229> playing<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.680> sound<00:01:53.159> back

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
whenever you're playing your sound back

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.030 
whenever you're playing your sound back
so<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.390> suggest<00:01:54.899> doing<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.350> now

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so that's how I'm suggest doing that now

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.709 
so that's how I'm suggest doing that now
if<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.520> want<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> different<00:01:57.360> way<00:01:57.689> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
if you want to in a different way you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
if you want to in a different way you
can<00:01:58.020> also<00:01:58.170> record<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.770> bass<00:01:59.070> directly

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
can also record your bass directly

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.880 
can also record your bass directly
through<00:02:00.149> an<00:02:00.210> audio<00:02:00.329> interface<00:02:00.689> now<00:02:01.409> I'm

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
through an audio interface now I'm

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.350 
through an audio interface now I'm
guilty<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.460> doing<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.939> couple<00:02:03.060> times

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
guilty of doing this a couple times

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.410 
guilty of doing this a couple times
because<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.259> easy<00:02:04.820> basses<00:02:05.820> always<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
because it's easy basses always have a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.850 
because it's easy basses always have a
little<00:02:06.719> bit<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.899> buzz

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
little bit of buzz

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.800 
little bit of buzz
so<00:02:07.980> it's<00:02:08.610> easy<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.060> plug<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.479> into<00:02:09.630> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so it's easy to just plug it into the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.330 
so it's easy to just plug it into the
audio<00:02:10.020> interface<00:02:10.200> put<00:02:10.649> out<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> really<00:02:11.100> low

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
audio interface put out a really low

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.690 
audio interface put out a really low
setting<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.000> lately<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:13.290> know<00:02:13.410> play<00:02:14.400> some

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
setting and lately you know play some

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.420 
setting and lately you know play some
flip<00:02:14.850> play<00:02:15.180> some<00:02:15.390> backs<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.800> that's<00:02:17.160> pretty

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
flip play some backs and that's pretty

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.220 
flip play some backs and that's pretty
easy<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.540> do<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.200> think

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
easy and you can do that and I think

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.290 
easy and you can do that and I think
that<00:02:19.500> plugging<00:02:20.010> into<00:02:20.160> an<00:02:20.370> audio<00:02:20.670> interface<00:02:20.910> is

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that plugging into an audio interface is

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.520 
that plugging into an audio interface is
much<00:02:21.510> more<00:02:21.840> doable

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
much more doable

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.350 
much more doable
when<00:02:22.830> you're<00:02:22.950> using<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.340> bass<00:02:23.550> not<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> guitar

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
when you're using a bass not a guitar

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.300 
when you're using a bass not a guitar
though<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.350> think<00:02:25.680> with<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.860> bass<00:02:26.070> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
though but I do think with a bass you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.860 
though but I do think with a bass you
are<00:02:26.460> able<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.820> do<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.180> though<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.600> have<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
are able to do it though if you have the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.590 
are able to do it though if you have the
ability<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.320> mic<00:02:28.710> your<00:02:29.460> cabinet<00:02:29.940> or<00:02:30.210> your<00:02:30.420> amp

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
ability to mic your cabinet or your amp

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.680 
ability to mic your cabinet or your amp
I<00:02:30.870> would<00:02:31.290> highly<00:02:31.680> suggest<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:33.030> if<00:02:33.300> you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
I would highly suggest that but if you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.480 
I would highly suggest that but if you
are<00:02:33.810> able<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.200> might<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:34.800> you're<00:02:34.920> able<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.310> plug

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
are able to might if you're able to plug

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.920 
are able to might if you're able to plug
into<00:02:35.640> an<00:02:35.820> audio<00:02:36.060> interface<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.420> will<00:02:36.780> work

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
into an audio interface that will work

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.420 
into an audio interface that will work
too<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.440> make<00:02:37.560> sure<00:02:37.709> all<00:02:37.740> your<00:02:37.920> settings<00:02:38.160> are

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
too just make sure all your settings are

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.100 
too just make sure all your settings are
relatively<00:02:38.940> low<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.480> you're<00:02:39.870> using

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
relatively low and you're using

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.810 
relatively low and you're using
something<00:02:40.410> like<00:02:40.530> GarageBand<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.459> may<00:02:41.580> even

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
something like GarageBand it may even

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.580 
something like GarageBand it may even
have<00:02:42.000> some<00:02:42.240> base<00:02:42.420> settings<00:02:42.840> built<00:02:43.080> into<00:02:43.410> it

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
have some base settings built into it

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.230 
have some base settings built into it
and<00:02:43.890> that's<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.400> two<00:02:44.580> ways<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.970> would<00:02:45.030> suggest

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
and that's the two ways I would suggest

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.810 
and that's the two ways I would suggest
to<00:02:45.630> record<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.110> bass<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.980> hopefully<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.400> helps

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
to record a bass so hopefully that helps

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.449 
to record a bass so hopefully that helps
check<00:02:48.030> out<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.239> recording<00:02:48.930> apps<00:02:49.170> video<00:02:49.739> and

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
check out that recording apps video and

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.710 
check out that recording apps video and
that<00:02:50.610> should<00:02:50.790> help<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.090> out<00:02:51.120> quite<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> bit

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
that should help you out quite a bit

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.990 
that should help you out quite a bit
I'll<00:02:52.320> probably<00:02:52.650> rename<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.310> video<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:53.970> it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
I'll probably rename the video so it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.080 
I'll probably rename the video so it
says<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.510> also<00:02:54.830> basis<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.580> should<00:02:57.030> help

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
says on also basis but that should help

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.520 
says on also basis but that should help
you<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.300> lot<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.140> pretty<00:02:58.380> short

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
you a lot and this is a pretty short

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.199 
you a lot and this is a pretty short
video<00:02:58.770> because<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.430> next<00:02:59.700> video<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.000> gonna<00:03:00.120> be

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
video because the next video is gonna be

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.580 
video because the next video is gonna be
really<00:03:00.480> huge<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.020> that's<00:03:01.140> kind<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.470> what

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
really huge and that's kind of what

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.290 
really huge and that's kind of what
we're<00:03:01.709> working<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:02.070> right<00:03:02.100> now<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.060> hope

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
we're working on right now so I hope

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.460 
we're working on right now so I hope
