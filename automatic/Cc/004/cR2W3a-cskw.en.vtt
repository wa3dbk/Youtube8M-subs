Vox ac30 with the top boosts a lot of
people<00:00:26.369> who<00:00:27.269> are<00:00:27.449> uninitiated<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.470> this

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
people who are uninitiated in this

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.410 
people who are uninitiated in this
wonder<00:00:29.070> about<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.490> top<00:00:29.760> boost<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.300> we'll

right<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.469> I'm<00:00:34.829> playing<00:00:35.370> through<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
right now I'm playing through what I

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.410 
right now I'm playing through what I
call<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.170> normal<00:00:37.440> channel<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:39.000> normal

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
call the normal channel on the normal

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:49.760 
call the normal channel on the normal
channel<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.989> an<00:00:40.079> AC<00:00:40.230> 30<00:00:48.079> this<00:00:49.079> might<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
channel of an AC 30 this might be the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:01.220 
channel of an AC 30 this might be the
channel<00:00:58.550> used<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> more<00:01:00.120> aggressive<00:01:00.539> type

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
channel used for a more aggressive type

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.590 
channel used for a more aggressive type
of<00:01:01.410> lead<00:01:01.649> type<00:01:01.980> tone<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:03.090> were<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
of lead type tone if we were going to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
of lead type tone if we were going to
use<00:01:03.719> any<00:01:03.989> kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.470> pedal<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> overdrive<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
use any kind of a pedal to overdrive the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.730 
use any kind of a pedal to overdrive the
air<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.450> would<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> channel<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
air this would be the channel to go to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.640 
air this would be the channel to go to
now<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.970> particular<00:01:09.229> channel<00:01:10.229> which<00:01:10.619> is

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
now on this particular channel which is

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.670 
now on this particular channel which is
the<00:01:10.830> normal<00:01:11.220> channel<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.900> tone<00:01:13.140> controls

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the normal channel the tone controls

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.980 
the normal channel the tone controls
which<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.250> basically<00:01:14.790> treble<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.450> bass<00:01:15.600> have

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
which are basically treble and bass have

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.710 
which are basically treble and bass have
little<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.590> no<00:01:16.619> effect<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.060> particular

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
little or no effect on this particular

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.399 
little or no effect on this particular
channel<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.960> thing<00:01:21.960> called<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.380> I

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
channel there is a thing called a I

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
channel there is a thing called a I
think<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:22.890> call<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.159> that's<00:01:23.520> called<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.880> cut

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
think they call it that's called a cut

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.990 
think they call it that's called a cut
it's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> reverse<00:01:24.869> presence<00:01:25.560> control<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.340> other

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
it's a reverse presence control in other

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210 
it's a reverse presence control in other
words<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> turn<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.780> goes<00:01:28.229> backwards<00:01:28.860> from<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
words it turn it goes backwards from a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.920 
words it turn it goes backwards from a
standard<00:01:29.640> knob<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.360> direction<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
standard knob and in one direction that

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.330 
standard knob and in one direction that
you<00:01:31.049> would<00:01:31.140> expect<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.680> increase<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you would expect you increase the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.880 
you would expect you increase the
presence<00:01:32.689> actually<00:01:33.689> decreases<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.740> it's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
presence actually decreases it but it's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.280 
presence actually decreases it but it's
the<00:01:35.009> same<00:01:35.250> control<00:01:35.790> only<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.750> turns<00:01:37.049> in

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
the same control only it just turns in

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.490 
the same control only it just turns in
Reverse<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.610> channel<00:01:41.960> might<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> one

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
Reverse so this channel might be the one

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.840 
Reverse so this channel might be the one
that<00:01:43.680> would<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.829> been<00:01:44.040> real<00:01:44.280> good<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that would have been real good for the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
that would have been real good for the
Rangemaster<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.780> Brian<00:01:46.079> May<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.560> something

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
Rangemaster with Brian May or something

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.569 
Rangemaster with Brian May or something
like<00:01:47.130> that

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
like that

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.530 
like that
my<00:01:48.000> volumes<00:01:48.570> are<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.170> turned<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.040> halfway<00:01:50.939> I'm

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
my volumes are not turned up halfway I'm

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.679 
my volumes are not turned up halfway I'm
about<00:01:52.159> maybe<00:01:53.159> three<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.149> these<00:01:54.479> volumes<00:01:56.689> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
about maybe three on these volumes the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.330 
about maybe three on these volumes the
second<00:01:58.140> channel<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.860> I'm<00:01:58.979> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> talk

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
shall the vibe trim channel also doesn't

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.120 
shall the vibe trim channel also doesn't
have<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:07.970> lot<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.209> tone<00:02:08.509> control<00:02:09.020> effect<00:02:09.410> pretty

have a lot of tone control effect pretty

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.530 
have a lot of tone control effect pretty
much<00:02:10.399> like<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.480> channel<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:11.990> was<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.530> in

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
much like the channel I was just in

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:27.390 
much like the channel I was just in
little<00:02:14.540> thinner<00:02:21.550> but<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.700> has<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.240> wonderful
