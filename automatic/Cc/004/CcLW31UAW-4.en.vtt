00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
is like the main Java class and

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.190 
is like the main Java class and
technically<00:03:32.340> we<00:03:32.549> could<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> lot

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
technically we could but this is a lot

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.780 
technically we could but this is a lot
safer<00:03:34.440> we<00:03:34.769> need<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> lot<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.250> areas<00:03:35.489> we're<00:03:35.700> gonna

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
safer we need a lot of areas we're gonna

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.550 
safer we need a lot of areas we're gonna
cover<00:03:36.030> all<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.329> them<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.079> we're<00:03:37.260> getting<00:03:37.410> to

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
cover all of them so we're getting to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.460 
cover all of them so we're getting to
our<00:03:37.739> tutorial<00:03:37.920> Java<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.970> our<00:03:39.209> non<00:03:39.930> updated

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
our tutorial Java in our non updated

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.349 
our tutorial Java in our non updated
version<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.420> copy<00:03:42.420> everything<00:03:43.040> cut<00:03:44.040> or

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
version and just copy everything cut or

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.690 
version and just copy everything cut or
exit<00:03:45.359> out<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.750> then<00:03:45.930> take<00:03:46.350> this<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.769> plop<00:03:47.549> it

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
exit out and then take this and plop it

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.670 
exit out and then take this and plop it
in<00:03:47.820> there<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.359> we're<00:03:48.780> gonna<00:03:48.959> get<00:03:49.140> an<00:03:49.260> error<00:03:49.560> at

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
in there and we're gonna get an error at

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.080 
in there and we're gonna get an error at
the<00:03:49.769> package<00:03:50.220> because<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.519> needs<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.880> be

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
the package because it needs to be

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.289 
the package because it needs to be
changed<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.989> calm<00:03:52.620> down<00:03:52.829> me<00:03:53.010> because<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.609> I

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
changed to calm down me because I I

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.509 
changed to calm down me because I I
guess<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.750> just<00:03:54.959> changed<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.410> but<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.400> should

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
guess I just changed it but that should

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.090 
guess I just changed it but that should
be<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.670> only<00:03:56.730> error<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.120> get<00:03:57.299> there<00:03:58.100> next

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
be the only error you get there next

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.979 
be the only error you get there next
you're<00:03:59.190> gonna<00:03:59.280> go<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.489> your<00:03:59.730> menu<00:04:00.660> because

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
you're gonna go to your menu because

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.750 
you're gonna go to your menu because
we're<00:04:01.170> gonna<00:04:01.260> get<00:04:01.470> errors<00:04:01.769> on<00:04:01.950> these<00:04:02.190> screens

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
we're gonna get errors on these screens

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.030 
we're gonna get errors on these screens
and<00:04:03.239> it's<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.780> common<00:04:04.290> error<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.650> we<00:04:04.680> just<00:04:04.890> got

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
and it's a common error so we just got

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.860 
and it's a common error so we just got
to<00:04:05.130> fix<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.459> all

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
to fix it all

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.250 
to fix it all
because<00:04:06.870> in<00:04:07.140> libgdx<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.970> 1.0<00:04:09.450> version<00:04:09.480> switch

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
because in libgdx the 1.0 version switch

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.750 
because in libgdx the 1.0 version switch
from<00:04:10.590> opengl<00:04:11.130> 10<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.579> OpenGL<00:04:12.109> 20<00:04:13.109> so<00:04:13.980> with<00:04:14.640> that

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
from opengl 10 to OpenGL 20 so with that

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.969 
from opengl 10 to OpenGL 20 so with that
being<00:04:14.940> said<00:04:15.030> we<00:04:15.900> need<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.289> get<00:04:16.500> rid<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.739> all<00:04:16.950> of

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
being said we need to get rid of all of

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.680 
being said we need to get rid of all of
the<00:04:17.310> GL<00:04:18.060> 10<00:04:18.419> stuff<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.380> do<00:04:19.769> that<00:04:19.979> we<00:04:20.850> get<00:04:21.479> rid<00:04:21.630> of

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
the GL 10 stuff so do that we get rid of

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.719 
the GL 10 stuff so do that we get rid of
this<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.349> actually<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.099> think<00:04:23.220> we<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.460> just<00:04:23.610> do

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
this and actually I think we can just do

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:24.470 
this and actually I think we can just do
if<00:04:24.090> we<00:04:24.240> type

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
if we type

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.400 
if we type
to<00:04:24.690> their<00:04:26.120> imports<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:28.440> should<00:04:28.590> work<00:04:28.830> and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
to their imports and it should work and

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.510 
to their imports and it should work and
we<00:04:31.410> also<00:04:31.560> need<00:04:31.770> update<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.130> stage<00:04:32.310> they

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
we also need update the stage they

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.340 
we also need update the stage they
changed<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.000> so<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.240> don't<00:04:33.390> really<00:04:33.720> need<00:04:33.930> to

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
changed it so you don't really need to

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.960 
changed it so you don't really need to
put<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.740> parameters<00:04:34.920> it<00:04:35.430> just<00:04:35.580> kind<00:04:35.700> of<00:04:35.760> takes

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
put the parameters it just kind of takes

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.000 
put the parameters it just kind of takes
up<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.210> whole<00:04:36.240> screen<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:37.410> just<00:04:37.680> get<00:04:37.800> rid<00:04:37.920> of

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
up the whole screen so just get rid of

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.950 
up the whole screen so just get rid of
everything<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:38.550> may<00:04:38.790> instantiate<00:04:39.780> the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
everything and just may instantiate the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.950 
everything and just may instantiate the
stage<00:04:40.200> as<00:04:40.560> with<00:04:41.280> no<00:04:41.460> parameters<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.300> we<00:04:42.780> just

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
stage as with no parameters and we just

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.830 
stage as with no parameters and we just
have<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.140> do<00:04:43.260> that<00:04:43.320> with<00:04:43.500> everything<00:04:43.710> else<00:04:43.980> so

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
have to do that with everything else so

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.700 
have to do that with everything else so
let's<00:04:45.840> see<00:04:46.080> here

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
let's see here

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.550 
let's see here
physics<00:04:47.400> screen<00:04:47.760> get<00:04:48.420> rid<00:04:48.540> of<00:04:48.570> GL<00:04:48.930> 10<00:04:49.260> we

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
physics screen get rid of GL 10 we

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.370 
physics screen get rid of GL 10 we
didn't<00:04:49.770> really<00:04:49.860> use<00:04:49.950> it<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.310> guess<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:51.380> you

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
didn't really use it I guess and you

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.020 
didn't really use it I guess and you
just<00:04:52.860> got<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.100> go<00:04:53.190> through<00:04:53.370> all<00:04:53.430> these<00:04:53.670> and

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
just got to go through all these and

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.720 
just got to go through all these and
just<00:04:54.270> get<00:04:54.390> rid<00:04:54.510> of<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.660> GL<00:04:54.900> tens<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:55.730> change

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
just get rid of the GL tens and change

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.960 
just get rid of the GL tens and change
these<00:04:56.940> two<00:04:57.330> GL<00:04:57.930> 20<00:04:58.680> because<00:04:59.280> we're<00:04:59.460> updated

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
these two GL 20 because we're updated

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.740 
these two GL 20 because we're updated
and<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.390> have<00:05:00.510> to<00:05:00.600> import<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.020> obviously<00:05:01.470> so

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
and you have to import that obviously so

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.730 
and you have to import that obviously so
if<00:05:03.750> we<00:05:04.470> do<00:05:04.620> that<00:05:04.800> change<00:05:05.700> that<00:05:05.850> to<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.000> 20<00:05:06.740> import

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
if we do that change that to a 20 import

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.800 
if we do that change that to a 20 import
it<00:05:08.390> and<00:05:09.390> get<00:05:10.050> rid<00:05:10.230> of<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.500> GL<00:05:11.070> 10<00:05:11.370> we<00:05:12.210> should<00:05:12.540> be

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
it and get rid of the GL 10 we should be

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.910 
it and get rid of the GL 10 we should be
completely<00:05:13.770> good<00:05:14.190> -<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:15.030> stage<00:05:15.300> here<00:05:15.810> so<00:05:16.500> we

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
completely good - the stage here so we

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.250 
completely good - the stage here so we
got<00:05:17.040> the<00:05:17.130> stage

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
got the stage

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.750 
got the stage
everything<00:05:19.260> should<00:05:19.680> be<00:05:19.740> looking<00:05:20.190> good<00:05:20.220> so

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
everything should be looking good so

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.160 
everything should be looking good so
we're<00:05:20.910> gonna<00:05:21.030> run<00:05:21.420> it<00:05:21.540> really<00:05:21.720> quick<00:05:21.930> just<00:05:21.960> to

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
we're gonna run it really quick just to

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.460 
we're gonna run it really quick just to
make<00:05:22.380> sure<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:23.900> y'all<00:05:24.900> look<00:05:25.080> forward<00:05:25.380> to

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
make sure and y'all look forward to

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.750 
make sure and y'all look forward to
tomorrow<00:05:25.590> because<00:05:25.950> I'm<00:05:26.130> making<00:05:26.280> one<00:05:26.550> heck<00:05:26.730> of

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
tomorrow because I'm making one heck of

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.210 
tomorrow because I'm making one heck of
a<00:05:26.910> tutorial<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.810> it's<00:05:28.590> probably<00:05:28.770> gonna<00:05:28.950> cover

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
a tutorial and it's probably gonna cover

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.480 
a tutorial and it's probably gonna cover
a<00:05:29.640> lot<00:05:30.210> of<00:05:30.830> big<00:05:31.830> a<00:05:32.130> pretty<00:05:32.850> big<00:05:33.890> way<00:05:34.890> to<00:05:34.950> develop

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
a lot of big a pretty big way to develop

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.490 
a lot of big a pretty big way to develop
games<00:05:35.730> and<00:05:36.690> I<00:05:36.780> think<00:05:36.990> it's<00:05:37.110> freaking<00:05:37.380> awesome

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
games and I think it's freaking awesome

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.350 
games and I think it's freaking awesome
so<00:05:37.950> look<00:05:38.310> forward<00:05:38.550> to<00:05:38.610> that<00:05:38.730> spoiler<00:05:39.030> alert

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
so look forward to that spoiler alert

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.070 
so look forward to that spoiler alert
and<00:05:39.600> we<00:05:39.690> actually<00:05:40.050> get<00:05:40.170> an<00:05:40.290> error<00:05:40.410> because

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
and we actually get an error because

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.820 
and we actually get an error because
when<00:05:43.080> we<00:05:43.170> have<00:05:43.260> to<00:05:43.350> do<00:05:43.500> next<00:05:43.740> is<00:05:44.100> we<00:05:44.520> have<00:05:44.790> to

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
when we have to do next is we have to

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.070 
when we have to do next is we have to
take<00:05:46.830> all<00:05:47.010> of<00:05:47.100> our<00:05:47.250> assets<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:47.850> were<00:05:48.060> in<00:05:48.420> our

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
take all of our assets that were in our

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.740 
take all of our assets that were in our
survivor<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:50.280> not<00:05:50.370> in<00:05:50.460> our<00:05:50.580> survival<00:05:51.000> no<00:05:51.330> in

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
survivor and not in our survival no in

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.890 
survivor and not in our survival no in
our<00:05:51.990> tutorial<00:05:53.180> Android<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.420> move<00:05:54.570> them<00:05:54.720> over

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
our tutorial Android and move them over

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.050 
our tutorial Android and move them over
because<00:05:55.530> we<00:05:55.620> have<00:05:55.710> all<00:05:55.800> these<00:05:56.010> assets<00:05:56.490> but<00:05:56.790> our

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
because we have all these assets but our

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.660 
because we have all these assets but our
updated<00:05:58.020> version<00:05:58.380> doesn't<00:05:58.530> have<00:05:58.680> access<00:05:59.190> to

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
updated version doesn't have access to

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.390 
updated version doesn't have access to
these<00:05:59.940> assets<00:06:00.240> so<00:06:01.020> we<00:06:01.140> just<00:06:01.260> take<00:06:01.440> them<00:06:01.620> copy

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
these assets so we just take them copy

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.780 
these assets so we just take them copy
them<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:02.850> then<00:06:03.750> we<00:06:04.230> go<00:06:04.740> into<00:06:04.890> here<00:06:05.460> and<00:06:05.640> we

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
them and then we go into here and we

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.980 
them and then we go into here and we
paste<00:06:06.060> them<00:06:06.330> and<00:06:06.510> we<00:06:06.570> can<00:06:06.660> get<00:06:06.750> rid<00:06:06.900> of<00:06:06.930> that

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
paste them and we can get rid of that

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.200 
paste them and we can get rid of that
bad<00:06:07.230> logic<00:06:07.530> G<00:06:08.190> job<00:06:08.850> JPEG<00:06:09.510> and<00:06:10.250> it<00:06:11.250> should<00:06:11.910> run

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
bad logic G job JPEG and it should run

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.190 
bad logic G job JPEG and it should run
now<00:06:12.890> and<00:06:13.890> voila<00:06:14.550> we<00:06:14.940> have<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.840> updated

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
now and voila we have the updated

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.320 
now and voila we have the updated
version<00:06:16.650> of<00:06:16.770> these<00:06:17.010> lazy<00:06:17.250> try<00:06:17.490> our<00:06:17.700> tutorials

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
version of these lazy try our tutorials

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.110 
version of these lazy try our tutorials
all<00:06:19.200> of<00:06:19.500> the<00:06:19.650> things<00:06:20.160> should<00:06:20.400> work<00:06:20.640> I<00:06:20.910> should

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
all of the things should work I should

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.520 
all of the things should work I should
probably<00:06:21.210> make<00:06:21.420> a<00:06:21.480> back<00:06:21.840> button<00:06:22.080> for<00:06:22.350> some<00:06:22.470> of

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
probably make a back button for some of

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.010 
probably make a back button for some of
this<00:06:22.620> stuff<00:06:22.680> but<00:06:23.190> the<00:06:24.090> physics<00:06:24.420> works<00:06:24.600> as<00:06:24.810> well

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
this stuff but the physics works as well

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.320 
this stuff but the physics works as well
the<00:06:25.980> the<00:06:26.400> red<00:06:26.580> screen<00:06:26.790> don't<00:06:27.030> worry<00:06:27.240> about

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
the the red screen don't worry about

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.270 
the the red screen don't worry about
that<00:06:27.630> that's<00:06:27.840> just<00:06:28.020> because<00:06:28.200> the<00:06:28.680> coloring<00:06:29.130> is

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
that that's just because the coloring is

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.600 
that that's just because the coloring is
weird<00:06:29.760> but<00:06:31.280> this<00:06:32.280> should<00:06:32.460> work<00:06:32.610> as<00:06:32.820> well<00:06:33.060> and

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
weird but this should work as well and

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.380 
weird but this should work as well and
actually<00:06:35.610> we're<00:06:35.730> gonna<00:06:35.820> have<00:06:35.970> to<00:06:36.030> we're<00:06:36.270> going

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
actually we're gonna have to we're going

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.900 
actually we're gonna have to we're going
to<00:06:36.450> cover<00:06:36.570> that<00:06:36.720> in<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:36.870> next<00:06:36.930> tutorial

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
to cover that in the next tutorial

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.630 
to cover that in the next tutorial
surpriiise<00:06:39.780> must<00:06:40.200> be<00:06:40.290> called<00:06:40.530> again<00:06:40.770> I'll

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
surpriiise must be called again I'll

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.450 
surpriiise must be called again I'll
shoot<00:06:41.820> yeah<00:06:42.150> so<00:06:42.690> we<00:06:42.780> got<00:06:42.810> to<00:06:43.050> cover<00:06:43.260> this<00:06:44.220> as

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
because I actually got ahead of myself

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.240 
because I actually got ahead of myself

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
see this because this is code for next

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.220 
see this because this is code for next
time<00:06:54.840> but<00:06:55.830> don't<00:06:56.580> worry<00:06:56.820> about<00:06:56.970> this<00:06:58.850> because

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
gonna try to close this out and wrap it

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.990 
gonna try to close this out and wrap it
up<00:07:24.360> but<00:07:24.870> that's<00:07:25.680> kind<00:07:25.950> of<00:07:26.010> how<00:07:26.310> you<00:07:26.370> transfer
