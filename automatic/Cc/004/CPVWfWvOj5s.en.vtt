 as you understand without a name 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.030
 This means that people here say no

 poor but they are willing to pay 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.270
 precisely for the optimal ratio 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.720
 they need to understand why this product 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.009
 or service is worth the money 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.479

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.390

 universal goods under 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.500

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.720
 price cheap chinese things fake 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.760
 the main thing is to have a low price quality 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.490
 here it doesn't matter anymore 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.030
 all shout that expensive why is 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.550

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.760
 group need to work very simply if 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.020
 You are not targeting this market segment. 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.970
 cheapest below average 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.910
 here you need to answer also there 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.209
 expensive and people will be on their own 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.550
 fall off but if this person 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.390
 other category optimal ratio 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.450
 price quality 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.090
 or webclient who just decided 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.370
 say that a little expensive like that here you 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.970
 should just explain to him what it is 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.390
 worth some money that's all 4 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.080
 Group 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.560
 yes if 4 there are people who are looking only 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.380
 even cheaper, or rather free so 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.090
 called the ball that is here they came 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.870
 they want to get free free 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.840
 consultation free examination 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.450
 why do you have it worth the money 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.850
 why not free of charge here for the question 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.459
 customer and why you are not free 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.769
 need sharpens so where did you see that it 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:36.280
 in general is sold for free tell me I 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:39.850
 I'll go myself and take it and that 's it 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.510
 work with the objection you have dear and I 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.750
 I can find cheaper and buy cheaper 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.010
 The first option is also to say that 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.680
 quality service or 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.190
 quality goods worth certain 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.040
 of money 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.560
 let's specify what the amount will be for 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.410
 you are acceptable and here the client is already responding 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.570
 and you can pick up by its pricing 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.930
 level already suitable service or 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.430
 goods if 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.480
 there are some options you can take away or 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.859
 add the second option you say 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.010
 quality products quality 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.560
 the service is worth some money in this 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.180
 case i'm ready to meet 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.239
 offer a small discount here too 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.449
 price negotiation begins 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:27.580
 what else could be the best again 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:33.070
 option is to give value to the client 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:37.729
 when your service or item costs less 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:41.800
 the more its value the more willing 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.800
 and so much the better, and bye
