00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
have the shorter scale neck design if

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.459

you<00:00:59.760> look<00:00:59.940> closely<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.719> these<00:01:00.899> guitars<00:01:01.289> you'll

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you look closely at these guitars you'll

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
you look closely at these guitars you'll
see<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> next<00:01:02.010> size<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.399> identical<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.390> them

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
see the next size is identical on them

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.780 
see the next size is identical on them
it's<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> body<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.280> big<00:01:05.489> baby

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it's just that the body on the big baby

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.620 
it's just that the body on the big baby
is<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.140> bigger<00:01:08.119> than<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> small

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
is a little bit bigger than the small

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.820 
is a little bit bigger than the small
one<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.869> therefore<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.470> gonna<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
one and therefore it's gonna have a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.940 
one and therefore it's gonna have a
little<00:01:11.040> bit<00:01:11.280> bigger<00:01:11.520> sound<00:01:11.939> than<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.630> baby<00:01:12.990> if

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
little bit bigger sound than the baby if

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
little bit bigger sound than the baby if
you're<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> beginner<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:15.450> remember<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and also we've got the playability value

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.450 
and also we've got the playability value
there<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.150> well<00:01:36.619> we're<00:01:37.619> gonna<00:01:37.740> probably<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.189> 30

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
there as well we're gonna probably be 30

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.969 
there as well we're gonna probably be 30
to<00:01:38.640> 40<00:01:38.909> percent<00:01:39.060> easier<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> play<00:01:39.869> I'm<00:01:40.860> gonna

just a little smaller guitar and

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.880 
just a little smaller guitar and
therefore<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:53.720> gonna<00:02:53.840> sound<00:02:54.110> just<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.590> little

therefore it's gonna sound just a little

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.699 
therefore it's gonna sound just a little
bit<00:02:55.040> smaller<00:02:55.970> than<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.930> bigger<00:02:57.110> guitar<00:02:57.470> here

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709

and<00:02:57.890> as<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.519> reference<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.299> found<00:02:59.750> out<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.080> took<00:03:00.380> a

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
and as a reference I found out I took a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.650 
and as a reference I found out I took a
big<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.519> a<00:03:01.549> full<00:03:01.790> sized<00:03:02.060> red<00:03:02.330> here<00:03:02.569> I'm

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
big this is a full sized red here I'm

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.380 
big this is a full sized red here I'm
going<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.840> put<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.410> in<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.680> picture<00:03:04.069> here

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
going to put this in the picture here

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.650 
going to put this in the picture here
and<00:03:05.390> step<00:03:05.690> back<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.000> can<00:03:08.150> see<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.450> size

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
and step back so you can see the size

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.780 
and step back so you can see the size
differences<00:03:09.350> here<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.370> left<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.760> have

playability value is going to be the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.630 
playability value is going to be the

the baby you see on the left here it's a

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.620 
the baby you see on the left here it's a
little<00:03:35.959> bit<00:03:36.079> shorter<00:03:36.500> neck<00:03:37.480> you're<00:03:38.480> gonna

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
little bit shorter neck you're gonna

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.319 
little bit shorter neck you're gonna
have<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> little<00:03:39.170> bit<00:03:39.410> smaller<00:03:40.040> space<00:03:40.549> between

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
have a little bit smaller space between

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.069 
have a little bit smaller space between
the<00:03:41.480> frets<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.820> therefore<00:03:43.820> certain<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.959> know

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
the frets and therefore certain you know

the frets and therefore certain you know
four<00:03:45.440> finger<00:03:45.829> chords<00:03:46.340> are<00:03:46.549> going<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.730> be<00:03:46.850> just

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
four finger chords are going to be just

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.580 
four finger chords are going to be just
a<00:03:47.180> little<00:03:47.209> bit<00:03:47.600> easier<00:03:48.049> on<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.290> smaller

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
a little bit easier on the smaller

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.460 
a little bit easier on the smaller
guitars<00:03:49.010> than<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:49.970> big<00:03:50.180> it's<00:03:50.780> close<00:03:51.170> but

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
guitars than the big it's close but

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.170 
guitars than the big it's close but
you'll<00:03:52.190> notice<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.519> little<00:03:52.670> bit<00:03:52.850> difference

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
you'll notice a little bit difference

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.390 
you'll notice a little bit difference
there<00:03:53.390> so<00:03:54.170> there's<00:03:54.350> there's<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.769> aspect<00:03:55.190> and

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
there so there's there's that aspect and

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.250 
there so there's there's that aspect and
playability<00:03:55.790> but<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.600> neck<00:03:56.780> circumference

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
playability but the neck circumference

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.380 
playability but the neck circumference
