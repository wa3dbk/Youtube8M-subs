00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
face criminal charges with tax evasion

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.460 
face criminal charges with tax evasion
of<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.860> size<00:01:53.100> yet<00:01:53.939> he<00:01:54.180> did<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.540> address<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470

issue until he was nominated

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.429 
issue until he was nominated
and<00:01:57.789> I<00:01:58.090> think<00:01:58.149> that<00:01:58.359> just<00:01:58.659> shows<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.869> problem

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
and I think that just shows a problem

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.830 
and I think that just shows a problem
with<00:01:59.590> integrity<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.340> we<00:02:00.880> cannot<00:02:01.210> afford<00:02:01.420> that

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
with integrity and we cannot afford that

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.599 
with integrity and we cannot afford that

has to pay his taxes what does that mean

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.530 
has to pay his taxes what does that mean
for<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.690> rule<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:37.989> law<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:39.310> our<00:02:39.549> country<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.209> I

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
for the rule of law in our country so I

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.890 
for the rule of law in our country so I
opposed<00:02:41.470> him<00:02:41.860> but<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.310> think<00:02:42.670> since<00:02:43.030> he<00:02:43.599> seemed

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
opposed him but I think since he seemed

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.289 
opposed him but I think since he seemed
to<00:02:43.930> be<00:02:44.140> positioned<00:02:44.890> as<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> only<00:02:45.730> person<00:02:46.150> who

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
to be positioned as the only person who

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.990 
to be positioned as the only person who
could<00:02:46.450> do<00:02:46.629> this<00:02:46.840> job<00:02:47.010> which<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.160> disagreed<00:02:48.730> with

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
could do this job which I disagreed with

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.390 
could do this job which I disagreed with
I<00:02:49.269> think<00:02:49.750> even<00:02:50.019> some<00:02:50.379> Republicans<00:02:50.650> felt<00:02:51.220> like

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
I think even some Republicans felt like

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.460 
I think even some Republicans felt like
they<00:02:51.610> needed<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.910> honor<00:02:52.180> President<00:02:53.049> Obama's
