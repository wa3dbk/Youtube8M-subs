00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.630 

ok<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.090> I've<00:01:20.420> written<00:01:20.720> hi<00:01:21.470> subscribe<00:01:22.250> but<00:01:22.550> it

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
ok so I've written hi subscribe but it

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.340 
ok so I've written hi subscribe but it
was<00:01:22.730> enough<00:01:22.940> room<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.450> fit<00:01:23.480> the<00:01:23.810> e<00:01:23.840> on<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.320> end

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
was enough room to fit the e on the end

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.219 
was enough room to fit the e on the end
but<00:01:24.800> you'd<00:01:25.100> get<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.460> overall<00:01:25.880> gist<00:01:26.180> of<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:26.510> and

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
but you'd get the overall gist of it and

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:39.800 
but you'd get the overall gist of it and
if<00:01:27.320> we<00:01:27.440> go<00:01:27.590> for<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:27.860> thicker<00:01:28.130> one<00:01:28.430> I<00:01:28.670> can<00:01:28.880> write

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.170 

okay<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:41.040> supposed<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.399> be<00:01:41.430> mr.<00:01:41.820> Android

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.530 
okay that's supposed to be mr. Android
app<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:43.290> obviously<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:44.820> completely<00:01:45.299> useless

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
app but obviously I'm completely useless

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.480

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
to write but basically you get the idea

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.940 
to write but basically you get the idea
of<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.490> application<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.409> really
