00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.330
 we shoot films everything is loving 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.280
 so far not even organized loved ones 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.720
 really surprise 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.530
 next to that is the world changing that 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.530
 fantastic believe so likely 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.050
 this christmas march at 20 degrees in 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.500
 the sun with the dome can say yes 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.360
 that's it 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.910
 I think of it as similar to the one in 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.390
 caribbean me so far not at all 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.489
 I could get the Christmas tree 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.410
 but is actually quite pleasant 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.460
 do not freeze or it is better 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.770
 the other way round 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.699
 it is better than anywhere else on the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.699
 parquet nora tschirner where then wilke 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.379
 mÃ¶hring and and and and all the elmar 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.729
 wepper and I forgot all 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.030
 everyone loves my darling 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.030
 plays 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.240
 tell me with children so turning only once 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.310
 me that you too a little a little 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.320
 Gegenpart have a child and not 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.860
 professional actors and 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.720
 actor 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.590
 I have to say so my daughter fisher 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.450
 met and she is great 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.570
 plays with his very early with his 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.060
 courage and with a permeability and reindeer 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.640
 around and without calls out loud and jumps into 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.490
 water and it makes it so great that was 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.080
 really whole 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.610
 I think it's cool that you sometimes as 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.560
 actress the receptionist 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.640
 yes, it's cool that you're cool 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.830
 as an actress no 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.869
 So love story game has to do that 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.340
 I found somehow even more special than 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.590
 I read the book I thought something for 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.789
 a horny figure that they are not 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.230
 love story is playing that now 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.420
 not always the one who suffers and the one 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.790
 wall and somehow there it goes 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.390
 in fact to her own 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.920
 self-discovery on a piece and around there 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.690
 this creates a nice friendship 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.610
 then with this older man, but where 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.230
 no romantic feelings 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.970
 getting in the way is always that 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.880
 problem if you have a husband and a wife 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.360
 hates practicing as it is somehow 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.760
 to sizzle and that's ok yes 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.470
 but it's rare that you can do that 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.709
 not play and the tournament totally 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.709
 Great 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.400
 I would be glad if that 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.630
 People in the cinema are all doing this 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:57.210
 but honestly and was so sure 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.440
 but in any case touches that is so 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.660
 a bit closer the strand of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.820
 maybe you should feel that 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.570
 is my impression of what love be 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.770
 I 'm not the damned one 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.770
 Christmas market emotion 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.290
 My grandma has always said he is dear 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.290
 the most important thing in life 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.989
 I love you
