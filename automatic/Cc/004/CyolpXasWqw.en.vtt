gone with a serrated edge knife I found
that<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> cut<00:02:02.729> them<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.939> lot<00:02:03.119> easier<00:02:03.509> than<00:02:03.630> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
that it cut them a lot easier than a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.600 
that it cut them a lot easier than a
flat<00:02:03.930> edged<00:02:04.079> knife<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.979> I'm<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.189> gonna<00:02:05.310> cut

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
flat edged knife so I'm just gonna cut

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.980 
flat edged knife so I'm just gonna cut
it<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.790> half<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.299> then<00:02:06.420> I'm<00:02:06.509> gonna<00:02:06.600> kind<00:02:06.930> of

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it in half and then I'm gonna kind of

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.499 
it in half and then I'm gonna kind of
soar<00:02:07.350> through<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.740> wafer<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.390> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
soar through the wafer like so so that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.119 
soar through the wafer like so so that
it's<00:02:09.629> got<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> nice<00:02:10.020> point<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.860> bit<00:02:11.039> of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
little rippled line which kind of looks

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.110 
little rippled line which kind of looks
like<00:02:49.140> where<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.440> ice<00:02:49.590> cream<00:02:49.950> over<00:02:50.160> hangs<00:02:50.640> over

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
like where the ice cream over hangs over

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.850 
like where the ice cream over hangs over
the<00:02:51.209> cone<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.110> make<00:02:52.290> sure<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.560> start<00:02:52.739> all

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
the cone so make sure that you start all

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.740 
the cone so make sure that you start all
the<00:02:52.950> way<00:02:53.040> down<00:02:53.250> one<00:02:53.430> end<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.940> then<00:02:54.360> go<00:02:54.510> back
