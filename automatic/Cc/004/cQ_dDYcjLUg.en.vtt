most of the snow golems just doing their
so<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:49.290> guys<00:03:49.500> decide<00:03:49.950> if<00:03:50.490> you<00:03:50.730> think<00:03:51.210> there's

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
so you guys decide if you think there's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.390

snow<00:03:52.020> golems<00:03:52.350> were<00:03:52.470> about<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.920> kill<00:03:53.100> him<00:03:53.220> or

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
snow golems were about to kill him or

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.670 
snow golems were about to kill him or
not<00:03:53.730> if<00:03:54.210> he<00:03:54.450> just<00:03:54.690> stayed<00:03:54.930> up<00:03:54.960> there<00:03:55.320> but

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
not if he just stayed up there but

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.550 
not if he just stayed up there but
unfortunately<00:03:56.010> kind<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.240> know<00:03:57.390> got<00:03:58.050> out

of<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.100> arena<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.520> think<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.820> only<00:03:59.940> reason<00:04:00.390> why

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
of the arena I think the only reason why

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.660 
of the arena I think the only reason why
the<00:04:01.110> weather<00:04:01.350> was<00:04:01.620> kind<00:04:01.800> of<00:04:01.890> sweet<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.460> gets

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
the weather was kind of sweet and gets

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.070 
the weather was kind of sweet and gets
himself<00:04:02.820> out<00:04:03.210> on<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.570> arena<00:04:03.630> when<00:04:03.990> he

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
himself out on the arena when he

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.110
