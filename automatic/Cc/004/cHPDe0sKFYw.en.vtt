00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.000
 video in boxing for big pc box 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.340
 youtube today we bring you the mouse x 20 that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.750
 is editec designed especially for 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.150
 play we see here the product 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.100
 and we're going to take it out of the box so that 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:28.380
 you can see its characteristics 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.660
 we put together and now we will pass 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.059
 a little review for your 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.030
 technical characteristics besides that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.100
 we connect it and we also see also the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.040
 content of the house that simply the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.670
 mouse and a small manual in which we 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.420
 will explain its characteristics 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.600
 It also explains how to configure the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.190
 mouse through your software we see that 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.440
 the wire 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.600
 resistant was meshed which we 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.350
 improves the durability we will increase 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.350
 the usb port 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.410
 and we see up here 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.410
 the mouse as it changes color 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.410
 among its multiple 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.410
 drawings 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.550
 the design as we can see is 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.230
 We can take ambidextrous so much with 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.230
 the right hand as with the left 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.210
 in which we can access all the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.390
 buttons if it's not on the right is on the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.050
 left and not miss any we see 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.180
 that right on the wheel 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.880
 as I press the button 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.300
 changing color this is simply 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.120
 an indicator of the country we have 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:50.560
 selected that we can go from the 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.200
 500 to 4000 and always knowing 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.740
 thanks to the country selector that is going 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.430
 illuminating we see that the color of the mouse 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.480
 is changing has also the lighting 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.520
 customizable through software by 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.250
 if we do not like the effect that goes 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.890
 making the mouse automatically 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.500
 the software should be noted that it is 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.150
 exceptional that is an advanced software 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.319
 in which we can configure very well 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.609
 the mouse 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.700
 the weight is not customizable but yes 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:26.189
 It is true that it is not very heavy and very 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.990
 light for our taste is very 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.140
 right 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.350

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.360
