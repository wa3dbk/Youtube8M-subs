00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
broccoli and garlic there here I'm using

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.160 
broccoli and garlic there here I'm using
artichokes<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.270> Dutch<00:02:39.270> white<00:02:39.540> clover<00:02:39.870> in

artichokes and Dutch white clover in
combination<00:02:40.920> they<00:02:41.520> work<00:02:41.700> quite<00:02:42.000> well<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
combination they work quite well the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.900 
combination they work quite well the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
artichokes again another great perennial

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.370 
artichokes again another great perennial
in<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.090> garden<00:02:45.420> out<00:02:45.570> here<00:02:45.600> on<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.080> west<00:02:46.260> coast

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
in the garden out here on the west coast

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.360 
in the garden out here on the west coast
when<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> clover<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.060> also<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.900> perennial<00:02:49.709> it

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
when the clover is also a perennial it

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.240 
when the clover is also a perennial it
is<00:02:50.610> also<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> legume<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.170> fixes<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.650> lot<00:02:52.830> of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
is also a legume and it fixes a lot of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.580 
is also a legume and it fixes a lot of
nitrogen<00:02:53.640> keeps<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.450> ground<00:02:54.660> covered<00:02:55.230> here

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
nitrogen keeps the ground covered here

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.979 
nitrogen keeps the ground covered here
so<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.430> doesn't<00:02:56.489> bake<00:02:57.120> during<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.690> summer

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
so it doesn't bake during the summer

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.590 
so it doesn't bake during the summer
heat<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.769> it<00:02:59.370> doesn't<00:02:59.700> leach<00:02:59.970> during<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
heat and it doesn't leach during the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.729 
heat and it doesn't leach during the
winter<00:03:00.840> rains<00:03:02.330> before<00:03:03.330> I<00:03:03.360> come<00:03:03.720> in<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.110> start

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
winter rains before I come in and start

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.830 
winter rains before I come in and start

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
planting my peppers and tomatoes this

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.620 
planting my peppers and tomatoes this
spring<00:03:07.230> I'll<00:03:08.160> be<00:03:08.400> cutting<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.060> clover<00:03:09.420> back

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
spring I'll be cutting the clover back

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.050 
spring I'll be cutting the clover back
trim<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.560> back<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.160> would<00:03:11.310> been<00:03:11.459> half<00:03:11.670> into

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
trim it back and it would been half into

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360 
trim it back and it would been half into
the<00:03:12.180> ground<00:03:12.420> put<00:03:13.200> all<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.500> new<00:03:13.620> plants<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.130> and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
the ground put all the new plants in and

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.550 
the ground put all the new plants in and
just<00:03:14.489> let<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.820> spring<00:03:15.239> back<00:03:15.480> up<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:16.320> whole

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
just let it spring back up this whole

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.500 
just let it spring back up this whole
nasty<00:03:17.100> looking<00:03:17.459> bunch<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.850> stuff<00:03:18.090> over<00:03:18.360> here

nasty looking bunch of stuff over here

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.870 
nasty looking bunch of stuff over here

is apple trees with alfalfa fava beans

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.509 
is apple trees with alfalfa fava beans
and<00:03:24.239> we<00:03:24.450> get<00:03:24.570> some<00:03:24.780> black<00:03:25.320> cap<00:03:25.709> raspberries

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
and we get some black cap raspberries

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.460 
and we get some black cap raspberries
growing<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.269> tomato<00:03:27.630> cages<00:03:27.959> and

winter rye fava beans and alfalfa below
the<00:03:32.519> alfalfa<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.330> particularly<00:03:33.959> nice<00:03:34.410> plant

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
the alfalfa is a particularly nice plant

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.360 
the alfalfa is a particularly nice plant
Peretz<00:03:35.489> long-lived<00:03:36.269> perennial<00:03:36.870> bees<00:03:37.709> love<00:03:38.160> it

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
Peretz long-lived perennial bees love it

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.180 
Peretz long-lived perennial bees love it
so<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.730> draws<00:03:38.970> pollinators<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.680> prett<00:03:40.980> SAR

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
so it draws pollinators but a prett SAR

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.150 
so it draws pollinators but a prett SAR
really<00:03:41.850> really<00:03:42.450> deep<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.080> so<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.860> plant

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
really really deep and so this plant

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.759 
really really deep and so this plant
will<00:03:44.370> draw<00:03:44.640> nutrients<00:03:45.390> up<00:03:45.660> from<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.959> subsoils

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
will draw nutrients up from the subsoils

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.650 
will draw nutrients up from the subsoils
that<00:03:46.950> have<00:03:47.040> been<00:03:47.160> lost<00:03:47.400> from<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.880> top<00:03:48.120> years

that have been lost from the top years

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.349 
that have been lost from the top years
ago<00:03:49.100> bring<00:03:50.100> them<00:03:50.220> back<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.760> leaves<00:03:51.030> and

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
ago bring them back in the leaves and

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.130 
ago bring them back in the leaves and
then<00:03:51.510> when<00:03:51.660> we<00:03:51.780> cut<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.170> plant<00:03:52.410> down<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.950> like

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
then when we cut the plant down and like

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.790 
then when we cut the plant down and like
in<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.380> garden<00:03:53.710> for<00:03:53.920> mulch<00:03:54.130> they<00:03:54.910> rerelease

in the garden for mulch they rerelease

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.920 
in the garden for mulch they rerelease
bring<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.920> back<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.340> our<00:03:57.510> vegetable<00:03:58.510> series

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
bring it back to our vegetable series

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.040 
bring it back to our vegetable series
winter<00:03:59.290> rye<00:03:59.470> underneath<00:04:00.130> raspberries<00:04:01.050> I'll

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
winter rye underneath raspberries I'll

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.110 
winter rye underneath raspberries I'll
just<00:04:02.290> let<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.650> Rye<00:04:02.800> come<00:04:03.160> up<00:04:03.310> grow<00:04:03.730> underneath

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
just let the Rye come up grow underneath

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.660 
just let the Rye come up grow underneath
there<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.810> then<00:04:05.020> it'll<00:04:05.530> perish<00:04:06.010> due<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.370> dry

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
there and then it'll perish due to dry

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.030

it fall down underneath the berries as a
mulch<00:04:11.380> so<00:04:12.010> I'll<00:04:12.100> get<00:04:12.250> my<00:04:12.370> own<00:04:12.490> straw<00:04:12.820> mulch
