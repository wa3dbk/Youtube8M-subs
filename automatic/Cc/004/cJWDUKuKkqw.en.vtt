when I get to a painting one of the
things<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.750> I'll<00:00:45.840> be<00:00:45.870> talking<00:00:46.170> about<00:00:46.380> is

modeling the form and the shadow that

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.630 
modeling the form and the shadow that
I'm<00:00:53.160> drawing<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:55.050> example<00:00:55.640> it's

I'm drawing here now is one example it's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.479 
I'm drawing here now is one example it's
following<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:59.040> form<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:01.309> field<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
following the the form of this field and

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.770 
following the the form of this field and
the<00:01:02.610> foreground<00:01:02.940> that's<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.040> the

the foreground that's one of the the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
the foreground that's one of the the
interesting<00:01:06.780> things<00:01:07.229> about<00:01:07.350> shadows<00:01:08.009> as<00:01:08.220> they

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
interesting things about shadows as they

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.130 
interesting things about shadows as they
help<00:01:08.640> describe<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:10.740> form<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.729> being

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
help describe the the form that is being

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:24.240 
help describe the the form that is being
described

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.950 

the<00:01:25.250> way<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.970> light<00:01:26.150> is<00:01:26.390> here<00:01:26.659> on<00:01:26.869> the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
the way that the light is here on the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.170 
the way that the light is here on the
snow<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.320> probably<00:01:27.979> what<00:01:28.250> attracted<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.030> me

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
snow is probably what attracted to me

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.080 
snow is probably what attracted to me
initially<00:01:29.680> when<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.710> was<00:01:30.950> driving<00:01:31.700> around

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
initially when I was driving around

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.980 
initially when I was driving around
looking<00:01:32.689> for<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:34.280> motif<00:01:34.790> as<00:01:35.270> its<00:01:35.540> called

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
looking for the the motif as its called

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.770 
looking for the the motif as its called
the<00:01:36.890> impressionist<00:01:37.850> painters<00:01:38.210> called<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
the impressionist painters called the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:59.940 
the impressionist painters called the
subject<00:01:39.259> was<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:40.789> motif

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.300 

this<00:02:00.549> warm<00:02:01.210> color<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:02.439> I'm<00:02:02.560> using<00:02:02.590> for<00:02:03.159> this

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
this warm color that I'm using for this

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.880 
this warm color that I'm using for this
snow<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.909> white<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.350> Naples<00:02:05.350> yellow<00:02:05.560> will

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
snow the white and Naples yellow will

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.580 
snow the white and Naples yellow will
also<00:02:06.610> make<00:02:06.789> a<00:02:06.820> nice<00:02:08.640> contrast<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
also make a nice contrast to the the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.550 
also make a nice contrast to the the
blue<00:02:11.980> casts<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.069> shadows<00:02:15.489> so

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.680 

we're<00:02:20.560> contrasting<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.610> value<00:02:22.420> and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
we're contrasting the value and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:42.200 
we're contrasting the value and
contrasting<00:02:23.910> temperature<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.769> color

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.270 

up<00:02:43.210> in<00:02:43.420> here<00:02:43.810> by<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:43.990> tree<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.620> edges<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.220> a

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
up in here by the tree the edges get a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.500 
up in here by the tree the edges get a
little<00:02:46.200> distinct<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:48.150> ambiguous<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.480> to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
little distinct and ambiguous as to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.180 
little distinct and ambiguous as to
where<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.990> shrubs<00:02:50.650> begin<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:53.190> just

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
where the shrubs begin and and so just

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.290 
where the shrubs begin and and so just
kind<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.550> scumbling

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
kind of scumbling

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.330 
kind of scumbling
that's<00:02:55.600> what<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:55.930> process<00:02:56.410> right<00:02:57.070> here<00:02:57.280> is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
that's what this process right here is

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:13.890 
that's what this process right here is
called<00:02:57.960> humbling

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.699 

go<00:03:14.900> ahead<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.049> little<00:03:15.140> more<00:03:15.349> toward<00:03:15.650> the

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
go ahead a little more toward the

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.160 
go ahead a little more toward the
lavender<00:03:16.340> there<00:03:16.609> right<00:03:17.060> now<00:03:17.359> there's<00:03:17.959> also

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
lavender there right now there's also

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.459 
lavender there right now there's also
some<00:03:18.790> kind<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:20.859> ridges<00:03:21.859> in<00:03:22.099> the<00:03:22.129> in<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:23.469> grass

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:24.469 
some kind of ridges in the in the grass

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:29.649 
some kind of ridges in the in the grass
field<00:03:25.310> area<00:03:25.760> here<00:03:27.280> that's<00:03:28.280> what<00:03:28.549> this<00:03:29.269> area

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
field area here that's what this area

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:39.300 
field area here that's what this area
right<00:03:29.810> there<00:03:30.079> that<00:03:30.260> I'm<00:03:30.379> doing<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:36.909> there's<00:03:37.909> a

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
right there that I'm doing is there's a

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.899 
right there that I'm doing is there's a
term<00:03:40.310> for<00:03:41.590> when<00:03:42.590> you<00:03:42.739> use<00:03:42.950> a<00:03:42.980> variety<00:03:43.579> of

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
term for when you use a variety of

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.530 
term for when you use a variety of
colors<00:03:44.030> especially<00:03:44.659> in<00:03:45.139> pastel<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:47.150> have<00:03:47.359> one

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
colors especially in pastel we have one

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.569 
colors especially in pastel we have one
color<00:03:47.810> on<00:03:47.989> top<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.439> each<00:03:48.650> other<00:03:48.859> it's<00:03:49.250> called

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
color on top of each other it's called

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.289 
color on top of each other it's called
fractured<00:03:50.450> color<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.169> so<00:03:51.889> I'm<00:03:52.669> blending<00:03:53.180> them

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
fractured color and so I'm blending them

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.990 
fractured color and so I'm blending them
here<00:03:53.510> now<00:03:53.719> but<00:03:54.099> if<00:03:55.099> I<00:03:55.280> were<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.519> leave<00:03:55.760> these

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
here now but if I were to leave these

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.709 
here now but if I were to leave these
rush<00:03:56.329> strokes<00:03:56.629> set<00:03:57.019> up<00:03:57.169> and<00:03:57.439> have<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.849> lot<00:03:59.569> of

00:03:59.709 --> 00:03:59.719 
rush strokes set up and have a lot of

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.490 
rush strokes set up and have a lot of
early<00:04:00.590> several<00:04:01.310> different<00:04:01.669> colors<00:04:02.239> of

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
early several different colors of

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.659 
early several different colors of
similar<00:04:03.500> hue<00:04:04.069> and<00:04:04.519> value<00:04:05.949> and<00:04:06.949> so<00:04:07.280> I'm<00:04:07.370> sort<00:04:07.579> of

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:12.399 
similar hue and value and so I'm sort of
fracturing<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.930> color<00:04:10.510> breaking<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.659> up<00:04:11.870> into

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
fracturing the color breaking it up into

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:21.699 
fracturing the color breaking it up into
different<00:04:15.669> adjacent<00:04:16.669> hues<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:21.049> can<00:04:21.199> probably

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
different adjacent hues you can probably

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.260 
different adjacent hues you can probably
kind<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.159> see<00:04:22.370> that<00:04:22.490> under<00:04:22.880> some<00:04:23.060> of<00:04:23.090> the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
kind of see that under some of the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.360 
kind of see that under some of the
lavenderish<00:04:23.780> color<00:04:24.349> and<00:04:24.650> some<00:04:24.919> of<00:04:25.039> the<00:04:25.190> more

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
lavenderish color and some of the more

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:34.909 
lavenderish color and some of the more
bluish<00:04:26.120> color<00:04:27.190> interspersed<00:04:28.190> there

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:41.609 

okay<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.789> now<00:04:37.059> I'll<00:04:37.269> go<00:04:37.449> over<00:04:37.479> here<00:04:37.839> to<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:40.619> to

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:41.619 
okay and now I'll go over here to the to

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:46.549 
okay and now I'll go over here to the to
the<00:04:41.739> foliage<00:04:42.099> and<00:04:43.649> catch<00:04:44.649> some<00:04:44.979> of<00:04:45.129> the

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:46.559 
the foliage and catch some of the

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:52.429 
the foliage and catch some of the
accents<00:04:47.559> of<00:04:47.709> light<00:04:48.189> coming<00:04:48.579> from<00:04:48.689> behind<00:04:50.789> and

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
accents of light coming from behind and

00:04:52.439 --> 00:05:02.239 
accents of light coming from behind and
hitting<00:04:53.439> certain<00:04:54.959> leaves

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:02.249 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:07.569 

here<00:05:02.879> and<00:05:03.089> there<00:05:03.269> just<00:05:03.539> to<00:05:04.039> get<00:05:05.039> this<00:05:06.319> idea<00:05:07.319> of

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:07.579 
here and there just to get this idea of

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:19.970 
here and there just to get this idea of
light<00:05:08.579> from<00:05:08.879> behind<00:05:09.179> backlighting

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.900 

in<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.180> pastel<00:05:22.080> I'd<00:05:22.520> indicated<00:05:23.520> that<00:05:23.640> more

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
in the pastel I'd indicated that more

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.020 
in the pastel I'd indicated that more
with<00:05:24.210> them<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:26.690> more<00:05:27.690> intense<00:05:28.170> red<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:29.640> wasn't

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
with them the more intense red it wasn't

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.850 
with them the more intense red it wasn't
that<00:05:30.180> much<00:05:30.360> change<00:05:30.660> of<00:05:30.900> value<00:05:31.320> here<00:05:31.590> it's<00:05:31.680> more

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
that much change of value here it's more

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.570 
that much change of value here it's more
of<00:05:31.980> a<00:05:32.070> change<00:05:32.400> of<00:05:32.580> value<00:05:33.480> than<00:05:34.580> intensity

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
of a change of value than intensity

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.440 
of a change of value than intensity
meaning<00:05:35.940> it's<00:05:36.090> it's<00:05:36.600> actually<00:05:37.080> going<00:05:37.290> that

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
meaning it's it's actually going that

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.450 
meaning it's it's actually going that
later
