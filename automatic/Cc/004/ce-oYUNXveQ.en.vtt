00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
hey there this is my lego transformers

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.459 
hey there this is my lego transformers
blackout<00:00:08.150> he's<00:00:09.150> what<00:00:09.450> i<00:00:09.480> would<00:00:09.690> consider<00:00:09.840> nano

blackout he's what i would consider nano
scale<00:00:11.900> and<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> comparison<00:00:13.920> between

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
scale and here is a comparison between

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
scale and here is a comparison between
him<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.830> my<00:00:17.810> nano<00:00:18.810> scale<00:00:19.430> Lego<00:00:20.660> transformer

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
skids and mudflap that's a mouthful it

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.430 
skids and mudflap that's a mouthful it
might<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> little<00:00:31.410> touch<00:00:31.890> big<00:00:35.329> compares

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
might be a little touch big compares

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
might be a little touch big compares
compared<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.239> remember<00:00:39.480> correctly

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
compared but if I remember correctly

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.619 
compared but if I remember correctly
he's<00:00:40.020> an<00:00:40.140> mh-53<00:00:40.700> which<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> huge<00:00:42.510> helicopter

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.720 

because<00:00:48.629> i'm<00:00:48.960> lazy<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.039> comes<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
because i'm lazy when it comes to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.450 
because i'm lazy when it comes to
coloring<00:00:51.719> my<00:00:51.930> transformers<00:00:53.030> correctly<00:00:54.030> um

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
coloring my transformers correctly um

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.630 
coloring my transformers correctly um
he's<00:00:56.460> got<00:00:57.059> some<00:00:57.660> weird<00:00:58.350> colors<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.160> him<00:00:59.309> such

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
he's got some weird colors on him such

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.930 
he's got some weird colors on him such
as<00:00:59.789> our<00:00:59.969> red<00:01:00.239> tail<00:01:01.219> one<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.309> these<00:01:02.399> clips<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
as our red tail one of these clips is

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.560 
as our red tail one of these clips is
red<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:06.210> white<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.350> black<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.580> could

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
red and white and black so I could

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.800 
red and white and black so I could
change<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.020> later<00:01:10.049> make<00:01:10.650> an<00:01:10.740> update<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.420> not

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
change it later make an update but not

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.140 
change it later make an update but not
sure<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.450> these<00:01:15.840> pieces<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:17.150> actually

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
sure I have these pieces here actually

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.070 
sure I have these pieces here actually
our<00:01:18.869> becomes<00:01:19.799> his<00:01:20.009> hands<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:21.000> using<00:01:21.600> them<00:01:21.810> as

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
our becomes his hands I'm using them as

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.109 
our becomes his hands I'm using them as
lending<00:01:22.560> your<00:01:22.770> otherwise<00:01:25.640> kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.700> flops

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
lending your otherwise kind of flops

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.499 
lending your otherwise kind of flops
down<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.070> that's<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.189> very<00:01:29.340> dignified

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.920 

as<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> transformation<00:01:34.290> oh<00:01:35.630> one<00:01:36.630> second

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
as for the transformation oh one second

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.490 
as for the transformation oh one second
before<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.460> actually<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.750> biggest<00:01:39.930> problem

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
before that actually the biggest problem

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.899 
before that actually the biggest problem
you<00:01:40.560> may<00:01:40.710> notice<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.460> him<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.380> his<00:01:43.909> blades

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
you may notice about him is his blades

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.219 
you may notice about him is his blades
here<00:01:45.420> actually<00:01:46.070> there<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.750> coming<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
here actually there are coming on the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.499 
here actually there are coming on the
real<00:01:49.470> helicopter<00:01:49.710> there's<00:01:50.479> five<00:01:51.479> or<00:01:51.930> six<00:01:53.509> six

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
real helicopter there's five or six six

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.609 
real helicopter there's five or six six
I<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:55.009> and<00:01:56.210> obviously<00:01:57.210> since<00:01:57.930> he's<00:01:58.200> really

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
I think and obviously since he's really

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.819 
I think and obviously since he's really
small<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.340> wasn't<00:01:59.850> able<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.860> do<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:03.680> okay<00:02:04.680> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
small I wasn't able to do that okay so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.609 
small I wasn't able to do that okay so
to<00:02:05.100> transform<00:02:05.790> him<00:02:05.960> ustream<00:02:06.960> make<00:02:07.350> sure<00:02:07.560> those

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
to transform him ustream make sure those

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.120 
to transform him ustream make sure those
are<00:02:07.829> straight

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
are straight

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.300 
are straight
and<00:02:09.670> then<00:02:10.380> another<00:02:11.380> straight<00:02:12.870> make<00:02:13.870> sure<00:02:13.900> is

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and then another straight make sure is

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.670 
and then another straight make sure is
going<00:02:15.310> straight<00:02:15.670> across<00:02:15.760> like<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.680> fold

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
going straight across like that fold

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.720 
going straight across like that fold
these<00:02:17.890> back<00:02:22.020> okay<00:02:23.100> down<00:02:24.100> like<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.670> you

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
these back okay down like that and you

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.050 
these back okay down like that and you
take<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:25.030> front<00:02:25.360> part<00:02:26.490> up<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:27.700> back<00:02:27.850> like

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
take this front part up and back like

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.250 
take this front part up and back like
that<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.530> take<00:02:29.770> his<00:02:29.920> hands<00:02:30.490> fold<00:02:31.180> them<00:02:31.360> built

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.230 

then<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.380> bring<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.920> whole<00:02:36.460> side<00:02:36.820> assembly

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
then you bring this whole side assembly

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.110 
then you bring this whole side assembly
forward<00:02:38.160> okay<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:41.010> then<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.220> take<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.730> back

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
forward okay then then you take the back

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.140 
forward okay then then you take the back
here<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.290> these<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:45.010> bend<00:02:45.310> out<00:02:45.490> just<00:02:45.940> a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
here and these just bend out just a

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:54.270 
here and these just bend out just a
touch<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:50.370> yeah<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:52.650> sometimes<00:02:53.650> from

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
touch like that yeah and sometimes from

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.220 
touch like that yeah and sometimes from
lucky<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.940> can<00:02:55.180> get<00:02:55.360> him<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.510> stand<00:02:55.780> up<00:02:56.050> straight

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
lucky I can get him to stand up straight

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.810 
lucky I can get him to stand up straight
sometimes<00:02:59.230> when<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.740> bend<00:03:00.040> him<00:03:00.250> back<00:03:02.820> he's

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
sometimes when you bend him back he's

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.170 
sometimes when you bend him back he's
not<00:03:04.000> terribly<00:03:04.180> accurate<00:03:04.840> actually<00:03:05.550> but<00:03:06.550> he's

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
not terribly accurate actually but he's

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.560 
not terribly accurate actually but he's
nano<00:03:07.660> scale<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.910> um<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:13.060> kind<00:03:13.270> of<00:03:13.300> hard<00:03:13.510> to

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
nano scale so um it's kind of hard to

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.810 
nano scale so um it's kind of hard to
him<00:03:13.810> make<00:03:14.200> him<00:03:14.320> perfectly<00:03:14.710> accurate<00:03:17.400> as<00:03:18.400> to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
him make him perfectly accurate as to

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.450 
him make him perfectly accurate as to
articulation<00:03:19.690> his<00:03:19.930> arms<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.860> move<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.310> little

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
articulation his arms to move a little

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.760 
articulation his arms to move a little
bit<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.970> especially<00:03:22.480> his<00:03:22.780> forearm<00:03:23.350> that's

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
bit and especially his forearm that's

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.260 
bit and especially his forearm that's
the<00:03:23.980> big<00:03:24.160> one<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:25.390> that's<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:26.020> legs<00:03:26.830> was<00:03:27.700> he

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
the big one so that's a legs was he

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.340 
the big one so that's a legs was he
bends<00:03:28.480> his<00:03:28.900> legs<00:03:29.400> vivid<00:03:30.400> move<00:03:30.880> inland

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
bends his legs vivid move inland

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.730 
bends his legs vivid move inland
individually<00:03:32.350> or<00:03:32.610> together<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:34.620> bending<00:03:35.620> at

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
individually or together to bending at

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.260 
individually or together to bending at
