by the end of tonight you probably are

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.979 
by the end of tonight you probably are
you<00:02:13.739> know<00:02:13.860> how<00:02:14.010> much<00:02:14.159> you'll<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.430> 250<00:02:15.239> k<00:02:15.450> two<00:02:15.900> of

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
you know how much you'll be 250 k two of

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.539 
you know how much you'll be 250 k two of
the<00:02:16.079> girls<00:02:16.110> actually<00:02:16.439> scored<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.129> these<00:02:17.280> clips

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
the girls actually scored in these clips

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.550 
the girls actually scored in these clips
were<00:02:17.670> actually<00:02:18.000> quite<00:02:18.120> easy<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.959> one

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
were actually quite easy like one

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.839 
were actually quite easy like one
deflection<00:02:20.159> the<00:02:20.189> other<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.579> went<00:02:20.730> through

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
deflection the other one went through

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.240 
deflection the other one went through
the<00:02:20.939> keepers<00:02:21.239> legs<00:02:21.450> or<00:02:21.569> something<00:02:21.870> but<00:02:22.250> yeah

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
the keepers legs or something but yeah

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.190 
the keepers legs or something but yeah
so<00:02:23.430> he's<00:02:23.549> going<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.819> about<00:02:23.909> 250<00:02:24.659> k<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> hope

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
so he's going to be about 250 k I hope

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.100 
so he's going to be about 250 k I hope
or<00:02:25.439> I<00:02:25.470> think<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.670> even<00:02:26.939> for<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.390> price<00:02:27.659> you

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
or I think and even for that price you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.929 
or I think and even for that price you
can<00:02:28.290> get<00:02:28.409> much<00:02:28.739> better<00:02:29.040> cubs<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.760> get

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
can get much better cubs you can get

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.699 
can get much better cubs you can get
probably<00:02:30.329> vandervoort<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.379> can<00:02:31.560> get

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
probably vandervoort you can get

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.309 
probably vandervoort you can get
informed<00:02:32.280> good<00:02:32.489> sir<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:33.329> can<00:02:33.510> get<00:02:33.689> royce

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
if you're going to get mullah as a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.149 
if you're going to get mullah as a
novice<00:02:40.140> Lee<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.349> man<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.620> much<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.920> would

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
novice Lee the man that much I would

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.039 
novice Lee the man that much I would
recommend<00:02:41.519> trying<00:02:41.909> them<00:02:42.090> out<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.390> least<00:02:42.780> at

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
recommend trying them out at least at

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.319 
recommend trying them out at least at
centre-forward<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:44.010> not<00:02:44.489> at<00:02:44.609> stryker<00:02:44.970> because

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
centre-forward if not at stryker because

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.000 
centre-forward if not at stryker because
I<00:02:45.359> do<00:02:45.510> think<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:45.959> he'll<00:02:46.170> be<00:02:46.260> good<00:02:46.409> there<00:02:46.680> he's

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
I do think that he'll be good there he's

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.770 
I do think that he'll be good there he's
six<00:02:47.340> foot<00:02:47.489> one<00:02:47.700> he's<00:02:47.819> got<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:47.970> decent<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.659> know

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
six foot one he's got a decent you know

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.080 
six foot one he's got a decent you know
Ariel<00:02:49.349> presence<00:02:49.829> there<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.519> be<00:02:50.700> able<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:50.940> score

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
Ariel presence there so be able to score

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.430 
Ariel presence there so be able to score
a<00:02:51.150> couple<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.420> her<00:02:51.480> husband<00:02:51.810> he<00:02:51.930> wasn't<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.319> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
a couple of her husband he wasn't in the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.649 
a couple of her husband he wasn't in the
box<00:02:52.709> enough<00:02:53.010> for<00:02:53.129> me<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.700> only<00:02:54.150> problem<00:02:54.389> with

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
box enough for me the only problem with

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.660 
box enough for me the only problem with
planar<00:02:54.870> Matt<00:02:55.079> Striker<00:02:55.349> as<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.799> he<00:02:55.920> has<00:02:56.129> got<00:02:56.400> high

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
planar Matt Striker as I he has got high

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.330 
planar Matt Striker as I he has got high
high<00:02:56.970> work<00:02:57.299> rate<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.620> probably

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
high work rate that is the probably

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.550 
high work rate that is the probably
major<00:02:59.670> downside<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.659> our<00:03:00.780> bowlers<00:03:01.019> card<00:03:01.379> and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
major downside to our bowlers card and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.050 
major downside to our bowlers card and
that<00:03:02.069> means<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.400> he's<00:03:02.519> going<00:03:02.639> to<00:03:02.700> be<00:03:02.760> quite

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
that means that he's going to be quite

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.580 
that means that he's going to be quite
defensive<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.780> quite<00:03:04.079> attacking<00:03:04.470> at<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
defensive and quite attacking at the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.080 
defensive and quite attacking at the
same<00:03:04.739> time<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.519> you're<00:03:05.639> looking<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.909> play

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
same time so if you're looking to play

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.610 
same time so if you're looking to play
on<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.299> country<00:03:06.629> attack<00:03:06.840> with<00:03:07.019> mullah<00:03:07.260> he's

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
on the country attack with mullah he's

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.050 
on the country attack with mullah he's
probably<00:03:07.829> not<00:03:08.010> gonna<00:03:08.159> be<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.400> best<00:03:08.579> player<00:03:08.819> a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
probably not gonna be the best player a

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.879 
probably not gonna be the best player a
very<00:03:09.420> slow<00:03:09.780> player<00:03:10.049> good<00:03:10.319> dribbling<00:03:10.829> skills

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
very slow player good dribbling skills
