00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello my name is marÃ­a monica verdor en 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.970
 and today I'm going to teach you how to make three 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.340
 very simple hairstyles that you can 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.890
 serve for the occasion that you prefer 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.980
 you will only need combs hooks 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.760
 small and a little something that you 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.580
 you prefer to decorate 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.369
 you will take your comb and behind you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.250
 bangs will select a small part 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.240
 of hair this part of the hair you're going 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 to throw back and then place a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.960
 small pincer to hold it such 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.510
 what you see in the video then you go to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.890
 do the same thing on the other side of you 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.890
 head so that it stays the same 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.600
 This hairstyle is very simple and in fact 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.820
 the difference it makes is that it takes as 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.090
 a volume here on the sides but 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.160
 it really is very very simple and easy to 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.020
 do the hairstyle that we will do now is a 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.730
 little bit more elaborate but I'm going to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.330
 explain calmly to do so 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.520
 well in their homes 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.220
 The first thing you should do is separate 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.410
 your bangs or a section of hair 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.740
 forward in the back 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.320
 you will make a halfway road then 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.660
 you take a section of hair in that 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.100
 back and what you will start to 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.100
 do is a press 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.470
 this press will be three and the section of 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.990
 hair that is in the front will be the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.920
 that will start looking for the center that 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.240
 is behind will look for the center and the new 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.720
 hair wick left towards the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.030
 front of our head will need a 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.430
 little more hair which is 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.720
 incorporates and continues to make the braid 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.420
 from behind always the hair wick that 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.540
 is left in the front of the head will be the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.750
 to take a little more hair and 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.840
 reincorporate into the braid this is 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.080
 so that the braid can be left over 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.750
 stuck to your head then when you go 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.670
 below you will stop looking for new 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.950
 new sections of hair and 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.170
 you will simply continue doing 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.660
 braid three in a simple way 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.200
 in the end, subject to the league that you 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.200
 you prefer 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.230
 ah 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.230
 let's go with the next hairstyle you're going to 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.560
 split your hair on the side and on the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.540
 part where you have less hair 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.360
 to take a small section of it 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.959
 this section you're going to start 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.959
 roll up 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.600
 and after having it well rolled up the 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.600
 hold ace in the back 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.740
 you repeat the same procedure with new 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.780
 hair 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.780
 and hold very well 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.030
 they are only three rolls so the one 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.030
 comes is the last 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.250
 you already have another hairstyle 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.030

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.030
