00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.270
 due to the behavior of the 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.620
 percent this video that I'm going to do today is for 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.979
 so that Cáceres to explain about the facilitated dissemination 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.039
 well I will show you the parts so that you 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.060
 by the way go recognize the family spruces in a bit with that 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.069
 good here we have 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.460
 this one as he has reiterated 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.640
 is the protein channel 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.590
 we see that the prophecy is more expensive 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.930
 percent this rebound that like the cachitos cha 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.870
 that it seems like it was closed as a channel to enter anything 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.040
 is called 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 carrier protein ocáriz 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.600
 In this part we have the phospholipids 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.730
 Sanz every little thing times as he is checking 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.320
 k of political affairs is called my phospholipid coat 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.430
 so they are both ends and up and my bed is closer 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.610
 percent 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.050
 admit good phosphate is an abbreviation here at &amp; t 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.420
 what is the energy that the body uses especially for the time 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.540
 for metabolic processes p 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.540
 vacant escape we will have to be potassium 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.650
 and that said 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.200
 blind in this eastern center of concentration where the majority are 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.430
 of 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.220
 from these part these molecules 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.650
 attacks as beautiful 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.650
 there is another one that circulated that will represent a crazy molecule 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.930
 which is much larger than the molecules of sodium and potassium 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 then I will go and sing in the cusco 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.200
 the good here 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 demus the particles that there are or the molecules 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.880
 potassium and sodium 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.880
 the airbus or facilitated the molecules 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.590
 advance of emerging concentration 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.410
 at a lower concentration 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.079
 of higher concentration 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.609
 call to medium electronic equipment 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.609
 to one of lower concentration mediterranean polycom 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.089
 I am going to show you 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.089
 ee uu in the explanation that I'm going to do what I'm going to do with him 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.289
 are with sodium 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:25.789
 hence, good for what 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.319
 he told me only one of them 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.319
 and good so that it will not be opposed let's finish that there are three 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.119
 i the kf3 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.089
 and there is one that is shifting can be out 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.879
 or it can be in parked 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.149
 whenever there is eta meta4 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:48.039
 and here and 3 then can k have to go back to Asia and so on 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.989
 of elders whenever she does not call me 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.019
 efe the area 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.789
 hassan vega - 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:56.299
 we are fine 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.139
 it has to do with the mucosa 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.519
 and with potassium 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.430
 some molecules are too big to pierce was the center 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.219
 clinical 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.879
 and too hydrophilic how to stop after passing the vica opel phospholipids 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.119
 as is the case of glucose and some other amino acids 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:21.309
 in this the photo comes in depending on the carrier protein since it is the 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:24.419
 unique capable of transporting 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.419
 these molecules so big 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.659
 first of all glucose binds 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.509
 on par with other carrier 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.929
 and this makes the web created by pedro exportadora also forms allowing 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.719
 well the passage of glucose 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:45.109
 ea as soon as the bolocco reaches the cytoplasm a kinase on top had 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.069
 of a phosphate group still in his kart converts glucose into groups at 6 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.699
 phosphate 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:56.119
 this causes glucose concentrations inside the cell to be 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.189
 always very low 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:03.569
 after this the glucose is transformed into another substance is indispensable for 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.889
 the creation of energy 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.229
 This procedure does not require energy at &amp; t inc 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:17.199
 what did they say about the DTT in energy etc and the body? 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.069
 especially the processes mind the metabolism 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.029
 does not require tepeyac energy that was 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:28.029
 in favor of the seer concentration of the most concentrated lover 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.340
 to another of lower concentration 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.340
 that the facilitated discussion, above all, continue like this 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.400
 since it is done to expel all the waste that she metabolizes from 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.300
 cells and to acquire new teeth 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.659
 the carrier protein what it does is to maintain the constant flow of the 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.479
 glucose 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.610
 blind in ohio I think that is the whole explanation that I have been able to give 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.659
 US closed from here from Colombia for all 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.120
 for everyone 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.439
 i good thank you very much for your attention 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:03.689
 To follow 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.729
 they practice that they keep visiting and this is a good thing 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:07.659
 a very good page
