00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.460
 hello to all so today we 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.130
 let's make a khartoum envelope 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.080
 so head-shaped here a little bit 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.120
 of cartoon birds that you can after 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.460
 coloring them put in color as 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.680
 you want to see if it wraps simplex 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.680
 and back and its opening system 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.410
 little message that can be here at 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.109
 interior 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.099
 so I showed you in a few 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.550
 a few steps we will see this 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.410
 envelope 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.150
 so we need a little bit of 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.800
 material as usual action to 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 paper 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 in clear double- sided tape and a 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.350
 rule to start we will trace our 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.340
 envelope on a sheet a3 so the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.070
 bases are standard no 21 by ten and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.500
 half so a first rectangle that you 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.789
 then duplicate below so it 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.530
 we make two rectangles from the inside 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 by di segni two little legs of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.350
 two centimeter collage of each 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.820
 side 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.289
 plus a triangle 6 cm high with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.750
 the extra to center on the on the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.090
 rectangle and two half circles that you 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.189
 are going to come centered can trace a 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.020
 little right here during the circles and 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.650
 you will come center and two halves 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.840
 circle 4 cm in diameter in this 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.100
 level of the wrapped 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.330
 once you've got this schema 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.340
 we will be able to go to the pump 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.570
 so we've already started with 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.040
 mark households so first thing 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.430
 with the back of the cutter we will score here 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.430
 everything would swim 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:45.140
 orange valves and and watch out for that 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.399
 level there high level of re najlae on 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.270
 going to Rennes but not on the whole 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.130
 length of an envelope 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.420
 we will only follow our work 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.319
 that is to say Rennes the beginning in the middle 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.640
 desserts pride hunger does you 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.060
 do not you have to mark the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.709
 paper inside the two circles 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.179
 once all that is done we go 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.269
 can cut where they are used 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:11.049

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:11.049

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.080

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:51.989
 we will have a little cut to do 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.989
 at the level of two golden eyes 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.610
 once all the cuts are done 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.750
 we notice folds so it's okay 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.750
