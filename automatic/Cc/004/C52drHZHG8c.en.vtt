can actually actually well managed to do

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.220 
can actually actually well managed to do
in<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> game<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.270> hilarious<00:00:33.780> fact<00:00:34.020> is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
in this game but the hilarious fact is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
in this game but the hilarious fact is
it<00:00:34.800> shouldn't<00:00:35.520> actually<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.210> difficult

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
it shouldn't actually be that difficult

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.729 
it shouldn't actually be that difficult
to<00:00:36.750> do<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> ton<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:38.610> ton<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.840> achievements<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
to do a ton of a ton of achievements and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.319 
to do a ton of a ton of achievements and
the<00:00:40.980> simple<00:00:41.280> reason<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> course

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the simple reason for that is of course

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.180 
the simple reason for that is of course
I<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:44.450> you<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.719> create<00:00:46.110> basically<00:00:46.590> everything

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
I I you can create basically everything

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.190 
I I you can create basically everything
now<00:00:47.370> cosi<00:00:48.059> restrictions<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.930> been<00:00:48.989> lifted

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
now cosi restrictions have been lifted

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.380 
now cosi restrictions have been lifted
if<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.620> can't<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.730> remember<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.360> correctly

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
if I can't if I remember it correctly

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.650 
if I can't if I remember it correctly
and<00:00:52.579> with<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.030> only<00:00:54.149> restriction<00:00:54.480> that

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
and with that the only restriction that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.560 
and with that the only restriction that
I<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.170> have<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:56.030> faith<00:00:57.030> related

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
I really will have here on faith related

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.029 
I really will have here on faith related
so<00:00:57.750> I'll<00:00:57.899> probably<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.530> too<00:00:58.800> big<00:00:58.980> of

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
so I'll probably not have too big of

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.790 
so I'll probably not have too big of
around<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.550> probably<00:00:59.910> around<00:01:00.059> Italy<00:01:00.800> probably

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
around me probably around Italy probably

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.299 
around me probably around Italy probably
potentially<00:01:02.370> Italy<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.350> Greece<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> speak

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
potentially Italy and Greece so to speak

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.590 
potentially Italy and Greece so to speak
if<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.840> go<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:08.250> Joe<00:01:08.640> map<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.000> no<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
if we do go to have Joe map here no I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.030 
if we do go to have Joe map here no I
say<00:01:10.080> Italy<00:01:10.439> croatia<00:01:10.710> slavonia<00:01:11.130> Rushka<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.450 
western part of bison an empire if I
take<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.409> basically<00:01:16.470> habits<00:01:17.040> my<00:01:17.159> realm

take that and basically habits my realm

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.940 
take that and basically habits my realm
in<00:01:17.640> order<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.090> power<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.950> just

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
in order to have power and just

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700 
in order to have power and just
understand<00:01:20.340> buildup<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.479> power<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.320> i<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.560> go

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
understand buildup of power so i can go

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.270 
understand buildup of power so i can go
off<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.070> achievements<00:01:23.810> basically<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.280> don't

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
end of the game that's the plan i have

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.720 
end of the game that's the plan i have
no<00:02:37.800> idea<00:02:38.040> how<00:02:38.250> will<00:02:38.490> actually<00:02:38.850> work<00:02:39.030> out<00:02:39.330> but

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
no idea how will actually work out but

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.510 
no idea how will actually work out but
pretty<00:02:41.730> sure<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.000> will<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.210> fairly<00:02:43.520> fairly

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
pretty sure it will be fairly fairly

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.890 
pretty sure it will be fairly fairly
interesting<00:02:44.970> here<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> big<00:02:45.330> question<00:02:45.660> now<00:02:45.690> is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
interesting here the big question now is

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.420 
interesting here the big question now is
I<00:02:45.930> said<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.650> start<00:02:46.920> as<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.550> at<00:02:48.350> a

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
I said that we would start as a at a

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.660 
I said that we would start as a at a
well<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:53.270> damn<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:55.070> merchants<00:02:56.070> Republic<00:02:56.490> that's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
well a damn it merchants Republic that's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.850 
well a damn it merchants Republic that's
the<00:02:56.790> word<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> think<00:02:58.080> we'll<00:02:58.320> actually<00:02:58.440> start

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
the word so I think we'll actually start

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.340 
the word so I think we'll actually start
as<00:02:59.070> Venice<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.550> Capua<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.630> basically<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
as Venice of Capua that is basically the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.610 
as Venice of Capua that is basically the
only<00:03:01.530> choices<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:02.490> have<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.730> think<00:03:03.500> when<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
only choices we have I think when it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.340 
only choices we have I think when it
comes<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:05.510> whether<00:03:06.510> or<00:03:06.630> not<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:06.870> actually<00:03:07.170> want

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
comes to whether or not we actually want

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.580 
comes to whether or not we actually want
to<00:03:07.850> well<00:03:08.850> do<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.240> so<00:03:09.930> i<00:03:09.960> think<00:03:10.050> we'll<00:03:10.290> start

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
to well do this so i think we'll start

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.400 
to well do this so i think we'll start
as<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.400> Doge<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.850> Venice<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.570> then<00:03:13.230> we'll

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
as the Doge of Venice and then we'll

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.470 
as the Doge of Venice and then we'll
basically<00:03:13.770> try<00:03:14.430> our<00:03:14.520> way<00:03:14.670> up<00:03:14.790> here<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.150> might<00:03:15.420> as

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
basically try our way up here I might as

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.540 
basically try our way up here I might as
a<00:03:15.660> sad<00:03:15.960> try<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.320> change<00:03:16.500> religion<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.340> is

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
a sad try and change religion that is

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.840 
a sad try and change religion that is
definitely<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.450> possibility<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:19.730> we'll<00:03:20.730> have

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
definitely a possibility but we'll have

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.910 
definitely a possibility but we'll have
to<00:03:20.910> see<00:03:21.030> what<00:03:21.780> consumers<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.560> can<00:03:22.740> pull<00:03:22.890> off

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
to see what consumers I can pull off

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.710 
to see what consumers I can pull off
I'll<00:03:23.220> probably<00:03:23.370> do<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.850> couple<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.330> other<00:03:24.450> mini

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
I'll probably do a couple of other mini

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.690 
I'll probably do a couple of other mini
games<00:03:24.960> were<00:03:25.260> all<00:03:25.590> smaller<00:03:25.980> games<00:03:26.250> well<00:03:26.520> try<00:03:26.670> to

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
games were all smaller games well try to

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.030 
games were all smaller games well try to
get<00:03:26.910> some<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.240> achievements<00:03:27.690> but<00:03:28.410> I'll

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
get some of the achievements but I'll

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.620 
get some of the achievements but I'll

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
Eustace is my main one and we'll see how

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.620 
Eustace is my main one and we'll see how
it<00:03:30.690> goes<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.380> we'll<00:03:31.800> be<00:03:31.920> starting<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.400> 1867<00:03:33.300> a
