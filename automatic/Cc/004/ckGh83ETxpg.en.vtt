a<00:00:35.160> few<00:00:35.450> new<00:00:36.450> features<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.129> plugin<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:38.910> if

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
a few new features in the plugin so if

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.850 
a few new features in the plugin so if
we<00:00:39.090> enable<00:00:39.270> our<00:00:39.510> powers<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.649> when<00:00:40.829> I

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
we enable our powers you can see when I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.680 
we enable our powers you can see when I
launch<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> ice<00:00:41.460> blast<00:00:41.760> or<00:00:42.239> any<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.600> those

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
launch the ice blast or any of those

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.209 
launch the ice blast or any of those
things<00:00:42.899> by<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> sort<00:00:43.620> instead<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.010> arrow

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
things by the sort instead of an arrow

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.709 
things by the sort instead of an arrow
launching<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.879> could<00:00:45.000> see<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.600> now

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
launching if you could see it now

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
launching if you could see it now
launches<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> snowball<00:00:46.590> which<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.190> something<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
launches a snowball which is something I

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.610 
launches a snowball which is something I
kind<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.670> realized<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.210> pretty<00:00:48.570> early<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.989> was

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
kind of realized on pretty early on was

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.160 
kind of realized on pretty early on was
a<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> problem<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.820> didn't<00:00:51.660> really<00:00:51.870> seem

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
a was a problem and didn't really seem

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
a was a problem and didn't really seem
very<00:00:52.410> realistic<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.370> that's<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.030> small

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
very realistic so that's just a small

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
very realistic so that's just a small
change<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.660> made<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> wanted<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> make<00:00:55.920> note

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
change I made so I wanted to make note

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.410 
change I made so I wanted to make note
of<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.370> along<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> other<00:00:57.059> internal

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
of that along with the other internal

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.959 
of that along with the other internal
fixes<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.020> made<00:00:58.370> however<00:00:59.370> let's<00:00:59.550> get<00:00:59.699> into<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
fixes I made however let's get into the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.000 
fixes I made however let's get into the
three<00:01:00.300> new<00:01:00.480> powers<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.109> added<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.559> we'll

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
three new powers that I added and we'll

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
three new powers that I added and we'll
get<00:01:02.129> into<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> mode<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.879> most<00:01:03.120> anticipated

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
get into the mode the most anticipated

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.000 
get into the mode the most anticipated
one<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> end<00:01:04.290> because<00:01:04.470> I'm<00:01:04.650> sure<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
one at the end because I'm sure all of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.070 
one at the end because I'm sure all of
you<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.280> what<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.930> first

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
you know what that one is but the first

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.450 
you know what that one is but the first
simple<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.770> basically<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
simple one is this basically the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
simple one is this basically the
snowflake<00:01:09.450> launching<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> air<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.439> if

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
snowflake launching it to the air so if

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.320 
snowflake launching it to the air so if
I<00:01:10.619> look<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> air<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.640> double

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
I look up in the air and double

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
I look up in the air and double
left-click<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.930> launches<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> snowball<00:01:14.369> into

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
left-click it launches a snowball into

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
left-click it launches a snowball into
the<00:01:14.580> air<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.030> creates<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.360> huge<00:01:15.689> blast<00:01:16.020> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the air and then creates a huge blast of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.590 
the air and then creates a huge blast of
snow<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> very<00:01:17.939> end<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> movie<00:01:18.450> when

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
snow like the very end of the movie when

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.899 
snow like the very end of the movie when
she<00:01:18.900> clears<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.380> all<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.650> snow<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.790> you

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
she clears out all the snow and so you

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.520 
she clears out all the snow and so you
can<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> added<00:01:21.659> some<00:01:21.840> more<00:01:21.930> those<00:01:22.110> messages

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
can see I added some more those messages

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.870 
can see I added some more those messages
that<00:01:22.680> go<00:01:22.770> along<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.040> this

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that go along with this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.820 
that go along with this
the<00:01:24.180> second<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.750> another<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.650> took<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the second is another one that took a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.380 
the second is another one that took a
took<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.490> fair<00:01:26.640> amount<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.850> time<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.150> which<00:01:27.299> is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
took a fair amount of time but which is

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.600 
took a fair amount of time but which is
not<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> most<00:01:27.689> anticipated<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.220> snow

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
not the most anticipated was the snow

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.859 
not the most anticipated was the snow
pillars<00:01:29.970> from<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> beginning<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> movie

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
pillars from the beginning the movie

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
pillars from the beginning the movie
when<00:01:31.290> Elsa<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.680> blasting<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.250> ahna<00:01:32.369> was

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
when Elsa was blasting and ahna was

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.120 
when Elsa was blasting and ahna was
trying<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.909> uh<00:01:32.960> trying<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> stay<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:35.009> can

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
trying to uh trying to stay on so we can

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.710 
trying to uh trying to stay on so we can
if<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.579> hold<00:01:35.729> down<00:01:35.850> shift<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.390> double

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
if you hold down shift and double

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.350 
if you hold down shift and double
left-click<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.439> forms<00:01:38.220> up<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.759> snow

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
left-click it forms up these snow

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.819 
left-click it forms up these snow
pillars<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.900> these<00:01:40.020> snow<00:01:40.170> pillars<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.680> both

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
pillars and these snow pillars are both

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.590 
pillars and these snow pillars are both
random<00:01:41.130> Heights<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.759> well<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.420> some

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
random Heights as well as some

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.660 
random Heights as well as some
randomization<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> formation<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.490> them

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
randomization in the formation of them

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.490 
randomization in the formation of them
so<00:01:45.240> if<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.450> launch<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.780> few<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.049> them<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.320> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
so if I launch a few of them here you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.440 
so if I launch a few of them here you
can<00:01:46.590> kind<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.670> difference<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> de

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
can kind of see the difference in the de

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.120 
can kind of see the difference in the de
randomization<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.110> all<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.439> all<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> them<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
randomization of all of all of them and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.760 
randomization of all of all of them and
you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:50.880> go<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you can see they just go on up and you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.440 
you can see they just go on up and you
can<00:01:52.890> create<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.880> pretty<00:01:54.000> nice<00:01:54.180> snow

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
can create a it's pretty nice snow

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.100 
can create a it's pretty nice snow
pillars<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.759> yeah<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.149> that's<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.540> second

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
pillars so so yeah so that's the second

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.530 
pillars so so yeah so that's the second
feature<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.439> added<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.670> third<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
feature I added and the third one is

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
feature I added and the third one is
definitely<00:02:01.140> whatever<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:02.040> wanted<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
definitely whatever one wanted and that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.149 
definitely whatever one wanted and that
was<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.360> ice<00:02:03.659> bridge<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.380> Elsa<00:02:04.680> formed<00:02:05.040> when

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
was the ice bridge that Elsa formed when

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.160 
was the ice bridge that Elsa formed when
she<00:02:05.369> was<00:02:05.520> doing<00:02:05.729> her<00:02:05.880> big<00:02:06.119> musical<00:02:06.600> let<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.020> go

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
she was doing her big musical let it go

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.559 
she was doing her big musical let it go
now<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.250> took<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.580> long<00:02:08.819> time<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.450> make

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
now this one took a long time to make

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510 
now this one took a long time to make
due<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> complexity<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.679> how<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.039> works

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
due to the complexity of how it works

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.140 
due to the complexity of how it works
however<00:02:11.940> I'll<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.239> into<00:02:12.360> Hanna<00:02:12.690> how<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.900> work

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
however I'll get into Hanna how it work

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.470 
however I'll get into Hanna how it work
right<00:02:13.390> now<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.110> if<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.260> type<00:02:14.379> Elsa<00:02:14.769> fie<00:02:14.920> bridge

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
right now so if I type Elsa fie bridge

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.300 
right now so if I type Elsa fie bridge
and<00:02:16.480> enables<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.110> bridge<00:02:17.290> system<00:02:17.470> now<00:02:18.159> this

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
and enables the bridge system now this

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.830 
and enables the bridge system now this
bridge<00:02:18.489> system<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.939> kind<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.209> complicated<00:02:19.599> a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
bridge system is kind of complicated a

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.390 
bridge system is kind of complicated a
kind<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.079> symbol<00:02:20.349> at<00:02:20.409> same<00:02:20.560> time<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:21.099> have<00:02:21.220> two

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
kind of symbol at same time you have two

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.399 
kind of symbol at same time you have two
items<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.700> inventory<00:02:21.909> the<00:02:22.360> up<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.840> down

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
items in inventory the up and the down

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.679 
items in inventory the up and the down
so<00:02:24.040> if<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:24.189> continue<00:02:24.579> walking<00:02:24.760> forward<00:02:25.329> you'll

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
so if I continue walking forward you'll

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.270 
so if I continue walking forward you'll
see<00:02:25.900> how<00:02:26.019> you<00:02:26.079> start<00:02:26.439> changing<00:02:26.680> all<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.159> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
see how you start changing all of the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.130 
see how you start changing all of the
things<00:02:27.489> into<00:02:27.700> ice<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:28.180> as<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.390> walk<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:28.750> forms

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
things into ice so as I walk it forms

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.660 
things into ice so as I walk it forms
but<00:02:29.620> if<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.739> wanted<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.099> bridge<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.400> go<00:02:30.489> up

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
but if I wanted the bridge to go up

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.610 
but if I wanted the bridge to go up
again<00:02:31.000> just<00:02:31.030> toggle<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.750> up<00:02:31.959> one<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
again just toggle to the up one and it

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.899 
again just toggle to the up one and it
creates<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.010> up<00:02:33.159> and<00:02:33.400> creates<00:02:33.609> a<00:02:33.670> staircase

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
creates it up and creates a staircase

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.789 
creates it up and creates a staircase
that<00:02:34.239> leads<00:02:34.689> it<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:34.959> one<00:02:35.109> novel<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.620> keep

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
that leads it up one novel and if I keep

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.979 
that leads it up one novel and if I keep
doing<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.189> you<00:02:36.670> can<00:02:36.790> see<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.180> keeps<00:02:37.359> going<00:02:37.720> up

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
doing that you can see it keeps going up

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.470 
doing that you can see it keeps going up
and<00:02:38.230> as<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.560> walk<00:02:38.890> all<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.790> snow<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.239> forms

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
and as I walk all the snow that forms

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.390 
and as I walk all the snow that forms
initially<00:02:40.930> turns<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.409> ice<00:02:41.439> as<00:02:41.829> it<00:02:41.950> should<00:02:42.220> and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
initially turns to ice as it should and

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.240 
initially turns to ice as it should and
as<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.329> keep<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:44.409> can<00:02:44.680> do<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.920> same<00:02:45.069> thing

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
as I keep going it can do the same thing

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.500 
as I keep going it can do the same thing
if<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.430> hold<00:02:45.609> that<00:02:45.700> if<00:02:45.879> I<00:02:45.970> change<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.480> direction

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
if I hold that if I change the direction

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.930 
if I hold that if I change the direction
so<00:02:46.900> if<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:47.019> scroll<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.530> down<00:02:47.769> one<00:02:48.040> as<00:02:48.639> I<00:02:48.790> keep

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
so if I scroll to the down one as I keep

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.930 
so if I scroll to the down one as I keep
walking<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.659> will<00:02:50.079> form<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.470> down<00:02:50.680> bridge<00:02:50.980> so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
walking it will form the down bridge so

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.729 
walking it will form the down bridge so
