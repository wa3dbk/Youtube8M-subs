00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
this basically takes the air turn like

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.319 
this basically takes the air turn like
they<00:00:43.590> vortex<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.700> its<00:00:44.910> name<00:00:45.000> implies

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
they vortex just like its name implies

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.110 
they vortex just like its name implies
if<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.200> find<00:00:46.440> these<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.770> airplanes<00:00:47.309> even<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
if you find these on airplanes even the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.900 
if you find these on airplanes even the
Space<00:00:48.360> Shuttle<00:00:48.390> hasn't<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.770> f1<00:00:50.250> racing<00:00:50.760> is

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
Space Shuttle hasn't but f1 racing is

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.360 
Space Shuttle hasn't but f1 racing is
where<00:00:51.120> they<00:00:51.270> use<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.680> where<00:00:52.949> Toyota

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
where they use it but is where Toyota

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
where they use it but is where Toyota
gets<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.030> turns<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.480> air<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.899> this

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
gets it and it turns the air like this

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.779 
gets it and it turns the air like this
it<00:00:55.320> comes<00:00:55.469> along<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> vehicle<00:00:56.250> stays<00:00:56.489> planted

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
it comes along the vehicle stays planted

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.599 
it comes along the vehicle stays planted
there's<00:00:57.210> zeros<00:00:57.719> dead<00:00:58.050> space<00:00:58.410> between<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.280> air

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
there's zeros dead space between the air

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.639 
there's zeros dead space between the air
in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> car<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.719> comes<00:01:00.930> along<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
in the car and it comes along here and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.410 
in the car and it comes along here and
then<00:01:01.770> you'll<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.129> these<00:01:02.280> vortex<00:01:02.789> generators

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
then you'll see these vortex generators

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420 
then you'll see these vortex generators
tell<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> air<00:01:03.930> what<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.409> back<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
tell the air what to do back here the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.609 
tell the air what to do back here the
air<00:01:05.610> flow<00:01:05.850> also<00:01:06.270> comes<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.869> over<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.290> deck

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

back<00:03:31.410> here<00:03:31.799> seats<00:03:32.310> still<00:03:32.609> fall<00:03:32.880> flat<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.450> you

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
back here seats still fall flat as you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.680 
back here seats still fall flat as you
can<00:03:33.900> see<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.620> split<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.480> let<00:03:36.660> one

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
can see it's a split so you can let one

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.800 
can see it's a split so you can let one
side<00:03:37.140> down<00:03:37.380> or<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.650> other<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.510> reason

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
side down or the other that the reason

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.780

they<00:03:39.930> do<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.739> don't<00:03:41.070> eliminate

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
they do that is so you don't eliminate

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.819 
they do that is so you don't eliminate
the<00:03:41.940> possibility<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.780> backseat<00:03:43.200> passenger

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
the possibility of a backseat passenger

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.099 
the possibility of a backseat passenger
what<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.160> mean<00:03:44.430> by<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.820> is<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.510> can<00:03:45.660> let<00:03:45.870> one

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
what I mean by that is you can let one

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.300 
what I mean by that is you can let one
side<00:03:46.350> down<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.829> still<00:03:47.040> have<00:03:47.190> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
side down and still have the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.800 
side down and still have the
pass-through<00:03:47.579> in<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.120> extra<00:03:48.420> cargo<00:03:48.660> space

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
pass-through in the extra cargo space

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.690 
pass-through in the extra cargo space
but<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.620> can<00:03:49.739> still<00:03:49.920> have<00:03:50.070> somebody<00:03:50.459> sitting

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
but you can still have somebody sitting

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.330
