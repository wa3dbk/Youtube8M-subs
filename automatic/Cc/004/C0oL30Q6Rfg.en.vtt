00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hi friends from sahara and I give them the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.819
 welcome to million curiosity of the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.529
 videogames chapter days like 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.450
 will remember in the last episode we talked 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.889
 about monkey island but that was not the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.380
 first graphic adventure game that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.580
 the solid arts that would not be mindjack 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.830
 mansion that was released in 1987 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.010
 management are mini how to pronounce 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.010
 that 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.610
 come to comment today have it now 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.320
 we continue the story focuses on a 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.730
 group of friends that go inside 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.170
 from a very mysterious mansion where 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.970
 strange things have been happening 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.070
 last years to rescue one of his 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.600
 friends who was kidnapped the game was 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.340
 quite revolutionary for its time 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.870
 one of the reasons has to allow 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.760
 different endings depending on the 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.200
 decisions made by the player or 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.450
 the characters that could die in the 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.340
 way and despite being a pretty game 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.780
 based on the horror movies class 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.580
 I did not have any time too much 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.200
 shocking for the player but yes 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.150
 contains an option in the story that 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.440
 it's quite interesting now inside the 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.900
 game you can meet a character 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.640
 called is the weird now in the weird is 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.530
 a paramilitary maniac who has a 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.270
 strange obsession with his hamster and the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.310
 Hamster is one of the objects that you can 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.810
 use inside the game but the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.580
 Hamster is an object that you can have 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.200
 inside the game but it really is not 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.390
 necessary to advance the story ni 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.680
 to do anything of vital importance like this 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.180
 that so that this 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.190
 hamster so they would put it there if not 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.270
 you can do absolutely nothing with him 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.460
 well that's where the part comes from 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.020
 interesting the only way that this 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 hamster could have some form of 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.380
 impact on the story is that if you 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.060
 you take in your inventory you take it up 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.909
 the kitchen where you'll find a micro 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.500
 open and you cook it alive so you can 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.000
 cook the hamster alive 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.360
 you just put the hamster inside and 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.710
 when you learn about microwave it explodes 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.479
 but this by itself has no 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.740
 effect on history is not the only one 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.539
 way this can take you some 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.490
 alternative end is that if you take the 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.289
 exploded corpse of the hamster and I 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.090
 you take to the weird is again when the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.100
 crazy is you see your beloved hamster done 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.409
 pieces he will simply murder and 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.659
 will enter the garden and that is one of the 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.970
 alternative endings well now let's 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.619
 somewhat less disturbing gay now 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.240
 you should be familiar with 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.100
 some of the notions that some 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.840
 games change their name when they receive 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.759
 an international launch from japan 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.069
 for example final fantasy and super mario 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.870
 These are the best known cases 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.190
 of the differences between the names of 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.049
 the games or the difference of 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.640
 launches of games between the us and 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.040
 Japan but one of the least 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.140
 known is the pokemon stadium in 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.790
 japan were thrown three we can stadium 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.410
 the one that we met here as we can 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.569
 write one this one actually because I 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.670
 from station 2 in japan and we met 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.950
 as pokemon stadium 2 is known as 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.180
 pokemon stadium silver and gold in japan 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.459
 and now that we're on the subject of 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.140
 Pokémon in Pokemon Ruby Sapphire There is a 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.480
 pokémon called spine is the one that has 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.340
 specks around the whole face but what 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.349
 interesting about this pokemon is that each 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.209
 one of its patterns is generated by a 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.040
 number behind their abilities is 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.620
 say every thorn you find in the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.120
 game is unique this is because the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.739
 Thorn image is based on the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.170
 personality values that are generated 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.560
 randomly this results in that in the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.860
 game you can potentially find 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.930
 4.294 million 967 thousand 296 different 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.150
 spin classes gives this is without taking in 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.099
 consideration the pokemones chain and what 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.470
 which would make that number double 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.900
 the following string is found in 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.519
 gears of war 3 on the first mission of the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.380
 game in the first battle one is 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.140
 found in a kind of ship about 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.610
 which there are ventilation pipes 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.630
 four ventilation tubes in fact yes 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.459
 you approach each one of them 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.860
 individually and the character screams 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.849
 within them does not have such order 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.280
 what do you do 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.720
 suddenly a chicken will appear this is 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.700
 a common chicken and 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.280
 porcine is nothing unusual but if you dare 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.380
 to shoot him a little bit transforms into 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.319
 a huge golden chicken that throws fire 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.569
 by mouth 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.239
 no doubt it is a very strange thing 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.889
 but it's not too hard to kill what 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.439
 what's so weird about it is that when you're 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.930
 against her for some reason so that you 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.280
 sight is going the other way so it's at 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.870
 you will not be able to start 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.310
 directly not your gun to shoot him 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.810
 what you have to do is recharge the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.180
 weapon and once you have recharged for 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.980
 shoot him directly and as if he were 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.840
 a giant gold hen that throws 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.909
 fire were not weird enough 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.549
 Once you kill her the hen explodes 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.379
 in confetti but that is not the only one this 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.959
 which is related to chickens in the 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.129
 gears of war 3 to get this other 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.500
 you have to start the game in the 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.720
 higher difficulty then you have to 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.579
 select chapter number 4 in this 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.440
 chapter there are a lot of corpses and 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.000
 ashes scattered throughout the level if 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.070
 you manage to pass the whole level 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.169
 without touching any of these bodies 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.509
 There will come a time when they will take you to 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.940
 a kind of den in which you can 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.620
 select weapons if you did everything right 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.020
 when entering this lair you should be able to 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.539
 find a kind of chicken doll 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.970
 giant pirate and if you touch her too 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.430
 they explode confetti but that is not the end 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.020
 of this stress continuing the game 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.160
 during the next two chapters 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.020
 you will find 3 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.510
 of ammunition that are put in places 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.220
 very difficult to achieve one on one 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.900
 car that is hanging from a ravine the 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.580
 another on a train track that is 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.140
 hanging from one ravine and the other from 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.600
 some boxes that are hanging from a 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.520
 ravine if you approach them and the 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.780
 strips down the ravine by the way when 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.090
 you have the third one down the ravine 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.690
 a chicken will appear flying over a 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.740
 kind of flying box things good 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.080
 this thing that you are seeing on screen 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.210
 appears flying and leaves a weapon very 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.160
 special which is a kind of 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.160
 bazooka that throws explosive chickens 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.400
 and now to finish let's see a little 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.110
 take off in the game reig for those 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.640
 that they do not know the game reig was a 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.320
 small game released a few years ago 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.150
 I had a lot of interesting things 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.280
 in him but the most interesting thing he has 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.380
 is that it was created by if the creators 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.640
 from wolfenstein doom who were the 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.680
 creators of the first but it's a 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.240
 shooter so obviously this is 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.950
 terence reich has something to do with 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.660
 doom in the game visited a place called 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.980
 the underground city is a place where 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.540
 you have to go to complete a mission 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.210
 where you have to kill some idiots 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.590
 they are out there causing disasters 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.640
 this is a pretty big place but if 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.110
 you manage to get to the end of 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.880
 building and you find a place 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.380
 where there are a lot of computers and 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.400
 you are pressing one by one the seven 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.960
 computers that you can find 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.090
 you can find something pretty 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.410
 interesting at first once you've 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.730
 activated all seven computers 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.170
 you just have to go back to 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.610
 beginning of the game where before 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.530
 a locked door that will now be 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.000
 open and you can open it once 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.470
 open doors can find 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.450
 some things that undoubtedly seem 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.100
 much to those of zoom to be able to enter 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.900
 they have to jump and crouch to pass 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.520
 for the boxes and then when they seem 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.350
 the pedestal that is there you can go to 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.120
 a very interesting place 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.560
 how can you see this new room 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.750
 uses all the graphs and 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.470
 textures of the original tube 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.420
 unfortunately there is nothing very 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.430
 interesting in it besides a kind 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.230
 of collectable that you can find not 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.300
 you can leave you can not interact with 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.650
 nothing you can not shoot the good nothing 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.030
 friends that would be all we have 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.070
 for today so we'll see each other in the 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.360
 next episode that I hope it's more 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.340
