00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.799

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.440
 the sport has achieved that little by little I 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.050

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.630
 to ski is also a way to spend 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.400
 together the time 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.349
 with my brothers when we were little 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 I admired him very much and then I when 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.539
 I tried to get along with him he beat me 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.000
 one horse aranda my parents and she them 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.239
 I was going to church, we were taking a 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.010
 little bad I have a lot of character and he is 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.010
 more is the quieter 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:49.140
 the first time I was eight years old 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.929
 weeks was a bit of a fall and now 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.359
 when I was very bad they took me 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:58.890
 to the doctor and they already diagnosed me 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.750
 leukemia me when I found out I did not know 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 it was and then I took it with 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.049
 joy then you realize what 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.789
 it was and it was not so good the second one was 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.009
 quite different from the first one because 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.539
 I was 12 years old and I did not expect it from 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.310
 no way it would fall again 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.960
 because I was older was more 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.440
 conscious I was more embarrassed to go out 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.020
 without but to the street they had to look 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.360
 a compatible marrow so that my body 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.860
 factory the good cells and they had to 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.580
 see if my brother was 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.580
 compatible or not 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.150
 It is very difficult for a few people 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.150
 but I was lucky that yes it was 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.479
 I did not know that he would take my 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.770
 put her she got the marrow that 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.770
 it's a liquid and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.960
 I can feel more love than any 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.280
 hand can feel because without the frame 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.280
 I could not have kept living 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.899
 he says he wants to go to australia but 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.520
 I know that even if he goes away or has 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.840
 a long time we will continue to be 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.840
 just as we are now
