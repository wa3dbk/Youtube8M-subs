00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.069

 our body, I also know that it is 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.110
 a little harder to find in the 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.539
 Brazil, but it is impossible to be in the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.970
 Does it matter if I know that it has 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.429

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.520

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.600
 the market a little more to tidy know 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.970
 that you find because it is a little 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.910
 more expensive to see if it is 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.240
 delicious I get another food that I 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.709
 I love you, it's the pasta. 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.399

 It's a relatively low price for me. 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.790
 so I insist on always choosing 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.380
 organic matter, even though it is a 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.040
 little more expensive 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.019

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.269
