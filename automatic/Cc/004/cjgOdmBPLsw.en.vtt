00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
faith in his audience there's a lot of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.330 
faith in his audience there's a lot of
things<00:01:22.170> he<00:01:22.350> doesn't<00:01:22.560> explain<00:01:23.040> he<00:01:23.189> just

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
things he doesn't explain he just

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.620 
things he doesn't explain he just
assumes<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.729> we'll<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.030> able<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.180> figure<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
assumes that we'll be able to figure it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.190 
assumes that we'll be able to figure it
out<00:01:24.780> based<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.460> us<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.729> being<00:01:26.909> idiots<00:01:27.119> which<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
out based on us not being idiots which I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.390 
out based on us not being idiots which I
appreciate<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.100> don't<00:01:29.130> see

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
appreciate because then we don't see

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.789 
appreciate because then we don't see
unnecessary<00:01:30.030> stuff<00:01:30.329> um<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.590> that's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
unnecessary stuff um but I think that's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.200 
unnecessary stuff um but I think that's
sort<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.100> what's<00:01:32.340> happening<00:01:32.670> here<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
sort of what's happening here with the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.819 
sort of what's happening here with the
story<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.600> think<00:01:33.750> he<00:01:33.990> gives<00:01:34.140> us<00:01:34.259> enough<00:01:34.530> pieces

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
story I think he gives us enough pieces

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.950 
story I think he gives us enough pieces
because<00:01:35.670> there's<00:01:35.880> no<00:01:36.060> clear<00:01:36.360> time<00:01:36.570> period

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
because there's no clear time period

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.289 
because there's no clear time period
there's<00:01:37.650> no<00:01:37.770> clear<00:01:38.040> location<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.060> no

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
there's no clear location so we have no

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.390 
there's no clear location so we have no
idea<00:01:39.329> where<00:01:39.840> when<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.650> it's<00:01:40.950> safe<00:01:41.189> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
idea where when and I think it's safe to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.980 
idea where when and I think it's safe to
assume<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.270> some<00:01:42.540> fantasy

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
assume that this is just some fantasy

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.330 
assume that this is just some fantasy
world<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.380> saw<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> little<00:01:43.979> differently<00:01:44.280> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
world I saw it a little differently I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.399 
world I saw it a little differently I
didn't<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:45.049> necessarily<00:01:46.049> feel<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.350> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
didn't actually necessarily feel that I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020

that engaged us and makes us want to

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.240 
that engaged us and makes us want to
watch<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.080> think<00:02:31.500> that's<00:02:31.650> why<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> story<00:02:32.190> is

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
watch it I think that's why the story is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.680 
watch it I think that's why the story is
simple<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.730> think<00:02:32.760> that's<00:02:33.000> also<00:02:33.270> why<00:02:33.390> we<00:02:33.420> don't

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
simple I think that's also why we don't

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.390 
simple I think that's also why we don't
have<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.290> definitive<00:02:34.470> time<00:02:34.980> period<00:02:35.340> or

here<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.660> sort<00:05:33.900> of<00:05:33.960> breaks<00:05:34.260> through<00:05:34.770> the

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
here that sort of breaks through the

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.640 
here that sort of breaks through the
mold<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.669> what<00:05:35.729> he's<00:05:36.240> assembled<00:05:37.110> and<00:05:37.440> that

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
truly one-of-a-kind it doesn't make

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.380 
truly one-of-a-kind it doesn't make

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
sense in any conventional way but it's

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.760
