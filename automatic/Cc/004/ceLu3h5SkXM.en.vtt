this<00:00:02.970> is<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.240> story<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.929> second<00:00:04.350> generation

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
this is the story of a second generation

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.390 
this is the story of a second generation
downdraft<00:00:05.910> stratified<00:00:06.509> gasifier<00:00:07.230> which<00:00:08.220> we

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
downdraft stratified gasifier which we

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.790 
downdraft stratified gasifier which we
constructed<00:00:09.059> from<00:00:09.300> thumbnail<00:00:10.110> sketch<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
constructed from thumbnail sketch of the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.740 
constructed from thumbnail sketch of the
gas<00:00:10.980> fire<00:00:11.370> with<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> cooling<00:00:12.570> tower

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
gas fire with the cooling tower

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.550 
gas fire with the cooling tower
alongside<00:00:14.630> took<00:00:15.630> us<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.870> while<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.080> build<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
alongside took us a while to build the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010 
alongside took us a while to build the
gasifier<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.369> collected<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> parts<00:00:18.270> salvaged

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
gasifier we collected the parts salvaged

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.439 
gasifier we collected the parts salvaged
mostly<00:00:19.619> put<00:00:20.430> them<00:00:20.609> together<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.210> our

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
mostly put them together with our

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.810 
mostly put them together with our
skilled<00:00:21.840> crew<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.130> we<00:00:23.430> could<00:00:23.580> create

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
skilled crew so that we could create

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.980 
skilled crew so that we could create
energy<00:00:24.210> from<00:00:24.689> biomass<00:00:26.570> well<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
energy from biomass well this is a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.679 
energy from biomass well this is a
completed<00:00:28.560> generation<00:00:29.460> 2<00:00:29.640> gasifier<00:00:30.300> which

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
completed generation 2 gasifier which

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.999 
completed generation 2 gasifier which
we've<00:00:30.869> been<00:00:30.960> working<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.859> better

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
we've been working on for the better

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.580 
we've been working on for the better
part<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> since<00:00:33.329> summer<00:00:33.570> spring<00:00:34.320> actually

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
part of the since summer spring actually

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.190 
part of the since summer spring actually
last<00:00:34.950> year<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.329> design<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.809> little<00:00:36.899> bit

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
last year and the design is a little bit

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.780 
last year and the design is a little bit
different<00:00:37.530> than<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> FEMA<00:00:38.100> downdraft

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
different than the FEMA downdraft

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.299 
different than the FEMA downdraft
gasifier<00:00:39.420> which<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:39.840> initially<00:00:40.140> built<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
gasifier which was initially built the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
gasifier which was initially built the
idea<00:00:41.670> behind<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.750> solve<00:00:42.989> some

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
idea behind this was to solve some

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.139 
idea behind this was to solve some
problems<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.890> discovered<00:00:44.730> when<00:00:44.879> we

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
problems that we discovered when we

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.619 
problems that we discovered when we
built<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.539> original<00:00:45.899> FEMA<00:00:46.410> design<00:00:47.390> we<00:00:48.390> still

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
built the original FEMA design we still

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.069 
built the original FEMA design we still
have<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> same<00:00:49.079> basic<00:00:50.539> vacuum<00:00:51.539> system<00:00:51.960> that

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
have the same basic vacuum system that

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.069 
have the same basic vacuum system that
we're<00:00:52.230> using<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.710> squirrel<00:00:53.370> cage<00:00:53.579> fan<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.840> draw

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
we're using a squirrel cage fan to draw

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
we're using a squirrel cage fan to draw
air<00:00:55.320> through<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.739> system<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.430> basically

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
air through the system so it's basically

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
air through the system so it's basically
everything<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> negative<00:00:58.199> pressure<00:00:58.410> from

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
everything is a negative pressure from

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430 
everything is a negative pressure from
the<00:00:59.879> burn<00:01:00.059> chamber<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> way<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.050> till<00:01:01.410> we

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the burn chamber all the way out till we

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.670 
the burn chamber all the way out till we
use<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> gas<00:01:02.870> inside<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.080> difference<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
use the gas inside the difference in the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.530 
use the gas inside the difference in the
gas<00:01:04.830> fires<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.400> still<00:01:05.640> use<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.970> same<00:01:06.210> diameter

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
gas fires we still use the same diameter

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.990 
gas fires we still use the same diameter
tube<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.320> used<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.680> gen<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.189> but

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
tube that we used on the gen one but

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.090 
tube that we used on the gen one but
we've<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.299> made<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> smaller<00:01:09.930> outer<00:01:10.229> area<00:01:10.770> out

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
we've now made a smaller outer area out

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.429 
we've now made a smaller outer area out
of<00:01:11.280> an<00:01:11.400> old<00:01:11.549> propane<00:01:11.850> cylinder<00:01:12.570> which<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:13.320> were

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
of an old propane cylinder which we were

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.750 
of an old propane cylinder which we were
able<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> come<00:01:13.890> by<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> large<00:01:14.310> number<00:01:14.369> of

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
able to come by a large number of

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.039 
able to come by a large number of
unserviceable<00:01:16.610> propane<00:01:17.610> chambers<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.810> take

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
unserviceable propane chambers we take

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.929 
unserviceable propane chambers we take
and<00:01:19.290> cut<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.560> off<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.670> top<00:01:20.909> of

as<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.329> see<00:01:39.540> needed<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> big<00:01:40.710> thing<00:01:40.740> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
as we see needed but the big thing is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.830 
as we see needed but the big thing is
the<00:01:41.130> char<00:01:41.340> removal<00:01:41.790> system<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> center<00:01:42.810> of

this top one is a small pipe with an
auger<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> auger<00:01:47.490> does<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
auger in it and what the auger does is

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.969 
auger in it and what the auger does is
as<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> charge<00:01:48.479> swept<00:01:48.840> away<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.560> whisker

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
transport it down into the lower chamber

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.580 
transport it down into the lower chamber
where<00:01:56.670> it'll<00:01:56.909> build<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.540> things<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.469> we

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
where it'll build up to things so we

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.980 
where it'll build up to things so we
have<00:01:58.740> much<00:01:58.890> more<00:01:59.100> charge<00:01:59.399> storage<00:01:59.850> than<00:02:00.840> we

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
have much more charge storage than we

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.810 
have much more charge storage than we
had<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> old<00:02:01.409> gasifier<00:02:02.130> smaller

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
had in the old gasifier smaller

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.139 
had in the old gasifier smaller
footprint<00:02:03.479> although<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> little<00:02:04.619> taller

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
footprint although it is a little taller

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.540 
footprint although it is a little taller
it<00:02:06.149> did<00:02:06.390> allow<00:02:06.600> us<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.930> ability<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.350> move<00:02:08.280> that

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
it did allow us the ability to move that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.490 
it did allow us the ability to move that

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
greg's great inventions it's actually a

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.080 
greg's great inventions it's actually a
pulley<00:02:16.410> system<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.130> hooks<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.700> bottom

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
pulley system that hooks to the bottom

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.730 
pulley system that hooks to the bottom
of<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> shaft<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.870> runs<00:02:19.080> through<00:02:19.410> from<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
of the shaft that runs through from the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.410

whisker<00:02:20.160> through<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.670> auger<00:02:20.880> all<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.300> way

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
whisker through the auger all the way

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.970 
whisker through the auger all the way
through<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> bottom<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.230> bushing<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.930 
bottom and there's a pulley on the
bottom<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.650> each<00:02:25.770> time<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.130> rotate<00:02:26.490> this<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
bottom so each time we rotate this the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.270 
bottom so each time we rotate this the
whisker<00:02:27.300> inside<00:02:27.690> rotates<00:02:28.200> about<00:02:28.350> 3/4<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.160> a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
turn that knocks charr off of a plate

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.220 
turn that knocks charr off of a plate
causes<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.390> fall<00:02:33.540> over<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> edge<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
causes it to fall over the edge and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.540 
causes it to fall over the edge and
everything<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.770> burn<00:02:34.920> chamber<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.400> move

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
everything in the burn chamber to move

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.130 
everything in the burn chamber to move
down<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.240> turn<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.660> couple<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.960> times

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
down so if we turn it a couple of times

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.280 
down so if we turn it a couple of times
the<00:02:37.350> charge<00:02:37.590> ROPS<00:02:37.830> down<00:02:38.040> quite<00:02:38.310> significantly

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
the charge ROPS down quite significantly

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.810 
the charge ROPS down quite significantly
it<00:02:40.290> sure<00:02:40.530> beats<00:02:40.740> shaking<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> old<00:02:41.490> shaker

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
it sure beats shaking the old shaker

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.640 
it sure beats shaking the old shaker
that<00:02:41.970> we<00:02:42.240> had<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.900> one<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.470> quick

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
that we had this one is just a quick

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.680 
that we had this one is just a quick
turn<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.220> knocks<00:02:44.430> about<00:02:44.970> an<00:02:45.240> inch<00:02:45.390> out<00:02:45.570> of

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
turn and it knocks about an inch out of

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
turn and it knocks about an inch out of
the<00:02:45.780> burn<00:02:46.140> chamber

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
the burn chamber

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.380 
the burn chamber
well<00:02:46.950> it'll<00:02:47.130> allow<00:02:47.370> us<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.670> put<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> motor<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
well it'll allow us to put a motor and a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.800 
well it'll allow us to put a motor and a
sensor<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.960> there<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.500> when<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.810> we're

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
sensor on there so that when the we're

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.000 
sensor on there so that when the we're
hoping<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.140> be<00:02:52.260> able<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.410> put<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> temperature

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
hoping to be able to put a temperature

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.350 
hoping to be able to put a temperature
probe<00:02:53.250> in<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.490> middle<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:53.880> when<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> char

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360

layer<00:02:54.570> or<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.380> paralysis<00:02:55.650> layer<00:02:56.100> burns<00:02:56.370> up

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
layer or the paralysis layer burns up

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.730 
layer or the paralysis layer burns up
towards<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.060> temperature<00:02:57.480> sensor<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.560> will

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
towards that temperature sensor it will

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.100 
towards that temperature sensor it will
kick<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.160> motor<00:02:59.430> causing<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.330> turn<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
kick on a motor causing it to turn the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.830 
kick on a motor causing it to turn the

layer to drop the colder the probe will

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.570 
layer to drop the colder the probe will
cool<00:03:04.020> off<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.590> it'll<00:03:04.830> stop<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.070> motor<00:03:05.400> from

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
cool off and it'll stop the motor from

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.980 
cool off and it'll stop the motor from
turning<00:03:05.940> at<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.240> point<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.600> it'll<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> very

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
turning at that point so it'll be a very

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.690 
level at a constant level in the top
there'll<00:03:28.380> be<00:03:28.410> an<00:03:28.560> auger<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.160> sensor<00:03:29.550> in

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
there'll be an auger and a sensor in

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.010 
there'll be an auger and a sensor in
there<00:03:29.790> that'll<00:03:30.060> say<00:03:30.180> okay<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.510> fuel<00:03:30.720> has<00:03:30.870> now

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
there that'll say okay the fuel has now

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.630 
there that'll say okay the fuel has now
dropped<00:03:31.290> down<00:03:31.590> we<00:03:31.770> need<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.010> add<00:03:32.160> more<00:03:32.400> an

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
dropped down we need to add more an

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.370 
dropped down we need to add more an
auger<00:03:33.180> will<00:03:33.360> turn<00:03:33.630> on<00:03:33.750> for<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:34.020> couple<00:03:34.140> of

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
auger will turn on for a couple of

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.020 
auger will turn on for a couple of
seconds<00:03:34.740> and<00:03:34.920> it'll<00:03:35.160> test<00:03:35.400> again<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.700> see<00:03:35.940> is

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
seconds and it'll test again and see is

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.570 
seconds and it'll test again and see is
it<00:03:36.180> full<00:03:36.420> no<00:03:36.690> adds<00:03:36.990> another<00:03:37.709> five<00:03:37.950> seconds<00:03:38.459> is

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
it full no adds another five seconds is

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.580 
it full no adds another five seconds is
it<00:03:38.730> full<00:03:38.970> no<00:03:39.209> adds<00:03:39.540> another<00:03:39.870> five<00:03:40.080> seconds<00:03:40.440> and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
it full no adds another five seconds and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.980 
it full no adds another five seconds and
at<00:03:41.340> some<00:03:41.520> point<00:03:41.730> it'll<00:03:41.910> say<00:03:42.090> too<00:03:42.570> much<00:03:42.720> fuel

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
at some point it'll say too much fuel

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.860 
at some point it'll say too much fuel
stop<00:03:43.610> or<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.970> know<00:03:45.060> not<00:03:45.240> enough<00:03:45.390> so<00:03:45.720> we'll

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
stop or you know not enough so we'll

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.270 
stop or you know not enough so we'll
have<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.170> play<00:03:46.380> with<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.770> adjust<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.190> but

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
have to play with that and adjust it but

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.470 
have to play with that and adjust it but
then<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.459> will<00:03:47.580> be<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.850> only<00:03:48.000> probably

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
then it will be the only probably

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.500 
then it will be the only probably
electronic<00:03:49.140> things<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:49.590> here<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.270> think<00:03:51.300> I

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
electronic things on here and I think I

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.820 
electronic things on here and I think I
can<00:03:51.630> get<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.840> down<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.050> one<00:03:52.200> small<00:03:52.470> circuit

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
can get it down to one small circuit

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.180 
can get it down to one small circuit
board<00:03:53.010> running<00:03:53.130> off<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.370> 9-volt<00:03:53.880> battery
