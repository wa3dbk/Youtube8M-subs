 tactical ventilation 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.889
 the internal combustion engine 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.549
 Who can be found in most fire departments and rely on the vehicle 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.679
 and so the fan can start with internal combustion engine 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.679
 as that is all success 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.079
 most important rule of hers 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.880
 used an exhaust blow 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.869
 which is placed sideways to the device from the Ansorg area and the toxic ones 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.880
 Distributed exhaust gases 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 the propeller technology 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.800
 The propeller technology creates a funnel-shaped airflow 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.230
 Spread evenly in all directions 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.260
 This airflow creates turbulence right from the start, causing confusion 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 Apartments for customers to the airflow weaknesses 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.090
 The broad storm also has the consequence that the air flow and 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.720
 Disturbances on the ground we represent deposed state gives away 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.340
 new turbulences are forming 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.510
 that will be with Coach Ralph Fischer 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.880
 in the first half we have the apartment of the Chamber this morning 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.510
 Dr 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.640
 youth 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 Customer 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.700
 It took us but we do not want but his ancestors from Germany 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.220
 how high from «I am except myself these are two apartments in the first weeks in 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.190
 attic 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.200
 and when asked 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.439
 Unfortunately, the inhabitant may be the most important question if there are still people in the house 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.890
 dont answer 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.530
 but by the precise answers to the interior of the building can the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.530
 Task Manager now already a very good picture of the structural situation 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 in his mind an idea arises for the division of the apartments in 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.430
 South Africa 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.990
 everything is already smoky here on the first floor 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.030
 there is 0 visibility 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.390
 Death comes to close the door of the fire apartment 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.110
 so the smoke is kept in the propagation stopped 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.720
 It also creates the exact air channel for ventilation 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.940
 he should not let the air into the apartment but through the hallway from the top 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.069
 Attic go out 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.569
 The row of windows in this room is the maximum opening area 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.739
 Copenhagen dpa 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.429
 Sometimes have APA 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.049
 Let's take a look at the process again 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.379
 while the attacking party is advancing into the house 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.079
 The second squad brings the fan in front of the front door in idle gas operation 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.869
 to adjust 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:46.159
 now everything up to 3 minutes 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.599
 the squad on the aerial ladder is at a safe distance and not from 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.599
 to be struck somewhere escaping flames 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.109
 Danzer stuck the discs on command 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.109
 Sócrates poet fire smoke out 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.400
 Immediately after smashing the outgoing Thurk would have come to the door of 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:07.389
 Group leader the command 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.479
 he can now in the fire apartment 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.329
 through the still ongoing ventilation, he brings now with the 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.299
 Fresh air electricity into the fire apartment 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.689
 It can be seen clearly how the poet smokes in the way 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.129
 from the just created exhaust vent outlet 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.549
 and then it just means 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.289
 Trust yourself and your knowledge 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:32.809
 use the tactical ventilation confidently and skilfully 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.569
 where people save lives safely 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:39.889
 tactical ventilation
