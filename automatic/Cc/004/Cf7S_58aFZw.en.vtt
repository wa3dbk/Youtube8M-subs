hereish I'm edge there so if you were to
draw<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> line<00:00:53.460> all<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.730> way<00:00:53.850> through

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
draw a line all the way through

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.569 
draw a line all the way through
separating<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> full<00:00:55.050> tone<00:00:55.980> side<00:00:56.219> bolts<00:00:56.489> from
