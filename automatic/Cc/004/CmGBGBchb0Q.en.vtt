00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
that and it's just a matter of figuring

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.480 
that and it's just a matter of figuring
out<00:01:13.299> how<00:01:13.710> number<00:01:14.710> one<00:01:14.890> I<00:01:14.920> was<00:01:15.159> going<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.340> work

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
out how number one I was going to work

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.999 
out how number one I was going to work
it<00:01:15.609> into<00:01:15.759> my<00:01:15.880> schedule<00:01:16.000> and<00:01:16.659> 42<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.530> was<00:01:17.740> going

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
it into my schedule and 42 I was going

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:25.589 
it into my schedule and 42 I was going
to<00:01:18.189> make<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:22.289> and<00:01:23.289> you<00:01:24.250> know<00:01:24.369> I<00:01:24.670> have<00:01:25.569> a

00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:25.599 
to make it and you know I have a

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:27.630 
to make it and you know I have a
tendency<00:01:26.079> to<00:01:26.109> feel<00:01:26.439> overboard<00:01:26.950> with<00:01:27.340> things

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
tendency to feel overboard with things

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.690 
tendency to feel overboard with things
and<00:01:28.000> so<00:01:28.329> I<00:01:28.599> will<00:01:28.869> often<00:01:29.200> time<00:01:29.439> to<00:01:29.679> jump<00:01:29.979> into<00:01:30.310> it

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
and so I will often time to jump into it

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.410 
and so I will often time to jump into it
and<00:01:31.030> weigh<00:01:32.020> over<00:01:32.500> two<00:01:32.829> things<00:01:33.099> and<00:01:34.090> of<00:01:34.359> course

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
and weigh over two things and of course

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.230 
and weigh over two things and of course
I<00:01:34.719> get<00:01:34.929> off<00:01:35.649> that<00:01:35.920> hurt<00:01:36.189> and<00:01:36.399> formal<00:01:36.939> I<00:01:37.060> don't

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
I get off that hurt and formal I don't

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.330 
I get off that hurt and formal I don't
want<00:01:37.359> to<00:01:37.420> do<00:01:37.539> that<00:01:37.569> again<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:38.950> really

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
want to do that again and so I really

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.169 
want to do that again and so I really
wanted<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.579> be<00:01:40.829> careful<00:01:41.829> and<00:01:42.069> not<00:01:42.280> do<00:01:42.849> that<00:01:43.000> to

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179
