00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.980
 hello tankers with you 40 tons and finally 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.019
 then at least a normal cross and mine 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.120
 sit what until recently 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:19.170
 there are domestic technical conditions honest 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.210
 or were not so very detailed in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 on my channel there at the very beginning 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.830
 watching they know that I had to go 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.929
 through a series of very large 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.460
 problems but who do not know the principle 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.170
 better not bother anymore because 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 if I start telling me this is a takeaway 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 my brain is full 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.190
 right now for the near future 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.510
 stay in St. Petersburg although incredible 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.370
 good city yes I liked it but 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.710
 still, many would agree with that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 rent housing there live in St. Petersburg that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.760
 to do well, it's as if a little expensive and the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.100
 what are allowed could get with youtube 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
 for example, what could help me all 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.000
 I can not get 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.210
 because already 3 months and youtube 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.670
 delays withdrawal processing and 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.720
 all this is not like in terms of there what is failure 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.479
 or something 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.009
 in the sense that there you have a letter with 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.200
 confirmation is all that but 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.810
 sorry she can go many weeks we 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.720
 we consider it normal and if he were still 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.689
 didn't come then excuse me so we kind of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.909
 it's pretty hard waiting to settle 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.939
 question with youtube 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.400
 parallel communicate with different 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.520
 intermediaries who also offer 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.720
 all sorts of different conditions principle 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.970
 although they suggest we eat 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.979
 significant part of some income 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.780
 who is there opportunity saint but there 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.670
 there are advantages for which 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.299
 can try wisdom while in 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.469
 meditations 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.920
 and now i'm already quite friend 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.590
 the place I was invited to visit a little 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.129
 nice people 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.680
 i moved to wave you 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:14.740
 allods 2 there if someone in the topic of cooking 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.930
 Kazakhstan maybe someone will be surprised 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.600
 what kind of significant relocation there 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.900
 some kind of trip is really nothing 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.570
 like this because for me with my 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.780
 travel experience but let's say 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.880
 VKontakte page if I want to specify 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.130
 all places of the city â€‹â€‹where inhale something 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.770
 did she could not accommodate that is maybe 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.140
 pavel durov changed something but when i 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.570
 I tried there 30 cities climbed large 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.930
 I will have a bigger list 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.900
 so it's like traveling to 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.959
 shuttle bus to work for came nothing 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.610
 special not feeling 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.300
 there are definitely some of your own 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.270
 pros 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.910
 some cons but the most important thing is that I 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.010
 I want to mention it is very warm and 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.489
 Warm welcome that we had 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.239
 good people kinda say well 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.959
 moral situation as if a little bit 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.480
 more than favorably that is me 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.670
 feel great and 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.519
 should you please for technically I'm 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.430
 a little better now 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.250
 There is in principle I think the next video 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.280
 which will appear well a little more than you 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.530
 please well I think yes that is where 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.830
 it will be clearer there somewhere fps more 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.790
 there somewhere but I do not see in 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.680
 principle on this all just wanted you 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.989
 report as what happens because 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.260
 many interesting many ask questions 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.470
