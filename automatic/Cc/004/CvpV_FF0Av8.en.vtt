00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello all friends not so long ago 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.540
 patch 1 and 8 which added our game 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.769
 personal combat missions 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.410
 many players immediately rushed to perform 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.929
 them and they began to have questions 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.060
 actually as efficiently as possible and 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.490
 quickly pass them these questions they 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.150
 asked me and so I decided to take off 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.000
 video in which I will try to give advice 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.550
 which will simplify the passage as much as possible 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.349
 combat missions as I mentioned before 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.540
 for myself I divide these tasks into three types 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.790
 the first type is surrender which depends 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200
 directly from your ability to play from 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.540
 skill 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.059
 these include change on quantity 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.700
 killed equipment for damage 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.070
 this technique is critical and on the amount 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.010
 hit the technique of the second type 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.969
 he is a little more difficult on the most unpleasant 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 combat missions 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.530
 it would you come in which are calculated 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 just random luck and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.370
 which extremely weakly depends on your 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.160
 skill 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.180
 these include crit crites 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.030
 on the blast of the enemy and on the burning of the enemy and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.460
 finally the third type of combat missions i have them 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.400
 I call combined that is which 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.520
 depends not only on your less 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.210
 play but also from some luck this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.470
 combat missions that are aimed at 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.320
 several victories in a row platoon 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.020
 either a word that is for later five wins 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.030
 in a row at a certain level of technology 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.770
 I understand that you need to play well for 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.600
 order to get victory but again 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.299
 still if you play great 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.820
 themselves in the team will be 6 to put it mildly 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.350
 very weak players 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.759
 it will be extremely difficult to drag 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.880
 impossible and so on the first type of combat 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.220
 tasks most important probably the very first 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.470
 look at this type of technique 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.860
 which you need to destroy if you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.310
 necessary to serve medium tanks 10 20 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.180
 pieces you don’t need to take it on why 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.369
 many maps 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.950
 rides of medium tanks are very 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.990
 very different if you take a heavy and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.789
 come on the direction of medium tanks 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.090
 you have a huge 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.790
 one of the fact that the st-shki you spin 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.379
 will make out and you can not even make 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.040
 one damage to them by the way they are 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.349
 much faster than you enticing line you and dpm 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.510
 they are often taller 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.859
 the same situation with heavy tanks 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.599
 who will deputation serve them on 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.340
 medium tanks not all you warm up and in 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.849
 forehead they will punch you every 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.590
 shot 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.370
 and go to porn one and stitches on 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.290
 three strands it is extremely unpleasant if you 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.109
 need to put a lot of critical 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.389
 damage equipment take 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.069
 a technique with preferably a gun which 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:47.930
 I can can shoot a landmine and has 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.189
 large caliber this is mainly fri-sau 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.560
 or some tyazh on the fifth 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.120
 set to have high-explosive guns because 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.709
 land mines cause a large amount 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.209
 physical damage you can crit 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.459
 it pairs at the same time caterpillars there 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.169
 mechvoda and gunner for example yet 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.540
 shots bent over anything else 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:06.049
 main shoot at different parts of the tank 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.129
 in order to criticize different modules and 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:12.750
 finally the third type is tasks on 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.280
 the number of hits in the technique is better here 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.060
 just take quick-fire equipment with 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.790
 fast kd 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.349
 because the faster you have to 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.669
 faster you can shoot again and those 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.549
 faster you can do a certain 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:26.430
 number of hits 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.709
 actually there on tanks 6 level 7 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.629
 rate of fire you can in a minute for 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.530
 two minutes make there about 15 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.720
 hit the enemy 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.430
 the main thing is to get exactly that is not 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.690
 hurry shooting come down completely and 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.459
 combat mission will be ready as well 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.620
 it is worth forgetting that besides 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.139
 combat mission you have a task in the game 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.879
 the main thing is to win 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.040
 so do not forget about everything and 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.840
 stars only perform its best not 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.299
 perform a combat mission but win in 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.040
 combat than vice versa perform it but not 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.599
 win and end up with no reward 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.090
 because in the text why were you 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.040
 must win and first chew 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.519
 don't forget about it and carefully 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:10.569
 read the conditions carefully and so 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.150
 go to the second type 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.189
 the second type as I said he 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.840
 completely random and you can only 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:20.199
 only indirectly affect the execution 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.350
 these combat missions and if in case of failure 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:26.020
 styling it is desirable to take a tank gun 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.720
 either fri-sau with a weapon 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.580
 alpha strike because the more of 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.370
 a straight the more damage on the modules 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.729
 pass and the easier it is to make 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.160
 detonate for Soviet 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.150
 Union is understandable Fri-Sau as a principle 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.460
 for other nations 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.860
 if the surrender is issued at the tenth level 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.199
 also fit a heavy tank e-100 because 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.789
 that he has a 150 meter cannon with good 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.050
 damage 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.970
 also do not hesitate to charge the land and 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.120
 land mines and also very well yes may 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.389
 other modules and cases are not uncommon 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:01.000
 penetration in a landmine in board or in the stern and 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:04.960
 then the ammo lay somewhere in 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.090
 eighty percent of the cases if 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.130
 combat mission aimed at arson 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.840
 any tank is better in this case 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.910
 take a tank with a fast kd 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.380
 because the more often you shoot at 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.229
 any module the more 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.300
 the probability you have it kratanut 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.889
 example if pressure you see that you 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.570
 do you shoot which tank and to this one 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.419
 tanks keep shooting the same 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.310
 the area where they shot for the first time before 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.380
 as long as it doesn’t usually burn there 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.039
 lights up after 2 or 3 hits 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.750
 fired up all the combat mission completed 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.280
 either you shoot at the engine but with 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.229
 the engine is a little harder if the tanks 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.580
 delivered very quickly and simply and there 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.780
 physically immediately lights up here kill and 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.470
 need to make at least three hits 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.280
 in order for it to catch fire again 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:52.210
 better to use for this 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.699
 technique with a buffer when in principle you can 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.979
 use the same nursery rhyme with a large 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.169
 alpha but the engine as it shows 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:03.820
 practice is not so frustrating as those 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.840
 same tanks and finally the third type the most such 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.530
 that's probably unpleasant because 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.630
 a lot of battherta a lot 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.240
 hate these combat missions because of 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.940
 the fact that the first can take good 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.310
 sovzvodnogo be yourself an experienced player in 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.470
 they play play you have four victories and 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.600
 for the fifth fight you throw example 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.790
 any frank crayfish which 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.330
 corny stand on base or there 2f and 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.690
 Kashin them he throws players and you still do not 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.669
 in the top and of course that even a platoon 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.979
 you can not bring this game as 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.250
 it turns out that four fights are held them up 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:43.310
 this just went down the drain 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.330
 what tips can be here first 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.770
 try to take you here 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.740
 which is perfect to combine with your friend 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.440
 if for example you are playing a game 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.330
 take in the platoon average or ptshku 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.919
 why because putting the nba and you 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.870
 will be a little different and will be very 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:02.160
 difficult garden frontal support you in 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.229
 the battle is also worth taking sovzvodnogo 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.940
 equal to the level of the game you either even 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.620
 who play a little bit better than you 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.810
 because if something happens, he can help 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:13.500
 you drag the fight if you are inadvertently 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:17.180
 merge and the third as much as possible 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:21.000
 concentrate on winning these battles 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.560
 forget combat missions play 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.360
 only on the pale fourth this 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.310
 probably more joke though maybe 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.539
 you will offer up prayers and all 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.510
 known to you gods 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.830

 lbz well others in the same spirit because of 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:40.349
 different superstitions it was right

 jokes on this i have all wish you 

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:44.360
