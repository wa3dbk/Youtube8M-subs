00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
treatment because you find that to be

vague<00:01:38.490> now<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.689> vague<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
vague now all of it is vague and

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.960 
vague now all of it is vague and
therefore<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.670> try<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
therefore what you do is you try to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.359 
therefore what you do is you try to
provide<00:01:42.479> some<00:01:42.750> clarity<00:01:42.990> by<00:01:43.350> saying<00:01:43.649> these

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
provide some clarity by saying these

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.760 
provide some clarity by saying these
here<00:01:45.119> are<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.360> subset<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> behaviors<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.619> we

here are the subset of behaviors that we

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.219 
here are the subset of behaviors that we
think<00:01:47.040> fall<00:01:47.280> under<00:01:47.579> those<00:01:47.729> terms<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.390> think

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
think fall under those terms I think

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.109 
think fall under those terms I think
