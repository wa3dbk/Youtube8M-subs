really<00:05:50.710> blooms<00:05:51.310> it<00:05:51.910> really<00:05:52.330> really<00:05:52.660> blooms

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
really blooms it really really blooms

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.750

and<00:05:53.320> like<00:05:53.710> it's<00:05:53.980> this<00:05:54.190> is<00:05:54.310> an<00:05:54.400> unusual

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
and like it's this is an unusual

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.880 
and like it's this is an unusual
combination<00:05:54.970> a<00:05:55.450> little<00:05:55.690> solid<00:05:56.080> body<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:56.590> this

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
combination a little solid body and this

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.380 
combination a little solid body and this
filter<00:05:57.220> Toronto<00:05:57.670> what<00:05:57.970> inspired<00:05:58.330> that

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
filter Toronto what inspired that

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.800 
filter Toronto what inspired that
decision<00:05:58.900> well<00:05:59.560> I<00:05:59.740> tell<00:06:00.070> you<00:06:00.420> you<00:06:01.420> know<00:06:01.450> the

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
decision well I tell you you know the

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.840 
decision well I tell you you know the
seems<00:06:02.410> like<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.860> filter<00:06:03.190> transit<00:06:03.640> and

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
seems like the filter transit and

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.150 
seems like the filter transit and
definitely<00:06:04.480> without<00:06:04.900> that<00:06:05.110> had<00:06:05.290> a<00:06:05.320> popularity

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
definitely without that had a popularity

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.270 
definitely without that had a popularity
resurgence<00:06:07.030> in<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.210> past<00:06:07.450> few<00:06:07.690> years<00:06:08.280> we've
