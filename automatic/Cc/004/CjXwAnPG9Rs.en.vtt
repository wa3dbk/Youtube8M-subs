00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
there's the light on let's swing it over

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.330 
there's the light on let's swing it over
there<00:01:45.030> -<00:01:45.119> camera<00:01:45.450> -<00:01:45.630> they<00:01:45.840> can't<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.340> turn

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
there - camera - they can't see I turn

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.920 
there - camera - they can't see I turn
it<00:01:47.460> away<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> second<00:01:48.299> does<00:01:48.390> camera<00:01:48.780> -

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it away here for a second does camera -

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990 
it away here for a second does camera -
gets<00:01:49.140> back<00:01:49.320> into<00:01:49.500> focus<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.430> basically<00:01:50.640> what

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
gets back into focus but basically what

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.630 
gets back into focus but basically what
you're<00:01:51.119> seeing<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.250> light

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you're seeing here is that the light

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.139 
you're seeing here is that the light
itself<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.960> flood<00:01:55.860> version<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.430> actually

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
itself in the flood version is actually

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.510 
itself in the flood version is actually
angled<00:01:57.329> down<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.070> other<00:01:59.159> words<00:01:59.369> what's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
angled down so in other words what's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
angled down so in other words what's
going<00:01:59.759> on<00:01:59.880> there's<00:02:00.090> more<00:02:00.270> light<00:02:00.509> intensity

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
going on there's more light intensity

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.870 
going on there's more light intensity
below<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:01.979> where<00:02:02.100> I'm<00:02:02.159> holding<00:02:02.490> my<00:02:02.610> hand

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
below here where I'm holding my hand

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
below here where I'm holding my hand
then<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.320> where<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.649> my<00:02:04.829> hand

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
then it is up here where I have my hand

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.319 
then it is up here where I have my hand
you<00:02:05.100> can't<00:02:05.250> really<00:02:05.399> soak<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.149> better

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
you can't really soak this but better

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.240 
you can't really soak this but better
there<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.930> basically<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.740> pointed

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
there but basically if I pointed

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.760 
there but basically if I pointed
downwards<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.360> get<00:02:09.569> more<00:02:09.780> intensity<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.560> if

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
downwards you get more intensity and if

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.320 
downwards you get more intensity and if
I<00:02:10.890> point<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.160> directly<00:02:11.489> up<00:02:11.700> at<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> camera<00:02:12.300> you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
I point it directly up at the camera you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.770 
I point it directly up at the camera you
can

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
can

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.520 
can
as<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.560> field<00:02:14.010> intensity<00:02:14.930> increases<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:16.320> I

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
as the field intensity increases as I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.800 
as the field intensity increases as I
change<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.980> angle<00:02:17.130> as<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:18.000> point<00:02:18.270> directly<00:02:18.390> at

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
change the angle as I point directly at

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.990 
change the angle as I point directly at
the<00:02:18.930> camera<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:20.190> there<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.520> have<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.760> an

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
the camera so there you have it an

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.910 
the camera so there you have it an
excellent<00:02:21.450> product<00:02:21.750> from<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.110> gang<00:02:22.320> over<00:02:22.770> at
