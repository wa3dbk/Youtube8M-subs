00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.600
 in the aromatic plants are plants 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 which work very well in climates 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.670
 Mediterranean are plants that are 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.640
 indigenous people of this area and who like 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.410
 above all well-drained land where 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.289
 do not accumulate water irrigations 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.020
 sporadic and good exposure to light 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.000
 a lot of light these plants have a 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.730
 particularity that is that they produce 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.189
 essential oils these oils are the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.589
 responsible for those aromas so 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.109
 characteristic and exquisite of each 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:40.949
 of them but for the plants they meet 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:43.769
 a specific function and that is that they are your 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.629
 way of cooling is a system of 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.589
 cooling they use to be able 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.260
 overcome the heats that occur in these 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.350
 Mediterranean climate zones we are going to give 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.840
 a few brief notes 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.789
 the most common aromatics in the first 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.030
 place we have lavender which is a 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.890
 basically undemanding 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.500
 what it requires is a well-drained soil 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.110
 where it does not tend to have that water and good 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.509
 exposure needs sun likes a lot 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.539
 the sun to the band on the other hand is a 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.000
 plant resistant to drought but in 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.789
 spring-summer we will have to water it 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.860
 regularly and also provide a good 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.869
 fertilizer the following aromatic of which 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.460
 I want to talk thyme is the 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.039
 thyme is an aromatic especially 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.429
 Rustic develops very well in full 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.080
 sun and he likes light terrains and 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.460
 drained does not like either the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.440
 waterlogging is quite 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.140
 resistant to drought simply 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.450
 we must be careful in spring of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.210
 that does not lack water regarding the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.440
 so I thank the application of 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.140
 fertilizer for autumn now we go with 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.569
 the rosemary the aromatics in general are 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.659
 plants that are grown a lot for their 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:59.990
 culinary interest for its aromas 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.270
 in cases where we want to have a 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.189
 urban garden the rosemary is especially 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.299
 appreciated for its characteristics 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.950
 culinary 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.170
 therapeutic and is also appreciated in 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.510
 perfumery is undemanding is a 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.360
 perennial shrub that can bloom almost 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.150
 all year round and also like the ones 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.790
 well-drained soils and in this case yes 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.489
 who likes water less the floors 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.690
 dried rosemary will do well in spring 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.230
 You may need some pruning to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.230
 clarify it 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.390
 you will appreciate especially though it is not very 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.459
 demanding regarding soils if we use 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.379
 a good substrate will thank you goes 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.209
 to develop much better and on the other 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.849
 side the contribution of fertilizer in spring and 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.040
 autumn can also be very 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:49.159
 beneficial finally we have the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.739
 oregano is a living pharmacy that should not 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.230
 missing in our urban garden since 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.970
 this one is very widely used 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.190
 in the kitchen she also likes the floors 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.459
 Well drained good sun exposure 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.959
 and rich in organic matter the 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.269
 Water requirements are also low 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.010
 it does not usually require many risks 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.560
 in summer unless summers are very 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.769
 strong and what he does appreciate are the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.769
 subscribers in autumn as we have already come 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.720
 commenting on aromatics is an option 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.760
 very interesting to locate in your 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.940
 gardens and terraces and on the one hand 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.640
 enjoy its exquisite aromas and for 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.829
 another you can incorporate it to your 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.239
 our kitchen taking advantage of it and 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.239
 using it as condiments
