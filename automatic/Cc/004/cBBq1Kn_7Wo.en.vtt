00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 hi friends from youtube i am your friend dann 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.559
 ortiz and I bring you this new video 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.770
 about the end of the world let's start 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.990
 good as many will already know this 21 of 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 December the world ends according to 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.640
 Maya but still this is very little 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 probable since other supposed ends of the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.769
 world were never made or it did not happen nor 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.949
 mothers on December 21 nothing will happen 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.260
 absolutely nothing since the 21 of 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.649
 December 2012 starts a new cycle 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.290
 a new start for example is like a 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.579
 speedometer which if it reaches 99 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.280
 one thousand nine hundred ninety nine 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.590
 kilometers you will see that it does not reach the hundred 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.980
 thousand but it will start from scratch again 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.750
 and what happened the car did not explode but good 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.000
 so they know more of that look in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 cap there is that information x 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.190
 but still the world will end when 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.199
 one wants it when one proposes it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.750
 now who has not dreamed of a 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.880
 zombie apocalypse would be great to kill 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.189
 a zombie fly his brains 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.680
 if a zombie apocalypse happened the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.960
 normal people would be scared looking 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.390
 refuge the geeks would use their 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.880
 Knowledge in left4dead to kill 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.070
 zombies and abnormal people would be taken 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.070
 photos with the zombies to upload them to 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.380
 facebook and the necrophiles would seek the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.200
 better protection x of this apocalypse 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.049
 it would be great a dream come true 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.240
 but even so we would be charged by the fucking clown 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.880
 shit because without weapons ammunition 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.789
 Hidden vehicles we will be zombies 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.130
 now another apocalypse something great would be 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.950
 an alien invasion would be great 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.899
 fight against aliens kill them and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.539
 feel in the saga of I have gone as 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.729
 master chief or as in years of wars 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.159
 as marcus phoenix but the only 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.140
 disadvantage would be your whores super weapons 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.990
 advanced capable of destroying ones in 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.659
 seconds we would not be anything before 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.329
 them but with strategies you would win 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.700
 now another apocalypse would be a meteor 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.369
 going to the land which if you 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.619
 impacts a lot of this on the earth 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
 will be destroyed but as nobody 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.110
 matter that I prefer the apocalypse 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.750
 zombie 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.850
 Well the only thing I can say is that the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.090
 end of the world will not be on December 21 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.940
 since it is only a myth but if the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.570
 end of the world on December 21 then 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.360
 let it be a zombie apocalypse please 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.430
 well that's it and in a few days 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.510
 another video which will be geek video 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.510
 bye bye
