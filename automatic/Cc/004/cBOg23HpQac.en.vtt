repel flies naturally now flies have

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.280 
repel flies naturally now flies have
been<00:00:08.429> around<00:00:08.700> for<00:00:09.240> longer<00:00:09.599> than<00:00:09.719> humans<00:00:10.170> and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
been around for longer than humans and

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.020 
been around for longer than humans and
they'll<00:00:10.440> probably<00:00:10.620> be<00:00:10.830> around<00:00:11.429> even<00:00:12.000> longer

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
they'll probably be around even longer

they'll probably be around even longer
than<00:00:12.360> us<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.590> when<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.009> comes<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.580> insects<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
than us so when it comes to insects and

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.040 
than us so when it comes to insects and
bugs<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.870> animals<00:00:16.490> my<00:00:17.490> theory<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.630> don't

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
bugs and animals my theory is you don't

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.960 
bugs and animals my theory is you don't
ever<00:00:19.260> want<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.650> kill<00:00:19.890> them<00:00:20.160> because<00:00:20.640> they

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
ever want to kill them because they

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.730 
ever want to kill them because they
deserve<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.600> here<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:21.960> as<00:00:22.050> much<00:00:22.199> as<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.560> do

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
deserve to be here just as much as we do

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.950 
deserve to be here just as much as we do
but<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.550> need<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> set<00:00:24.090> boundaries<00:00:24.449> for<00:00:24.779> them

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
but we need to set boundaries for them

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.109 
but we need to set boundaries for them
and<00:00:25.230> control<00:00:25.560> their<00:00:25.710> actions<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> first

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
