00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 after all this hot guys is 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.460
 finally time to 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.710
 dedicate a prize to a sweet prize 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.469
 I would say I thought so to prepare a 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.389
 delicious cake a cold cake the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.490
 chocolate without using the oven is 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.350
 for charity because the fund meanwhile is in 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 holidays as we will 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.880
 we will make a base clock kant with the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.250
 puffed rice and then a cover 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.859
 creamy alone to say it or the choline in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.960
 mouth let's see how it prepares for the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.869
 base we need 120 grams of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.489
 dark chocolate 70 g of rice 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.880
 blown naturally or al 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.530
 chocolate for the cream 200 g of cream 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.890
 fresh 100 g of fresh ricotta 100 g of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.300
 spreadable cheese 50 g of sugar a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.969
 veil 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.149
 3 grams of isinglass 25 g of rice 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.730
 blown to cover 100 g of 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.430
 dark chocolate 100 milliliters of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.969
 cloth we start with the preparation of 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.670
 base I have already closed to the microwave 120 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.260
 grams of dark chocolate you can 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.290
 clearly dissolve it also a 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.610
 bain-marie if you do not have a microwave 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.560
 add the puffed rice I have 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.930
 chosen chocolate puffed rice leaves 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.830
 also the neutral one is good and we mix 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.409
 for good this is the result 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.509
 now here or lined a hinged pan 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.520
 from the diameter of 20 centimeters with the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.680
 baking paper is also simple 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.939
 film that much of everything will then be 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 put in the fridge, we pour all the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.900
 our puffed rice 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.119
 so instead of making the classic mince 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.729
 of biscuits and butter not as a base of a 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.189
 cheesecake here we use own the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.899
 we are selling good rice and there is puffed rice 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.909
 maybe we also help with a spoon 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.909
 to flatten the surface 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.340
 now the base we put it in 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.370
 freezer just in time 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.850
 to prepare the cream to make the cream 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.790
 I soaked the gelatin in 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.400
 cold water for about 10 minutes if not 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.080
 you want to use isinglass 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.110
 replace it with 4 grams of agar agar 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.170
 in that case you will have to dissolve the race 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.930
 in a little hot liquid and then 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.840
 add it to your ok compound here 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.110
 there's the cream we keep a little aside 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.970
 which will serve to dissolve us 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.739
 then the gelatin the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.040
 remaining cream instead we pour it into 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.170
 another bowl and we assemble it with the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.300
 electric whips adding floor 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.910
 flat the less sugar or semi mounted the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:47.060
 cream now the meter inside a 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.830
 smaller container and mix in 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:57.920
 spreadable cheese is fine one 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:03:00.280
 any and the fresh ricotta mix 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.380
 quickly with whips without cream 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.530
 otherwise it collapses 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.220
 we reach 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.220
 then slowly 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.950
 once obtained the cream of this 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.620
 consistency add the little cream 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.620
 at a time and the hut loved me calmly 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:27.230
 add now some puffed rice to 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.980
 chocolate with our cream we mix 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.200
 always slowly meanwhile or 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.800
 heated without the cream in the microwave 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.570
 that I had kept aside you remember 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.610
 this here or warmed just worth everything 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.810
 what is needed to dissolve the glue 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.400
 of fish we put the isinglass 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.140
 found in stressed soaking water 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.060
 scoliamo so keep up to 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:04:00.620
 melting once dissolved and the thing 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:02.600
 of fish we can combine it with the cream la 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.640
 isinglass is essential for 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.610
 get a nice slice of cake 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:13.400
 compact this is the consistency that 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.580
 I want to keep meanwhile too 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.010
 removed the puffed rice base from the 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:23.330
 freezer you have it firmed 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.980
 well we combine all the cream we release and 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.850
 then we leave in the fridge for about 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.850
 mezz'oretta 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.689
 after about half an hour to an hour in short of 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.310
 fridge 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:40.370
 this is the result is not 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.550
 completely compact, however, it is possible 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.960
 proceed to cover with a kind of 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.840
 Ganache Chocolate 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.789
 what made or melted in the microwave the 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:57.050
 dark chocolate add the cream 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.969
 so if I call it jaws even if it is 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.919
 in short, a species suffices and the ganache does 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.110
 you do a little bit differently you can 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.789
 find the recipe overlay or 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:12.740
 even at the end of the video I will put the 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:17.910
 correct link so let's pour a cream 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:24.540
 covering over the cream 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:27.390
 white spread well with a spatula 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.820
 then we put it in the fridge for two or three 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.650
 hours so that this time it compacts 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.180
 to the discussion in this way 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:41.430
 you will see that we will succeed in obtaining some 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:45.900
 slices after three hours of cooling 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:50.510
 this is the result we remove the ring 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.510
 of hinge and slowly 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.470
 here it is 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.920
 I would call this cake a mix between a 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.410
 chocolate cheesecake and cake with 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.640
 i mars now I'll also show you 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.530
 the inside and this is the result 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.200
 in short, I hope my sweet guys 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.850
 you enjoyed it you can clearly 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.130
 customize it according to your tastes 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.470
 for example you can prepare this cake 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.660
 with white chocolate you can avoid the 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.940
 jaws cover it like a jelly of 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.260
 good sweet adult raspberries denice my 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.130
 personal trainer and put me a like 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.130
 if you liked
