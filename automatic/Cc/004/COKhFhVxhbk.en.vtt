00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.939 
ahead and take a look at the battery and
what<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.769> looks<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.759> Galaxy<00:00:15.330> Nexus

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
what it looks like in the Galaxy Nexus

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.680 
what it looks like in the Galaxy Nexus
so<00:00:16.949> here's<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.640> battery<00:00:17.970> itself<00:00:18.090> as<00:00:18.539> you

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
so here's the battery itself as you

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.679 
so here's the battery itself as you
could<00:00:18.869> see<00:00:19.220> I'll<00:00:20.220> compared<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> size<00:00:21.359> of

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
could see I'll compared to the size of

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.130 
could see I'll compared to the size of
the<00:00:22.369> original<00:00:23.369> battery<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.480> second

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the original battery just in the second

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.990 
the original battery just in the second
so<00:00:25.880> let's<00:00:26.880> go<00:00:27.029> ahead<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.349> read<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.890> 3.7<00:00:29.789> v

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
so let's go ahead and read it's a 3.7 v

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.150 
so let's go ahead and read it's a 3.7 v
DC<00:00:31.189> 3800<00:00:32.189> mah<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.930> lithium<00:00:34.440> ion<00:00:34.590> battery

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
DC 3800 mah it's a lithium ion battery

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.510 
DC 3800 mah it's a lithium ion battery
it's<00:00:35.640> rechargeable<00:00:36.210> obviously<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.399> as<00:00:38.399> you

it's rechargeable obviously and as you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.940 
it's rechargeable obviously and as you
can<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.000> has<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.510> part<00:00:40.410> number<00:00:40.680> over<00:00:40.920> here

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
can see it has the part number over here

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.260 
can see it has the part number over here

i 9250 galaxy nexus prime so let's go
ahead<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.570> put<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.079> into<00:00:46.350> my<00:00:47.219> phone<00:00:47.250> right

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
ahead and put this into my phone right

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
ahead and put this into my phone right
over<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.719> want<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> you

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
over here so what you want to do is you

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.549 
over here so what you want to do is you
want<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.680> pop<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.399> back<00:00:50.640> open<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.390> take<00:00:52.350> out

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
want to pop the back open and take out

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.189 
want to pop the back open and take out
the<00:00:53.190> battery<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.210> originally<00:00:54.539> have

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the battery that you originally have

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.130 
the battery that you originally have
let's<00:00:55.920> compare<00:00:56.280> these<00:00:56.520> side<00:00:56.820> by<00:00:56.850> side<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.899> as

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
let's compare these side by side so as

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.619 
let's compare these side by side so as
you<00:00:59.100> can<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.609> they<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.590> identical<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.859> length

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
you can see they are identical in length

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.710 
you can see they are identical in length
because<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:04.080> has<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.500> fit<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.240> the<00:01:06.240> extended

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
because it has to fit but the extended

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.870 
because it has to fit but the extended
battery<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.530> double<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> thickness<00:01:08.400> as

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
battery is like double the thickness as

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.899 
battery is like double the thickness as
you<00:01:09.000> could<00:01:09.210> tell<00:01:10.130> side<00:01:11.130> by<00:01:11.340> side<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.760> could

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you could tell side by side you could

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.450 
you could tell side by side you could
tell<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.479> lot<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.049> lot<00:01:13.080> thicker<00:01:13.500> this

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
tell it's a lot it's a lot thicker this

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.480 
tell it's a lot it's a lot thicker this
compared<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.729> all<00:01:17.729> right<00:01:18.080> it's<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
compared to this so all right it's a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.219 
compared to this so all right it's a
like<00:01:20.490> double<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> size<00:01:21.210> pretty<00:01:21.630> much<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
like double the size pretty much as you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.969 
like double the size pretty much as you
could<00:01:22.380> tell<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:23.390> over<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:26.540> this<00:01:27.540> would<00:01:27.780> be

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
could tell right over here this would be

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.999 
could tell right over here this would be
the<00:01:28.979> original<00:01:29.189> size<00:01:29.700> battery<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.680> as<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.860> can

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the original size battery and as you can

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.539 
the original size battery and as you can
see<00:01:32.329> back<00:01:33.329> here<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.770> double<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> size

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
see back here it's like double the size

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
see back here it's like double the size
so<00:01:35.759> let's<00:01:35.909> go<00:01:36.030> ahead<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.270> put<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> battery

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
so let's go ahead and put this a battery

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.910 
so let's go ahead and put this a battery
into<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> phone<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.240> goes<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.780> slips<00:01:40.710> in

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
into the phone so it goes in slips in

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.899 
into the phone so it goes in slips in
like<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:43.430> obviously<00:01:44.430> you're<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.759> going

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
like so and obviously you're not going

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.770 
like so and obviously you're not going
to<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.090> able<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.509> use<00:01:46.399> pure<00:01:47.399> original<00:01:48.090> back

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to be able to use pure original back

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.230 
to be able to use pure original back
cover<00:01:48.950> because<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.189> battery<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.640> big<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.149> it

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
cover because the battery is big and it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.280 
cover because the battery is big and it
just<00:01:51.780> wouldn't<00:01:52.170> fit<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> could<00:01:53.549> see

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
just wouldn't fit so as you could see

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
just wouldn't fit so as you could see
original<00:01:55.290> back<00:01:55.530> cover<00:01:55.790> doesn't<00:01:56.790> fit<00:01:56.909> maybe

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
original back cover doesn't fit maybe

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.219 
original back cover doesn't fit maybe
I'm<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> go<00:01:57.479> ahead<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.689> turn<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.049> light

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
I'm going to go ahead and turn the light

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.780 
I'm going to go ahead and turn the light
on<00:01:58.259> over<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.130> guys<00:01:59.340> could<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
on over here so you guys could see a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.230 
on over here so you guys could see a
little<00:01:59.850> bit<00:02:00.210> better<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.560> could<00:02:01.740> see

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
little bit better as you could see

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.410 
little bit better as you could see
original<00:02:03.240> covers<00:02:03.630> not<00:02:03.899> going<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.170> fit<00:02:04.439> at<00:02:04.560> all

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
original covers not going to fit at all

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.660 
original covers not going to fit at all
so<00:02:06.420> let's<00:02:06.719> go<00:02:06.840> ahead<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.170> pop<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.399> cover

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so let's go ahead and pop on the cover

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.280 
so let's go ahead and pop on the cover
that<00:02:08.940> comes<00:02:09.360> with<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.140> battery

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.020 

so<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:13.709> going<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:13.860> slip<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:16.439> clips<00:02:20.030> like

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so it's going to slip in the clips like

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.119 
so it's going to slip in the clips like
this<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.930> want<00:02:22.409> to<00:02:22.530> make<00:02:22.680> sure<00:02:22.709> they're<00:02:23.099> all

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
this I want to make sure they're all

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.539 
this I want to make sure they're all
shut<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.480> blunt<00:02:24.750> problem<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.859> this

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
shut the blunt problem with this

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.649 
shut the blunt problem with this
extended<00:02:27.090> battery<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:28.909> it<00:02:29.909> sticks<00:02:30.420> out<00:02:30.599> a

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
extended battery is it sticks out a

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.899 
extended battery is it sticks out a
little<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.319> for<00:02:31.560> me<00:02:31.709> that's<00:02:32.069> not<00:02:32.310> really<00:02:32.640> that

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
little but for me that's not really that

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.699 
little but for me that's not really that
much<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.629> problem<00:02:33.659> it's<00:02:34.260> not<00:02:34.439> that<00:02:34.680> much

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
much of a problem it's not that much

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.559 
much of a problem it's not that much
bigger<00:02:35.159> as<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.909> could<00:02:36.090> see<00:02:37.430> but<00:02:38.430> you're<00:02:39.420> not

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
bigger as you could see but you're not

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.539 
bigger as you could see but you're not
going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.989> be<00:02:40.139> able<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.620> use<00:02:40.799> any<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.159> the<00:02:41.340> cases

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
going to be able to use any of the cases

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.539 
going to be able to use any of the cases
I<00:02:41.849> haven't<00:02:42.420> really<00:02:42.569> checked<00:02:43.049> if<00:02:43.439> there<00:02:44.250> are

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
I haven't really checked if there are

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.119 
I haven't really checked if there are
cases<00:02:45.180> for<00:02:45.659> extended<00:02:46.200> batteries<00:02:46.620> well<00:02:46.799> as<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
cases for extended batteries well as you

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.330 
cases for extended batteries well as you
can<00:02:47.250> see<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:48.299> case<00:02:48.870> won't<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.889> won't<00:02:50.099> fit

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
can see the case won't just won't fit

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.089 
can see the case won't just won't fit
and<00:02:50.609> even<00:02:50.879> if<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.120> did<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.480> wouldn't<00:02:52.099> fit

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
and even if it did it wouldn't fit

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.759 
and even if it did it wouldn't fit
properly<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:54.030> that's<00:02:54.780> one<00:02:55.049> downside<00:02:55.590> of

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
properly so that's one downside of

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.860 
properly so that's one downside of
having<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:56.840> extended<00:02:57.840> battery<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:59.040> your

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
having a extended battery is that your

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.539 
having a extended battery is that your
phone<00:03:00.870> isn't<00:03:01.169> going<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> be<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:01.799> protected<00:03:02.430> as

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
phone isn't going to be as protected as

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.780 
phone isn't going to be as protected as
it<00:03:02.760> should<00:03:03.060> be<00:03:04.099> so<00:03:05.099> if<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:06.450> drop<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.780> on

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
it should be so if you drop it on

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.740 
it should be so if you drop it on
there's<00:03:08.790> probably<00:03:08.939> going<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.299> be<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.540> little

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
there's probably going to be a little

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.119 
there's probably going to be a little
more<00:03:09.870> damage<00:03:10.470> coming<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.489> your<00:03:11.669> phone<00:03:11.970> then<00:03:13.129> it

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
more damage coming to your phone then it

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.039 
more damage coming to your phone then it
would<00:03:14.310> be<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.639> I<00:03:15.000> have<00:03:15.209> used<00:03:15.419> this<00:03:15.599> battery

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
would be and I have used this battery

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.729 
would be and I have used this battery
it's<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.250> great<00:03:18.060> battery<00:03:18.299> pretty<00:03:18.810> much<00:03:19.049> doubles

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
it's a great battery pretty much doubles

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.420 
it's a great battery pretty much doubles
on<00:03:20.190> my<00:03:21.120> battery<00:03:21.419> life<00:03:21.959> with<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.769> usage<00:03:23.099> of<00:03:23.220> my

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
on my battery life with the usage of my

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.879 
on my battery life with the usage of my
phone<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.709> great<00:03:26.569> but<00:03:27.569> also<00:03:28.260> with<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
phone so it is great but also with the

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.089 
phone so it is great but also with the
double<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.569> size<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.199> double<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.919> time

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
double the size of the double the time

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.039 
double the size of the double the time
of<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.370> battery<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:33.239> also<00:03:33.540> doubles<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.019> size

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
of the battery it also doubles the size

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.759 
of the battery it also doubles the size
of<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.560> battery<00:03:34.979> and<00:03:35.250> on<00:03:36.319> just<00:03:37.319> makes<00:03:37.650> your

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
of the battery and on just makes your

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.589 
of the battery and on just makes your
phone<00:03:38.010> quite<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.459> bit<00:03:38.699> bigger<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:41.510> we're<00:03:42.510> going

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
phone quite a bit bigger so we're going

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.319 
phone quite a bit bigger so we're going
to<00:03:42.690> go<00:03:42.720> ahead<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.349> see<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.769> actually<00:03:44.220> try<00:03:44.760> not

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
to go ahead and see I actually try not

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.869 
to go ahead and see I actually try not
sure<00:03:45.599> if<00:03:45.720> i<00:03:45.780> charge<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.229> battery<00:03:46.500> fully<00:03:47.099> but

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
sure if i charge this battery fully but

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.149 
sure if i charge this battery fully but
we're<00:03:47.970> going<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.150> go<00:03:48.299> ahead<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.659> see<00:03:49.159> the

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
we're going to go ahead and see the

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.819 
we're going to go ahead and see the
expectancy<00:03:51.120> life<00:03:51.659> of<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.079> battery<00:03:52.530> right

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
expectancy life of this battery right

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.479 
expectancy life of this battery right
now<00:03:53.180> okay<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.239> we're<00:03:54.659> in<00:03:54.690> and<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.979> fully

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
now okay so we're in and it is fully

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.710 
now okay so we're in and it is fully
charged<00:03:57.239> so<00:03:58.129> slide<00:03:59.129> to<00:03:59.340> unlock<00:03:59.400> and<00:04:00.090> go<00:04:00.359> ahead

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
charged so slide to unlock and go ahead

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.319 
charged so slide to unlock and go ahead
into<00:04:01.049> settings<00:04:01.650> I'm<00:04:01.979> not<00:04:02.159> sure<00:04:02.459> if<00:04:02.729> it's<00:04:03.000> going

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
into settings I'm not sure if it's going

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:11.199 
into settings I'm not sure if it's going
to<00:04:03.829> tell<00:04:04.829> me<00:04:05.010> how<00:04:05.699> long<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:06.389> know<00:04:07.019> just<00:04:07.349> as<00:04:07.639> 95%

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.129 

maybe<00:04:12.209> there's<00:04:12.419> an<00:04:12.569> application<00:04:13.109> for

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
maybe there's an application for

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.080 
maybe there's an application for
expected<00:04:16.139> battery<00:04:16.889> life<00:04:17.070> expectancy<00:04:17.849> so

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
expected battery life expectancy so

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.249 
expected battery life expectancy so
maybe<00:04:18.299> I'll<00:04:18.479> just<00:04:18.630> put<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:18.900> in<00:04:19.139> the

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
maybe I'll just put that in the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.870 
maybe I'll just put that in the

wanted to mention the packaging wasn't a
too<00:05:23.639> good<00:05:23.940> battery<00:05:24.780> was<00:05:25.020> in<00:05:25.199> this<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:25.800> the

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
too good battery was in this and the

too good battery was in this and the
case<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.360> battery<00:05:27.539> were<00:05:27.810> both<00:05:28.050> in<00:05:28.260> this<00:05:28.440> so<00:05:28.620> it

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
case and battery were both in this so it

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.580 
case and battery were both in this so it
wasn't<00:05:29.070> too<00:05:29.130> well<00:05:29.490> protected<00:05:29.840> but<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:31.410> all
