00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.339
 We are going to talk about memory today. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.710
 in muscle memory is very 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.570
 important for any musician but in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.250
 especially for us drummers because the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.870
 our instrument is very physical 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.619
 so I'll read a definition that I 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.109
 I liked about memory memory 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.600
 relation to learning 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.699
 involves the consolidation of a 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 specific task in memory through the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.619
 repetition when the movement is repeated 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.009
 often a muscular memory of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 long term is created for this task 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.500
 allowing it to be performed without much 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.140
 effort 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.800
 this process reduces the need for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.690
 attention and creates maximum efficiency 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.690
 inside the motor system and in memory 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.070
 so I 'll give you an example. 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.110
 when you drive a car for example 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.059
 you do not think of all the tasks that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.440
 You're running, do not you think ? 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.270
 I'm going to step on the brakes or step on the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.640
 accelerator I'm going to pass the first gear 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.100
 because because both your mind when 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.769
 already developed this body. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.260
 memory you already know what to do but 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.659
 I get you put in a car that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.490
 whose direction is on the right but 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.020
 only he will know exactly what 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.860
 to do but your body will not 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.670
 because because you lack muscle memory 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.220
 bringing this to our instrument 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.619
 for example if you see someone playing 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.729
 make a sentence a turn and you understand 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.320
 what did he do 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.110
 you sit on your instrument to do 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.090
 you can not because in your mind you 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.729
 already understood but your body has not yet 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.500
 knows how to perform once more why 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.850
 you do not have muscle memory and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.119
 how do we develop this 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.979
 muscle memory through repetition 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.600
 So I'll give you an example. 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.430
 now I'm going to get two of the proceeds 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.079
 simpler most used your touch 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.579
 simple double-tap 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.950
 I'll make a simple touch with my hand. 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.200
 right-hand accent on a double tap with the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.840
 left hand with the softest notes 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.030
 I'll do it first in the box and 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.530
 then I'll distribute it in the kit or 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.540
 I will change because the extraction but I will 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.329
 to be doing exactly the same thing 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.600
 single tap and double tap and then you 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.119
 will see how we can develop 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.739
 phrases using muscle memory one 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.739
 something that we repeat a lot 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.570
 so we have now seen an example 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.610
 summary of how you pick up the memory 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.250
 muscles that you have developed in the 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.770
 you gradually extend it to 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.660
 include what dictated I did it with a 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.209
 single touch single tap 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.350
 you can do with any income 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.910
 then the first you apply your 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.130
 the cash and develops this 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.160
 muscle memory this facility and 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.410
 gradually you begin to incorporate 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.880
 other parts of the battery doing so 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.680
 you will see that this muscle memory 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.609
 you won at first the box goes 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.109
 to help you 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.209
 but it will be necessary to earn a little 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.090
 more muscle memory so that you 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.810
 may be there expanding to the rest of the 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.350
 kit 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.450
 Ok for today, this is it if you liked it 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.270
 click liked liked the video 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.790
 so our channel is mainly 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.600
 join us we talk about these and 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.930
 other very interesting subjects in the 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.830
 www.ba.com would have brasil.com.br ok 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.830
 to the next
