00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
a lot of requests on this trick and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.150 
a lot of requests on this trick and
first<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.710> it's<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.800> easy<00:00:42.739> like<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.010> learn

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
first of all it's not easy like to learn

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.569 
first of all it's not easy like to learn
but<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:46.379> makes<00:00:46.620> pretty<00:00:46.770> challenging<00:00:47.190> norm<00:00:47.370> but

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
but it makes pretty challenging norm but

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.520 
but it makes pretty challenging norm but
once<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> hang<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:49.260> pretty

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
once you get the hang of it it's pretty

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.029 
once you get the hang of it it's pretty
it's<00:00:50.280> not<00:00:50.700> too<00:00:50.940> difficult<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.800> got<00:00:53.010> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it's not too difficult you just got to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:01.930 
it's not too difficult you just got to
practice<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> lot<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:58.670> it's<00:00:59.670> really<00:01:00.920> just

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
practice it a lot and it's really just

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.770 
practice it a lot and it's really just
busy<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.270> anyway<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> finger<00:01:06.299> positionings

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
busy well anyway so finger positionings

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
busy well anyway so finger positionings
like<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.790> there's<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:08.970> index<00:01:09.510> finger<00:01:09.979> is<00:01:10.979> my

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
like that there's my index finger is my

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.660 
like that there's my index finger is my
middle<00:01:11.970> finger<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:15.590> all<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
middle finger like that all it is to it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.789 
middle finger like that all it is to it
is<00:01:19.009> step<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:20.250> I'm<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.270> sliding<00:01:21.659> up

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
is step off I'm going to just sliding up

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.780 
is step off I'm going to just sliding up
like<00:01:22.799> toward<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> corner<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.330> out<00:01:24.770> well

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
like toward the corner not like out well

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.929 
like toward the corner not like out well
it'd<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.299> an<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.600> forward<00:01:28.170> heel<00:01:28.820> which<00:01:29.820> is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it'd be like an I forward heel which is

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090 
it'd be like an I forward heel which is
like<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> difference<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:30.930> or<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.740> mean<00:01:31.979> I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
like a difference I think or I mean I

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
like a difference I think or I mean I
live<00:01:32.220> aerial<00:01:32.430> what<00:01:33.150> I'm<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.079> them<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
live aerial what I'm not one of them I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.539 
live aerial what I'm not one of them I
don't<00:01:34.500> know<00:01:34.610> see<00:01:35.610> um<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:37.049> anyway<00:01:37.400> that's<00:01:38.400> how

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
don't know see um so anyway that's how

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.149 
don't know see um so anyway that's how
would<00:01:38.700> look<00:01:39.110> what<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.380> audio<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.860> just

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
would look what we want audio so just

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.289 
would look what we want audio so just
slide<00:01:41.340> off<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> corner<00:01:42.920> okay<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> should

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
slide off the corner okay and you should

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.410 
slide off the corner okay and you should
get<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.570> fun<00:01:45.979> as<00:01:46.979> long<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:47.640> your<00:01:47.850> fingers<00:01:48.240> like

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
get it fun as long as your fingers like

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
get it fun as long as your fingers like
this<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.470> should<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.740> good<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:52.680> pop

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
this then you should be good and the pop

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.410 
this then you should be good and the pop
more<00:01:53.759> into<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> pop<00:01:54.500> it's<00:01:55.880> want<00:01:56.880> your<00:01:57.000> finger

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
more into the pop it's want your finger

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.450 
more into the pop it's want your finger
kind<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> dip<00:01:58.200> fish<00:01:58.409> area<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:59.399> on

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
kind of in the dip fish area more on

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
kind of in the dip fish area more on
that<00:01:59.579> more<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> tail<00:02:00.570> because<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that more like the tail because if it's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
that more like the tail because if it's
in<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> dip<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.070> won't<00:02:02.219> get<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
in the dip you won't get get it that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.510 
in the dip you won't get get it that
high<00:02:03.719> or<00:02:03.930> probably<00:02:04.229> get<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.130> but

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
high or probably get like like that but

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.630 
high or probably get like like that but
we'll<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> full<00:02:06.600> clip<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:08.489> all

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
we'll get the full clip so that's all

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400 
we'll get the full clip so that's all
there<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.300> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
there is to it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.860 
there is to it
don't<00:02:11.410> Akash<00:02:11.740> I'd<00:02:11.980> switch<00:02:12.340> feels<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:13.750> like

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
don't Akash I'd switch feels it's like

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.530 
don't Akash I'd switch feels it's like
the<00:02:13.960> same<00:02:14.140> motion<00:02:14.470> experience<00:02:14.920> which<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:16.270> try

the same motion experience which and try
to<00:02:16.600> UM<00:02:16.810> slide<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.470> bit<00:02:17.620> harder<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.180> follow

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
to UM slide it a bit harder and follow

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:28.080 
to UM slide it a bit harder and follow
through<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:24.330> like<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:26.820> just<00:02:27.820> kind<00:02:28.060> of
