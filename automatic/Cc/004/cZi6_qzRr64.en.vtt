00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.089 

she's<00:03:01.599> got<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.989> memorize<00:03:02.319> those<00:03:02.500> chords<00:03:02.920> and

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
she's got to memorize those chords and

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.100 
she's got to memorize those chords and
in<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.730> part<00:03:04.060> where<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.420> can<00:03:04.780> keep<00:03:04.810> rhythm

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
in that part where I can keep rhythm

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.050 
in that part where I can keep rhythm
with<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.439> metronome<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:06.159> then<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.819> can<00:03:06.970> see

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
with the metronome and then I can see

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.619 
with the metronome and then I can see
your<00:03:07.180> face<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.540> telephone<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.709> straw<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.159> once

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
can split the atoms per molecule and

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.009 
can split the atoms per molecule and
he's<00:04:04.580> going<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.909> have<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.120> molecule<00:04:05.480> two<00:04:05.870> more

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
one you're just going to hit the D and

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.880 
one you're just going to hit the D and
let<00:06:14.770> it<00:06:14.800> ring<00:06:15.130> and<00:06:15.820> then<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:17.200> intro<00:06:17.650> starts

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
let it ring and then the intro starts

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.120 
let it ring and then the intro starts
playing<00:06:18.370> I<00:06:19.230> prepare<00:06:20.230> to<00:06:20.260> let<00:06:20.530> this<00:06:20.710> ring<00:06:20.980> out

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
playing I prepare to let this ring out

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.390 
playing I prepare to let this ring out
all<00:06:21.400> the<00:06:21.610> way<00:06:21.760> before<00:06:22.330> I<00:06:22.390> start<00:06:22.660> the<00:06:22.780> intro<00:06:23.400> but

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
all the way before I start the intro but

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.550 
all the way before I start the intro but
since<00:06:25.120> you<00:06:25.330> if<00:06:25.600> there's<00:06:25.810> only<00:06:25.930> one<00:06:26.200> guitar

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
since you if there's only one guitar

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.220 
since you if there's only one guitar
then<00:06:27.430> you<00:06:27.520> don't<00:06:27.730> want<00:06:27.880> to<00:06:28.000> just<00:06:28.210> hit<00:06:28.420> once<00:06:28.720> and

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
then you don't want to just hit once and

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.700 
then you don't want to just hit once and
go<00:06:29.380> straight<00:06:29.680> back<00:06:29.950> to<00:06:30.010> the<00:06:30.190> intro<00:06:31.350> but<00:06:32.350> if<00:06:32.470> not

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
go straight back to the intro but if not

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.180

another to college the intro and then

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.280 
another to college the intro and then
once<00:06:38.520> this<00:06:38.700> is<00:06:38.880> done<00:06:38.910> ringing<00:06:39.480> you<00:06:40.110> can<00:06:40.200> go
