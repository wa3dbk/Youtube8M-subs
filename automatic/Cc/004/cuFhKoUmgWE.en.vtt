00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and I ordered these two particular skins

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.019 
and I ordered these two particular skins
for<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:22.260> reason<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.070> silver<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.550> so

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
if you have the silver iPhone I thought

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.429 
if you have the silver iPhone I thought
it<00:00:26.970> would<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:27.269> look<00:00:27.599> almost<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.260> you

um the difference between this one and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the clear one is that the metal slick

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
the clear one is that the metal slick
raps<00:01:25.939> decals<00:01:26.939> are<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> little<00:01:27.720> bit<00:01:27.960> uh<00:01:29.030> stiffer

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
raps decals are a little bit uh stiffer

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.270 
raps decals are a little bit uh stiffer
they're<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.390> necessarily<00:01:30.689> thicker<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
they're not necessarily thicker but it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.520 
they're not necessarily thicker but it
doesn't<00:01:32.579> kind<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> loose<00:01:33.600> plastic

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
doesn't kind of have that loose plastic

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.859 
doesn't kind of have that loose plastic
type<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.950> feel<00:01:35.130> they<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.150> tend<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> leave

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
type of feel they just tend to leave

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.359 
type of feel they just tend to leave
more<00:01:37.200> flat<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> apply<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
more flat so you do have to apply a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.210 
more flat so you do have to apply a
little<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.820> heat<00:01:39.060> when<00:01:39.540> putting<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:39.960> but

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
little more heat when putting it on but

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.710 
little more heat when putting it on but
the<00:01:41.220> other<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.909> nice<00:01:42.060> thing<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> goes<00:01:42.570> on

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the other the nice thing is it goes on

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.600 
the other the nice thing is it goes on
very<00:01:42.750> easily<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.710> almost<00:01:43.829> easier<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.460> get

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
very easily it was almost easier to get

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.280 
very easily it was almost easier to get
the<00:01:44.729> air<00:01:44.850> bowls<00:01:45.060> onto<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.049> wouldn't

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the air bowls onto this but you wouldn't

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.770 
the air bowls onto this but you wouldn't
be<00:01:46.350> able<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.829> them<00:01:47.100> anyway<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.689> was

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
be able to see them anyway and it was

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.749 
be able to see them anyway and it was
very<00:01:49.020> easy<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.470> line<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.520> like

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
very easy to line up and I really like

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.819 
very easy to line up and I really like
you<00:01:51.119> could<00:01:51.270> actually<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.869> Apple<00:01:52.259> logo<00:01:52.409> here

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
you could actually this Apple logo here

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.109 
you could actually this Apple logo here
is<00:01:52.920> cut<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.549> move<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
is cut out so you can move it so you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.480 
is cut out so you can move it so you
could<00:01:54.270> see<00:01:54.450> kind<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.899> polished<00:01:55.530> aluminum

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
could see kind of that polished aluminum

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.550 
could see kind of that polished aluminum
logo<00:01:57.149> through<00:01:57.360> there<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:58.110> left<00:01:58.320> mine

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
logo through there but I just left mine

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.870 
logo through there but I just left mine
on<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.540> aluminum<00:02:00.740> or<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.950> silver<00:02:02.399> skin

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
on this aluminum or the silver skin

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.789 
on this aluminum or the silver skin
actually<00:02:03.149> has<00:02:03.479> some<00:02:03.659> texture<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.590> has<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
actually has some texture so it has a

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.700 
actually has some texture so it has a
green<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.630> smooth<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.290> way<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
green you can it smooth this way and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.949 
green you can it smooth this way and
it's<00:02:07.860> rough<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.459> way<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.929> know

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
it's rough this way so you can you know

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.839 
it's rough this way so you can you know
it's<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.540> pattern

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
it's not just a a pattern

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.690 
it's not just a a pattern
it<00:02:13.450> definitely<00:02:13.959> has<00:02:14.439> texture<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.340> which<00:02:15.430> is

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
it definitely has texture to it which is

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.020 
it definitely has texture to it which is
kind<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:15.939> nice<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.299> feels<00:02:16.629> good<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
kind of nice and feels good the the the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.780 
kind of nice and feels good the the the
cutouts<00:02:19.359> are<00:02:19.569> very<00:02:19.989> close<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.920> mean<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
cutouts are very close I mean the the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.369 
cutouts are very close I mean the the
tolerance<00:02:22.269> on<00:02:22.389> this<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.719> great<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.170> know<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
tolerance on this is great you know the

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.360 
tolerance on this is great you know the
precision<00:02:23.859> is<00:02:23.980> great

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
precision is great

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.009 
precision is great
like<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.790> said<00:02:24.969> I<00:02:24.999> I<00:02:25.299> didn't<00:02:25.719> do<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.870> greatest

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
like I said I I didn't do the greatest

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.390 
like I said I I didn't do the greatest
job<00:02:26.230> here<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.739> corners<00:02:27.099> you<00:02:27.219> can

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
job here on the corners you can

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.800 
job here on the corners you can
certainly<00:02:27.670> clean<00:02:28.060> those<00:02:28.209> up<00:02:28.359> a<00:02:28.480> little<00:02:28.629> bit

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810
