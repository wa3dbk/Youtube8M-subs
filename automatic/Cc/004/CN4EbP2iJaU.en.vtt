file that comes with studio HD we'll

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:26.150 
file that comes with studio HD we'll
take<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.619> listen<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:24.350> as<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:25.980> it

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
take a listen to it as you can see it

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
take a listen to it as you can see it
comes<00:00:26.369> with<00:00:26.580> 8<00:00:26.789> tracks<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.390> audio<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.900> each

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
comes with 8 tracks of audio and each

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.800 
comes with 8 tracks of audio and each
track<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.769> layered<00:00:29.099> up<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.490> 3<00:00:29.849> layers<00:00:30.480> deep

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
track can be layered up to 3 layers deep

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.709 
track can be layered up to 3 layers deep
for<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.140> total<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.410> 24<00:00:31.890> tracks<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.340> playback<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
for a total of 24 tracks of playback you

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.139 
for a total of 24 tracks of playback you
can<00:00:33.870> turn<00:00:34.020> tracks<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.800> off<00:00:35.000> adjust<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
can turn tracks on and off adjust the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.780 
can turn tracks on and off adjust the
levels<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.719> faders<00:00:37.489> plus<00:00:38.489> there's<00:00:38.670> an

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
levels with faders plus there's an

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.310 
levels with faders plus there's an
effects<00:00:39.090> bucket<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.110> add<00:00:40.230> an

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
effects bucket so that you can add an

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.310 
effects bucket so that you can add an
effect<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.800> either<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> tracks<00:00:45.200> let's<00:00:46.200> get

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
effect to either of the tracks let's get

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.710 
effect to either of the tracks let's get
some<00:00:46.530> basic<00:00:46.950> rough<00:00:47.190> mix<00:00:47.489> together<00:00:47.700> here

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
some basic rough mix together here

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.040 
some basic rough mix together here
pull<00:00:50.320> down<00:00:50.470> that<00:00:50.530> lead<00:00:50.860> part<00:00:52.560> here<00:00:53.560> we<00:00:53.650> go

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
pull down that lead part here we go

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.139 
pull down that lead part here we go
so<00:00:55.680> now<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.890> go<00:00:56.129> through<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.460> loop<00:00:56.610> library

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
so now I can go through my loop library

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.700 
so now I can go through my loop library
and<00:00:57.510> see<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:57.719> there's<00:00:57.899> anything<00:00:58.110> else<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> want

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
and see if there's anything else I want

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.319 
and see if there's anything else I want
to<00:00:58.770> add<00:00:58.860> to<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.129> the<00:01:01.670> loops<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.850> auditioned

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
to add to this the loops are auditioned

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.509 
to add to this the loops are auditioned
in<00:01:03.420> real<00:01:03.660> time<00:01:03.930> against<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> arrangement<00:01:05.220> at

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
in real time against the arrangement at

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.590 
in real time against the arrangement at
the<00:01:05.940> master<00:01:06.560> tempo<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> arrangement<00:01:08.600> we

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the master tempo of the arrangement we

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.180 
the master tempo of the arrangement we
use<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> same<00:01:09.900> technology<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
use the same technology like we have in

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.130 
use the same technology like we have in
loop<00:01:11.430> tastic<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.450> will<00:01:12.570> automatically

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
loop tastic it will automatically

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.649 
loop tastic it will automatically
conform<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.920> tempo<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.369> any<00:01:14.520> loop<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
conform the tempo of any loop to the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.499 
conform the tempo of any loop to the
master<00:01:16.110> tempo<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:20.970> let's<00:01:21.149> do<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> little

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
master tempo so now let's do a little

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:31.999 
master tempo so now let's do a little

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
explodes to show me the three regions

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.380 
explodes to show me the three regions
that<00:02:06.899> are<00:02:06.959> layered<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:08.429> select<00:02:08.700> any<00:02:08.849> region

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
that are layered I can select any region

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.720 
that are layered I can select any region
to<00:02:09.479> become<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.750> topmost<00:02:10.289> region<00:02:10.799> really<00:02:11.519> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
to become the topmost region really and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.619 
to become the topmost region really and
then<00:02:12.000> edit<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.480> region<00:02:17.239> welcome<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.360> studio

of<00:02:26.069> those<00:02:26.340> three<00:02:26.670> vocal<00:02:27.060> tics<00:02:27.239> now<00:02:27.870> I'll<00:02:27.989> just

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
of those three vocal tics now I'll just

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.530 
of those three vocal tics now I'll just
drag<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.980> last<00:02:29.250> take<00:02:29.549> up<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> new<00:02:30.239> track

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
drag that last take up to a new track

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.020 
drag that last take up to a new track
and<00:02:30.930> then<00:02:31.530> drag<00:02:31.829> and<00:02:32.010> drop<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.220> delay<00:02:32.670> effect

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and then drag and drop the delay effect

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.819 
and then drag and drop the delay effect
to<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.269> really<00:02:33.569> will<00:02:33.840> change<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.349> parameters

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
to it really will change the parameters

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:40.520 
to it really will change the parameters
on<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.040> delay<00:02:35.430> using<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> XY<00:02:36.510> pad<00:02:39.379> welcome<00:02:40.379> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
on the delay using the XY pad welcome to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.870 
on the delay using the XY pad welcome to
studio<00:02:40.769> HD

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.220 

we<00:02:48.880> can<00:02:49.060> adjust<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.480> loop<00:02:49.630> anywhere<00:02:50.050> within

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
we can adjust the loop anywhere within

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:00.210 
we can adjust the loop anywhere within
the<00:02:50.350> composition<00:02:57.660> great<00:02:58.800> now<00:02:59.800> i<00:02:59.830> can<00:03:00.100> use

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220
