00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
going to be a hangar swirl but I also

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100 
going to be a hangar swirl but I also

the pink and Hawaii and these bar is
going<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.849> be<00:02:12.909> pretty<00:02:13.060> hefty<00:02:13.689> because<00:02:15.000> as<00:02:16.000> I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
going to be pretty hefty because as I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.250 
going to be pretty hefty because as I
said<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.599> my<00:02:16.870> other<00:02:17.469> video<00:02:18.269> this<00:02:19.269> loaf<00:02:19.709> yields

embed<00:02:34.150> design<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.689> was<00:02:34.810> going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.049> do<00:02:35.200> either

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
embed design I was going to do either

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.670 
embed design I was going to do either
but<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:37.180> forgot<00:02:37.719> that<00:02:37.900> I'm<00:02:37.989> soaping<00:02:38.409> with<00:02:38.530> an

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
but I forgot that I'm soaping with an

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.789 
but I forgot that I'm soaping with an
arrow<00:02:38.889> mold<00:02:39.219> and<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.810> had<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.049> change<00:02:41.319> up<00:02:41.620> my

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
arrow mold and so I had to change up my

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.509 
arrow mold and so I had to change up my
embed<00:02:42.579> layout<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:43.150> well<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.620> i<00:02:45.129> think<00:02:45.400> i'm

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
embed layout as well but i think i'm

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.729 
embed layout as well but i think i'm
only<00:02:45.639> going<00:02:45.849> to<00:02:45.909> get<00:02:46.180> about<00:02:46.540> 12<00:02:47.260> bars<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:48.579> and

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
only going to get about 12 bars this and

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.369 
only going to get about 12 bars this and
quite<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.769> few<00:02:50.889> of<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.939> soaps<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.840> i'm<00:02:53.049> doing

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
quite a few of the soaps that i'm doing

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.740 
quite a few of the soaps that i'm doing
right<00:02:53.530> now<00:02:53.970> because<00:02:54.970> I've<00:02:55.150> never<00:02:55.180> done<00:02:55.599> them

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
right now because I've never done them

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.140 
right now because I've never done them
before<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.230> don't<00:02:56.590> want<00:02:56.799> to<00:02:56.889> do<00:02:57.099> large<00:02:57.760> batches

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
before I don't want to do large batches

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.539 
before I don't want to do large batches
and<00:02:58.720> pretty<00:02:59.680> much<00:02:59.739> until<00:03:00.099> I<00:03:00.129> know<00:03:00.250> how<00:03:00.400> they

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
and pretty much until I know how they

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.399 
and pretty much until I know how they
received<00:03:00.970> if<00:03:01.239> they<00:03:01.359> do<00:03:01.419> well<00:03:01.659> this<00:03:01.870> year<00:03:01.930> then

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
received if they do well this year then

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.440 
received if they do well this year then
maybe<00:03:02.590> next<00:03:02.799> year<00:03:02.950> I'll<00:03:03.220> do<00:03:03.370> larger<00:03:03.730> batches

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
maybe next year I'll do larger batches

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.210 
maybe next year I'll do larger batches
so<00:03:04.900> pretty<00:03:05.829> much<00:03:05.950> what<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.400> see<00:03:06.430> this<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:07.510> I

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
so pretty much what you see this is it I

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.210 
so pretty much what you see this is it I
won't<00:03:09.220> be<00:03:09.340> doing<00:03:09.459> any<00:03:09.669> restocks<00:03:10.299> because<00:03:11.220> as

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
won't be doing any restocks because as

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.490 
won't be doing any restocks because as

it's<00:04:27.150> no<00:04:27.330> windows<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:29.340> know<00:04:29.460> no<00:04:29.610> matter

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
it's no windows and you know no matter

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.810 
it's no windows and you know no matter
how<00:04:29.970> many<00:04:30.180> lamps<00:04:30.630> I<00:04:30.900> have<00:04:31.169> is<00:04:31.530> just<00:04:31.820> nothing

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
how many lamps I have is just nothing

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.710 
how many lamps I have is just nothing
beats<00:04:33.300> sunlight<00:04:34.639> so<00:04:35.639> sometimes<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.330> just<00:04:36.539> come

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
beats sunlight so sometimes I just come

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.380 
beats sunlight so sometimes I just come
upstairs<00:04:38.030> this<00:04:39.030> makes<00:04:39.300> me<00:04:39.539> feel<00:04:39.570> better

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.510 

well<00:04:44.020> guess<00:04:44.200> it's<00:04:44.440> not<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.620> whole<00:04:44.860> lot<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.250> show

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
well guess it's not a whole lot to show

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.270 
well guess it's not a whole lot to show
here<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:47.140> hangar<00:04:47.500> swirl<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:48.010> pretty

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
here the hangar swirl is pretty

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.710 
here the hangar swirl is pretty
consistent<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:49.300> route<00:04:53.880> instead<00:04:54.880> thicken<00:04:55.570> up

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
consistent to route instead thicken up

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.810 
consistent to route instead thicken up
just<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.260> little<00:04:56.440> bit<00:04:56.590> which<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:57.310> know<00:04:57.430> working

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
just a little bit which you know working

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.620 
just a little bit which you know working
with<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:58.060> floral<00:04:58.570> that<00:04:59.560> tends<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.040> happen<00:05:00.160> I

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.120 

don't<00:05:04.630> know<00:05:04.750> in<00:05:05.020> hindsight<00:05:05.230> maybe<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:05.980> would

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
don't know in hindsight maybe I would

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.510 
don't know in hindsight maybe I would
have<00:05:06.160> done<00:05:06.370> a<00:05:06.430> different<00:05:06.940> type<00:05:07.270> of<00:05:07.300> swirl

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
have done a different type of swirl

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
have done a different type of swirl
knowing<00:05:09.520> that<00:05:09.550> this<00:05:09.880> was<00:05:10.150> going<00:05:10.450> to

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
knowing that this was going to

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:18.000
