00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.130
 hello all welcome to moral law pp 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.540
 and good this video is going to make a video 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.430
 fast since I do it practically for 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.490
 show you how to install a recovery of 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.439
 advanced and distinct recovery to the recovery 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.660
 of what the samsung has since 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.340
 some see it and you told me that 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.640
 you have problems to do the root of 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.030
 version 4.3 since we get the option 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.670
 of being able to install install files 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.220
 from the internal memory from our 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.790
 recovery therefore I will tell you how 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.790
 install the recovery using bic 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.860
 good as you can see I do not have the 4.3 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.800
 but that works for 4.3 and then that 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.400
 you have to do first before anything 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.360
 before 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.930
 before 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.930
 start the mobile and that you're going to adjust 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 you go to phone information and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.360
 you must go to the compilation number and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.729
 Press several times until it comes out 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.350
 that now you have the options of 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 developer once you have the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.280
 developer options you go back 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.310
 and will put kiko options 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.299
 developer you give him 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.310
 and you have to activate them and activate the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.039
 debug mode installed since 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.640
 I was doing tests so you could 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.940
 do 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.910
 fashion by law 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.350
 once we do that simply 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.610
 we would have to connect the mobile to 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.290
 phone but first of all I'm going to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.330
 teach that I have a different rom to 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.500
 the one of these yes that is different from the one of 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.110
 This is because I already have the phone on 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.490
 flashed phone and things like that but I'm going 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.960
 to show you the rom that I have now and the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.730
 rom that for you to see that it has 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.850
 changed the rom in window so that 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.750
 may know that this works so set me 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.750
 I go to the recovery mode 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.049
 I do not think it 's saying I mean the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.720
 recovery that what we're going to change the 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.399
 recovery 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.380
 and I'm going to show that I have installed 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:16.920
 right now that I have installed is 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:21.710
 this one the recovery 6.04 6.0 points 4.4 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.670
 it's worth from here we're going to 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.670
 restart the phone again 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.970
 and I'll tell you what it takes 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.190
 I'm having a problem because I have not 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.510
 could not let me install the singer and 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.610
 therefore I'm going to have to teach it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.710
 with the camera but good 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.350
 we warn that you need to have the one 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.140
 installed and for you to recognize the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.730
 phone drivers at the time of 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.760
 activate the one of doing the phrasing by odÃ­n 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.470
 that's the first thing also that you already know 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.300
 what 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.490
 it does not have to give problem but in 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.680
 some time I could give it that is already 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.000
 speaking that we have already spoken many 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.280
 times so do this under your 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.960
 own responsibility so nothing 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.330
 first thing we have to do is put 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.370
 in mobile mode in download mode for 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.290
 we turn off the phone 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.420
 I'm going to do it to the manual form for 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.680
 that you also for what you do not 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.260
 you know 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.510
 you understand how it is done and well a 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.080
 Once off we must press volume 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.360
 down 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.360
 home button and power 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.159
 as you see tells us volume tells us that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.930
 to continue and we give you with the volume 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.380
 above 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.930
 and we already have it in download mode 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.340
 it's worth once we have the blog mode 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.480
 what we have to do in the 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.820
 following from here I will move 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.240
 the camera I would like to see it but there is no 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.240
 another way 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.830
 OK 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.970
 here we can see the pc 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.970
 and what we are going to do 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.690
 and I do not see either 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.540
 what we have to do is download 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.730
 an application that is called and that I'm going 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.530
 to leave a file in an application that 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.930
 I will leave you in the description that is 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.230
 the plis touch this is a recovery for 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.579
 the galaxy and 9 and 300 is worth to him and 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.650
 9 and I'm sorry to have it clear 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.569
 once we download it it occupies very 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.600
 little also we unload in the three 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:27.070
 points 3.3 points 0 9 just fatal 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.820
 we open the odin 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.960
 and what we have to do is give ap 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.389
 all this we leave as 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.630
 and we must select the file that I have 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:42.050
 mentioned before the film puig what 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.759
 we selected here it will get an 80 now 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.139
 what we have to do we must catch and 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:50.400
 plug in our mobile 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:54.060
 by one you see here we have the quality 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.800
 I do not like the video but at least 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.820
 that solves the problem you can have 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.090
 our mobile 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.990
 in fact we are going and as you can see 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.630
 come out this 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.760
 with 5 or that has recognized the 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.850
 mobile once this is done simply 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.290
 we have to give it to be I'm going to give it 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.650
 and I hope to start the recovery well 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.110
 it's worth nothing so let's go there 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.389
 this usually takes very little since it is a 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.949
 recovery installation once it is 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.650
 install the recovery the mobile is 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.600
 will restart which odin we are going to 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.820
 and we leave back to the mobile I 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.330
 to put it as it was before 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.330
 ah 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.390
 Here you can see that the mobile phone does not 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.870
 nothing has happened everything is perfect 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.870
 is restarting 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.289
 already install it the other arc and so 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.089
 no problem 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:54.590
 and the mobile has not had any problem 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:57.920
 has been restarted 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:01.120
 once done this we take and as I say 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.120
 we can remove the cable 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.629
 and we are going to pay it to see if it has 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.310
 correctly installed the record for 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:10.530
 that I'm going to turn it off directly I'm going to 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.639
 enter how you should enter 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.409
 you 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.889
 this as I say I'm doing it for 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:20.770
 those who want to install a recovery 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:23.310
 different from the stock salt are recovery 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.310
 advanced 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:28.279
 the factory version of samsung 4.3 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.409
 I think it's also good for reflections 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:33.589
 I am using for example the 4.4 with 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.389
 all of ethics that is that apparently 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:41.019
 must be worth to enter mode 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.019
 recovery volume up home power 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.620
 let's go and hope 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.370
 and as you can see we have already installed 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.800
 another recovery where it is already if it gives us 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.410
 the options that many of 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.520
 you are interested in installing 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:01.350
 applications are here my instance 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.990
 I saw from there you can install things 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.310
 from the internal memory of the mobile as well 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.590
 that nothing will be the tutorial 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.990
 more than anything this video I have done for 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.450
 in answers to a few that 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.460
 have tried to do the Russian tutorial 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.040
 for the official 4.3 that I had I have 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.440
 made a video and you will not get power 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.320
 install the rut file because 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.610
 your recovery was that of this, so 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.800
 you already know how to install the recovery 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.240
 advanced and nothing more to say do this 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.890
 under your own responsibility and 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.010
 see you in the next video up 

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.010
 then
