these two guys what they do is they help
extend<00:02:42.329> a<00:02:42.420> cable<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.500> don't<00:02:43.739> have<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> long

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
extend a cable if you don't have a long

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.460 
extend a cable if you don't have a long
enough<00:02:44.280> cable<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.150> definitely<00:02:45.470> extend

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
enough cable you can definitely extend

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.410 
enough cable you can definitely extend
it<00:02:46.590> or<00:02:46.739> elongated<00:02:47.430> by<00:02:47.610> getting<00:02:48.060> one<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.239> these

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
it or elongated by getting one of these

it or elongated by getting one of these
Ethernet<00:02:49.290> couplers<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.489> know<00:02:50.670> just

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
Ethernet couplers and you know just

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.759 
Ethernet couplers and you know just
based<00:02:51.150> off<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.480> face<00:02:51.690> right<00:02:51.930> here<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.620> you

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
based off the face right here that you

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.920 
based off the face right here that you
got<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.070> right<00:02:53.220> cable<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.750> take

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
got the right cable and so you can take

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.050 
got the right cable and so you can take
one<00:02:55.079> of<00:02:55.110> these<00:02:55.260> shorter<00:02:55.680> guys<00:02:55.860> here<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
one of these shorter guys here this is a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.979 
one of these shorter guys here this is a
long<00:02:57.329> one<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.060> goes<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.239> one<00:03:00.510> end<00:03:00.750> you

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
long one and so it goes on one end you

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.110 
long one and so it goes on one end you
can<00:03:01.260> take<00:03:01.440> one<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.680> these<00:03:01.829> Swart<00:03:02.310> ethernet

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
can take one of these Swart ethernet

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.560 
can take one of these Swart ethernet
cables<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.750> then<00:03:04.049> stick<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
cables and then stick it in and

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
cables and then stick it in and
information<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.660> still<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.049> same<00:03:07.320> it's

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
information is still the same it's

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.770 
information is still the same it's
really<00:03:08.070> intact<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.030> also<00:03:09.180> get<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.450> longer

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
really intact but you also get a longer

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.150 
really intact but you also get a longer
cable<00:03:10.079> without<00:03:10.530> having<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.010> buy<00:03:11.130> another

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
cable without having to buy another

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.199 
cable without having to buy another
cable<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:13.040> think<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:14.130> go<00:03:14.280> for<00:03:14.489> about<00:03:14.519> 5<00:03:14.970> bucks

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
cable I think they go for about 5 bucks

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.090 
cable I think they go for about 5 bucks
you<00:03:15.720> can<00:03:15.870> find<00:03:16.079> on<00:03:16.170> Matt<00:03:16.320> most<00:03:16.500> stores<00:03:16.769> so

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
you can find on Matt most stores so

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.180 
you can find on Matt most stores so
definitely<00:03:17.880> worth<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.120> investment

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
definitely worth the investment

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.920 
definitely worth the investment
another<00:03:21.000> thing<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.480> might<00:03:21.600> think<00:03:21.660> about

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
another thing that you might think about

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.949 
another thing that you might think about
is<00:03:22.380> if<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.709> want<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.980> do<00:03:23.070> multiple<00:03:23.280> X<00:03:23.730> boxes<00:03:24.299> if

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
is if you want to do multiple X boxes if

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.330 
is if you want to do multiple X boxes if
you're<00:03:25.170> going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.380> do<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> LAN<00:03:25.709> party<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.160> want

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
you're going to do a LAN party you want

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.230 
you're going to do a LAN party you want
to<00:03:26.430> invest<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.850> one

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240

these<00:03:27.330> guys<00:03:27.570> here<00:03:28.020> this<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.770> called<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:30.920> network

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
these guys here this is called a network

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.510 
these guys here this is called a network
switch<00:03:32.370> or<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> hub<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:34.890> these<00:03:35.040> hubs<00:03:35.280> they

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
switch or a hub and in these hubs they

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.190 
switch or a hub and in these hubs they
come<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.850> different<00:03:35.940> ports<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.810> always

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
come in different ports so you always

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.930 
come in different ports so you always
have<00:03:37.380> one<00:03:37.590> that's<00:03:37.770> called<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.190> uplink<00:03:38.670> and

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
have one that's called the uplink and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.270 
have one that's called the uplink and
the<00:03:39.480> uplink<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.050> basically<00:03:40.440> your<00:03:40.680> master

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
the uplink is basically your master

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.100 
the uplink is basically your master
console<00:03:42.180> where<00:03:42.480> you're<00:03:42.600> taking<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
console where you're taking the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.460 
console where you're taking the
information<00:03:43.620> from<00:03:43.740> so<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> game<00:03:44.850> like<00:03:45.060> halo

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
information from so in a game like halo

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.440 
information from so in a game like halo
you're<00:03:46.470> going<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.770> one<00:03:47.150> console<00:03:48.150> and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
you're going to have one console and

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.720 
you're going to have one console and
that's<00:03:49.140> going<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.380> be<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> uplink<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.340> each

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
that's going to be the uplink and each

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.310 
that's going to be the uplink and each
additional<00:03:50.910> console<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:51.750> add<00:03:51.990> to<00:03:52.230> it

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
additional console that you add to it

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.210 
additional console that you add to it
it's<00:03:52.860> going<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.100> be<00:03:53.960> sharing<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.050> information

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
it's going to be sharing the information

it's going to be sharing the information
from<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.490> main<00:03:56.880> console<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:58.110> these<00:03:59.040> are

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
from the main console so these are

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.430 
from the main console so these are
definitely<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.880> good<00:04:00.540> investment<00:04:00.960> also<00:04:01.350> if

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
the rj45 Ethernet cables and one of the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.810 
the rj45 Ethernet cables and one of the
things<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.620> forgot<00:04:10.740> to<00:04:11.010> mention<00:04:11.160> is<00:04:11.490> for<00:04:11.670> the

things I forgot to mention is for the
uplink<00:04:12.270> it's<00:04:12.810> going<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.110> require<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.470> different

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
uplink it's going to require a different

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.800 
uplink it's going to require a different
type<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.190> cable<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:14.940> not<00:04:15.090> an<00:04:15.240> Ethernet<00:04:15.630> cable

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
type of cable it's not an Ethernet cable

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.039 
type of cable it's not an Ethernet cable
it's<00:04:16.530> called<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:17.280> patch<00:04:17.970> cable<00:04:18.510> or<00:04:18.720> also<00:04:18.870> a

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
it's called a patch cable or also a

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.940 
it's called a patch cable or also a
crossover<00:04:19.590> cable<00:04:20.450> so<00:04:21.450> very<00:04:22.140> important<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:22.860> you

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
crossover cable so very important so you

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.220 
crossover cable so very important so you
need<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.520> have<00:04:23.700> one<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.000> these<00:04:24.090> guys<00:04:24.150> here<00:04:24.750> this

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.410 
need to have one of these guys here this
is<00:04:25.410> what<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:25.560> call<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.890> crossover<00:04:26.550> cable<00:04:27.120> or

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
is what you call a crossover cable or

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.010 
is what you call a crossover cable or
patch<00:04:27.690> cable<00:04:28.200> it's<00:04:28.640> definitely<00:04:29.640> different<00:04:30.020> so

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
patch cable it's definitely different so
