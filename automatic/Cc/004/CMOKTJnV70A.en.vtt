installation process is very easy you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
installation process is very easy you
just<00:01:27.960> would<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.979> apply<00:01:29.759> some<00:01:30.060> pressure

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
just would have to apply some pressure

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.030 
just would have to apply some pressure
on<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.049> four<00:01:31.320> angles<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> case<00:01:33.770> case<00:01:34.770> is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
on the four angles of the case case is

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.480 
on the four angles of the case case is
made<00:01:35.250> from<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:36.000> flux<00:01:36.570> letter<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.250> non
