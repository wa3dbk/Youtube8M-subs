00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello to all and hello to all these 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.190
 peaks and hack an iphone that it is 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.020
 ends up with a pretty show 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.780
 special today since we will do 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.759
 a pc test we have a pretty little 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.380
 machine here which is a pc faille euros 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 augmented by materiel.net 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.850
 if you know the site and we are going 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.279
 try to see how they work 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.210
 with current productions yes everything 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 in fact then must still specify 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.109
 that it's an input configuration 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.439
 range is a pc gamer but input 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.740
 of range 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.179
 yes so proposed to 749 euros so if 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.980
 it is the budget you have eh 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.270
 well we will try to answer the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
 next question is what are you going 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.170
 so be able to turn the last ones 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.370
 big games of the moment on this machine the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.140
 suspenseful sail 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.460
 but first of all to see all 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.260
 extracts were made extracts on 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.059
 three games but we'll show you that to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.980
 the end we will first show you the pc 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.059
 starting with its connectivity is there 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.289
 we have a vision from above yes a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.629
 very rich connectivity especially in 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.770
 usb port matter of 2.0 of 3.0 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.840
 all the audio connectivity that you 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.489
 must micro-headset blain and back 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.620
 we find again a great 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.579
 richness in usb port and then 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.260
 well all the video connectivity 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.180
 needed to remake your little ones 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.060
 connections there are still 3.0 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.500
 behind this ag usb port I leave 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.479
 speak so now we'll see 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.950
 inside the pc you see all the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 small rooms inside just yes 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.890
 and all that this pca in his 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.810
 entrails 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.509
 so we opened it we opened it and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.610
 we have to look at it then we have at the base 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.530
 a gigabyte boxing motherboard this is a 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.479
 very reputed brand in the field 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.070
 so there would I know we for 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.759
 to say here is where there will be absolutely 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.130
 no problem 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.689
 yeah then on the other hand we're gonna go 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.650
 talk about the processor because it's a 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.720
 little bit what will he fish in the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.740
 notebook configuration on an i tell core 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.509
 i3 2120 and the problem is that it's 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.659
 a good value for money is a 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.680
 processor that was really in my 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.689
 report that sincerely begs you but 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.560
 in a config gamer 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.420
 it may be a bit of a task 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.420
 will try that particular wrinkles and 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.340
 some other components it's a 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.680
 little bit worry it's a pity or 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 acquired is not put a big one here 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.500
 what is this and especially the memory 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.960
 so in terms of memory we are on 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.829
 two bars of 2 gigabytes of marc 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.520
 skill and those two pc10600 and that's 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.649
 true that maybe it's a little bit 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.030
 light and that's why it's a small 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.220
 budget it's also because it's the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.530
 maximum that can tolerate the famous 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.290
 electra processor and this inevitably 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.640
 so with that then revenge at the level 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.140
 of the graphics card then there if we are 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.660
 on something a lot more 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.050
 comfortable on on this configuration 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.209
 since it is a nvidia gtx 570 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.090
 so in terms of performance we are 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.910
 above a gtx 470 but below 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.860
 of a gtx 480 here we will see everything to 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.569
 time course that that it that 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.550
 that it allows in terms of fluidity 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.050
 in games but it's a good map 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.400
 graph there are no worries for the 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.140
 large entry-level configuration 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.250
 the graphic actor is yes because 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.239
 we call back good we talk anyway 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.090
 processor etc 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.200
 so remember it's for a pc 750 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.459
 euros exactly 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.230
 but here and then I'll show you 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.260
 simply the hard drive of a field 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.430
 it was for wii for information 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.550
 hard drive that can we are 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.379
 today in any case we saw 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.680
 precisely what she had in the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.450
 belly 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.510
 and now we'll see the result 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.010
 on the screen we will start with 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.780
 diablo iii here are three successive games 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.980
 and we start with the one who is the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.830
 less greedy because who says weird 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.000
 of ten attempts to offer games 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.640
 turning its maximum of configurations 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.290
 possible then diablo iii so turn 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.560
 very very much of course this configuration 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.819
 we are on 60 images seconds 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.000
 goes down a little bit at times in the 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.319
 just fighting a little precision you 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.180
 maybe see the screen sometimes 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.830
 few nights cros cut micro 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.420
 micro latency loading in fact that's 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.129
 not at all due to the configuration but 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.330
 to the server the day I'm logged in 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.040
 of course it's an online game 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.010
 exactly but you are really going 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.569
 power 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.590
 play diablo iii in excellent 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.939
 conditions two or three that will come out 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.379
 by the way in reaching patiently 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.760
 to see a few days and you 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.680
 really this configuration allows for 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.099
 rotate it in very good 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.569
 terms 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.220
 so it's interesting to see that but 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.319
 we will also be chained with something 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.390
 already a little greedy is qui 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.030
 he will go to widou thiengoly 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.799
 known for to solicit anyway 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.659
 not bad machines to be greedy in 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.299
 terms of resources and one realizes 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.390
 like my faith the game while we have 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:11.400
 regulated I specify in maximum detail to 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.400
 the exception km2 loubert sampling which is 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.870
 we removed his but these fall 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.549
 as you can see from 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.769
 see by which one has a game that is 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.600
 fluid that turns between 38 and 40 images 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.970
 per second 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.740
 we'll be there soon in this video on board 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.440
 of a fight and you will see that the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.360
 framerate it stays fluid that's the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.680
 will brake very often there is no 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.180
 worry we can decently at the witcher 2 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.470
 the pretty one there really we see that 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.820
 take advantage yes but if they deny 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.530
 soffits a fucker of m 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.949
 yes some little worries camera there 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.550
 to hit the beast it's the same 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.830
 not the pcc me it's when he was 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.599
 tired I'm doing it to you this is so 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 really band on the witcher 2 well yes 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.669
 you can on this configuration 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.590
 entry level you can enjoy 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.289
 from the witcher 2 there is no concern too 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.030
 also here on it too and we're going 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.710
 end up against the bulk of the heavy 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.770
 very heavy is still 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.090
 battlefield 3 and battlefield 3 that takes 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.570
 a little bit of crysis is a 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.500
 little bit the benchmark game play itself 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.599
 and although we realize that 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.470
 battlefield 3 turns on on a 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.120
 very calm configuration and their 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.650
 be careful I will clarify the 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.030
 things 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.110
 we first played in ultra it was not 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.160
 possible I tell you right away a 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.990
 ultra was sure of the near match 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.630
 second it was not playable so we have 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.390
 has gone down a notch by extending it high 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.860
 it's this relatively fluid then we 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.390
 down to 25 frames per second at 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.730
 stronger the action a pretty action 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.570
 explosive but we dream from time to time 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.620
 here we are 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.060
 but the flute and still remains 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.740
 ok there are no worries so we 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.750
 can play anyway at battlefield 3 and 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.070
 this configuration even if it's 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.420
 maybe not in the conditions of 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.520
 games we saw previously 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.430
 yeah that's okay bah plays I think 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.390
 we've seen pretty much everything on this pc in 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.190
 you see what can do 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.050
 precisely an entry-level pc like 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.270
 you said 750 euros and 6 stops game 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.870
 current in any case now for 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.120
 the future 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.740
 does it work too it's a 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.970
 pc who is so who can turn 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.070
 all games released recently released 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.960
 good some go down some 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.450
 graphical options on the other hand bet on 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.230
 the future at the level of such a pc is 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.960
 when even you do like it 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.070
 a pc let's say it will not turn 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.240
 details thoroughly all the games of the three 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.230
 or next four years you 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.910
 will be able to rotate and maybe 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.260
 the last big games you 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.290
 had up to the desire to play here 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.570
 but it will not be a pc on which 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.680
 we can bet for it depends on any 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.000
 way it's the principle is in confidence 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.800
 entry level this is what kind of 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.290
 gamer you are of course we know very well 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.970
