00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.799
 binner 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.050
 the world of mixology on the internet a lot 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.630
 because one has a lot of contact with all kinds of people 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.130
 and most of all one 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.280
 good will provide what you will give them as a moment of satisfaction 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 like it's something that 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 the filling is not enough 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.420
 last experience as a bartender was going to work on a cruise in the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.840
 future after rising almería to flee 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.910
 it was an experience that 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.910
 what took him forward in a thousand ways 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.140
 and culturally held that the event teach people now true 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.940
 to prepare cocktails 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.880
 no way in the way that they do internationally with standards of 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.880
 quality five-star establishments 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.080
 in this case 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 diallo does not lead to higher levels since last night 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.980
 as a worthy service is not like a profession 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.859
 the culture of a country of cocktails 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.699
 was this one can reflect and differently 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.699
 although I think that I should wait to see how the 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.619
 country's culture in the liquors that are produced 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:25.159
 in this country 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.649
 and this case for example if we talk about vodka 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:32.389
 We believe that we will be receiving all the Baltic countries as you like. 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.149
 scandinavian poland accurate 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:39.179
 what we talk about the room we can talk about Caribbean countries like haiti 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:41.949
 puerto rico cuba 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.179
 if we talk about whiskey we could refer to countries like 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.379
 scotland and ireland 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.230
 if we talk about the esime plowing tone referred england-hollanda alba that are 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.999

 the triplet advances 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.459
 as the juice of cranberry or cranberry juice advances 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:39.959
 also 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.069
 you add a 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.079

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.439
 a freezer 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.469
 to be able to keep the cut in the neck 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.289

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.629

 fazio but not 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.740
