00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.430
 part of pulling back 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:27.050
 something like this happened a little bit 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:33.829
 maimed shorter in order to 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:35.079
 pull back the punch chains snagged on 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:41.410
 front beam 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:51.740
 I hope I will not tear off behind 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:59.450
 frog hooked on a very good thing boss 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:04.570
 now it's not stretched like a string in 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:09.159
 eventually began to pull the hill on the roofs 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.840
 gone it is not against all the roof is flat 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:16.790
 the door began to close me 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.770
 delighted of course not so little 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.870
 glue it could be somewhere a lock 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:30.100
 because here in principle everything 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:33.200
 okay we have such a gap 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.979
 here about dress even already dragged 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.360
 it turns out so here too the gap 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.820
 increased top decreased due to the fact that 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.940
 kenzo bottom angle at least i'm so 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.990
 I think in short this one is completely 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.990
 seam here this bumps from the inside I jumped 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.119
 while on the dirty shot while tapping 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.840
 welding seam as we see here i 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.740
 ripped 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.900
 This, too, the little things as my grandfather said 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.530
 iron is plasticine 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:12.890
 and you can do anything with it 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:16.000
 you want a sculpture you want it what he 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.990
 crashed into a stump as this woman said 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.290
 that is, the owner of the car former 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:27.110
 hard to believe because you 're here 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:33.110
 see traces of 7 paint they use 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:36.050
 went here on a wing are not available here 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.500
 far from a stump either this fennec was 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.470
 decorated and everywhere because everywhere is there 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.880
 you blue paint that all someone in it 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:53.120
 slammed okay at least with us 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:57.320
 began to close the way the fact that two 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.209
 car damn yes ride think on 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.880
 forward okay it will be tomorrow 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.180
 look hope I have nothing to do with 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.450
 closing the tailgate as it were 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.489
 the rest of his as they were and remained 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.950
 people did not burst but from the inside it 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:18.459
 looks like here i say here 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:22.420
 roughing this seam crease 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:27.730
 you can tell by shig almost gone cloud 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.730
 spider we have newspapers 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.790
 so here at the box office dry 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.410
 if time will also come garage 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.340
 just with the stove and will do 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.480
 little by little 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:51.950
 maybe I'll start cutting the floor sooner. 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:54.459

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.459
