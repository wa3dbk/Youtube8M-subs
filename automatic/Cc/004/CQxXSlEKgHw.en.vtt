your HP printer from recognizing the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.080 
your HP printer from recognizing the
cartridges<00:00:22.100> now<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.160> first<00:00:23.460> thing<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
cartridges now the first thing to do is

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.820 
cartridges now the first thing to do is
check<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.480> both<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> color<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.680> black

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.149 
way to work this out with these HP
printers<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.350> take<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> quick<00:01:16.770> look<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.040> the

cartridge out of your printer give it a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
or ink dirt anything on the contacts and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.130 
or ink dirt anything on the contacts and
if<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.210> can't<00:02:37.390> see<00:02:37.630> anything<00:02:37.810> it's

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
if you can't see anything it's

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.080 
if you can't see anything it's
worthwhile<00:02:38.470> giving<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.250> quick<00:02:39.310> wipe<00:02:39.700> anyway

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
worthwhile giving it a quick wipe anyway

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.880 
worthwhile giving it a quick wipe anyway
just<00:02:40.600> in<00:02:40.780> case<00:02:40.930> there's<00:02:41.140> oils<00:02:41.470> or<00:02:41.620> something

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
just in case there's oils or something

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.870 
just in case there's oils or something
that's<00:02:42.010> not<00:02:42.220> going<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.370> be<00:02:42.460> necessarily

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
that's not going to be necessarily

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.090 
that's not going to be necessarily
visible<00:02:43.150> on<00:02:43.510> there<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.350> I'd<00:02:44.500> recommend<00:02:44.650> just

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
visible on there so I'd recommend just

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.280 
visible on there so I'd recommend just
giving<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.400> quick<00:02:45.520> wipe<00:02:45.760> down<00:02:45.790> with<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.480> piece<00:02:47.110> of

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
tissue and with that done just reinstall

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.820 
tissue and with that done just reinstall
it<00:02:54.340> into<00:02:54.520> your<00:02:54.670> printer<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.500> error

remove the cartridges from the printer

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.210 
remove the cartridges from the printer

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.780 
and you should see the contacts kind of
match<00:03:18.370> up<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:20.220> now<00:03:21.220> what<00:03:21.340> we're<00:03:21.460> going<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.610> do

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
match up that now what we're going to do

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.420 
match up that now what we're going to do
is<00:03:22.030> just<00:03:22.330> give<00:03:22.480> those<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.720> wipe<00:03:23.290> down<00:03:23.430> again

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
using a non fibrous tissue now we've

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.250 
using a non fibrous tissue now we've
very<00:03:28.090> careful<00:03:28.390> when<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.570> wipe<00:03:28.720> these<00:03:28.930> because
