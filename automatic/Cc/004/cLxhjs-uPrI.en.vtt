00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:04.480
 Hi, I'm also a pariah, show you 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.200
 this product he wanted ecc complaints to 540 perishables 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.609
 is very similar to a mouse keyboard demonstrated to do 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.869
 very little a couple of weeks ago 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.960
 remains the previous version of this the mint 540 ref 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.710
 to be exact 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.029
 it is clear that we have here the most notable difference 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.780
 is that one is silver colored merck color pilots 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.189
 but naturally 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.859
 certain differences 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.899
 percent on the surface that as we said or how we have colored 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.560
 black 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.330
 is to maintain and has a touch similar to the lawyer they normally call 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.340
 ski surface 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.780
 a treatment that they give to plastic 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.360
 to leave that aspect 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.030
 good as many of several differences that keyboard with respect to the other the first 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.380
 and more remarkable is 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.510
 the multi touch pad the sun toasted that will be smaller than that of the 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.660
 previous version 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.770
 but what has been said has 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.530
 functions 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.520
 from 22 to say that it works with several of the heads of companies so that 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.380
 use chairs 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.630
 on the one hand the obstacle that is not done on one side 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.730
 yes what you do cabbage two of two 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.530
 ballots with 2 of 2 furniture the hand and months ago color 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.799
 it's quite comfortable moody's also other functions like for example that 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.520
 for a priísta abel the right button of the mouse 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.870
 not only after put there but many have been many cons of the 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.470
 filis opens 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.750
 the context menu is opened is simply by clicking with the three zeros 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.910
 at the same time at the same time 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.079
 good are some of the functions that ted has on the other hand Peruvian 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.670
 founded makes a most remarkable difference 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.900
 can be 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.289
 tel the receiver is aspe kenya 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.570
 than the other 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.479
 and that also the best reception we were talking about mud protest 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.980
 I had 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.530
 quite a pretty powerful range 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.080
 in this case we are talking about the double but almost with this one with this 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.719
 of course we can reach 15 or 20 meters away bonn quite easily 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.329
 therefore good and in the other we highlighted this aspect 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.329
 good if you really need something that already long distance 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.880
 that your keyboard in every way 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:23.109
 we are a look at the top right where we see three are you 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.259
 ledesma has left 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:29.189
 l battery i the good connection leader yes 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:30.840
 he put as 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.869
 11 a key and the computer receives it would be extend excellent 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:39.150
 if we are short of batteries the celestial we visit them matching 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
 would be lost in the center 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.139
 by him 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.929
 below the keyboard we can see door 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.209
 we can see where bad condition 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.679
 let's do it but without a vote from the past if we have 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:56.899
 if we have the this troubadour mole we push this button 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.350
 in less than 1 5 seconds we have to press this park 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.350
 are linked so they are on the same radio channel 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.719
 on the other hand in this case old previous regime efe 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.829
 since ccoo we did not have here we have a bull below that is why 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.200
 r does not light accidentally because we press human 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.019
 a key that we have given part of these preparations 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.409
 with a picasso we process more 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.409
 small items to raise slightly 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.799
 current ap 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.949
 over here we can see 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:33.259
 telmo where I return with forgiveness the baby 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.359
 that we are sending a click stark 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.559
 of a decade 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.769
 good as times one is not a sin of troops of the previous government 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.889
 we can highlight what they said they have 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.089
 that has better reception of the other have greater reach 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.429
 Regarding the keyboard we can see that the keys are placed more shape 

00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:54.019
 Similary 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.650
 boxes that portfolio despite everything did not have good air and also the 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.369
 kind of very similar things are 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:04.909
 they are the same keys they are of class in type of slim but of course enough 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.029
 long as appeared a usual keyboard of the winners scored 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.729
 figures collected is not the chemical keyboard coming from a laptop 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.079
 i regarding other issues for good the 2 4 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.069
 same has improved a little bit your comfort thanks to that see if you 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.599
 will value the fear on the right 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.669
 were necessary actions with which usually here all surface of 2 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.599
 hours these fans 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.349
 and to be honest with the two decisive points for client funds 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.139
 move them 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.509
 or not the left button and with rights' a little smaller 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.270
 but they are much more suitable 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.759
 stood out again 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.860
 for the third time accusing him of the cafesg we have checked in the store 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.800
 as through walls 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.550
 from where they work perfectly with the present in place 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:57.909
 It was difficult to say what 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:59.949
 he said that the 20 meters 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:00.990
 achieves 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.300
 easily 15 meters with total security 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.309
 so anyone in any condition says meters 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.849
 it works perfectly 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.400
 and good the receiver 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.150
 what is said is a little bit smaller than the other apart by Syrian problems for 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.499
 introduce them in the grant against another cable or whatever 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:21.530
 good comes with a little village labrador to be able 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.639
 install it 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:23.800
 comfortably 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.479
 Obviously it comes with many with your hand manual distinctions 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:28.279
 they explain 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.989
 Sixt explain all the functions of Herbert seems to have 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.050
 also a pair of batteries to be able to work with everything as soon as in 4 a 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.949
 Who 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.120
 down like crazy or comfortable cbs keyboard 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.590
 recommend last cases for both best servers in this city for 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.599
 a media center to steal 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.639
 three perfect to eat as well as a decision after that too 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.349
 fully compatible with the powers to be able to chat in this field too 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.619
 it works little 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.009
 with many other devices for vázquez 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:04.449
 is an accident keyboard and standaard ii the official summoned the pipe 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:05.839
 compatible device 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:08.490
 but he has wanted a taboo subject 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.830
 there was a very nice together to keep going 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.680
 dn in any operating system is not is not dependent so far 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.110
 cooperative none 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.550
 of its functions 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.289
 i 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.430
 these tod @ s 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.890
 in this case in this way of public use more than the previous examination of 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.889
 by him especially for the theme two fa 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.119
 to the right 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.749
 the other every now and then deprives the finger to the right 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.659
 and state assets for errors is the point that I liked the most according to another 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:43.309
 detail that is also appreciated this keyboard well appeared 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:44.860
 autonomy of the other 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.449
 visser amen of minor may wish 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:53.270
 but optimistic two stacks instead of d4 comments the quoted to four stacks 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.270
 triple ay this one has excused so only eight appointments are 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.030
 two rows of triple type 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:06.189
 the masts that the company is him from the keyboard 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.720
 I'm good at what they say last they last long enough the truth is that 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.020
 and if not to abuse the 2 palaces ready especially keyboard the batteries culture 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.820
 months 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.700
 it's mourning and it uses minutes when burned what else it can do up 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.969
 the proposed batteries 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:24.369
 eat with a combined use it is clear that there is that I can 

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:28.289
 little a week can be if you're using it continuously but for a 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:30.199
 normal use for example to send at home 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.569
 tower coah - the storm that can last 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:35.569
 even months he the ranks of the rival 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:41.360
 i that's all i want to thank harrison and the in her test phase the 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.779
 assignment of this product 

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:44.070
 i 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.520
 Well I hope that smoothed soon we will show you 

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:49.699
 not everyday
