00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
well um I think that's all of the level

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.389 
well um I think that's all of the level
ones<00:01:49.290> actually<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.710> don't<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.070> many

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
ones actually I don't have that many

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.940 
ones actually I don't have that many
level<00:01:50.790> 1<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.270> we'll<00:01:51.450> go<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.020> level<00:01:52.560> twos

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
level 1 so we'll go on to level twos

really complicated to set up a game and
play<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.030> against<00:02:57.300> someone<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.870> lot<00:02:58.110> easier

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
play it against someone a lot easier

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.460 
play it against someone a lot easier
just<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.709> play<00:02:58.950> yugioh<00:02:59.700> duel<00:03:00.330> monsters<00:03:00.780> we

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
just to play yugioh duel monsters we

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.260 
just to play yugioh duel monsters we
have<00:03:01.650> ansatsu<00:03:02.340> i<00:03:02.760> think<00:03:03.000> that's<00:03:03.180> how<00:03:03.239> you

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
have ansatsu i think that's how you

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.770 
have ansatsu i think that's how you
pronounce<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:04.550> yeah<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.970> get<00:03:06.090> one<00:03:06.360> monster

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
pronounce it yeah you get one monster

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.680 
pronounce it yeah you get one monster
per<00:03:06.959> pack<00:03:07.200> because<00:03:08.180> getting<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.300> few<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.570> these

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
per pack because getting a few of these

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.820 
per pack because getting a few of these
I<00:03:09.750> think<00:03:10.020> would<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.230> been<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.380> little<00:03:10.560> much

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
I think would have been a little much

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.160 
I think would have been a little much
for<00:03:10.860> each<00:03:11.310> pack<00:03:11.640> we<00:03:12.060> have<00:03:12.180> an<00:03:12.360> echo<00:03:12.540> gal<00:03:12.840> number

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
for each pack we have an echo gal number

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.160 
for each pack we have an echo gal number
one<00:03:14.030> yeah<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.090> I've<00:03:15.239> been<00:03:15.420> able<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.750> hold<00:03:16.020> on
