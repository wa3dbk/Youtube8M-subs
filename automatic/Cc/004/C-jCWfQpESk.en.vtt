make snow here for the little snowmen
and<00:02:24.319> let<00:02:25.319> me<00:02:25.409> think<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.909> just<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.390> piece<00:02:27.689> of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and let me think this is just a piece of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.780 
and let me think this is just a piece of
white<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.769> was<00:02:28.890> actually<00:02:29.040> whisper<00:02:29.640> white

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
white it was actually whisper white

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.250 
white it was actually whisper white
cardstock<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.780> ran<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.049> through<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
cardstock and I ran it through the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.149 
cardstock and I ran it through the
swirls<00:02:33.049> cuttlebug<00:02:34.049> flow<00:02:34.290> folder<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:34.950> then<00:02:35.040> I

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
swirls cuttlebug flow folder and then I

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.059 
swirls cuttlebug flow folder and then I
brushed<00:02:35.549> over<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:36.000> with<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.920> think<00:02:37.920> it's

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
brushed over it with the I think it's

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.330 
brushed over it with the I think it's
called<00:02:38.569> champagne<00:02:39.569> colored<00:02:40.019> Versamark<00:02:40.709> so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
called champagne colored Versamark so

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.860 
called champagne colored Versamark so
that's<00:02:41.579> why<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.879> has<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.269> little<00:02:42.329> creamy

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
that's why it has this little creamy

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.899 
that's why it has this little creamy
like<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.590> dirty<00:02:43.890> snow<00:02:44.189> kind<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.579> look<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:44.790> it

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
like a dirty snow kind of a look but it

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.220 
like a dirty snow kind of a look but it
was<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.030> would<00:02:45.359> have<00:02:45.420> been<00:02:45.480> too<00:02:45.750> stark<00:02:46.049> white

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
was just would have been too stark white

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.750 
was just would have been too stark white
for<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.650> card<00:02:46.889> because<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.459> kind<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.670> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
for the card because it's kind of a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.580 
for the card because it's kind of a
vintage<00:02:47.909> paper<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.650> then<00:02:49.920> i<00:02:49.980> use<00:02:50.370> iridescent
