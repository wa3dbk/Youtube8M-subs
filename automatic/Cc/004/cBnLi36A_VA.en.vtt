00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.420 
top-notch throughout so I can definitely
see<00:01:24.470> where<00:01:24.560> they're<00:01:24.740> coming<00:01:24.920> from<00:01:25.009> there<00:01:25.310> were

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
see where they're coming from there were

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.130 
see where they're coming from there were
some<00:01:25.729> things<00:01:25.970> there<00:01:26.479> are<00:01:26.509> some<00:01:26.659> issues<00:01:26.780> they

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
some things there are some issues they

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.840 
some things there are some issues they
had<00:01:27.350> early<00:01:27.770> in<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.979> game<00:01:28.159> and<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.579> know<00:01:28.640> they

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
had early in the game and I know they

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.399 
had early in the game and I know they
released<00:01:29.119> an<00:01:29.270> update<00:01:29.659> I<00:01:29.689> think<00:01:30.020> like<00:01:30.170> three

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
released an update I think like three

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.219 
released an update I think like three
weeks<00:01:30.649> ago<00:01:30.829> to<00:01:31.520> help<00:01:31.610> polish<00:01:32.030> off<00:01:32.210> some<00:01:33.049> of<00:01:33.079> the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
weeks ago to help polish off some of the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.230 
weeks ago to help polish off some of the
bugs<00:01:33.829> that<00:01:33.979> they<00:01:34.159> had<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:34.579> I<00:01:34.640> think<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.060> games

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
bugs that they had but I think the games

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.880 
bugs that they had but I think the games
getting<00:01:35.450> closer<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:35.899> closer<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.380> launch<00:01:36.590> I

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
getting closer and closer to launch I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.880 
getting closer and closer to launch I
actually<00:01:37.790> tried<00:01:38.299> to<00:01:38.329> text<00:01:38.899> one<00:01:39.590> of<00:01:39.770> the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
actually tried to text one of the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.289 
actually tried to text one of the
members<00:01:40.189> of<00:01:40.310> supercell<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.909> I<00:01:40.970> know<00:01:41.030> and

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
members of supercell that I know and

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.700 
members of supercell that I know and
asked<00:01:41.420> him<00:01:41.600> if<00:01:41.689> he<00:01:41.780> had<00:01:41.869> any<00:01:42.049> updates<00:01:42.409> on<00:01:42.530> it

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
asked him if he had any updates on it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.230 
asked him if he had any updates on it
but<00:01:43.130> unfortunately<00:01:43.280> he<00:01:43.729> said<00:01:43.880> he<00:01:44.000> doesn't

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
but unfortunately he said he doesn't

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.060 
but unfortunately he said he doesn't
know<00:01:44.299> anything<00:01:44.509> about<00:01:44.689> it<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:45.140> really<00:01:45.920> when

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
know anything about it and really when

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.130 
know anything about it and really when
it<00:01:46.159> comes<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.939> games<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.570> supercell

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
it comes to the games that supercell

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.870 
it comes to the games that supercell
makes<00:01:48.439> if<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.189> guys<00:01:49.280> didn't<00:01:49.610> know<00:01:49.640> they

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
makes if you guys didn't know they

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.149 
makes if you guys didn't know they
actually<00:01:50.329> split<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.079> teams<00:01:51.290> apart<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
actually split the teams apart so the

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.800 
actually split the teams apart so the
people<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.579> work<00:01:52.759> on<00:01:52.909> clash<00:01:53.180> of<00:01:53.360> clans<00:01:53.600> they

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
people that work on clash of clans they

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.569 
people that work on clash of clans they
actually<00:01:54.200> don't<00:01:54.409> work<00:01:54.649> on<00:01:54.860> boom<00:01:55.070> Beach<00:01:55.280> at<00:01:55.460> all

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
actually don't work on boom Beach at all

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.789 
actually don't work on boom Beach at all
and<00:01:55.790> vice-versa<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.110> literally<00:01:57.409> they're<00:01:57.680> in

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
and vice-versa so literally they're in

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.950 
and vice-versa so literally they're in
no<00:01:58.009> contact<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.329> more<00:01:59.479> they<00:01:59.630> work<00:01:59.780> on

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
no contact and the more they work on

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.480 
no contact and the more they work on
this<00:02:00.079> game<00:02:00.289> it's<00:02:00.500> not<00:02:00.590> taking<00:02:01.009> anything<00:02:01.250> away

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
this game it's not taking anything away

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.120 
this game it's not taking anything away
from<00:02:01.670> clash<00:02:02.030> of<00:02:02.180> clans<00:02:02.479> but<00:02:03.079> that's<00:02:03.469> as<00:02:03.590> far<00:02:03.979> as

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
from clash of clans but that's as far as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.770 
from clash of clans but that's as far as
I<00:02:04.219> know<00:02:04.280> right<00:02:04.610> now<00:02:04.759> I'm<00:02:04.969> thinking<00:02:05.390> since<00:02:05.570> they

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
I know right now I'm thinking since they

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.080 
I know right now I'm thinking since they
just<00:02:05.930> made<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.350> forum<00:02:06.799> official<00:02:07.789> they

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
just made that forum official they

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.730 
just made that forum official they
released<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.690> boom<00:02:08.840> beach<00:02:09.050> forum<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.590> since

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
released the boom beach forum and since

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.500 
released the boom beach forum and since
they're<00:02:09.920> making<00:02:10.160> these<00:02:10.250> posts<00:02:10.730> I<00:02:10.880> think<00:02:11.390> it

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
they're making these posts I think it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.610 
they're making these posts I think it
can't<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.870> more<00:02:12.080> than<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.290> few<00:02:12.620> weeks<00:02:12.770> away

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
can't be more than a few weeks away

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.960 
can't be more than a few weeks away
