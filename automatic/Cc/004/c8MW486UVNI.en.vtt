00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.120
 sargent ania are chosen agencies this 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.950
 Jews in Italy the show that goes on the air 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.849
 from Monday to Friday in which we speak 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.849
 of what happens in the world 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.010
 the first thing I wanted to launch you loach 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.410
 in the face scum is something that comes 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.269
 alone the well-known production company of a 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.519
 million things that as already said not 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.439
 if it passes very well lately it is that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.570
 has made it known that by starting from 14 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 then next year 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.500
 will stop producing its own particular 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.149
 product guess what I thought 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.860
 the playstation the first thing that is me 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.600
 coming to mind is the playstation 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.079
 but no, I was wrong, it is this 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 that made her famous or the Walkman 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.360
 apparently in fact sony ha 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.890
 continued to produce this business 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.780
 now I have no idea who sold them 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.579
 because to use an object like this you have 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 need an object like this and i am 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.390
 sure enough not to see one 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.090
 music cassette or any other 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.770
 type for at least 10 years or more video 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.020
 I was quite surprised when 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.660
 my brother who at age 17 one day me 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.100
 he said but this business is a business 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.689
 lots of CDs put the data in 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.760
 moral of the story time passes and a 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.890
 slow applause to all the people who 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.240
 they failed to overcome the shock 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.880
 traumatic of the passage from 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.680
 audiocassette to the cd and from the cd to the format 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 digital and having dealt with this 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.920
 fantastic news we can not that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.360
 stay in the world of the fantastic 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.310
 news we move to france in a 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.080
 high school where we find parents who 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 they protest that I am in revolt 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.380
 always of parents in revolt when you 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.020
 speaks of schools but we also find 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.460
 the suspended teacher is a theme 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.860
 just the title of the theme that was 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.470
 given to students during an assignment in 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.800
 class the theme was this you just have 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.780
 turned 18 years old 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.830
 you have decided to do away with the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.350
 your life 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.240
 your decision seems irrevocable 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.000
 decide in one last momentum of 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.990
 write the reasons for our gesture 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.030
 drawing a portrait comparison 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.790
 describe all the disgust you have 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.290
 of him our text will evoke 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.880
 some event of your life 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.430
 at the origin of your mood 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.780
 obviously polly controversy I want 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.320
 know your opinion what it is 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.200
 think 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.430
 personally I am absolutely 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.170
 agree with the suspension of the teacher 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.970
 and this is not because I am scandalized 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 from the topic of suicide because I hate 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.410
 taboo suicide but mainly because 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.660
 I have great respect for the figure of 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.400
 professor of the professor as a model 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.710
 it's at the same time they are a kind of 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.780
 follower of positive thinking I think 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.550
 it is important to talk about everything but not 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.620
 in these terms I find that these 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.420
 terms are wrong because a theme 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.340
 like this I set it up so it doesn't 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.260
 reality reflect on the problem of 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.460
 suicide on suicide itself but 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.980
 he simply asks the students 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.050
 pretend to be depressed and tell me what 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.020
 it is your darkest secret there 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.760
 it would kill no no it's not good 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.290
 way of reasoning at least according to mine 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.120
 point of view before moving on to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.550
 next news as usual and vi 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.080
 I will talk about Italian politicians who lose 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.180
 the beautiful country of ufo existence 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.430
 I'm not joking just the end of 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.100
 today's scum lorenzo sends us 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.020
 this photo that sent me together 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.270
 a rather cheeky email that says 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.220
 let's have some fun too 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.260
 so lorenzo could not read them 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.910
 disappointing you, however, I already hear the comments 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.890
 some jealous baby boys 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.860
 what they say but me he likes a physique 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.840
 so I would not liars burned the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.000
 politician I was talking about and this is a 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.290
 MEP is called Borghezio 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.630
 we talked a million times 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.220
 just because he is not new to 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.810
 to say it in a politically correct way a 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.760
 of the colored exits and the last exit 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.060
 colorful indeed is the one that after having 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.550
 listened to radio Padania is the report 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.780
 that actually aliens are in between 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.400
 there is a conspiracy between the chancellors and 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.640
 the prime ministers of the countries for 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.200
 hide this thing and unfortunately me 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.550
 I find myself having to mention this because 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.520
 with the proximity of the end of the year 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.810
 They are increasing cases of panic or 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.910
 my god the end of the world 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.650
 etc. so let's see how two countries 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.660
 different but similar in some respects 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.010
 they reacted one thing to one side 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.319
 we have the united states government that 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.150
 officially on its website 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.610
 let the population know 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.220
 US that is not going to end 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.540
 the world is no there will be collisions 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.370
 with other planets there will be no 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.450
 there will be no four explosions 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.250
 knights of the apocalypse 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.620
 none of this on the other side 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.359
 there is the Australian prime minister julia 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.210
 gillard who will have left the statement 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.980
 opposite by letting you know that you will finish the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.110
 world at the end of this year though 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.030
 it is still not clear why, if I am 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.710
 they quote textually caused by a horde 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.200
 of zombies that eat the skin of the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.860
 other people or from the final triumph of the 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.210
 that hip hop 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.889
 the woman obviously released this 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.660
 declaration jokingly but to me it is 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.490
 came immediately to ask me if 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.200
 one of our politicians had done 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.790
 got the thing so jokingly of the 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.350
 mail to laugh this press 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.120
 I guess it all depends on 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.090
 personal sensibility , however, the world 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.669
 is about to end and everyone would die no 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.080
 but yes, yes, but not much, but we talk a lot 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.550
 quickly of politics I wanted 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 respond to some of you who have 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.729
 left comments below the video of 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.770
 yesterday in the past of people yesterday rai 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.000
 said the mountain government was a good one 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.620
 government 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.390
 I have always shown my support 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.400
 also criticized this government 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.630
 how there was to criticize it but I do n't dream of it 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.490
 not even remotely because these are 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.410
 my ideas to say that the government 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.090
 montino was incisive in changing 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.789
 a few things you could do a lot of 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.200
 the more unfair it has been a lot 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.789
 however, to say that what he did 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.740
 in this year it was useless indeed 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.110
 it seems excessive to me 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.270
 however, they are for all people 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.010
 that they should feel obliged to 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.510
 vote right because they don't want to 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.070
 vote left because they feel more 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.900
 close to the right levels because they have 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.820
 fear of the communists or because on the left 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.010
 they are smelly we leave the paradigm 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.050
 that right means Berlusconi is not 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.270
 so in the pdl there are elements 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.710
 valid for example on December 16th at 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.510
 day they were due to 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.830
 hold the center-right primaries that 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.850
 Berlusconi said well we don't do it 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.200
 more command me 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.389
 instead a big one will be held 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.180
 demonstration led by the two great ones 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.010
 dissidents of the pdl or giorgia meloni 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.110
 and the only two I drive together 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.510
 belonging to the pdl at least those 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.420
 known to avoid getting back in line 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.010
 after that for him 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.500
 he told me i'm back that inside 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.690
 of their party speak of democracy 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.890
 speak of ideals that speak of legality 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.510
 it is rumored that they could also 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.140
 break away from the pdl to found another 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.760
 party 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.930
 if you were interested in being able to right me 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.790
 an ear to what this person 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.710
 not to say I'll throw it right for 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.170
 not having to fall back into the 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.150
 paradigm of berlusconi more people a 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.980
 side that defend the indefensible 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.420
 but this scum if all that 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.980
 I have to say for today, thanks for having 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.690
