we had a large treadmill in the lab

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.529 
we had a large treadmill in the lab
previously<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:26.369> broke<00:00:26.880> down<00:00:26.910> this

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
previously but it just broke down this

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.550 
previously but it just broke down this
last<00:00:27.810> spring<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:29.150> with<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.449> problem<00:00:31.199> came

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
last spring and with that problem came

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.470 
last spring and with that problem came
the<00:00:31.679> opportunity<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.400> replacing<00:00:33.150> it<00:00:33.240> with<00:00:33.390> an

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the opportunity of replacing it with an

roller seeing on a treadmill in itself

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.620 
roller seeing on a treadmill in itself
is<00:01:04.680> an<00:01:04.920> interesting<00:01:05.090> thing<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> do<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
is an interesting thing to do and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.620 
is an interesting thing to do and
experience<00:01:07.100> it's<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.700> similar<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.300> roller

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

skating<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.140> road<00:01:10.410> but<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.710> there's<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
skating on the road but it there's a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.430 
skating on the road but it there's a
little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> quality<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.420> when<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
little bit just the quality of when you

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.990 
little bit just the quality of when you
plant<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:13.800> poles<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.250> rubber<00:01:14.460> surface

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
plant your poles on the rubber surface

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
plant your poles on the rubber surface
it<00:01:15.180> responds<00:01:15.690> differently<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.260> I<00:01:16.500> was<00:01:17.250> doing

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it responds differently and I was doing

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
it responds differently and I was doing
a<00:01:17.730> vo2<00:01:18.120> max<00:01:18.630> test<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.220> measures<00:01:20.700> how<00:01:21.380> how

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
a vo2 max test and that measures how how

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.260 
a vo2 max test and that measures how how
much<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.920> volume<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.370> oxygen<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.910> you<00:01:24.090> can

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
much your volume of oxygen that you can

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.960 
much your volume of oxygen that you can
consume<00:01:24.660> and<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.500> finds<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.160> maximum<00:01:26.370> amount

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
consume and it finds the maximum amount

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
consume and it finds the maximum amount
at<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.420> peak<00:01:27.690> intensity<00:01:28.260> level<00:01:28.650> primarily

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
at your peak intensity level primarily

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.030 
at your peak intensity level primarily
what<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.760> does<00:01:29.940> is<00:01:30.120> allows<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:31.110> head<00:01:31.530> ski

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
what it does is allows the head ski

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.520 
what it does is allows the head ski
coach<00:01:32.340> objective<00:01:33.240> information<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.500> be

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
coach objective information that can be

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.220 
coach objective information that can be
used<00:01:34.770> as<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.040> comparison<00:01:35.430> between<00:01:36.150> skiers<00:01:36.840> year

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
used as a comparison between skiers year

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.830 
used as a comparison between skiers year
to<00:01:37.350> year<00:01:37.620> but<00:01:37.830> more<00:01:38.250> importantly<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.450> it's

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
to year but more importantly it's it's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.350 
to year but more importantly it's it's
used<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.950> look<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.250> individual<00:01:42.030> skiers

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
used to look at individual skiers

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660 
used to look at individual skiers
progress<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.170> fitness<00:01:43.530> over<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> years<00:01:44.370> as

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
progress and fitness over the years as

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.150 
progress and fitness over the years as
they're<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.480> at<00:01:45.570> MSU<00:01:45.900> so<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.620> I<00:01:46.740> come<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
they're here at MSU so if I come in and

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.650 
they're here at MSU so if I come in and
do<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.340> again<00:01:47.520> next<00:01:47.850> year<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.570> really

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
do this again next year it's really

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.650 
do this again next year it's really
helpful<00:01:49.080> just<00:01:49.230> to<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.850> where<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.880> am<00:01:51.030> where<00:01:51.630> I
