 very happy to be in this stage 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.090
 feeling nerves 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.300
 with the song that is measured I'm going to say 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.250
 of the jury comment is amazing 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.590
 really what you achieve on stage 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.150
 the interpretation he has put 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.250
 we talked to Carlos too and 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.490
 we said that does not seem chiquitos not 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.800
 they seem 13 years of 14 of 12 of 15 not 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.010
 they look much older because they come out 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.769
 stage 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.769
 with a very good teacher level 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.770

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.479
 Carlos was used and I loved it is important 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.160
 that knows how to admit the kids that are 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.080
 participants that what they do is fine 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.000
 difficult we the great ones die 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.560
 of fear as sometimes so small things 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.620
 then do not feel pressured 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.350
 because they are already stars right now they are 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.900
