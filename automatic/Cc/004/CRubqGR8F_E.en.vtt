think<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.870> car<00:00:13.110> itself<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.799> going<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.040> be

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
think the car itself is going to be

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.039 
think the car itself is going to be
fairly<00:00:14.429> basic<00:00:14.730> where<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.450> sits<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.900> their

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
fairly basic where it sits in their

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.990 
fairly basic where it sits in their
model<00:00:16.470> line<00:00:16.680> these<00:00:17.220> guys<00:00:17.460> are<00:00:17.640> turning<00:00:17.880> that

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
model line these guys are turning that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.910 
model line these guys are turning that
model<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.539> its<00:00:18.570> head<00:00:18.990> let<00:00:19.439> me<00:00:19.560> show<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
model on its head let me show you the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.759 
model on its head let me show you the
technology<00:00:20.279> inside<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.210> interesting

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
technology inside this is interesting

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.279 
technology inside this is interesting
now<00:00:22.769> 3g<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.850> fairly<00:00:24.119> common<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.689> automobiles

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
now 3g is fairly common in automobiles

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.019 
now 3g is fairly common in automobiles
but<00:00:25.410> even<00:00:25.800> today<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.490> not<00:00:26.640> typically

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
but even today it's not typically

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.720 
but even today it's not typically
embedded<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.779> 4g<00:00:28.380> almost<00:00:28.890> unheard<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.490> until

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
embedded and 4g almost unheard of until

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.620 
embedded and 4g almost unheard of until
now<00:00:30.210> here's<00:00:31.080> audi<00:00:31.410> putting<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> into<00:00:32.219> their<00:00:32.630> a3

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
now here's audi putting it into their a3

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
now here's audi putting it into their a3
you'd<00:00:34.410> expect<00:00:34.829> me<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.040> say<00:00:35.219> eight<00:00:35.460> there

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
you'd expect me to say eight there

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.700 
you'd expect me to say eight there
wouldn't<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.329> high-end<00:00:36.989> car<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
wouldn't you high-end car and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.340 
wouldn't you high-end car and
introducing<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.430> here<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.120> lower<00:00:39.570> end<00:00:39.930> car

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
introducing it here in a lower end car

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.750 
introducing it here in a lower end car
and<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:40.620> kind<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> interesting<00:00:41.010> strategy

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and that's kind of interesting strategy

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.310 
and that's kind of interesting strategy
what<00:00:42.120> you'll<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.510> you'll<00:00:42.540> pop<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> sim<00:00:43.170> in

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
what you'll do is you'll pop a sim in

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.660 
what you'll do is you'll pop a sim in
the<00:00:43.350> dash<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.219> any<00:00:44.340> embedded

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the dash like you do with any embedded

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.130 
the dash like you do with any embedded
connectivity<00:00:45.300> system<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> might<00:00:46.110> say

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
connectivity system and you might say

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.650 
connectivity system and you might say
why<00:00:46.500> don't<00:00:46.559> need<00:00:46.739> 4G<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> car<00:00:47.670> because<00:00:48.270> 3g<00:00:48.600> is

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
why don't need 4G in a car because 3g is

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.060 
why don't need 4G in a car because 3g is
not<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> big<00:00:48.989> enough<00:00:49.020> pipe<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.620> run<00:00:49.860> what

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
not a big enough pipe to run what

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.850 
not a big enough pipe to run what
they're<00:00:50.250> doing<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> dash<00:00:51.500> 7000<00:00:52.500> streaming

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
they're doing in the dash 7000 streaming

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
they're doing in the dash 7000 streaming
radio<00:00:52.980> stations<00:00:53.670> Google<00:00:54.390> Earth<00:00:54.570> which

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
radio stations Google Earth which

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.389 
radio stations Google Earth which
they've<00:00:54.960> had<00:00:55.140> before<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.620> these<00:00:55.739> cars<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.250> now

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
they've had before in these cars but now

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.130 
they've had before in these cars but now
really<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.149> some<00:00:57.300> good<00:00:57.480> throttle<00:00:57.960> response

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
really with some good throttle response

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080 
really with some good throttle response
if<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.710> will<00:00:58.829> it'll<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.129> load<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.940> some

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
if you will it'll really load with some

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.549 
if you will it'll really load with some
snappiness<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.260> they've<00:01:01.440> got

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
snappiness to it here they've got

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.840 
snappiness to it here they've got
something<00:01:01.829> called<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> phone<00:01:02.309> box<00:01:02.550> what

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
something called the phone box what

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.619 
something called the phone box what
that's<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.359> give<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that's going to do is give you a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.179 
that's going to do is give you a
wireless<00:01:04.049> connection<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> external

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
antenna apparatus in the car here's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.420 
antenna apparatus in the car here's
another<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.710> when<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.070> car<00:01:08.250> hits

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
another one when this car hits

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.890 
another one when this car hits
production<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> offer<00:01:09.510> an<00:01:09.750> app

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
going to a fatter pipe that's a good
