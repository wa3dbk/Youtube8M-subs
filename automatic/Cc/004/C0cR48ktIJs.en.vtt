00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:10.700
 Vibration isolation project completed motor 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.700
 shield bimast bombs page on both sides 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:37.399
 floor and foot aura roof and silver by 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.399
 residual principle 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:52.829
 rear arches bimast bombs and also 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:58.469
 remnants of xp and the Jurassic and in the rear wing, too, and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.920
 silver and a few words about why I 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.330
 stuck it like that I test my theory 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.570
 about insulation see the driver 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.700
 sits in front of the car closer 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.020
 to blue 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.509
 noise source main engine and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 transmission transmission exhaust goes 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.450
 farthest from him is the back 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.890
 car noise sources in the back 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.740
 so if you roll the whole car 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:35.159
 in a continuous layer let's say this 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:39.810
 front noise is that car 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.270
 decreases evenly and at the same time everything 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.090
 equal to the dominant noise will remain 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 engine transmission noise 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.780
 that is, he himself went to for the noise of the car 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.759
 and from there I took it almost to the point 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.640
 states 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:59.250
 drove in principle the engine was audible in 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.399
 In this case I want to check such a thing. 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.969
 what's in the front for the noise or you 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.569
 maximum to see this literally cocoon 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.310
 this turned out for just a little more 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.130
 stick on the rack 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.750
 for the noise or the maximum and the back 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.620
 for noise left residual 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:28.930
 let's say here the rear seats are under iron 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.930
 special vibration isolation tank is not necessary 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.990
 rear end too 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.560
 pasted for the most part where there is 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:46.640
 muffler and rear strum schA trough too 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.890
 all sealed with the rear pockets 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.120
 I will not make a fuss at all because they have 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.770
 moisture accumulates back pockets generously 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:03.560
 Iâ€™m going to stand behind an anticorrosive twist here 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:06.740
 family seems so waiting for graduation 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.060
 project with in order to see 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.090
 what result will be on the way 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.090
 trials 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.090
 small supplement for those who wish 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.780
 to repeat 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:30.890
 how many materials it took three sheets most 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:34.450
 bombs one sheet and silver and 15 sheets 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.450
 stp aero 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.030
 so much need for such 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.030
 result
