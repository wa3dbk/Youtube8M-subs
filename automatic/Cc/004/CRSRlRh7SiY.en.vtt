contemporary home but if you're more
traditional<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.399> nature<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.329> actually

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
traditional in nature you can actually

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.020 
traditional in nature you can actually
take<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.230> print<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:46.890> put<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.640> into<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
take this print and just put it into a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.389 
take this print and just put it into a
matted<00:00:48.570> frame<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.620> look<00:00:49.800> completely

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
matted frame and it will look completely

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.520 
matted frame and it will look completely
different<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.629> whenever<00:00:51.809> you're<00:00:52.140> doing<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
different so whenever you're doing a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.680 
different so whenever you're doing a
matted<00:00:52.890> frame<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.430> want<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> consider<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
matted frame you want to consider the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.200 
matted frame you want to consider the
colors<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> artwork<00:00:56.010> itself<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.699> this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
colors in the artwork itself in this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.540 
colors in the artwork itself in this
instance<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.989> complimentary<00:00:58.590> white<00:00:58.980> frame<00:00:59.340> or

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
instance a complimentary white frame or

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.490 
instance a complimentary white frame or
even<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.879> contrasting<00:01:00.629> black<00:01:00.840> frame<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.410> be

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
even a contrasting black frame would be

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.310 
even a contrasting black frame would be
a<00:01:01.530> great<00:01:01.949> option<00:01:02.750> now<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> it's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
a great option now to do this it's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.289 
a great option now to do this it's
actually<00:01:04.439> very<00:01:04.890> simple<00:01:05.189> when<00:01:05.850> you're<00:01:05.939> picking

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
actually very simple when you're picking

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
actually very simple when you're picking
out<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> matte<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> frame<00:01:07.409> itself<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
out the matte in the frame itself you

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.070 
out the matte in the frame itself you
want<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.580> consider<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.420> size<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.720> your

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
want to consider the right size for your

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.899 
want to consider the right size for your
wall<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.070> want<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> consider<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
wall and then you want to consider the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.300 
wall and then you want to consider the
right<00:01:12.119> size<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.960> print<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.920> make<00:01:14.159> sure

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
right size for the print and make sure

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.520 
right size for the print and make sure
that<00:01:14.460> everything<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.119> fit<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.540> together<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that everything will fit in together and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
that everything will fit in together and
look<00:01:16.710> cohesive<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.270> instance<00:01:18.509> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
look cohesive so in this instance you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.350 
look cohesive so in this instance you
just<00:01:19.320> take<00:01:19.560> apart<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> frame<00:01:20.369> remove<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
just take apart the frame remove the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.570 
just take apart the frame remove the
backing<00:01:21.600> from<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.020> frame<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.770> place<00:01:23.400> your

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
backing from the frame and place your

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.999 
backing from the frame and place your
print<00:01:23.939> inside<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.720> map<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.200> you're<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
print inside the map if you're the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.920 
print inside the map if you're the
little<00:01:26.280> bit<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.520> tape<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.030> long<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.630> it's<00:01:27.780> not

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
little bit of tape as long as it's not

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080 
little bit of tape as long as it's not
going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> damage<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.890> piece<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.400> artwork<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
going to damage the piece of artwork and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.450 
going to damage the piece of artwork and
then<00:01:30.720> place<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.320> back<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> frame<00:01:31.979> back<00:01:32.220> on

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
then place the back of the frame back on

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.310 
then place the back of the frame back on
from<00:01:33.090> there<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.450> can<00:01:33.600> adjust<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.110> height

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
from there you can adjust the height

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109 
from there you can adjust the height
based<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.040> where<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.369> want<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> artwork<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
based on where you want the artwork to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.819 
based on where you want the artwork to
go<00:01:36.240> on<00:01:36.360> your<00:01:36.479> wall<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.990> you've<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> whole

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
new focal point so the next time that

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.960 
new focal point so the next time that
you<00:01:40.350> need<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.740> update<00:01:40.950> your<00:01:41.280> walls<00:01:41.549> with<00:01:41.850> some
