00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.420 
there's no way of getting any fat to the
behind<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.470> put<00:01:55.740> an<00:01:55.799> implant<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.219> but

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
behind and so you put an implant in but

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.920 
behind and so you put an implant in but
some<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.700> side<00:01:56.880> effects<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.270> implants<00:01:57.750> are

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
some of the side effects of implants are

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.249 
some of the side effects of implants are
that<00:01:58.259> they're<00:01:58.680> solid<00:01:59.009> materials<00:01:59.869> they<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
that they're solid materials they have a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.780 
that they're solid materials they have a
slightly<00:02:01.590> higher<00:02:01.710> chance<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> complications

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
slightly higher chance of complications

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.789 
slightly higher chance of complications
such<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.869> actually<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.439> some<00:02:04.619> pictures

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
such as we actually have some pictures

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.530 
such as we actually have some pictures
we<00:02:05.070> could<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.280> showing<00:02:05.549> -<00:02:05.670> yes<00:02:05.909> what's<00:02:06.360> going

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
we could be showing - yes what's going

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.429 
we could be showing - yes what's going
through<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.780> those<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.140> you're<00:02:07.320> talking

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
through all those as you're talking

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.309 
through all those as you're talking
about<00:02:07.740> this

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
about this

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.859 
about this
so<00:02:08.469> this<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.099> woman<00:02:09.340> who<00:02:09.789> we<00:02:10.149> actually<00:02:10.569> did

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
so this is a woman who we actually did

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.429 
so this is a woman who we actually did
the<00:02:11.260> brazilian<00:02:12.040> butt-lift<00:02:12.719> or<00:02:13.719> transferring

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:14.439 
the brazilian butt-lift or transferring

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.280 
the brazilian butt-lift or transferring
a<00:02:14.709> fact<00:02:15.159> to<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.519> buttock<00:02:15.819> area<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.750> for<00:02:16.930> her<00:02:17.079> we

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
a fact to the buttock area so for her we

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.849 
a fact to the buttock area so for her we
actually<00:02:17.760> removed<00:02:18.760> fat<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.290> very<00:02:20.590> gentle

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
actually removed fat with a very gentle

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.740 
actually removed fat with a very gentle
liposuction<00:02:21.579> to<00:02:21.760> her<00:02:21.849> abdominal<00:02:22.060> waist<00:02:22.480> area

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
liposuction to her abdominal waist area

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.899 
liposuction to her abdominal waist area
and<00:02:22.780> transferring<00:02:23.379> it<00:02:23.409> to<00:02:23.530> her<00:02:23.709> behind<00:02:23.980> okay<00:02:24.879> I

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
and transferring it to her behind okay I

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.360 
and transferring it to her behind okay I
think<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.150> really<00:02:25.359> nice<00:02:25.510> improvement<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.500> it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
think it's really nice improvement so it

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.069 
think it's really nice improvement so it
actually<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.849> double<00:02:28.239> whammy<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.750> guess<00:02:28.930> is

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
actually is a double whammy I guess is

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.050 
actually is a double whammy I guess is
what<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.349> you're<00:02:29.739> you're<00:02:30.400> taking<00:02:30.760> from<00:02:30.879> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
what it is you're you're taking from the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.330 
what it is you're you're taking from the
tummy<00:02:31.239> area<00:02:31.359> and<00:02:32.230> then<00:02:32.530> transferring<00:02:33.250> that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
tummy area and then transferring that

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.589 
tummy area and then transferring that
and<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.879> isn't<00:02:34.090> something<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.420> body

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
and that isn't something the body

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.839 
and that isn't something the body
couldn't<00:02:34.900> can<00:02:35.260> actually<00:02:35.680> do<00:02:35.859> or<00:02:36.099> is<00:02:36.129> it<00:02:36.370> after

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
couldn't can actually do or is it after

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.330 
couldn't can actually do or is it after
you've<00:02:36.970> tried<00:02:37.420> everything<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:38.340> exactly

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
you've tried everything then exactly

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.069 
you've tried everything then exactly
because<00:02:39.609> I<00:02:39.639> mean<00:02:39.879> if<00:02:40.000> you're<00:02:40.180> not<00:02:40.359> born<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
because I mean if you're not born and

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.210 
because I mean if you're not born and
same<00:02:41.230> thing<00:02:41.379> there's<00:02:41.500> another<00:02:41.680> another

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
same thing there's another another

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.619 
same thing there's another another
patient<00:02:42.639> with<00:02:42.730> us<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.060> way<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.209> similar

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
patient with us the way the similar

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.899 
patient with us the way the similar
surgery<00:02:44.500> if<00:02:45.010> you've<00:02:45.220> tried<00:02:45.430> everything<00:02:45.760> and

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
surgery if you've tried everything and

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.030 
surgery if you've tried everything and
you<00:02:46.060> really<00:02:46.329> you<00:02:46.599> really<00:02:46.629> can't<00:02:47.319> enhance

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
you really you really can't enhance

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.929 
you really you really can't enhance
you're<00:02:48.939> behind<00:02:49.359> other<00:02:49.870> than<00:02:50.079> workout<00:02:50.939> then

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
you're behind other than workout then

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.610 
you're behind other than workout then
you<00:02:52.060> really<00:02:52.239> have<00:02:52.359> to<00:02:52.450> transfer<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> fat<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.349> so

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
you really have to transfer a fat and so

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.289 
you really have to transfer a fat and so
the<00:02:53.829> best<00:02:54.069> area<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:54.549> do<00:02:54.639> that<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.879> try<00:02:55.000> to<00:02:55.060> find

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
the best area to do that is try to find

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.330 
the best area to do that is try to find
areas<00:02:55.599> of<00:02:55.750> excess<00:02:56.019> fat<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.680> liposuction<00:02:57.099> is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
areas of excess fat the liposuction is

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.800 
areas of excess fat the liposuction is
done<00:02:57.459> very<00:02:57.700> differently<00:02:58.150> than<00:02:58.239> traditional

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
done very differently than traditional

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.839 
done very differently than traditional
liposuction<00:02:58.959> for<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.769> generally<00:03:00.669> when<00:03:00.790> you

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
liposuction for that generally when you

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.309 
liposuction for that generally when you
do<00:03:00.939> liposuction<00:03:01.090> you're<00:03:01.689> really<00:03:01.989> trying<00:03:02.200> to

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
do liposuction you're really trying to

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.960 
do liposuction you're really trying to
harvest<00:03:02.680> as<00:03:02.769> much<00:03:02.950> fat<00:03:03.220> as<00:03:03.250> possible<00:03:03.790> you're

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
harvest as much fat as possible you're

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.490 
harvest as much fat as possible you're
doing<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.239> under<00:03:04.329> higher<00:03:04.569> suction<00:03:05.139> things

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
doing it under higher suction things

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.990 
doing it under higher suction things
like<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.889> whereas<00:03:06.519> when<00:03:06.609> you're<00:03:06.730> trying<00:03:06.879> to

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
like that whereas when you're trying to

transfer harvest fat from a certain area

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.069 
transfer harvest fat from a certain area
you<00:03:09.669> have<00:03:09.909> to<00:03:10.000> do<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.269> under<00:03:10.419> other<00:03:10.659> handheld

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
you have to do it under other handheld

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.229 
you have to do it under other handheld
suction<00:03:11.530> or<00:03:11.799> low<00:03:12.220> suction<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.760> when<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.060> get

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
suction or low suction and when you get

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.180 
suction or low suction and when you get
the<00:03:13.389> fat<00:03:13.629> it<00:03:14.049> has<00:03:14.109> to<00:03:14.290> be<00:03:14.349> processed<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:15.040> you

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
the fat it has to be processed so you

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.830 
the fat it has to be processed so you
remove<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.669> blood<00:03:15.879> cells<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.449> move<00:03:16.690> the

you to do this whereas previously I
couldn't<00:03:30.729> yes<00:03:31.299> I<00:03:31.510> think<00:03:31.569> it's<00:03:31.900> getting<00:03:32.019> more

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
couldn't yes I think it's getting more

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.800 
couldn't yes I think it's getting more
more<00:03:32.470> popular<00:03:33.099> the<00:03:33.699> actual<00:03:34.030> concept<00:03:34.449> of<00:03:34.629> fat

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
more popular the actual concept of fat

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.659 
more popular the actual concept of fat
transfer<00:03:35.260> isn't<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.709> near<00:03:35.919> but<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.489> high

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
transfer isn't that near but in high

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.399 
transfer isn't that near but in high
volume<00:03:37.180> it's<00:03:37.389> more<00:03:37.599> new<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.079> this<00:03:38.229> is<00:03:38.379> a

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
volume it's more new so this is a

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.069 
volume it's more new so this is a
high-volume<00:03:38.829> transfer<00:03:39.579> it's<00:03:40.299> what<00:03:40.930> we've

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
high-volume transfer it's what we've

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.869 
high-volume transfer it's what we've
noticed<00:03:41.290> is<00:03:41.500> that<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.680> really<00:03:41.979> need<00:03:42.099> to<00:03:42.370> know

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
noticed is that you really need to know

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.399 
noticed is that you really need to know
how<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.150> harvest<00:03:43.449> the<00:03:43.690> fat<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:46.169> clean<00:03:47.169> the

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
how to harvest the fat and clean the

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.680 
how to harvest the fat and clean the
fact<00:03:47.680> before<00:03:48.129> you<00:03:48.220> inject<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.510> then

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
fact before you inject it in and then

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.659 
fact before you inject it in and then
how<00:03:49.959> safe<00:03:50.199> is<00:03:50.349> this<00:03:50.500> it's<00:03:50.979> actually<00:03:51.099> very<00:03:51.370> safe

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
how safe is this it's actually very safe

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.979 
how safe is this it's actually very safe
because<00:03:51.790> you're<00:03:52.000> using<00:03:52.150> your<00:03:52.389> own<00:03:52.419> body's

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
because you're using your own body's

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.960 
because you're using your own body's
tissue<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.650> transferring<00:03:54.489> it<00:03:54.549> over<00:03:54.790> so

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
tissue and transferring it over so

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.439 
tissue and transferring it over so
there's<00:03:55.120> no<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.870> can't<00:03:56.109> get<00:03:56.290> any<00:03:56.439> rejection

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
there's no you can't get any rejection

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.000 
there's no you can't get any rejection
from<00:03:58.449> that<00:03:58.599> you<00:03:58.780> know<00:03:58.870> things<00:03:59.169> like<00:03:59.319> that<00:03:59.379> okay

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
from that you know things like that okay

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.159 
from that you know things like that okay
and<00:04:00.250> just<00:04:00.579> curious<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:01.389> mean<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.629> it<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.959> same

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
and just curious I mean is it the same

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.140 
and just curious I mean is it the same
fat<00:04:02.439> that's<00:04:02.680> in<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:03.040> stomach<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.579> would<00:04:03.760> end

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
fat that's in the stomach that would end

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.689 
fat that's in the stomach that would end
up<00:04:04.299> in<00:04:04.479> in<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.019> derriere<00:04:05.349> of<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:06.069> area<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.430> mean

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
up in in the derriere of the area I mean

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.490 
up in in the derriere of the area I mean
it<00:04:06.879> does<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:07.299> stay<00:04:07.659> there<00:04:07.900> does<00:04:08.169> it<00:04:08.319> get

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
it does it stay there does it get

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.589 
it does it stay there does it get
absorbed<00:04:08.769> into<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.220> system<00:04:09.579> is<00:04:09.699> it<00:04:09.729> transfer

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
absorbed into the system is it transfer

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.080 
absorbed into the system is it transfer
yeah<00:04:10.989> so<00:04:11.379> it's<00:04:11.680> very<00:04:11.919> true<00:04:12.099> so<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.549> is<00:04:12.699> a<00:04:12.729> fact

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
yeah so it's very true so it is a fact

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.240 
yeah so it's very true so it is a fact
that<00:04:13.269> was<00:04:13.750> genetically<00:04:14.259> in<00:04:14.709> your<00:04:14.979> abdomen

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
that was genetically in your abdomen

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.879 
that was genetically in your abdomen
that<00:04:15.579> that's<00:04:15.819> now<00:04:16.030> in<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.329> behind<00:04:16.659> area<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.409> it

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
that that's now in the behind area so it

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.539 
that that's now in the behind area so it
has<00:04:18.340> memory<00:04:19.029> of<00:04:19.380> what

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
has memory of what

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.570 
has memory of what
did<00:04:20.879> earlier<00:04:21.389> so<00:04:21.690> from<00:04:21.959> its<00:04:21.989> source<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.099> if<00:04:23.370> you

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
did earlier so from its source so if you

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.339 
did earlier so from its source so if you
were<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:23.909> lose<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.180> large<00:04:24.780> amount<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.169> weight

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
were to lose a large amount of weight

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.869 
were to lose a large amount of weight
you<00:04:25.680> noticed<00:04:26.099> that<00:04:26.250> after<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.610> fat<00:04:26.729> transfer

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879 
you noticed that after the fat transfer

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.149 
you noticed that after the fat transfer
your<00:04:27.240> bottom<00:04:27.810> may<00:04:27.930> decrease<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.349> bit<00:04:28.620> just<00:04:29.039> like

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
your bottom may decrease a bit just like

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.189 
your bottom may decrease a bit just like
your<00:04:29.400> tummy<00:04:29.550> there<00:04:29.789> or<00:04:30.000> if<00:04:30.509> generally<00:04:31.050> your

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
your tummy there or if generally your

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.529 
your tummy there or if generally your
abdominal<00:04:31.949> Donnell<00:04:32.400> area<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.789> a<00:04:32.819> resistant

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
abdominal Donnell area is a resistant

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.480 
abdominal Donnell area is a resistant
area<00:04:33.659> to<00:04:33.930> fat<00:04:34.110> loss<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.800> wouldn't<00:04:35.099> lose<00:04:35.220> that

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
area to fat loss you wouldn't lose that

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.159 
area to fat loss you wouldn't lose that
all<00:04:35.729> right<00:04:35.909> this<00:04:36.150> is<00:04:36.300> all<00:04:36.419> fascinating<00:04:36.659> we've

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
all right this is all fascinating we've

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.600 
all right this is all fascinating we've
got<00:04:37.319> to<00:04:37.440> take<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.590> really<00:04:37.949> quick<00:04:38.099> break<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.580> I

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
got to take a really quick break and I

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.509 
got to take a really quick break and I
know<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:38.789> have<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.000> couple<00:04:39.240> of<00:04:39.389> other
