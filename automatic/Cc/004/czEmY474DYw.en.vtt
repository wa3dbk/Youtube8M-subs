00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.509
 stars to livta our luca 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.330
 bulgarelli approached daisy 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.969

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.059

 of the division asd skating 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.689
 portogruaro that at this time 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.640
 let's face it and the athlete mute 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.490
 teaching more because in alone 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 four months you won regional 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.820
 European and world nationals 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.790
 virtually everything in fact much 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.730
 emotion and everything on a blow even though 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.290
 many motions were in fact me 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.090
 and my team from 2013 where we have 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.840
 made the world championship in taipei 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.360
 in short, we started to win them all 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.219
 the competitions that took place 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.760
 precisely starting from the championship of 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.760
 Taipei world then the regional championships 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.609
 to caorle the Italian championships in Florence 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.030
 and the last one recently the championships 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.090
 Europeans who have been held in 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.310
 holland to almere and emotion 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.110
 clearly it is very strong also because 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.780
 behind these results there is a job 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.640
 immense both from us as athletes 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.310
 both from our coaches and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.650
 moreover they are mauthen yes they too and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.030
 we remember them are benedetta martini e 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.390
 roberto callegher and all the directors i 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.670
 in short, parents who support us and yes 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.840
 they are always behind in all these 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.970
 in short our experiences the party a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.580
 May is a very popular sport one of 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.530
 more practiced in Italy yet not 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.930
 fails to attract let us say 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.050
 investments in these comparisons 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.320
 how come unfortunately skating 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.130
 artistic on wheels is a sport that does not 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.520
 you see a lot on television so not 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.610
 it has a huge notoriety difference 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.520
 instead of figure skating always 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.680
 on ice that we say is a bit 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:17.220
 more little more famous and unfortunately we are the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.900
 why I don't know, there are few 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.260
 few funds and therefore we unfortunately every 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.150
 experience that we are going to do to burden 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.970
 on our shoulders and ours 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.420
 parents and therefore a sport 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.870
 the reason unfortunately is little known 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.870
 I do not know
