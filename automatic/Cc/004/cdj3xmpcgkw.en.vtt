but<00:02:55.360> in<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.570> meantime<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:56.440> felt<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:56.920> would<00:02:57.070> just

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
but in the meantime I felt I would just

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.130 
but in the meantime I felt I would just
get<00:02:57.400> some<00:02:58.330> fruit<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.780> picked<00:02:59.020> up<00:02:59.080> some

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
get some fruit so I picked up some

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.580 
get some fruit so I picked up some
pineapple<00:02:59.740> and<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.390> think<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.170> good<00:03:02.410> to

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
pineapple and and so I think is good to

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.820 
pineapple and and so I think is good to
test<00:03:02.800> yourself<00:03:02.950> sometimes<00:03:03.520> like<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.830> came

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
will be up tomorrow which is probably a

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.480 
will be up tomorrow which is probably a
more<00:06:21.230> manageable<00:06:21.440> way<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:21.890> do<00:06:22.100> it<00:06:22.220> anyway

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
more manageable way to do it anyway

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.860 
more manageable way to do it anyway
because<00:06:22.610> it<00:06:22.850> gives<00:06:22.910> me<00:06:23.150> time<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:23.360> just<00:06:23.660> write

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870

because it gives me time to just write
it<00:06:24.050> off<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:24.380> stuff<00:06:24.590> rather<00:06:25.160> than<00:06:25.280> doing<00:06:25.550> it

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
it off and stuff rather than doing it

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.780 
it off and stuff rather than doing it
