00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.360
 on the bottom buttons 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.790
 classic touchs of android in this 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.750
 side is the power button 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.190

 headphones and the microusb connection and in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.710
 this other side we have control of 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.980
 volume and a very interesting button 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.380
 dedicated to the camera 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.780
 in the back if we remove the lid 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.630
 we have access to the 2100 battery 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.380
 milliamps and also to the cards 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.790
 sim 2 since it is dual sim and slot 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.790
 for micro sd cards 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.020
 in the back we also have a 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.460
 led flash and right next to the 8 camera 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.770
 megapixels 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.290
 and you caught me trying the mode of 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.030
 Beauty of the 5h aquarium interface 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.700
 but come I'll show you what else 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.530
 functions has for that I have brought to 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.170
 a lot of friends sure to the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.060
 most of you know you are going to leave 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.800
 do a lot of pictures with all these 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.050
 modes that is the beauty that was 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.690
 using that afterwards so that we leave 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.980
 a little bit more beautiful in this part of 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.780
 right in this menu we have 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.340
 different options as choosing the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.750
 better picture we have the detection of 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.670
 Smiles for everyone to leave 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.870
 smiling in this case I think we 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.880
 it's going to be necessary because everyone is 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.100
 sea ​​of ​​happy to leave we have 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.410
 also a scene selection mode 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.930
 Automatic image capture of 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.270
 different angles we also have photo 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.960
 panoramic hdr 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.210
 and normal photo if we go to configuration 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.370
 we can for example geo-tag 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.100
 our images that this is 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.960
 especially useful if we travel a lot 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:28.230
 we also have the compensation of 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.240
 exhibition that we can modify to 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.090
 make our images come out more 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.730
 clear or darker 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.730
 we have also color effects we are going to 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.819
 try for example the water effect and how 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.450
 you see all our friends come out in 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.370
 blue 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.129
 but good as we do not want them to come out 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.989
 all all all blue 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.970
 I'll leave it in none and I'll show you more 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.440
 modes like this scene mode that we 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.900
 will serve if we are in a condition 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.670
 where we need lighting 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.209
 special or a special capture by 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.940
 example when we are on the beach in the 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.519
 beach in a lot of sun and if we put this 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.140
 mode the camera will make the adjustments 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.700
 necessary so that the photo does not come out 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.970
 perfect 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.130
 we also have white balances 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.790
 depending on the lighting that 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.650
 let's have and another kind of functions in 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.470
 this part of here we have functions of 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.930
 camera and it is especially useful the 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.610
 timer for some captures and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.950
 also the fact that we can 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.280
 modify the continuous shooting can be 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.620
 40 shots or 99 shots I will do the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.040
 try now I have it in 40 shots 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.040
 followed 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.770
 efe 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.389
 and so up to 40 photos could be 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.800
 doing for the moment done 1919 go 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.409
 served the dolls 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.319
 more things that we have for example 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:05.430
 we can modify the iso and there is one thing 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:07.949
 super interesting in video mode and 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.800
 is that we can modify the range of 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.080
 time this is more commonly known 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.629
 as timelapse is to say the power 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.039
 make a series of images every 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.310
 for example, we could 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.500
 select a second or two seconds 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.949
 up to 10 seconds with which all those 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.650
 images together would give a feeling of 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:32.580
 time movement is to say a video 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.080
 where the images are happening in 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.550
 these images is now moving to 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.440
 dori to give a video effect 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.440
 accelerated is timelapse 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.870
 You can improve your photos by selecting 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.669
 directly on the screen the point that 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.889
 you want it to come out focused and better 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.919
 exposed from the entire frame in this 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.980
 case I want it to go well focused and 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.600
 perfectly exposed the 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.650
 baby turtle 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.440
 others 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.150
 they go out a bit unfocused because the 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.009
 point of attention is directly in 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.060
 the turtle if I want the point of 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.060
 attention be on the mushroom 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.250
 what I have to do is focus on the 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.680
 mushroom the turtle although it is in first 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.900
 plane is going to come out a little out of focus 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.479
 when you remove the back cover of the 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.180
 5 hd aquarium we saw that it had two slots 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.909
 for two sim cards these cards 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.680
 can be from any operator can 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:30.419
 be of the same can be of different 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.699
 it may be that it offers you the best 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:34.439
 rate or whatever you want this is 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.569
 especially practical if you have two 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:38.759
 phone numbers one personal and another 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.900
 you can manage both 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:44.969
 cards entering settings 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.190
 administration of the sim card and here 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:49.560
 you have the way to manage the 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.349
 voice calls to make them 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.699
 from one card from another or that the 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.680
 smartphone asks you every time 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:59.129
 go make a call too 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.080
 you can modify the messages 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.250
 incoming video calls and also the 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.710
 data connection 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.750
 all this customizable so you can 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.120
 save some eurillos inside the 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.479
 five hd available as a non-system 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.729
 operative android in its version 4.2 that 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.449
 goes on a quad-core cortex processor 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.999
 to 7 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:20.400
 to 12 gigahertz and its capacity to 

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:23.129
 storage is 16 gb that you can 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.889
 expand with microsd cards that already 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:30.210
 we saw the expansion slot before 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:31.939
 It also has bluetooth wi-fi gps and 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.740
 also has cellular connectivity 

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:38.520
 3g plus if you want to know the content 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.900
 of the box of the bq aquariums 5 hd and by 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.180
 course start using it from 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.330
 minute number one do not stop seeing the 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:49.339
