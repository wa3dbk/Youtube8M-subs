00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 I'm going to tell you something that has to do with 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.120
 the family I had in Pinamar de 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.950
 vacation and I had the opportunity to 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.650
 live with people who are with 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.330
 ATVs and trucks 4x4 of the 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.920
 vetoes I do not have to say anything and about 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.930
 all the beaches that are spectacular 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.070
 the beaches accessed by Melina 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.649
 with 4x4 trucks that are fantastic 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.390
 a great curious postcard that has the 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.460
 Argentine coast especially in the part 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.110
 from pinamar what I did not find was 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.099
 still a lot of security the subject 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.649
 ATVs 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.719
 follow the quadricycle theme being one 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.270
 issue that has to be taken with greater 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.070
 seriousness if there is a regulation to 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.949
 respect there have been hits has seen 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.190
 guys guys driving ATVs and 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.429
 guys and great without casting that all 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.399
 this is prologue to an accident that occurred 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.960
 someone who ran over a clear photographer 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.749
 in the competition on the coast in 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.140
 necochea was just disputing 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.050
 a light 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.840
 an organized race let's say and there was 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.360
 a photographer say some poorly located 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.470
 also and a quadricycle that spilled 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.060
 I wrongly located for me badly located 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.310
 what registered the accident and what is 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.580
 remarkably well located because it's 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.680
 away from a perimeter that was placed in 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.150
 that curve with pennants the man is 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.540
 the rugged photographer who has 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.909
 triple fracture of tibia and fibula look 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.909
 to see the accident is impressive 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.799
 What else will be injured is who is 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.340
 the white riverbank is the only one that is 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.140
 there forward of in the flags 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.520
 because the cameraman who is 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.520
 taking these pictures is further back 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.790
 the next 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.960
 let's say it is badly located 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.110
 good 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.860
 the truth that he took it cheap is no no 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.860
 Thank God 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:14.709
 says he saw the black smoke a stain 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.709
 black that was the sand 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.970
 also the rapa quadricycle in the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.400
 curve but he is badly located 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.260
 I do not know to see coming in four I do not know 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.690
 what other than wrong maneuver here 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.760
 I say the other thing that wrong maneuver and 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.099
 your driver of the cuatri I do not see 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.750
 falls as in the curve follows us but 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.849
 previously marked but is predictable 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.049
 are four cycles for a very high 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.700
 speed on a terrain that is sandy 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.760
 as well say look at those who are 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.760
 watching and the cameraman who takes these 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.040
 images are much further back approximate 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.400
 five to ten meters further back by 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.010
 something are further logical this happened 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.790
 in the competition that calls challenge of 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.159
 the coast in Necochea and this man this one 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.940
 He suffered triple fracture of the tibia and fibula 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.859
 of the left leg is very sore 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.489
 and he is waiting for a 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:14.060
 more specific pathology to spoke 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.060
 spoke with Eduardo 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:23.549
 when you gain ground because it was a 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.519
 banked curve yes but how is a place 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.510
 of very volatile sands with the first 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.060
 Barrette 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.189
 by default release is still 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.290
 collapsed on the wall 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:42.079
 then I imagined there could be a 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.079
 danger and I was running and nothing else 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.650
 and well that was attended to in the hospital 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.600
 of emergency that led the province 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.370
 Buenos Aires, very painful 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.550
 taking off that the elements follow 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.100
 technicians in what way he tells us that 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.960
 possibly tomorrow will be here and I 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.510
 they would be operating on Thursday I have triple 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.510
 fibula fracture 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.640
 sorry with regimen comes to see if vomit 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.520
 another thing he sees him going out alone but for 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.410
 no and if it's going to be the same why not 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.250
 he felt that some danger was running 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:25.090
 I was retiring he did not understand but maybe 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.090
 he believed but in the images it is good
