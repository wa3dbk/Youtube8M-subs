this<00:00:06.560> is<00:00:06.800> the<00:00:07.010> program<00:00:07.900> explanation<00:00:08.900> for<00:00:09.260> the

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
this is the program explanation for the

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.820 
this is the program explanation for the
center<00:00:10.610> of<00:00:10.730> gravity<00:00:12.010> calculation<00:00:14.530> the<00:00:15.530> center

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
center of gravity calculation the center

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.760 
center of gravity calculation the center
of<00:00:15.950> gravity<00:00:16.430> basically<00:00:17.119> is<00:00:17.450> saying<00:00:18.050> where<00:00:18.439> is

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
of gravity basically is saying where is

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.650 
of gravity basically is saying where is
the<00:00:19.130> center<00:00:19.910> of<00:00:20.200> action<00:00:21.200> for<00:00:21.829> the<00:00:22.300> mass<00:00:23.300> or

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
the center of action for the mass or

wants me to change my picture basically
what's<00:00:31.310> going<00:00:31.579> on<00:00:31.730> here<00:00:31.970> notice<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:32.239> center

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
what's going on here notice the center

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.569 
what's going on here notice the center
of<00:00:32.750> action<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.260> go-kart<00:00:33.739> is<00:00:33.890> going<00:00:34.190> up<00:00:34.309> and

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
of action of the go-kart is going up and

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.960 
of action of the go-kart is going up and
down<00:00:34.820> through<00:00:35.630> this<00:00:35.870> general<00:00:36.320> area<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.070> what

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
down through this general area and what

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.600 
down through this general area and what
we're<00:00:38.150> trying<00:00:38.270> to<00:00:38.450> determine<00:00:38.810> is<00:00:39.230> when<00:00:40.190> we<00:00:40.400> put

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
we're trying to determine is when we put

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.950 
we're trying to determine is when we put
our<00:00:40.730> front<00:00:41.000> wheels<00:00:41.240> in<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:41.600> general

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
our front wheels in this general

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.050 
our front wheels in this general
location<00:00:42.140> here<00:00:42.800> what's<00:00:43.070> going<00:00:43.310> to<00:00:43.340> happen<00:00:43.790> to

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
location here what's going to happen to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.730 
location here what's going to happen to
the<00:00:44.240> go-kart<00:00:44.690> go<00:00:44.990> spinning<00:00:45.410> out<00:00:45.590> of<00:00:45.620> control

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
the go-kart go spinning out of control

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.070 
the go-kart go spinning out of control
or<00:00:46.370> what<00:00:46.720> so<00:00:47.720> the<00:00:48.170> idea<00:00:49.040> is<00:00:49.490> that<00:00:50.090> you<00:00:50.660> get<00:00:50.840> the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
or what so the idea is that you get the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.930 
or what so the idea is that you get the
weight<00:00:51.290> of<00:00:51.440> all<00:00:51.560> components<00:00:52.040> as<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:52.490> see<00:00:52.700> we

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
weight of all components as you see we

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.030 
weight of all components as you see we
have<00:00:53.060> an<00:00:53.210> engine<00:00:53.630> of<00:00:53.780> 40<00:00:54.080> pounds<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.560> person<00:00:54.950> of

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
have an engine of 40 pounds a person of

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.670 
have an engine of 40 pounds a person of
165<00:00:55.910> a<00:00:55.940> front<00:00:56.390> tire<00:00:56.630> and<00:00:56.900> so<00:00:57.020> forth<00:00:57.230> all<00:00:57.500> the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
165 a front tire and so forth all the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.270 
165 a front tire and so forth all the
weights<00:00:58.240> put<00:00:59.240> together<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.930> add<00:01:00.320> it<00:01:00.500> up<00:01:00.650> we

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
weights put together and add it up we

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.220 
weights put together and add it up we
also<00:01:01.490> have<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.940> weights<00:01:02.150> of<00:01:02.300> every<00:01:02.840> component

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
also have the weights of every component

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.530 
also have the weights of every component
of<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.650> go-kart<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.489> tubes<00:01:04.759> for<00:01:04.970> instance<00:01:05.449> I

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
about the go-kart has been taken into

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.419 
about the go-kart has been taken into
account<00:01:13.670> from<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.179> weight<00:01:14.390> standpoint<00:01:14.780> and<00:01:15.679> the

account from a weight standpoint and the
total<00:01:16.759> weight<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:16.999> go-kart<00:01:17.509> here<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:17.960> 375

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
total weight of the go-kart here is 375

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.459 
total weight of the go-kart here is 375
pounds<00:01:19.579> that<00:01:19.909> does<00:01:20.090> include<00:01:20.389> the<00:01:20.569> weight<00:01:21.289> of<00:01:21.380> a

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
pounds that does include the weight of a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.109 
pounds that does include the weight of a
person<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.920> actual<00:01:22.189> weight<00:01:22.369> of<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.639> frame<00:01:22.939> is

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
person the actual weight of the frame is

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.459 
person the actual weight of the frame is
210<00:01:23.719> pounds<00:01:24.139> so<00:01:25.630> from<00:01:26.630> there<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:27.259> actually

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
210 pounds so from there to actually

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.980 
210 pounds so from there to actually
calculate<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.520> center<00:01:28.789> of<00:01:28.880> gravity<00:01:29.030> we're

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
calculate the center of gravity we're

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.559 
calculate the center of gravity we're
using<00:01:30.340> this<00:01:31.340> rear<00:01:32.240> wheel<00:01:32.539> as<00:01:32.869> our<00:01:33.170> moment<00:01:33.829> of

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
using this rear wheel as our moment of

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.179 
using this rear wheel as our moment of
action<00:01:35.569> or<00:01:35.810> our<00:01:36.109> moment<00:01:36.619> we're<00:01:36.799> going<00:01:36.889> to<00:01:36.950> sum

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
action or our moment we're going to sum

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.370 
action or our moment we're going to sum
all<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.789> data<00:01:38.689> around<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.619> rear<00:01:39.829> wheels<00:01:40.240> and

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
all the data around the rear wheels and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.620 
all the data around the rear wheels and
that<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:43.249> call<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:43.579> summing<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.060> moments<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
that we call it summing the moments and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.160 
that we call it summing the moments and
so<00:01:45.259> if<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.499> see<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:46.009> have<00:01:46.340> distances<00:01:47.209> clocked

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
so if you see I have distances clocked

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.590 
so if you see I have distances clocked
out<00:01:48.380> for<00:01:48.709> each<00:01:48.920> one<00:01:49.219> of<00:01:49.340> these<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.789> these

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
out for each one of these and these

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.039 
out for each one of these and these
particular<00:01:52.299> dimensions<00:01:53.299> shown<00:01:53.569> right<00:01:53.810> here

particular dimensions shown right here

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.160 
particular dimensions shown right here
are<00:01:54.170> actually<00:01:54.740> for<00:01:55.270> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
are actually for the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.130 
are actually for the
the<00:01:59.170> tubes<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.770> each<00:02:00.460> component<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.270> if<00:02:02.020> you

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
the tubes and each component and if you

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.720 
the tubes and each component and if you
take<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.440> close<00:02:02.770> look<00:02:03.040> at<00:02:03.220> this<00:02:03.370> spreadsheet

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
take a close look at this spreadsheet

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.060 
take a close look at this spreadsheet
you'd<00:02:04.150> see<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.510> each<00:02:04.660> component<00:02:04.930> has<00:02:05.470> a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
you'd see that each component has a

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.280 
you'd see that each component has a
position<00:02:06.280> for<00:02:07.000> instance<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.420> one<00:02:07.630> says<00:02:07.840> 60

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
position for instance this one says 60

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.020 
position for instance this one says 60
inches<00:02:08.619> that's<00:02:08.830> tube<00:02:09.130> number<00:02:09.340> one<00:02:09.670> which<00:02:09.850> is

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
inches that's tube number one which is

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.930 
inches that's tube number one which is
way<00:02:10.210> out<00:02:10.390> here<00:02:10.680> this<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.890> 60<00:02:12.250> inches<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.760> can't

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
way out here this is 60 inches you can't

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.850 
way out here this is 60 inches you can't
really<00:02:13.150> see<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:13.600> that's<00:02:13.720> what<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.140> so

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
really see it but that's what it is so

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.950 
really see it but that's what it is so
it's<00:02:15.070> 60<00:02:15.430> inches<00:02:15.790> from<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.330> rear<00:02:16.570> wheels

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
it's 60 inches from the rear wheels

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.670 
it's 60 inches from the rear wheels
right<00:02:17.560> here<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.720> sum<00:02:19.990> them<00:02:20.170> all<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.560> as

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
right here so you sum them all and as

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.380 
right here so you sum them all and as
you<00:02:20.860> see<00:02:21.040> there's<00:02:21.250> actually<00:02:21.730> some<00:02:21.940> negatives

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
you see there's actually some negatives

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.960 
you see there's actually some negatives
and<00:02:22.570> some<00:02:22.780> positives<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:24.160> negatives<00:02:24.700> are<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and some positives the negatives are the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.400 
and some positives the negatives are the
ones<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.330> are<00:02:25.420> behind<00:02:25.600> is<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.170> wheels

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
ones that are behind is the wheels

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.250 
ones that are behind is the wheels
everything<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.760> going<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:28.810> general

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
everything that is going in this general

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.350 
everything that is going in this general
direction<00:02:29.340> right-hand-rule<00:02:30.340> going<00:02:31.000> this

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
direction right-hand-rule going this

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.880 
direction right-hand-rule going this
direction<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.230> motion<00:02:33.070> of<00:02:33.160> this<00:02:33.250> mouse<00:02:33.520> is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
direction is the motion of this mouse is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.420 
direction is the motion of this mouse is
positive<00:02:35.890> anything<00:02:36.490> on<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.360> other<00:02:37.390> side<00:02:37.900> is

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
positive anything on the other side is

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.290 
positive anything on the other side is
negative<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.580> would<00:02:39.670> actually<00:02:39.820> have<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.180> go

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
negative it would actually have to go

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.420 
negative it would actually have to go
this<00:02:40.570> direction<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.680> weight<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.250> would<00:02:42.400> be

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
this direction the weight of it would be

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.260 
this direction the weight of it would be
pulling<00:02:42.880> this<00:02:43.030> direction<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.720> being<00:02:44.020> negative

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
pulling this direction so being negative

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.880 
pulling this direction so being negative
there's<00:02:46.270> very<00:02:46.780> limited<00:02:47.020> negatives<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.770> have

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
there's very limited negatives you have

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.770 
there's very limited negatives you have
the<00:02:47.980> muffler<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.490> all<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.240> tubes<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.660> are

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the muffler and all the tubes that are

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.500 
the muffler and all the tubes that are
behind<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.950> rear<00:02:51.190> wheel<00:02:51.459> this<00:02:51.880> stuff<00:02:52.240> back

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
behind the rear wheel this stuff back

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.160 
behind the rear wheel this stuff back
here<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:52.959> negative<00:02:53.470> signs<00:02:54.990> everything<00:02:55.990> else

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
here is negative signs everything else

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.080 
here is negative signs everything else
is<00:02:56.350> positive<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.190> add<00:02:57.400> them<00:02:57.610> all<00:02:57.820> together

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
is positive so you add them all together

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.530 
is positive so you add them all together
you<00:02:58.420> put<00:02:58.720> your<00:02:58.930> special<00:02:59.410> sign<00:02:59.650> on<00:02:59.890> there<00:03:00.130> which

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
you put your special sign on there which

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.449 
you put your special sign on there which
regulates<00:03:01.540> whether<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:02.739> being<00:03:02.950> added<00:03:03.220> or

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
regulates whether it's being added or

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.430 
regulates whether it's being added or
subtracted<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:04.510> then<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.989> add<00:03:05.170> all<00:03:05.200> the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
subtracted and then you add all the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.020 
subtracted and then you add all the
moments<00:03:05.650> together<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.760> sum<00:03:07.000> of

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
moments together and this is the sum of

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.690 
moments together and this is the sum of
the<00:03:07.180> moments<00:03:07.360> right<00:03:07.750> here<00:03:08.310> that's<00:03:09.310> all<00:03:09.459> fine

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
the moments right here that's all fine

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.699 
the moments right here that's all fine
and<00:03:09.760> dandy<00:03:09.970> what<00:03:10.600> it<00:03:10.690> comes<00:03:10.840> down<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.080> is<00:03:11.470> that

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
and dandy what it comes down to is that

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.770 
and dandy what it comes down to is that
this<00:03:12.190> will<00:03:12.430> calculate<00:03:12.640> how<00:03:13.150> much<00:03:13.300> weight<00:03:13.570> is

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
this will calculate how much weight is

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.690 
this will calculate how much weight is
over<00:03:13.930> your<00:03:14.200> front<00:03:14.380> wheels<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.040> over<00:03:15.519> your

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
over your front wheels and over your

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.390 
over your front wheels and over your
back<00:03:15.850> wheels<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.900> have<00:03:16.930> 185<00:03:17.800> pounds<00:03:18.220> over

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
back wheels you have 185 pounds over

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.580 
back wheels you have 185 pounds over
your<00:03:18.519> front<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.030> 190<00:03:19.780> over<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.080> rear<00:03:20.290> that's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
your front and 190 over the rear that's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.190 
your front and 190 over the rear that's
what<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.280> want<00:03:21.519> ideally<00:03:21.910> now<00:03:22.660> let's<00:03:22.900> say<00:03:23.050> we

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
what you want ideally now let's say we

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.490 
what you want ideally now let's say we
throw<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.440> 200<00:03:24.040> pound<00:03:24.190> person<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:24.820> there<00:03:25.030> and

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
throw a 200 pound person in there and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.170 
throw a 200 pound person in there and
run<00:03:26.500> calculate<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.370> see<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.970> we<00:03:28.060> have<00:03:28.150> a

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
run calculate you see that we have a

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.750 
run calculate you see that we have a
50/50<00:03:28.780> weight<00:03:29.200> distribution<00:03:29.709> it's<00:03:30.430> right<00:03:30.640> out

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
50/50 weight distribution it's right out

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.820 
50/50 weight distribution it's right out
of<00:03:30.880> money<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:32.080> get<00:03:32.230> somebody's<00:03:32.590> even

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
of money so you get somebody's even

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.820 
of money so you get somebody's even
heavier<00:03:33.220> like<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.489> 250<00:03:34.480> pound<00:03:34.660> person<00:03:35.200> what

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
heavier like a 250 pound person what

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.570 
heavier like a 250 pound person what
does<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.040> do<00:03:36.430> well<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.890> seems<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.280> have

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
does that do well and it seems to have

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.310 
does that do well and it seems to have
not<00:03:39.790> moved<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.299> very<00:03:40.480> much<00:03:40.720> let's<00:03:41.019> do<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.230> again

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
not moved it very much let's do it again

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.160 
not moved it very much let's do it again
let's<00:03:41.769> do<00:03:41.950> 300<00:03:42.730> pounds<00:03:43.660> and<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.480> starts<00:03:46.930> as

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
let's do 300 pounds and it it starts as

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.750 
let's do 300 pounds and it it starts as
you<00:03:47.290> can<00:03:47.470> see<00:03:47.680> starts<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.190> put<00:03:48.310> more<00:03:48.489> weight

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
you can see starts to put more weight

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.759 
you can see starts to put more weight
over<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.030> front<00:03:49.120> wheels<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:49.930> it's<00:03:50.560> pretty

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
over the front wheels so it's pretty

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.070 
over the front wheels so it's pretty
versatile<00:03:51.430> as<00:03:51.820> far<00:03:52.150> as<00:03:52.269> weight<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.690> concerned

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
versatile as far as weight is concerned

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.229 
versatile as far as weight is concerned
you<00:03:53.230> can<00:03:53.260> have<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.590> 150<00:03:54.160> pound<00:03:54.610> person<00:03:54.910> in

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
you can have like 150 pound person in

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.259 
you can have like 150 pound person in
there<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.709> it's<00:03:56.709> really<00:03:57.100> close<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.670> where<00:03:58.180> it

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
there and it's really close to where it

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.920 
there and it's really close to where it
should<00:03:58.299> be<00:03:58.750> as<00:03:58.959> far<00:03:59.830> as<00:03:59.890> weight<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.370> concerned

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
should be as far as weight is concerned

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.750 
should be as far as weight is concerned
this<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.170> explanation<00:04:02.590> for<00:04:03.010> let's<00:04:03.519> put<00:04:03.670> it

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
this is the explanation for let's put it

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.480 
this is the explanation for let's put it
back<00:04:03.930> 165<00:04:04.930> where<00:04:05.260> we<00:04:05.470> were

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490

back 165 where we were
this<00:04:07.490> is<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:07.760> explanation<00:04:08.060> of<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.510> program

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
this is the explanation of the program

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.420 
this is the explanation of the program
for<00:04:11.050> all<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.290> tubes<00:04:12.560> as<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:12.950> see<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.190> actually

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
for all the tubes as you see I actually

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.120 
for all the tubes as you see I actually
have<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:14.330> tubes<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.810> frame<00:04:15.130> numbered

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
have the tubes and the frame numbered

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:31.710 
have the tubes and the frame numbered
and<00:04:16.340> that's<00:04:17.060> how<00:04:17.209> I<00:04:17.239> used<00:04:18.170> it<00:04:18.380> in<00:04:18.560> this<00:04:18.770> program

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720
