will allow you use less chlorine so if

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.549 
will allow you use less chlorine so if
you're<00:00:39.390> sensitive<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.840> chlorine<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.469> a

you're sensitive to chlorine it's a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.290 
you're sensitive to chlorine it's a
great<00:00:40.739> way<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> keep<00:00:41.129> your<00:00:41.250> cool<00:00:41.399> sanitize<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
great way to keep your cool sanitize and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
great way to keep your cool sanitize and
keep<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> cloning<00:00:42.750> love<00:00:42.899> although<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.290> your

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
keep the cloning love although in your
