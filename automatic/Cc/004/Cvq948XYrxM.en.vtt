00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
talking about human connection which is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.380 
talking about human connection which is
one<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> major<00:00:22.800> themes<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.670> show<00:00:23.880> now

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
one of the major themes of the show now

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.300 
one of the major themes of the show now
this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.689> interesting<00:00:24.930> because<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.830> theme

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
this is interesting because this theme

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.000 
this is interesting because this theme
is<00:00:26.490> not<00:00:26.640> revealed<00:00:27.240> until<00:00:27.480> episode<00:00:28.109> 11<00:00:28.800> or

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
is not revealed until episode 11 or

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.640 
is not revealed until episode 11 or
layer<00:00:29.250> 11<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.789> pornography<00:00:30.199> up<00:00:31.199> until<00:00:31.500> that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
layer 11 in pornography up until that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.490 
layer 11 in pornography up until that
point<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.340> seems<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.899> theme<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
point it seems like the theme of the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.979 
point it seems like the theme of the
series<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.090> real<00:00:36.360> world<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
series is that the real world and the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.330 
series is that the real world and the
wired<00:00:37.230> are<00:00:37.559> basically<00:00:37.800> two<00:00:37.920> sides<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
wired are basically two sides of the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.729 
wired are basically two sides of the
same<00:00:38.489> coin<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> physical<00:00:39.989> world<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
same coin that the physical world is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.840 
same coin that the physical world is
basically<00:00:41.239> unimportant<00:00:42.239> compared<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
basically unimportant compared to the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.360 
basically unimportant compared to the
