00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
the camp that it might go wrong

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.300 
the camp that it might go wrong
well<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.080> think<00:03:19.200> it's<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.710> a<00:03:19.860> massive

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
well I think it's it's a massive

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.830 
well I think it's it's a massive
occasion<00:03:21.060> if<00:03:21.210> they've<00:03:21.360> done<00:03:21.420> anything

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
occasion if they've done anything

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.870 
occasion if they've done anything
they've<00:03:22.170> really<00:03:22.470> made<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.860> pressures<00:03:23.310> even

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
they've really made the pressures even

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.730 
they've really made the pressures even
more<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:24.630> he<00:03:24.810> could<00:03:24.990> have<00:03:25.110> come<00:03:25.290> back<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> lot

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
more so he could have come back a lot

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.890 
more so he could have come back a lot
quieter<00:03:26.100> than<00:03:26.490> in<00:03:26.820> his<00:03:26.940> home<00:03:27.210> city<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.660> front

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
quieter than in his home city in front

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.200 
quieter than in his home city in front
of<00:03:28.040> 55,000<00:03:29.040> people<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:29.700> they<00:03:29.880> put<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
of 55,000 people so they put the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.700 
of 55,000 people so they put the
pressure<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.720> think<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.470> know<00:03:31.530> they're

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
pressure on I think you know they're

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.650 
pressure on I think you know they're
probably<00:03:31.890> confident<00:03:32.580> they<00:03:32.670> can<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.210> but

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
probably confident they can do it but

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.600 
probably confident they can do it but
it's<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.500> tough<00:03:34.770> fight<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.130> can't<00:03:35.400> get<00:03:35.580> over

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
it's a tough fight you can't get over

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.310 
it's a tough fight you can't get over
