00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
because I weighed out of it this is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.290 
because I weighed out of it this is
usually<00:00:30.840> great<00:00:31.410> more<00:00:31.850> mostly<00:00:32.850> all<00:00:33.030> weight

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
usually great more mostly all weight

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
usually great more mostly all weight

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
up to pop out a little bit next you

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.210 
up to pop out a little bit next you
notice<00:01:59.510> these<00:01:59.690> are<00:01:59.900> very<00:02:00.110> very<00:02:00.200> curved<00:02:00.800> so<00:02:01.130> you

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
notice these are very very curved so you

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.070 
notice these are very very curved so you
want<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.490> turn<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.790> upside<00:02:02.210> down<00:02:02.240> this<00:02:02.720> way<00:02:02.960> so

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
want to turn it upside down this way so
