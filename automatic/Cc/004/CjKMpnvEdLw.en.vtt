really good basis and just have a look

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.769 
really good basis and just have a look
at<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.519> base<00:00:26.730> here<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> lot<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> this

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
at this base here you see a lot of this

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.769 
at this base here you see a lot of this
now<00:00:27.960> where<00:00:28.230> people<00:00:29.189> are<00:00:29.310> running<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.880> bit<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
now where people are running a bit of a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.479 
now where people are running a bit of a
triangle<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> center<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.070> two

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
triangle in the center we have two

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
triangle in the center we have two
infernos<00:00:33.059> kind<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> one<00:00:33.930> side<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
infernos kind of to one side of the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.170 
infernos kind of to one side of the
Queen<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.739> center<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.430> base<00:00:35.700> doesn't<00:00:35.910> do

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
Queen in the center this base doesn't do

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.600 
Queen in the center this base doesn't do
that<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.570> much<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.890> infants<00:00:38.309> were<00:00:38.370> more

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
that as much if the infants were more

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.869 
that as much if the infants were more
over<00:00:39.030> then<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:40.410> maybe<00:00:40.680> would<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.730> much

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
over then then maybe would be much

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
over then then maybe would be much
harder<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.329> get<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> Queen<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.290> an

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
harder they get the Queen and an

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
harder they get the Queen and an
infinite<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> quote<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.329> inferno

out of the Pharaohs wee bit further over

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.340 
out of the Pharaohs wee bit further over
it<00:00:53.340> might<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> much<00:00:54.059> tougher<00:00:54.270> base<00:00:54.570> anyway

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it might be a much tougher base anyway

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.529 
it might be a much tougher base anyway
our<00:00:55.530> let's<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> now<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.430> attack<00:00:56.760> I'm

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
but it's spectacular and it will

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.370 
but it's spectacular and it will
certainly<00:01:08.159> change<00:01:08.490> my<00:01:08.760> rating<00:01:08.939> combo<00:01:09.510> from

the way this worked out some great and
make<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> probably<00:01:14.130> should<00:01:14.310> use<00:01:14.460> some<00:01:14.640> hugs

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
really have much of a cracker so doctors

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.530

to<00:01:30.750> goblins<00:01:31.400> let's<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.670> CC<00:01:33.090> come<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.420> we're

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
to goblins let's the CC come in we're

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.560 
to goblins let's the CC come in we're
seeing<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.960> mixed<00:01:34.770> CCS<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:36.270> I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
seeing a lot of mixed CCS now I think I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230 
seeing a lot of mixed CCS now I think I
like<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.140> series<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.880> if

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
like this series because I think that if

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
like this series because I think that if
you<00:01:39.360> actually<00:01:39.509> did<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.869> lower<00:01:40.140> they're<00:01:40.439> quite

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
you actually did a lower they're quite

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.359 
you actually did a lower they're quite
painful<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:42.380> know<00:01:43.380> around<00:01:43.710> cool<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.250> you're

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
painful to know around cool so you're

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.850 
painful to know around cool so you're
seeing<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.700> lot<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> people<00:01:45.270> draw<00:01:45.600> them<00:01:45.860> zap

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
seeing a lot of people draw them zap

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.380 
seeing a lot of people draw them zap
them<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.549> they're<00:01:47.729> mixed<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> don't

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
them but because they're mixed you don't

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.120 
them but because they're mixed you don't
get<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> minions<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.350> any<00:01:49.590> Wizards<00:01:49.950> day

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
to do that on this attack and probably

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.900 
to do that on this attack and probably
would<00:02:36.990> have<00:02:37.050> been<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> safer<00:02:37.650> raid<00:02:37.860> with<00:02:38.580> some

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
would have been a safer raid with some

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.970 
would have been a safer raid with some
local<00:02:39.390> insurance<00:02:39.570> hogs<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.380> take<00:02:40.560> down<00:02:40.770> their

local insurance hogs to take down their

local insurance hogs to take down their
defense<00:02:41.520> maybe<00:02:42.150> young<00:02:42.450> three<00:02:42.870> hooks<00:02:43.080> or

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
defense maybe young three hooks or

something there's a risk of a spring

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.790 
something there's a risk of a spring
trap<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.910> might<00:02:45.090> drop<00:02:45.210> by<00:02:46.020> drop<00:02:46.410> four

two just in case there's a spring there
okay<00:02:52.860> let's<00:02:53.100> see<00:02:53.310> I'm<00:02:53.430> going<00:02:53.460> around<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.150> base

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
okay let's see I'm going around the base

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.020 
okay let's see I'm going around the base
so<00:02:54.570> you're<00:02:55.290> dropping<00:02:55.440> these<00:02:55.650> loons<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.940> as

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
so you're dropping these loons to as

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.400 
so you're dropping these loons to as
typical<00:02:57.420> sort<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.660> drop<00:02:57.840> dropping<00:02:58.170> them<00:02:58.290> in

typical sort of drop dropping them in

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.200 
typical sort of drop dropping them in
twos<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.890> threes<00:02:58.980> at<00:02:59.430> its<00:02:59.580> defense<00:02:59.940> around

the perimeter now i'm raging them in

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.960 
the perimeter now i'm raging them in
your<00:03:04.410> fists<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.980> inferior<00:03:05.340> before<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:05.790> and

activates of the balloons i like to sort

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.680 
activates of the balloons i like to sort
of<00:03:07.710> see<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:07.980> activate<00:03:08.490> just<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.820> little<00:03:09.120> without

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
of see it activate just a little without

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.540 
of see it activate just a little without
taking<00:03:10.020> down<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.320> balloons<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.430> know

taking down the balloons but you know

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.480 
taking down the balloons but you know
I'm<00:03:12.320> reasonable<00:03:13.320> timing<00:03:13.680> they're<00:03:13.860> taken<00:03:14.370> out

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
I'm reasonable timing they're taken out

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.490 
I'm reasonable timing they're taken out
the<00:03:14.790> inferno<00:03:15.450> without<00:03:15.750> impacting<00:03:16.170> them

balloons at all you can see dropping

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.150 
balloons at all you can see dropping
them<00:03:18.630> into<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.020> twos<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.740> second<00:03:20.010> half

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.260 
them into the twos in the second half
from<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.460> raid<00:03:21.290> they<00:03:22.290> will<00:03:22.500> end<00:03:23.490> appears<00:03:24.090> and

from is raid they will end appears and

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.970 
from is raid they will end appears and
most<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.630> base<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:25.020> way<00:03:25.170> but<00:03:25.740> all

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
most of the base that way but all

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.920 
most of the base that way but all
doesn't<00:03:26.220> go<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.460> plan<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:27.150> you'll<00:03:27.420> see<00:03:27.660> what

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
doesn't go to plan and you'll see what

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.150 
doesn't go to plan and you'll see what
happens<00:03:28.260> here<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:31.170> who's<00:03:31.320> got<00:03:31.530> two<00:03:31.860> balloons
