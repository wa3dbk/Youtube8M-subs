00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
you want to get a good back design with

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.179 
you want to get a good back design with
the<00:03:17.669> fan<00:03:17.909> you<00:03:18.870> got<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.049> fan<00:03:19.290> on<00:03:19.409> like<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.769> hold

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:20.189 
the fan you got a fan on like this hold

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:25.129 
the fan you got a fan on like this hold
on<00:03:20.250> let<00:03:20.579> me<00:03:20.609> cut<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.879> again<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:24.959> can<00:03:25.079> see

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
on let me cut it again so you can see

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.589 
on let me cut it again so you can see
all<00:03:25.469> the<00:03:25.669> lines<00:03:26.669> but<00:03:26.969> when<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.180> turn<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.449> this

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
all the lines but when you turn it this

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.740 
all the lines but when you turn it this
way<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:30.060> pips<00:03:30.359> are<00:03:30.540> pretty<00:03:30.750> much<00:03:30.930> cut<00:03:31.199> in<00:03:31.319> half

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
way the pips are pretty much cut in half

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.789 
way the pips are pretty much cut in half
so<00:03:33.750> if<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.900> want<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.109> see<00:03:34.230> more<00:03:34.439> of<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.560> pips

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
so if you want to see more of the pips

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.490 
so if you want to see more of the pips
you<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.129> got<00:03:35.280> to<00:03:35.400> turn<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.760> other<00:03:35.790> way

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
you just got to turn it the other way

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.500 
you just got to turn it the other way
and<00:03:37.500> then<00:03:38.040> fan<00:03:38.310> it

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.680 

and<00:03:45.020> you<00:03:45.140> see<00:03:45.290> more<00:03:45.500> pips<00:03:46.420> but<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.540> back

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
and you see more pips but the back

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.089 
and you see more pips but the back
design<00:03:47.900> isn't<00:03:48.260> really<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.560> good<00:03:48.709> because

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
design isn't really that good because

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.470 
design isn't really that good because
it's<00:03:49.250> mostly<00:03:49.489> white<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:49.760> only<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.150> little<00:03:50.330> bit

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
it's mostly white and only a little bit

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.650 
it's mostly white and only a little bit
of<00:03:50.510> blue<00:03:50.750> comes<00:03:51.019> up<00:03:55.239> but<00:03:56.239> other<00:03:56.420> than<00:03:56.540> that

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
of blue comes up but other than that

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.330 
of blue comes up but other than that
they<00:03:56.900> handle<00:03:57.200> pretty<00:03:57.349> good<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:58.340> table<00:03:58.700> spread

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
they handle pretty good the table spread

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.620 
they handle pretty good the table spread
like<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.370> normal<00:04:01.700> bicycle<00:04:01.819> deck<00:04:04.480> feels<00:04:05.480> like

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
like a normal bicycle deck feels like

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.270 
like a normal bicycle deck feels like
they're<00:04:05.780> printed<00:04:06.140> on<00:04:06.200> bicycle<00:04:06.650> stock<00:04:06.890> because

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
they're printed on bicycle stock because

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.890 
they're printed on bicycle stock because
it<00:04:07.400> dribbles<00:04:08.560> really<00:04:09.560> really<00:04:09.769> good<00:04:09.980> they<00:04:10.900> have

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
it dribbles really really good they have

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:21.080

that<00:04:12.019> slide<00:04:12.349> around<00:04:12.470> feel

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.480 

so<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.720> don't<00:04:21.930> know<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.139> get<00:04:22.470> this<00:04:22.650> deck<00:04:22.919> let's
