00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150
 10 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.670
 the farc linking the sun the end 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.789
 can be put in several ways but the main one is using the tool 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.560
 of articulate center a joosub articulation tool that has drawn 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.949
 a round with a sentence 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.739
 when we use this tool curiously no menu appears 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:29.189
 new between the menus your second ones that are of use of the plot the menus 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.590
 when we activate other tools in this case none of them appears 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.250
 the way to put the joints 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.710
 is varied we can do it in the traditional way the simplest iif and I 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.910
 loose that would consist of a click 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.210
 about the note and select the joint that we would like to take 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.680
 or double click on it the joint which button select either of the two 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.400
 areas 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.840
 correct 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.670
 when we put the joint in the symbol we see a small 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.829
 selection square what can be activated 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.560
 ok not be this case is not activated when it is activated has a 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.730
 color like fuchsia or pink 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.780
 for me percent thanks to that little square of selection 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.890
 we can move the joint where we want right left 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.300
 up down ok we can 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300
 avoid showing educated pou 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.390
 delete if we want 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.100
 in this case the hoyada borja 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 let's look at the joint window a bit 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.880
 good the temple of selling joints we have 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.670
 up to 50 article 57 different articulations but we could even create 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.160
 many more 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 as a character as a symbol 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.310
 but as a character or as 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.810
 Shaped figures 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.229
 we could believe all we would like even joints that 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.229
 there would be no years that we continue to invite could you expect 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.720
 between these 57 joints 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.800
 they are all numbered that number is an internet numbering that also 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.610
 that uses end I hope that the pronaa us in principle does not serve for great 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.419
 thing 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.469
 but on the right side of each of them 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.529
 soler that usually the letter appears 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.490
 or sometimes it appears 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.210
 a number like in this case on 26 in the 27 98 appear operations from 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.849
 the local 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.450
 those numbers ob letters and follow if they are going to be important when it comes to putting 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.569
 the joints 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.969
 those numbers or letters are the keyboard shortcuts that will facilitate us 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.479
 very much work 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:46.389
 As we have seen before the simple way was to click select the 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.439
 articulation and then 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.329
 efe would be activated another quick way to put it is 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.180
 make an aria of selection of all the notes where we want to put 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.749
 joints suppose 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.739
 that I in these two measures 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.299
 I want everything to be chopped or this breed is enough to make an area of 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.999
 selection 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.929
 and when a selection olaría appears 

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:11.779
 the window to apply articulation in this sale could not select the 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.939
 articulation that wants in this case the chopped 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.849
 it costs 14 years to be elected and what I saw 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.730
 i automatically already have the article close the joints put 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.790
 I can move these joints from the selection area if I 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.159
 in forgiveness from the house of selection followed an aria of 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.069
 selection and cured of their joints we can see all in group 'yes I want' 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.929
 oo delete all of them in group 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.929
 also with the key 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.599
 I'm going to eliminate all 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:49.869
 the selection was his cousin 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:53.969
 now we're going to adopt new joints using 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.199
 the keyboard shortcuts that really 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.739
 is when the finale 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.439
 per cent becomes a quick tool good first let's look at 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.019
 what keyboard shortcuts can we use 

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:10.429
 for example for him this tasting highlights all chopped has 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.129
 as keyboard shortcut the sd 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.279
 the accent or for example has the 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.279
 i the pilot has 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.240
 the normally when you're going to make a score that has a lot of kind of 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.550
 joints what you usually do is come but usually do is come to this 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.610
 window 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.050
 make a small tablet on a paper 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.039
 with the symbols that you will need and you went from keyboard and visible cinemas 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.620
 next to the amb the monitor to 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.800
 can work in this case as there are only three the simple to remember 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.849
 this kato settled i samantha or cancer 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.490
 so 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.789
 If I wanted to chop your stake to all, just press the sy key 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:52.830
 very important 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.270
 holding the key is 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.580
 do not let go of the key is the porcine of the computer mace once the key 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.740
 is this arm wrestling 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.379
 adn we click 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.069
 on 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.930
 the efe 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.930
 the notes that we want them to carry 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:13.789
 if we press the side for accents let's suppose that I think I put accents 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.939
 we keep the sada and not to let go 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.889
 i click on those notes that we want to bring to the center 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.820
 and for the pilot whales, I give the s 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.490
 and all put 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.490
 with calderón in the notes 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.860
 as you have seen percent this one pressing the notes been keeping the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.250
 so the keys 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.659
 and I was clicking note by note 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.289
 it can be done like this 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:44.039
 but a dark fast mom 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:44.979
 until today 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.999
 giving it to undo a faster way 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:52.439
 d put the joints when especially we have the same articulation in 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.180
 several notes 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.500
 make a selection aria the ccoo mouse we have done before but this case 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.150
 keeping the key pressed for example 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.669
 if I want these two measures to be 14 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.979
 he pressed the key that not the loose 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.889
 i would pay for selection covering 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.429
 the notes that will arrive in this letter and automatically to the computer - p 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:19.830
 for the articulations at 100 for exactly the same accents struck the 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.889
 to a selection area of ​​the notes that I want you to use 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.990
 it automatically puts it 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.949
 and vertically exactly the same if I wanted 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:33.539
 that the pilot will take these notes could select these notes 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.159
 if I put one more like this for example one could remove it 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.960
 that's the fastest way to put 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.880
 joints
