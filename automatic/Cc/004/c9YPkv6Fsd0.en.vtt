00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.330
 over the river in this way 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.680
 Y 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.380
 it's uniform I have an hour if the leg 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.680
 of order through three months in the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.470
 bayern or not 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.040
 and there you could call a person 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.040
 on the other hand 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.309
 that's why yes we are how many but when 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.309
 I have an answer there will be seed 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.520
 they closed 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.280
 they decide who gets to ride who else 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.280
 this is not going for worlds 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.909
 permanent this is not so that you have the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.439
 flight 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:34.640
 we want you to have this machine 7 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.640
 having the first 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.310
 ones that calls with the right one to 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.540
 each 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.540
 there yes no 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.670
 if I share you 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.390
 all right 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.350
 marin to ask me percent 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.470
 being in a barcelona more 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.850
 I would love to 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.850
 who did not doubt that he alone 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.130
 growth in response to each other but 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.130
 I think I understand this criterion 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.760
 it was also voluntary and state 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.599
 but for more 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.599
 sometimes 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.430
 I 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.579
 it would be beforehand and that's why 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.580
 another 6 more 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.500
 amazing also not before ticket in 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.890
 no part says subject to disposition 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.890
 chair 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.060
 the question is not such 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.060
 so 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.079
 in 15 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.010
 He has a job that is very difficult 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.049
 lose it 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.360
 not everything as it has been the expense that one 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.079
 makes the whole investment and compensation 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.079
 it's a ticket 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.560
 luck 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.470
