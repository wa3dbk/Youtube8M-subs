pretty<00:01:03.090> much<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.480> mass<00:01:03.690> causes<00:01:04.080> his<00:01:04.229> helmet

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
is a must-have sense of course Darth

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.930 
is a must-have sense of course Darth
Vader<00:04:56.310> um<00:04:57.980> see<00:04:58.980> ya<00:04:59.070> there<00:04:59.250> is<00:04:59.340> two<00:04:59.490> versions<00:04:59.850> of

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
Vader um see ya there is two versions of

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.610 
Vader um see ya there is two versions of
this<00:05:00.060> figure<00:05:00.420> where<00:05:00.810> it's<00:05:00.900> this<00:05:01.020> one<00:05:01.230> which<00:05:01.470> is

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
this figure where it's this one which is

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.930 
this figure where it's this one which is
the<00:05:01.800> first<00:05:01.950> one<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.190> came<00:05:02.370> out<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:02.580> think<00:05:02.760> this

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
the first one that came out I think this

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.690 
the first one that came out I think this
was<00:05:03.240> in<00:05:03.450> either<00:05:03.960> wave<00:05:04.290> 1<00:05:04.560> or<00:05:04.800> wave<00:05:04.980> to<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.580> was

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
was in either wave 1 or wave to it was

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.100 
was in either wave 1 or wave to it was
one<00:05:05.850> of<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:05.970> first<00:05:06.150> waves<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:06.750> know<00:05:06.810> that

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
one of the first waves that I know that

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.310 
one of the first waves that I know that
much<00:05:07.340> and<00:05:08.340> but<00:05:09.300> they<00:05:09.480> also<00:05:09.660> in<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.110> later

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
much and but they also in the later

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.620 
much and but they also in the later
waves<00:05:10.620> they<00:05:10.950> made<00:05:11.190> another<00:05:12.090> Darth<00:05:12.390> Vader

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
waves they made another Darth Vader

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.990 
waves they made another Darth Vader
which<00:05:12.960> is<00:05:13.140> I<00:05:13.350> think<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:14.160> exact<00:05:14.460> same<00:05:14.670> figure

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
which is I think the exact same figure

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.130 
which is I think the exact same figure
just<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.390> think<00:05:15.600> with<00:05:15.720> a<00:05:15.750> more<00:05:15.990> accurate

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
just I think with a more accurate

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.520 
just I think with a more accurate
lightsaber<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:18.170> instead<00:05:19.170> of<00:05:19.260> the<00:05:19.380> regular

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
lightsaber and instead of the regular

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.430 
lightsaber and instead of the regular
mask<00:05:19.950> he's<00:05:20.360> unmasked<00:05:21.360> I<00:05:21.510> guess<00:05:21.840> I<00:05:21.960> just<00:05:21.990> I

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
mask he's unmasked I guess I just I

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.970 
mask he's unmasked I guess I just I
should<00:05:22.680> say<00:05:22.830> um<00:05:23.810> so<00:05:24.810> yeah<00:05:25.050> is<00:05:25.230> just<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.650> Anakin

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
should say um so yeah is just the Anakin

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.950 
should say um so yeah is just the Anakin
Skywalker<00:05:26.400> face<00:05:26.700> instead<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.150> being<00:05:27.630> Darth

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
Skywalker face instead of being Darth

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.680 
Skywalker face instead of being Darth
Vader<00:05:28.170> if<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:28.410> know<00:05:28.500> what<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.650> mean<00:05:28.680> um<00:05:29.540> so<00:05:30.540> yeah

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
Vader if you know what I mean um so yeah

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.270 
Vader if you know what I mean um so yeah
this<00:05:30.870> one<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.080> a<00:05:31.230> little<00:05:31.530> bit<00:05:31.620> rarer<00:05:31.860> than<00:05:32.100> that

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280
