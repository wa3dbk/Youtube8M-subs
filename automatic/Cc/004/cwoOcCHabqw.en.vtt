00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
and I stopped to look around for a

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.620 
and I stopped to look around for a
second<00:01:30.410> when<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.160> do<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.670> see<00:01:32.030> what<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.270> see

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
second when I do and I see what I see

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.580 
second when I do and I see what I see
out<00:01:32.660> there<00:01:33.200> list<00:01:33.950> them<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.190> little<00:01:34.400> bit<00:01:35.590> and

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
out there list them a little bit and

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.680 
out there list them a little bit and
easier<00:01:37.340> breath<00:01:37.610> comes<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.210> then<00:01:38.300> I<00:01:38.330> start

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
easier breath comes and then I start

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.260 
easier breath comes and then I start
again<00:01:38.990> see<00:01:39.800> it's<00:01:39.950> not<00:01:40.100> all<00:01:40.340> one<00:01:40.700> long<00:01:40.910> thing

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
again see it's not all one long thing

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
all of that is all that test is broken

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.760 
all of that is all that test is broken
down<00:01:44.270> into<00:01:44.510> little<00:01:44.810> pieces<00:01:45.050> there's<00:01:45.530> one

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
down into little pieces there's one

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.640 
down into little pieces there's one
question<00:01:46.070> there's<00:01:46.790> one<00:01:47.300> paragraph<00:01:47.900> there's

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
question there's one paragraph there's

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.430 
question there's one paragraph there's
one<00:01:48.980> word<00:01:49.340> there's<00:01:49.850> one<00:01:50.060> sentence<00:01:50.630> it's<00:01:51.110> all

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
one word there's one sentence it's all

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.580 
one word there's one sentence it's all
just<00:01:51.950> small<00:01:52.520> moments<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.660> we<00:01:54.200> can<00:01:54.350> take<00:01:54.530> a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
practices a little bit here's something

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.680 
practices a little bit here's something
that<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.530> can<00:02:12.710> do<00:02:12.830> at<00:02:12.950> home<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.130> practice<00:02:13.690> this

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
that you can do at home to practice this

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.030 
that you can do at home to practice this
is<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.050> might<00:02:15.230> sound<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> little<00:02:15.560> funny<00:02:15.860> it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
is this might sound a little funny it

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.490 
is this might sound a little funny it
might<00:02:16.160> sound<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.460> little<00:02:16.490> weird<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.510> try<00:02:18.440> it

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
might sound a little weird but I try it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.280 
might sound a little weird but I try it
and<00:02:18.770> then<00:02:19.040> see<00:02:19.310> what<00:02:19.490> works<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.990> take<00:02:21.260> a

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
and then see what works so I take a

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.650 
and then see what works so I take a
pencil<00:02:21.620> at<00:02:21.890> home<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.970> get<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.420> piece<00:02:23.630> of

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
pencil at home and I get a piece of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.100 
pencil at home and I get a piece of
paper<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:24.709> draw<00:02:24.920> circles<00:02:25.490> on<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.640> maybe<00:02:26.450> ten

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
paper and I draw circles on it maybe ten

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.150 
paper and I draw circles on it maybe ten
circles<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.830> then<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.550> say<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.450> myself<00:02:30.050> go<00:02:30.920> and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
circles and then I say to myself go and

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.400 
circles and then I say to myself go and
then<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:31.970> fill<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.450> first<00:02:32.630> circle<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.230> then

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
then I fill in the first circle and then

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.380 
then I fill in the first circle and then
inside<00:02:33.950> as<00:02:34.310> soon<00:02:34.550> as<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.700> finished<00:02:35.060> filling

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
inside as soon as I finished filling

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.140 
inside as soon as I finished filling
that<00:02:35.480> circle<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.900> say<00:02:36.110> yeah<00:02:36.740> I<00:02:36.770> did<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.610> then

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
that circle I say yeah I did it and then

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.850 
that circle I say yeah I did it and then
I<00:02:38.180> go<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.540> next<00:02:38.810> circle<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:39.530> fill<00:02:39.830> that

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
I go to the next circle and I fill that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.040 
I go to the next circle and I fill that
in<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.280> go<00:02:40.400> yeah<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.060> did<00:02:41.750> it

way of really supporting yourself you
can<00:02:51.290> do<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.530> every<00:02:51.680> time<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.280> test<00:02:52.520> if

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
can do that every time in the test if

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.490 
can do that every time in the test if
you<00:02:52.790> want<00:02:52.940> every<00:02:53.420> time<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:53.750> fill<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.140> circle

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
you want every time you fill in a circle

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.250 
you want every time you fill in a circle
yeah<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:55.130> did<00:02:55.520> it<00:02:55.550> and<00:02:55.820> by<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.690> time<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.140> get

a<00:03:01.070> little<00:03:01.370> bit<00:03:01.580> about<00:03:01.970> how<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.630> feel<00:03:02.959> powerful

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
a little bit about how to feel powerful

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.920 
a little bit about how to feel powerful
in<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:03.860> kind<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.130> situation<00:03:04.820> so<00:03:05.570> let's<00:03:05.750> take

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
in this kind of situation so let's take

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.500 
in this kind of situation so let's take
the<00:03:06.080> worst-case<00:03:06.770> scenario<00:03:07.280> let's<00:03:07.910> take<00:03:08.150> the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
the worst-case scenario let's take the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.710 
the worst-case scenario let's take the
case<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.989> like<00:03:09.140> getting<00:03:09.650> in<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:11.030> test<00:03:11.360> and

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
case of like getting in to the test and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.530 
case of like getting in to the test and
being<00:03:12.590> in<00:03:12.680> your<00:03:12.769> underwear<00:03:13.150> well<00:03:14.150> no<00:03:14.390> that's

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
being in your underwear well no that's

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.780 
being in your underwear well no that's
that's<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.230> really<00:03:15.560> maybe<00:03:15.980> that's<00:03:16.220> too<00:03:16.400> bad

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
that's a really maybe that's too bad

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.520 
that's a really maybe that's too bad
let's<00:03:17.269> think<00:03:17.390> of<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.600> different<00:03:17.780> scenario

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
let's think of a different scenario

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.110 
let's think of a different scenario
let's<00:03:18.950> think<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.310> scenario<00:03:19.459> where<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:19.910> go

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
let's think of a scenario where you go

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.410 
let's think of a scenario where you go
in<00:03:20.299> there<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:20.980> it's<00:03:21.980> like<00:03:22.100> oh<00:03:22.430> what's<00:03:23.239> the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
in there and it's like oh what's the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.300 
in there and it's like oh what's the
answer<00:03:23.570> I<00:03:23.930> don't<00:03:24.170> know<00:03:24.410> what's<00:03:24.620> going<00:03:24.920> on<00:03:25.040> I

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
answer I don't know what's going on I

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.620 
answer I don't know what's going on I
don't<00:03:25.670> know<00:03:25.760> what<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.030> answer<00:03:26.330> is

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
don't know what the answer is

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.009 
don't know what the answer is
ah<00:03:26.660> I'm<00:03:27.290> going<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.650> just<00:03:28.190> stop<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:28.940> then<00:03:29.840> when

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
ah I'm going to just stop and then when

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.220 
ah I'm going to just stop and then when
I<00:03:30.049> stop<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.620> think<00:03:30.680> boy<00:03:31.640> what<00:03:32.330> I'd<00:03:32.480> really<00:03:32.810> like

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
I stop I think boy what I'd really like

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.670 
I stop I think boy what I'd really like
right<00:03:33.590> now<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:35.110> have<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.140> piece<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.380> chewing

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
right now is to have a piece of chewing

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.340 
right now is to have a piece of chewing
gum<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:37.790> imagine<00:03:38.450> myself<00:03:38.600> just<00:03:39.140> for<00:03:39.260> a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.839 

it's<00:03:43.850> pretty<00:03:44.090> good

great<00:03:46.840> my<00:03:47.019> favorite<00:03:47.409> kind<00:03:48.840> what<00:03:49.840> I'm<00:03:49.959> doing<00:03:50.290> is

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
great my favorite kind what I'm doing is

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.349 
great my favorite kind what I'm doing is
I'm<00:03:50.980> just<00:03:51.010> imagining<00:03:51.670> something<00:03:51.909> different

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
I'm just imagining something different

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.140 
I'm just imagining something different
I'm<00:03:52.450> taking<00:03:52.780> another<00:03:52.900> break<00:03:53.319> so<00:03:54.159> one<00:03:54.969> of<00:03:55.000> the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
I'm taking another break so one of the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.300 
I'm taking another break so one of the
things<00:03:55.359> that<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.659> can<00:03:55.870> do<00:03:56.049> to<00:03:56.620> feel<00:03:56.859> powerful

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
things that you can do to feel powerful

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.289 
things that you can do to feel powerful
is<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:58.120> let<00:03:58.299> yourself<00:03:58.450> feel<00:03:59.519> not<00:04:00.519> powerful<00:04:01.120> at

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
is to let yourself feel not powerful at

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.119 
is to let yourself feel not powerful at
first<00:04:01.599> it's<00:04:02.079> like<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.349> have<00:04:02.799> all<00:04:02.980> these

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
first it's like I have all these

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:04.949 
first it's like I have all these
thoughts<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.670> have<00:04:03.879> all<00:04:04.060> of<00:04:04.180> these<00:04:04.329> ideas<00:04:04.599> about

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
thoughts I have all of these ideas about

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.380 
thoughts I have all of these ideas about
how<00:04:05.439> it's<00:04:05.590> not<00:04:05.709> going<00:04:05.890> to<00:04:05.950> work<00:04:06.099> I<00:04:06.340> do<00:04:06.640> that<00:04:07.150> and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
how it's not going to work I do that and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.710 
how it's not going to work I do that and
then<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.500> say<00:04:08.799> what<00:04:09.069> do<00:04:09.159> I<00:04:09.189> want<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.549> do<00:04:09.700> now<00:04:09.879> what

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
do I want to do now and it could be

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.649 
do I want to do now and it could be
anything<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.489> could<00:04:12.639> be<00:04:12.790> like<00:04:13.000> go<00:04:13.239> for<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.480> walk

I let myself freak out and then I go hey
where<00:04:34.570> would<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.720> rather<00:04:34.990> be<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.560> then<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.430> go<00:04:36.880> in

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
where would I rather be and then I go in

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.360 
where would I rather be and then I go in
my<00:04:37.240> mind<00:04:37.419> just<00:04:37.660> for<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.080> second<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:39.039> where<00:04:39.190> that

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
my mind just for a second to where that

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.409 
my mind just for a second to where that
is<00:04:39.580> now<00:04:40.590> what<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:41.620> does<00:04:42.009> for<00:04:42.370> your<00:04:42.820> body<00:04:43.030> is

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
is now what that does for your body is

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.930 
is now what that does for your body is
really<00:04:43.990> different<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:44.650> actually<00:04:45.070> changes<00:04:45.699> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
really different it actually changes the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.790 
really different it actually changes the
chemistry<00:04:46.539> in<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.810> brain<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.259> chemistry<00:04:47.710> in

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
chemistry in the brain the chemistry in

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.950 
chemistry in the brain the chemistry in
the<00:04:47.889> body<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.759> gives<00:04:49.030> you<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.389> shift

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
the body and it gives you that shift

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.290 
the body and it gives you that shift
that<00:04:50.740> can<00:04:50.979> change<00:04:51.250> everything<00:04:51.639> in<00:04:51.909> the<00:04:51.970> moment

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
that can change everything in the moment

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.320 
that can change everything in the moment
and<00:04:52.389> then<00:04:52.599> coming<00:04:53.409> back<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:54.370> my<00:04:54.789> goal<00:04:55.120> I'm

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
and then coming back to my goal I'm

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.360 
and then coming back to my goal I'm
going<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.900> fill<00:04:56.349> out<00:04:56.530> more<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:56.949> these<00:04:57.099> bubbles

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
going to fill out more of these bubbles

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.460 
going to fill out more of these bubbles
and<00:04:57.669> I'm<00:04:58.030> going<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.210> be<00:04:58.360> more<00:04:58.570> successful<00:04:59.080> and

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
and I'm going to be more successful and

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:08.170 
and I'm going to be more successful and
I'm<00:04:59.800> going<00:04:59.919> to<00:04:59.949> win<00:05:00.370> at<00:05:00.639> finishing<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.479> test

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.390 

there's<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:08.990> lot<00:05:09.260> of<00:05:09.410> emphasis<00:05:09.560> put<00:05:10.130> on<00:05:10.190> these

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
there's a lot of emphasis put on these

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.370 
there's a lot of emphasis put on these
tests<00:05:11.000> but<00:05:11.480> you<00:05:11.570> know<00:05:11.690> what<00:05:11.870> it's<00:05:12.050> only<00:05:12.260> a

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
tests but you know what it's only a

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.990 
tests but you know what it's only a
short<00:05:12.650> amount<00:05:12.800> of<00:05:13.040> time<00:05:13.280> it's<00:05:13.460> only<00:05:13.580> a<00:05:13.730> small

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
short amount of time it's only a small

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.610 
short amount of time it's only a small
amount<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.630> time<00:05:14.870> in<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.170> day<00:05:15.320> that<00:05:15.500> you're

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
amount of time in the day that you're

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.520 
amount of time in the day that you're
going<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:15.800> spend<00:05:16.070> on<00:05:16.220> this<00:05:16.430> so<00:05:17.150> I<00:05:17.420> would<00:05:17.960> just

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
going to spend on this so I would just

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.620 
going to spend on this so I would just
when<00:05:19.040> you<00:05:19.160> get<00:05:19.370> done<00:05:19.580> with<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.820> thing<00:05:20.120> you've

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
when you get done with the thing you've

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.350 
when you get done with the thing you've
said<00:05:20.990> all<00:05:21.050> those<00:05:21.500> times<00:05:21.860> I've<00:05:22.220> done<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:22.700> I<00:05:22.850> did

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
said all those times I've done it I did

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.810 
said all those times I've done it I did
it<00:05:23.390> I<00:05:23.600> was<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:23.990> was<00:05:24.320> successful<00:05:24.950> and<00:05:25.100> then<00:05:25.580> when

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
it I was I was successful and then when
