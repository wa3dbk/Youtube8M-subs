00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:08.400
 Effect sound) Tiger cry 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.139
 Hi? 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.279
 I am a resident of Gyeongin, who works at the Zoo in Seoul. 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.650
 The animal I am introducing today is a white rhino. 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.789
 Why is it a white rhinoceros? 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.300
 There are two reasons. 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.899
 The first is to protect the extinct Rhinoceros on Earth 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.869
 May 22 from the World Wildlife Fund ~ 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.650
 It is because it is the day designated as world rhino day. 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.930
 In 2011, the second coming from the Singapore Zoo ~ 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.720
 The male white rhinoceros Mandela and ~ 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.720
 A female white rhinoceros superficial mating is observed. 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.500
 This is because I am looking forward to the birth of baby white rhinoceros next year. 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.460
 So from now on ~ 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.500
 Let me introduce Mandela from Singapore. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.400
 November 2011 Incheon International Airport 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.470
 The veterinarian confirms Mandela's condition. 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.229
 Mandela, a somewhat tired figure, 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.540
 I arrived at the zoo after midnight. 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.000
 Tighten the container to the passageway to guide it to the inner chamber. 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.110
 After waiting for a long time, Mandela - 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.690
 I feel something strange. 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.690
 Suddenly, the screen is covered. 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:02:25.500
 (Mandela continues to be excited by the excitement.) 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:30.569
 Mandela's excitement does not sink 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.569
 The curtains and pipes have become like scrap paper. 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:43.519
 I'm going to go to the moving container with a terrible light ~ 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:50.519
 The curtain connected with the pipe was broken in a moment. 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.040
 The next morning 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.040
 I sprinkle water to relax Mandela's tension. 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:04.829
 For Hungry Mandela 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.669
 I'll give you plenty of hay. 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:17.669
 Mandela is hungry, too, 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.139
 Scrub Mandela's back with a brush 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:28.139
 Sprinkle water to rest assured. 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.700
 An operation to drive Mandela to us has begun. 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.079
 The end of the aisle is Mandela's stay. 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.849
 Mandela, who entered the room, 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.429
 Fortunately, Mandela safely entered the room. 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:04:01.389
 Here Mandela spent the winter of 2011. 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.100
 May 2012 Seoul Zoo Animal Hall, today Mandela and Chomi are the first day to be tied to the Han River. 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.019
 While everyone is watching in tense 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.449
 Mandela enters into us carefully. 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:22.360
 I have been running for a long time. 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.360
 There is a lot of green paint on the inside fence, 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:36.779
 There you can see the far field. 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:43.779
 The zookeeper opens the door and comes in. 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:51.919
 Mandela slowly came to the side of the ultra- 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.800
 Mandela and chopped rice are divided into hay. 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.200
 Before completing the work, Mandela and Sukmyun were off to learn their face. 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.500
 I knew about each other, so I succeeded in making a big success. 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.900
 In May 2013, Mandela, a zoo in Seoul, Korea, is finally planning to make love to Zhao Ming. 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.059
 It is not easy to get on first because it is the first time ~ 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:21.180
 On that day Mandela and Chunmi and love failed because of lack of experience, but ~ 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.500
 The estrus cycle returns at about 50 days. 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.639
 I think I can succeed if I try again a few more times. 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.370
 September 2013 Seoul Zoo Museum 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.339
 Nowadays, Mandela and Sukmi are not apart for a while. 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:44.129
 Mandela also follows the back of the stomach when it moves. 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.249
 That's because it is a rut season. 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:51.199
 Since rhinoceros are originally living independently 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.210
 I do not usually be male or female 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.650
 There have been a few witnesses of Mandela and Chamie sharing love for a few months. 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.800
 I can see that the superhero allows Mandela. 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.299
 I do not think so. 

00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:12.300
 The rhino's pregnancy is 15 ~ 19 months long. 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.600
 I hope that next year I will have the good fortune to see baby rhinos. 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:25.900
 You can also help Mandela and Chomi get a healthy and tender baby rhinoceros ~ 

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:28.530
 Maybe we should come to Seoul Zoo 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.089
 If you see Mandela and Chan Mei 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:36.029
 Do not shout loudly or throw anything like a stone. 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:38.860
 If Mandela and the starfish are surprised 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.620
 I can not see baby rhino next year. 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.500
 So when the baby white rhinoceros are born, I will introduce them again ~ 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:49.319
 I will finish this today. Have a good day ~ ^^
