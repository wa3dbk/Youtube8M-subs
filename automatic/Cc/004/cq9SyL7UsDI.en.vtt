00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.879
 Good morning, how are you doing? 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.430
 Good night depends where you are today 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.910
 I'm going to do the review of a game this 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.920
 time in this case that the one I played 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.039
 for the review of the mobile that is this the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.690
 order the angry birds 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.060
 which I find very funny 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.560
 or we're going to start it here you start 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.640
 install an update that installed 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.640
 before something of a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.660
 well let's start with the screen 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.660
 here is my account 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 Here he puts you about your dibise so that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.820
 You see the drawings I do not know if I've seen them 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.770
 they were from neox 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.990
 this is my account 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.800
 this is for the tele potes if you have 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:56.700
 some of that seems magnificent to me 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.579
 you do not put it here and suddenly it appears 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.390
 here is that that has not done any 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.720
 game is like the good skylanders we go 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.140
 to go 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.140
 there are enough I will take the first 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.560
 and well here I have a car but for 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.180
 example here the car that you have to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.160
 had in the previous map does not let you 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.130
 pick it up again and that seems to me I do not know 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.480
 I think it's a bitch because this car 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.110
 I started to spend all the money that 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.390
 I had to have it cool and it seems that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.270
 they do not leave you and I do not know how much it bothered me 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.260
 here is this little pig that says things 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.330
 you will need a kart with a good 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.230
 displacement to win the races more 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.450
 difficult 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.289
 this map I've already had it whole I 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.840
 because he knew how to say that I told myself here more 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.759
 fighting against as final hands and you go 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.670
 getting the character at the beginning 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.439
 when you start in that this uncle network the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.899
 angry birds is not normal the rojito bueno 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.780
 here do you start there are four things 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.549
 which is a race against time one of 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.239
 catch watermelons and a versus to play 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.010
 against another online person that bad 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.230
 is that you can not play with someone you know 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.569
 alone and you can not play with someone 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.680
 puts you to the task of theoretically good 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.120
 let's do this 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.120
 let's play normal 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.890
 how do I say super fun this game 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:31.340
 because I do not know to me angry birds I do not 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.739
 like you know what the games then I 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.780
 they liked the first ones but they are already 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.569
 doing a little boring for me this 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.650
 it's the best because it's all cars and 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:46.500
 all of that I love 6 here they put you 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.290
 dynamite and what crazy 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.660
 and here where I have the thumb right now 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.980
 young man when I look I made the shortcut without 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.200
 want 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.239
 here where I have the thumb is like the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.400
 turbo that if you give it has a power 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.400
 special as in the normals 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.710
 I have done it too fast 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.960
 Look, it's been very good 104 in three 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.670
 stars I think I'm going to swim or 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.990
 I do not get stars to look 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.000
 yes three stars 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.740
 I have achieved the final challenge that this is 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.150
 like missions side missions 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.040
 that you use the put you see here to look 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.320
 and you put others already there in the round 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.060
 2 if you win and realize that it is for when 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.810
 you pass the game that you are not on board that 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.790
 do something good let's go with something else 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.470
 I'm going to put this map because I do not know 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.190
 we want to annoy many games and you 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.980
 he downloads it jce 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.480
 because imagine you download it with all the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.280
 illusion and it annoyed the story is not 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.960
 well now I just played a race 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.870
 to march this from watermelons that is 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.940
 very well that there is fruit along the way and 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.450
 you have to go picking 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.750
 to see them here is so good that goes 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.750
 picking 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.860
 and here I do not know if I'm going with someone and I've 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.069
 already lost or do not see this car with anyone 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.579
 It's much better than the one that comes to you 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.799
 something that I like a lot also is that 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:16.280
 now I can not show but 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.870
 that cars buy one and you go 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.269
 evolving because there are also some 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.250
 that are paid with money and you go 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.050
 leveling up the cars and that's 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.990
 great because the times are better 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.880
 more powerful cars there is a given moment 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.100
 that when you take all the fruit there 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.920
 coins 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.820
 but this has another different power than 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.820
 is that it makes an explosion 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.969
 normal that everyone knows him do 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.270
 they do the same 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:51.390
 from the same 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.340
 the same as in the original that has 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.800
 each a power that has already turned to 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.750
 make three stars 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.400
 and well let's do the last and 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.190
 we also see ourselves in the power of this 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.040
 let's do the last one that is going to be a 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.850
 against the clock against evil now he could not 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.470
 play because I've already had it but 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.479
 good as you'll see already you 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.070
 it's pretty fun there's also 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.940
 powers that I do not know if they have appeared there 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.450
 above 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.240
 but is that if I stop if I go back to 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:26.509
 start and get tired because 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.550
 here is the typical system for 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.620
 that services the game that 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.780
 we get tired and you have to 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.360
 stop for them to rest because if 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.909
 you do not stay supervised 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.789
 and well, if I start again, it takes away a 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:42.969
 point and I can not teach it this is that 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.110
 try not to collide better 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:49.720
 it's a fuck is against the clock and here 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.270
 up is the pump 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.430
 that if you do not get it to pass it on 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.140
 Well, you can not be that you have not 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.550
 managed to press the power of this 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.450
 girl who is in a bubble and 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.450
 I'm watching it all 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.249
 is already three stars 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.249
 puts it there 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.340
 well that's fine because it gave you more 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.220
 money with money you can improve 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.320
 cars and so we are doing each time 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.720
 better, I hope you liked it 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:24.780
 this game, if I went to you, 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.790
 it would download because it is super good and 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.400
 good do not forget to leave your like 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.740
 will be your line 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.210
 give it to like as I said favorites 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.210
 and subscribe goodbye
