00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
so she started coaching it and dry

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.569 
so she started coaching it and dry
because<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.510> think<00:03:14.750> it's<00:03:14.900> important<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.739> she

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
because I think it's important and she

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.030 
because I think it's important and she
also<00:03:16.730> thinks<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.420> what<00:03:17.630> she<00:03:17.959> took<00:03:18.290> she<00:03:18.500> is

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
also thinks that what she took she is

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.270 
also thinks that what she took she is
super<00:03:19.459> she<00:03:20.450> proposed<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.980> beginning

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
super she proposed it in the beginning

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.150 
super she proposed it in the beginning
which<00:03:22.609> make<00:03:22.880> me<00:03:23.090> feel<00:03:23.329> even<00:03:23.840> safer<00:03:24.500> watching

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
which make me feel even safer watching

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.220 
which make me feel even safer watching
with<00:03:25.310> her<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:27.400> so<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.850> was<00:03:29.090> try<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.810> she<00:03:29.870> could

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
with her and so it was try so she could

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.250 
with her and so it was try so she could
see<00:03:30.500> how<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.220> girls<00:03:31.760> behave<00:03:32.329> and<00:03:32.690> how<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.109> is
