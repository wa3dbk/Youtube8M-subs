00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.250
 hello and welcome to geek newspaper 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.130
 these years and here I am running and has 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.220
 so tv oled shalit announced in may 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.260
 last in Monaco then of a big 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.970
 European event ben there it is same 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.289
 thing so we find this screen or 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.970
 now who will arrive in very 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.289
 long since it's September and 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.410
 marketing is planned for 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.649
 November at an indicative price of 9000 euros 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.920
 so just for a little reminder the screen 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.680
 oled de ti life of a screen that algeria 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 counts 55 inches with a thickness of 4 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.430
 mm only 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.260
 so if we look well that the thickness 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.930
 so I come here and there you can see 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.860
 that it's really very very fine and that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.440
 it's impressive you can see 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.320
 besides the edges here 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.320
 the kiss is completely completely 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.020
 yes do not mix the remix is ​​that with 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.810
 the flight is pretty bluffing and you have to 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.300
 say that the contrast ratio is enough 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.030
 hallucinatory 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.620
 here on the other side because we are there 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.680
 we are not too much I will introduce you 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.820
 also we run fast here 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 rely on the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.750
 LG's first ultra- definition screen 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.610
 so we propose a diagonal of 84 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.280
 years then we speak well of 4k for a 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.080
 trace definition and not just so 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.030
 certain of resolution of which it is true 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.850
 but who sells 4000 by 2000 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.090
 so if we will see it and the brands have 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.720
 decided to communicate on this on this 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.610
 ultra definition so 2160p in 2 x 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.910
 1080 and who does in four the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.900
 resolution of a full hd screen 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.130
 this is me I think it's about 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.460
 to extend everything since unfortunately 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.630
 we do not have to ifa smartphones 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.700
 the nuptials people heart weight and 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.930
 all this and to be in this one the 3d 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.440
 pretty classic with climbs in 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.460
 range 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.100
 that we should present shortly 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.600
 on this balcony thanks a lot of attention 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.810
 and see you soon on the geek newspaper
