can see when you go down here sweet that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.840 
can see when you go down here sweet that
we<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.790> some<00:01:42.390> bones<00:01:42.860> three<00:01:43.860> diamonds<00:01:44.340> yeah

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
we get some bones three diamonds yeah

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.660 
we get some bones three diamonds yeah
three<00:01:45.210> diamonds<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> start<00:01:45.810> off<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.439> get

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
three diamonds to start off with we get

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.389 
three diamonds to start off with we get
another<00:01:47.670> diamond<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.299> four<00:01:48.600> diamonds<00:01:49.399> and

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
another diamond that's four diamonds and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.580 
another diamond that's four diamonds and
some<00:01:50.729> gold<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.570> varies<00:01:51.960> every<00:01:51.990> time

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
some gold I think it varies every time

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.109 
some gold I think it varies every time
so<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.860> guess<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.189> could<00:01:53.310> always<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.670> restart

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
so I guess you could always like restart

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.490 
so I guess you could always like restart
the<00:01:54.240> world<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.659> don't<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.960> what<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.229> want

in here which is here on the map we have

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.040 
in here which is here on the map we have
do<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.850> really<00:03:15.300> don't<00:03:15.360> want<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.600> land<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.930> the

do I really don't want to land on the
pressure<00:03:16.800> plate<00:03:17.510> okay<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:18.989> nothing

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180

but<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.549> said<00:03:26.610> I<00:03:26.820> think<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.239> might<00:03:27.390> vary<00:03:27.720> so

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
but like I said I think it might vary so

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.960 
but like I said I think it might vary so
if<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.230> get<00:03:28.380> absolute<00:03:28.829> rubbish<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.519> think<00:03:29.910> you

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
if you get absolute rubbish I think you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.160 
if you get absolute rubbish I think you
might<00:03:30.090> be<00:03:30.120> able<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.360> like<00:03:30.510> reload<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.989> world
