00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.020
 since just a day now runs the 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.250
 crysis 3 multiplayer beta on the pc us 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.330
 already reported yesterday 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.650
 About the technical details 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.029
 I am here again with Raphael 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.010
 vÃ¶tter from the pc games hardware the 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.239
 I'm really good with that and myself 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.550
 I've heard it has now 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.410
 what important thing did the raffle 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.280
 yes we got a driver from 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.809
 Amd the catalyst 13.2 beta 3 is there 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.870
 just as are some new he 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:52.120
 boosts performance in crysis 3 1 beta 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.120
 in the context of 10% excitement 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.610
 and there are still differences 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.020
 for 1 media and for ati owner hans so 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.670
 So if no edge smoothing of a 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.560
 thereby the play on both manufacturers 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.060
 equally good though four women 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.400
 multi table edge smoothing of one or 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.510
 another mode then break radeon 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.930
 still a bit stronger than cards 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.930
 the fist 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.130
 meanwhile some bugs 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 graphic error or similar noticed 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.460
 what can one say so what you do not 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.950
 should hire or hire if 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.960
 you want to have a clean look so 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.400
 In general, it is like this without being poor 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.250
 mode then breaks packs each 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.440
 graphics card currently a motorist there 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.030
 it is currently often mandible cards so do not 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.350
 the radeon cards are running better though 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.760
 have also lacked power but 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.890
 deep skating right now so that the 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.930
 but with less chance of collapsing 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.310
 just when you 're in the indoor so in the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.170
 There is one interior on the way 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.890
 white border around grasses and so far 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.960
 from the objects 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.640
 that is crytek, I have that 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.200
 the act is still being read in the final 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.830
 code be fixed and a beta 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.830
 probably not 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.870
 and what so detailed benchmarks 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.940
 if I want to know exactly what 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.010
 can my graphics card what is so accurate 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.299
 what I need for crysis one could 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.010
 Also help or how it looks 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.360
 but of course we have since today 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.910
 early natural benchmarks made like 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.970
 the new driver catalyst 13 23 and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.099
 Tiefbau blabla and we will be in progress 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.200
 of the day probably already in so today 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.200
 afternoon driver test online 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.519
 and went deeper at the benchmarks so 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.230
 who is exactly interested in it? 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.030
 easy on pc games hardware de 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.310
 drop by and see all the benchmarks 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.590
 look and otherwise wish me 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.400
 continue to have fun with our crysis 3 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.400
 multiplayer beta reporting
