let's focus on the game a little bit

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.949 
let's focus on the game a little bit
better<00:04:01.830> than<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> know<00:04:02.700> it's<00:04:03.450> got<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.660> baneling

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
better than I I know it's got a baneling

that's<00:04:04.290> going<00:04:04.620> on<00:04:04.740> sup<00:04:05.550> he<00:04:05.670> might<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> hundred

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
that's going on sup he might a hundred

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.060 
that's going on sup he might a hundred
guests<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.690> he<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.050> think<00:04:07.530> he<00:04:07.560> pulled<00:04:07.830> him<00:04:07.950> off

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
guests and he I think he pulled him off

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.140 
guests and he I think he pulled him off
gas<00:04:08.340> for<00:04:08.490> a<00:04:08.550> little<00:04:08.670> bit<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:08.880> then<00:04:09.000> he<00:04:09.060> went

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
gas for a little bit and then he went

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.940 
gas for a little bit and then he went
back<00:04:09.270> to<00:04:09.420> mining<00:04:09.750> guys<00:04:09.990> again<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.440> think<00:04:10.680> this

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
back to mining guys again I think this

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.440 
back to mining guys again I think this
hedge<00:04:11.160> could<00:04:11.400> just<00:04:11.580> be<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.730> big<00:04:11.940> fate<00:04:12.150> he<00:04:12.270> might

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
hedge could just be a big fate he might

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.449 
hedge could just be a big fate he might
let<00:04:12.570> it<00:04:12.690> finish<00:04:12.870> off<00:04:13.140> shenanigans<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:14.130> think

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
let it finish off shenanigans I think

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.770 
let it finish off shenanigans I think
