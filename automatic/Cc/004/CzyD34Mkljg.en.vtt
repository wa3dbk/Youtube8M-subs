 Santa here in the snow pack 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.510
 complicated was well random without the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.890
 is dominated by the enemy team and you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.739
 with three friends you just have to get 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.489
 the flag and start running in the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.489
 counterclockwise here on the flag runs pretty 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:05.670
 and 34 laps here you have to stay 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.340
 Galley be well tuned to the sound of the game and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.939
 when you are almost at the end of the eighth 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.970
 Back I think very well of the numbers but 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.729
 we will continue running Santa 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.689
 It appears in front of you then just 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.040
 You keep turning when I fell here. 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.020
