00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Imagine you were her husband 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.700
 hire a video producer 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140
 who would you take the left with 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.580
 his little dslr and his 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.920
 probably a month old 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.730
 photography page on facebook or the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.469
 types on the right 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.120
 I think the answer should be everyone 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.740
 be clear, but a way to do it 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.690
 much more sense than just looking good 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.730
 and that's why you want one today 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.279
 Introduce another budget secret tip 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.279
 that rick of cameras the fun 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.730
 I have a long time for one myself 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.710
 Wanted away with all the trimmings but 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.910
 either they were too expensive or something 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.860
 cheap that one then again 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.750
 became skeptical and then I am 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.719
 on the side of mates behind with 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.410
 he came across and was full of anticipation 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.270
 ordered 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.010
 meanwhile it should be rigged on again 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.379
 on amazon but it is often the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.940
 case that it is sold out in the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.829
 description is therefore next to the Amazon 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.360
 left so still the link to the original 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.489
 shop because then customs fees 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.289
 but the shipping is there, too 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.149
 relatively fast here in the test I have 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.880
 now the shoulder rick the full 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.710
 people and the mapbox wants to start 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.970
 I with the shoulder victory that consists of 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.250
 two c-tubes 26 c tubes one 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.420
 Mounting plate for your camera to 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.600
 two gripped with the associated 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.670
 angle pieces a connector and 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.259
 the shoulder surface additionally one can 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.030
 get yourself a counterweight 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.549
 for which one still needs additional pipes 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.619
 Order all parts of the rig 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.150
 corresponding 15 millimeters standard 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.650
 Eisemann can call that too 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.640
 Products from all other manufacturers 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.009
 expand 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.259
 In addition, all individual components 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.119
 Including screws made of aluminum 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.950
 only the pad for the shoulder 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.380
 but would not be somehow stupid when 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.909
 it would not be upholstered the screw 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.350
 mechanisms work very well and 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.659
 even if you only use them with the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.040
 hand tight just fine with a little practice 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.899
 then you also manage the streak 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.880
 Build fast as other parts 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.680
 really wonderful fit together 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.360
 nevertheless, the whole thing is very stable and 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.100
 that's just what a rieckmann is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.229
 must be able to trust that the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.850
 Camera is also held and that one 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.229
 really can work with it for a long time 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.030
 Especially for the shoulder pad is very 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.829
 it will be pleasant and a counterweight 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.660
 next to it even better because then you do not 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.459
 to carry the whole load in your hands 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.880
 purely from the processing ago I can 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.050
 complain about this rico 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.510
 the only thing that kinda negative 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.490
 it is noticeable with time and which 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.110
 But I get scratched by the pipes 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.480
 think that's normal 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.340
 Case always breaks down with the metal 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.720
 then turn it over 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.400
 sometime also traces of use 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.750
 come and how so busy after all 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.100
 use and not somewhere 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.570
 stand and watch 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.970
 Next, we take time to 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.830
 follow focus in front of with a full focus 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.780
 you can focus much more precisely 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.670
 Tighten not only enjoyable for 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.860
 the hand is usually one 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.510
 this resistance also offers this 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.310
 here is completely made of metal 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.590
 down to the white edge you see there 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.990
 These are plastic ones around there 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.820
 focus points to be able to mark more expensive 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.490
 Systems have built-in limiters 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.840
 Unfortunately, this one does not have that 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.700
 ring is the summer to do 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.590
 this just attached with magnets around 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.600
 to be able to simply take them off 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.400
 settled with a small rubber ring 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.380
 Timing belt thus the full focus too 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.700
 with normal photo lenses is usable 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.950
 as you do not necessarily have to 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.290
 buy direct cinema lens or something 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.120
 however, you realize you are using with objective 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.100
 that's a bit of a game in the translation 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.540
 But that is just what it is 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.550
 difference between really expensive 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.300
 systems and just the cheaper ones 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.760
 variants 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.930
 Nevertheless, it is relatively little and 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.190
 if you do not have the highest standards 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.230
 so you should loose it 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.150
 cope with the most controversial part of the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.590
 rig should then but be the MapBox 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.450
 I have heard many voices 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.880
 have talked about that such parts yes 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.740
 but you can totally unnecessary 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.240
 so that wonderful lenz injured avoid 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.370
 if you look at this on the original video 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.010
 wilhelm did not give it up 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.209
 ok i like that but sometimes i can 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.030
 they are really annoying 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.760
 Besides , this map box has 1 4 x 4 frame 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.290
 leads eg nd filter or gradient filter 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.330
 that is above all things in the setup 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.920
 several objective meaningful because one 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.900
 not so constantly changing the filters 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.790
 must and only has to shop because 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.800
 however, it is always up front 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.720
 Corpus of the map box this time made of plastic 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.520
 and only the aluminum flaps 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.110
 but right there you should on 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.370
 otherwise it will save weight 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.320
 but quite difficult if you are the part 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.540
 lasts a little longer and runs around with it 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.010
 but here is the driving line 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.170
 again as already mentioned 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.640
 very good and I can really look good 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.000
 my experience so far with it 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.590
 did hardly really complain searches 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.660
 So you're a middle-class rick around his 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.060
 improving video quality is some 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.880
 really the gold of the effects 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.500
 movie with a 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.960
 created with eric is again a so 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.330
 much other than the handheld wiggle 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.710
 What else you see everywhere else 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.570
 then comes a pretty good full 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.430
 focus without which you never film again 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.290
 I want to do that and then you can do it all the same 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.180
 you can also upgrade later 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.040
 I would like to follow a more expensive one 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.620
 focus and then buy the pact 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.060
 again simply on the shoulder tripod 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.010
 All parts can not be needed either 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.390
 order separately so that you can just the 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.370
 can use full focus 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.110
 that 's it for me today 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.700
 Hope you liked the video 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.950
 See there are a few lately 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.140
 I would like to call now secret tips 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.210
 at least as far as video equipment is concerned 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.830
 is that all of me left are like 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.990
 said in the description and me 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.370
 Thank you very much for seeing us 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.390
 Of course we'll see each other in the next one 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.390
 video until then
