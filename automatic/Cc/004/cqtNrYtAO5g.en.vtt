they actually gave you a DLC pack where
it<00:02:04.709> includes<00:02:05.100> possibly<00:02:05.819> a<00:02:05.969> Super<00:02:06.600> Saiyan<00:02:06.840> God

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
it includes possibly a Super Saiyan God

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.320 
it includes possibly a Super Saiyan God
Vegeta<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.709> maybe<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.100> god<00:02:08.520> Frieza<00:02:08.880> who<00:02:09.119> knows

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
Vegeta or maybe a god Frieza who knows

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.960 
Vegeta or maybe a god Frieza who knows
so<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.709> been<00:02:10.860> three<00:02:11.190> DLC<00:02:11.730> packs

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
so there have been three DLC packs

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.480 
so there have been three DLC packs
announced<00:02:12.510> each<00:02:12.780> costing<00:02:13.500> $10<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.250> think

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
announced each costing $10 and I think

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.070 
announced each costing $10 and I think
each<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.910> them<00:02:15.060> will<00:02:15.180> be<00:02:15.210> worth<00:02:15.510> its<00:02:15.720> value

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
each of them will be worth its value

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.480 
each of them will be worth its value
because<00:02:16.200> they're<00:02:16.860> gonna<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.100> containing

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
because they're gonna be containing

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.270 
because they're gonna be containing
their<00:02:17.730> own<00:02:17.880> set

have a big frustration towards GT they
don't<00:02:23.110> really<00:02:23.380> see<00:02:23.620> why<00:02:23.830> GT<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.459> necessary<00:02:24.970> but
