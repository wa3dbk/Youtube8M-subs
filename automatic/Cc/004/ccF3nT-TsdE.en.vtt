00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.990

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.539
 she that is what motivates you I have 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.210
 any question for you that I want to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.630
 my life what do you want most 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.269
 deep in your being and your heart that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.880
 motivate you to impel you to live with 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.920
 passion that everything you do that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.090
 everything you do , do it with 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.190
 Love with affection with desire to live not 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 only for you but to give it to him 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.370
 to someone else to share that passion 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.370
 and that desire if you still do not know what you want 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.670
 of life or what can you offer to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.670
 life I invite you to think about it 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.949
 the reflections and if you do not know what 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.550
 you want from life maybe if you know 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.090
 what is it that you do not want 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.369
 what you do not want and you know that you do not 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.780
 you want 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.909
 curiously, maybe it's what you're 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 doing at this moment maybe there is 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.800
 work that you do not like that you do not 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.409
 passionate that it bothers you that bores you 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.030
 what makes you tired that you do not wait 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.860
 to spend the hours and minutes to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 let the day end and be able to go home 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.270
 or go to see friends maybe you're 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.729
 with that couple you do not want anymore 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.090
 be but you have no choice or maybe 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.920
 because it scares you suddenly to be alone 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.410
 think what you do not want in your life 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.990
 and that you're probably doing it 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.630
 that you are probably living in that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.410
 space comfort for comfort 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.649
 fear maybe the fear of change 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.020
 dare risk yourself at that risk 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.860
 and in that span of change you can 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.630
 find what you want and also 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.479
 when you identify that if you want 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.470
 prices be willing to pay for 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.909
 to achieve it is to say what your goals are 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.409
 what are your dreams what are your 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.110
 delusions 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.629
 and when you have them clear that prices 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.010
 You are willing to pay 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.500
 willing to take risks 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.379
 are you willing to dare to take the leap 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.420
 quantum of your life you know with what 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:26.580
 objective with the objective of feeling 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.459
 happy motivated put life to your years today 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 it's the best day to start you decide 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.319
 if you want to stay in this area 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.140
 comfort or you want to take a risk and go up 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.930
 another level or at least treat that such 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.140
 so yes that there is that space 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.540
 where you want to arrive, take a chance and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.459
 I have one more maybe when 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.629
 find what you want and 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.430
 you want 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.310
 you also find him what is your mission 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.620
 or what is the meaning of your life what is 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.140
 that vision that is what you want to leave 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.750
 in this world on this planet for your 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.340
 children for your family for your society 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.620
 for your community what would be that mission 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.260
 what would that sense be that you could 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.109
 give your life something that motivates you and you 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.130
 illusions Viktor Frank that was a 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.100
 writer and who lives 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.050
 in the spaces of war he said 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.450
 that all those people who did not have 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.790
 a motivation they did not have an illusion 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.980
 that maybe they did not have the family 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.960
 they died quickly but everyone 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.210
 individual that was in those areas of 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.110
 shelter survived because 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.360
 they had a motivation to live 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.480
 what is it for you to follow 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.590
 living but not living, live with 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.290
 love and compassion arriÃ©sgate comes to that 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.590
 space that what you do you do with 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.050
 love with passion with dedication that 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.810
 when you go to bed say what 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.660
 satisfaction what satisfaction rest 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.720
 because I did everything that I like 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.270
 do because I did my best do not ask 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.210
 that things are easy how it would be 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.070
 You better say the best of me and I know 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.520
 until the impossible for everything to come out 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.520
 at one hundred 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.160
 what do you need to feel good 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.579
 how is your life at this moment 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.289
 what do you need 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:27.409
 what would you like to risk transforming 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.540
 change a motivate for you and for 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:31.930
 the rest 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.510
 I leave you in reflection identifies what is 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.540
 what or what is your passion 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.520
 that you like that you enjoy maybe when 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.560
 It was that you were little, you said, I want to be 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.570
 teacher or I want to be a lawyer 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.970
 I do not want to be an architect I do not want to be 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.630
 pilot I do not want to be a sweeper or 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.630
 milkman that is that that of small 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.510
 I was excited and maybe by chance 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.210
 of fate you forgot not 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.030
 you were losing I invite you to go to 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.120
 background to the bottom of your being and that 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.470
 find what is that purpose of life 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.380
 what is it that excites you what it is that 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.750
 motivates you and brings life to the years 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.210
 because if there is something that is very true it is 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.550
 that we are going to die then today 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.620
 you have an opportunity to transform 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.760
 your life so that what you do you do 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.590
