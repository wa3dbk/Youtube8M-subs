00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
reversion of their probe series or a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.059 
reversion of their probe series or a
vexed<00:00:06.359> recei<00:00:06.660> Riis<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.990> their<00:00:07.170> probe<00:00:07.440> versions

I<00:00:08.429> don't<00:00:08.880> know<00:00:08.970> what<00:00:09.059> do<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.150> want<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.360> call<00:00:09.540> it

I think Beckster version of their probe
series<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.040> correct<00:00:14.540> less<00:00:15.540> money<00:00:16.220> same<00:00:17.220> tone
