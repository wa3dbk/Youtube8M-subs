00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.749 
SIM card so we have this side directions
I<00:01:18.210> mentioned<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.409> need<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.859> insert

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
I mentioned here so you need to insert

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.450 
I mentioned here so you need to insert
the<00:01:20.880> SIM<00:01:21.090> card<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> same<00:01:21.719> way<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.189> have

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the SIM card in the same way so you have

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.719 
the SIM card in the same way so you have
this<00:01:24.140> instruction<00:01:25.140> saw<00:01:25.439> how<00:01:25.859> to<00:01:25.920> insert<00:01:26.609> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
this instruction saw how to insert the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.480 
this instruction saw how to insert the
SIM<00:01:26.909> card<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.719> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:28.049> here<00:01:28.469> there<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.399> a

SIM card so you can see here there is a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
SIM card so you can see here there is a
cutting<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:29.969> so<00:01:30.149> you<00:01:31.109> need<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.380> place<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
cutting here so you need to place the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.310 
cutting here so you need to place the
SIM<00:01:31.920> card<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.490> this<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.719> place<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> SIM

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
SIM card like this so they place the SIM

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.810 
SIM card like this so they place the SIM
card<00:01:38.600> now<00:01:39.600> let's<00:01:39.890> push<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> back<00:01:41.280> into<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
card now let's push it back into the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.539 
card now let's push it back into the
device<00:01:41.969> so<00:01:42.359> you<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:42.570> see<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.020> just

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
device so you can see here just

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.620 
device so you can see here just
inserting<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.670> back<00:01:44.909> onto<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.420> device<00:01:45.570> which

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
inserting it back onto the device which

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.660 
inserting it back onto the device which
so<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.340> push<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> back<00:01:51.320> now

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
so there you go just push it back now

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.819 
so there you go just push it back now
the<00:01:53.670> phone<00:01:53.939> will<00:01:54.270> probably<00:01:54.659> detect<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.649> SIM

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the phone will probably detect the SIM

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.289 
the phone will probably detect the SIM
card<00:01:56.039> so<00:01:56.189> there<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.490> go

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
card so there you go

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.499 
card so there you go
the<00:01:57.630> phone<00:01:57.840> has<00:01:58.049> detected<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.890> SIM<00:01:59.070> card

pretty simple you just need to use the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.370 
pretty simple you just need to use the
sim<00:02:10.800> ejector<00:02:11.519> pin<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.970> include<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> box<00:02:13.110> and

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
sim ejector pin I include in the box and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.550 
sim ejector pin I include in the box and
I<00:02:13.590> use<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.099> push<00:02:14.400> into<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.360> slot<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.170> it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
I use it to push into this slot and it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.500 
I use it to push into this slot and it
will<00:02:16.650> reject<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:17.130> sim<00:02:17.340> tray<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.239> need<00:02:18.390> to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
will reject the sim tray and you need to

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.740 
will reject the sim tray and you need to
insert<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.019> sim<00:02:19.230> card<00:02:19.610> with<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> chip<00:02:20.819> facing

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
insert the sim card with the chip facing

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
insert the sim card with the chip facing
downwards<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> Kutta<00:02:22.799> towards<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.370> left

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
downwards and the Kutta towards the left

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.820 
downwards and the Kutta towards the left
side<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.000> then<00:02:24.510> push<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.959> back<00:02:25.140> into<00:02:25.440> this

side and then push it back into this

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.430
