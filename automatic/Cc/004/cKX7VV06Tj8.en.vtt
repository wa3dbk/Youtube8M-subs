while<00:01:27.490> he<00:01:27.640> was<00:01:27.729> with<00:01:27.940> Celtic<00:01:28.630> he<00:01:29.110> played

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
while he was with Celtic he played

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.170 
while he was with Celtic he played
through<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.740> pain<00:01:29.979> barrier<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.700> begin<00:01:31.000> with

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
through the pain barrier to begin with

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.420 
through the pain barrier to begin with
but<00:01:31.330> it's<00:01:31.450> led<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:31.840> stuttering<00:01:32.380> start<00:01:32.770> to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
but it's led to a stuttering start to

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.000 
but it's led to a stuttering start to
his<00:01:33.640> burrow<00:01:34.060> career<00:01:34.600> but<00:01:35.229> it's<00:01:35.350> not<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.560> problem

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
his burrow career but it's not a problem

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.910 
his burrow career but it's not a problem
that<00:01:36.460> threatens<00:01:36.700> his<00:01:37.270> World<00:01:37.659> Cup<00:01:37.930> dream<00:01:38.229> know

that threatens his World Cup dream know

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.730 
that threatens his World Cup dream know
hopefully<00:01:39.310> not<00:01:39.549> just<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:41.110> just<00:01:41.320> takes<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.710> bit

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
hopefully not just it just takes a bit

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.710 
hopefully not just it just takes a bit
longer<00:01:41.890> because<00:01:42.340> one<00:01:42.940> of<00:01:42.970> those<00:01:43.150> areas<00:01:43.330> that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
longer because one of those areas that

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.680

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
you do it every day whether you're

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.680

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
anything and that's certainly the case

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.430

at<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.610> moment<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.420> really<00:02:55.019> need<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.260> work

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
at the moment so I really need to work

hard for the next couple of months and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.900 
hard for the next couple of months and
hopefully<00:02:58.470> I'll<00:02:58.590> get<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.889> call<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.459> says

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
hopefully I'll get that call that says

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.729 
hopefully I'll get that call that says
you<00:03:00.180> know<00:03:00.329> you'll<00:03:00.900> be<00:03:00.959> on<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.319> plane<00:03:01.470> to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
South Africa but that will all be down

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.490 
South Africa but that will all be down
to<00:03:04.560> hard<00:03:04.709> work<00:03:04.920> for<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:06.120> successor<00:03:06.720> mmm<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:07.470> a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
to hard work for a successor mmm for a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.259 
to hard work for a successor mmm for a
football<00:03:07.799> club<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.190> really<00:03:08.670> that's<00:03:08.910> what<00:03:09.150> I'm

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
football club and really that's what I'm

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.910 
football club and really that's what I'm
concentrating<00:03:09.660> on<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.170> that's<00:03:10.230> where<00:03:10.560> you

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
concentrating on and that's where you

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.500 
concentrating on and that's where you
know<00:03:11.040> where<00:03:11.220> my<00:03:11.370> focus<00:03:11.609> is<00:03:11.940> because<00:03:12.239> if<00:03:12.359> I<00:03:12.450> do

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
know where my focus is because if I do

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.559 
know where my focus is because if I do
that<00:03:12.840> then<00:03:13.700> hopefully<00:03:14.700> that'll<00:03:14.880> be<00:03:14.970> more<00:03:15.420> than

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
that then hopefully that'll be more than

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.660 
that then hopefully that'll be more than
enough<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:16.139> obviously<00:03:16.769> not<00:03:17.040> know<00:03:17.250> then<00:03:17.489> get

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
enough to obviously not know then get
