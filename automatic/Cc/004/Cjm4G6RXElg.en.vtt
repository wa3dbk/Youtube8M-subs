kind<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.890> things<00:00:29.039> we're<00:00:30.000> obviously<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.359> known

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
kind of things we're obviously not known

kind of things we're obviously not known
back<00:00:30.900> then<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.980> discard<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
back then so it you discard what you

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.780 
back then so it you discard what you
think<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.090> junk<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.570> later<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.340> card<00:00:35.610> may

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
think is junk and later on that card may

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
think is junk and later on that card may
actually<00:00:35.940> become<00:00:36.270> valuable<00:00:36.780> you'll<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.200> that

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
actually become valuable you'll see that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.440 
actually become valuable you'll see that
once<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> while<00:00:38.190> here<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.940> kind<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.210> shocked
