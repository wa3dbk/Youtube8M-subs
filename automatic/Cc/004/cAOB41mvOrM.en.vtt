00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.840
 with the support of the public fan hello who 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.480
 With you krasin Fink and you look 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.670
 program 11 here and only here we 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.889
 compare people events and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.170
 phenomena last week we figured out 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.449
 what is cooler modern or classic 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.789
 art and surprisingly that in our age 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.770
 where modern art has become a part 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.199
 of our time most viewers 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.270
 voted for classical art 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.369
 and today in the one on one program we 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.070
 as well as before we face each other 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.660
 old and new 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.980
 e-books against ordinary 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.300
 First of all, I will say why you need to read 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.100
 when a person thinks he has 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.230
 increases vocabulary and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.570
 improving the ability to speak beautifully 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.890
 also if an ordinary person starts reading 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.140
 fiction 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.579
 namely satire then when reading will begin 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.219
 gradual borrowing varied 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.320
 behaviors in different situations 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.809
 that is, if you summarize all of the above 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.879
 thanks to absolutely any literature 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.010
 a person can independently build 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.229
 my identity but today we will analyze 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.420
 what devices are worth doing it 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.100
 electronic books or paper when 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.499
 books were the only way 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.599
 get knowledge and experience then nature 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:18.119
 paid for it with their forests and 

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:19.529
 bowls wood prices went up and in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.359
 mainly for paper making 

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:23.099
 cotton straw is used or 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.349
 waste paper it helps to reduce 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:27.329
 transportation costs summer and 

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:29.549
 actually reduce the already high 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.829
 speed of deforestation so today 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.990
 books can be read without fear that 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.789
 because of them they cut down a bunch of forests while reading 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.889
 ordinary paper books 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.020
 some people enjoy a 

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:41.969
 tactile sensation contrary to what 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.509
 paper book is not convenient to take with you 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.550
 the trip 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.710
 they are too strong after sight 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.180
 because of the small print anyway purchase 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.040
 paper book is first and foremost 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.380
 thanks to the author for the spent 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.540
 work but the acquisition of electronic 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.520
 Books have nothing to bother you from 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.560
 order to get a book even 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.720
 without getting up from the sofa ending with 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.520
 you may not even pay the author for it 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.680
 labor download pirated instance 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.760
 recognize it pretty mean by 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.520
 relation to the author 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.500
 now almost every house has a couple 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.900
 bookcases that take up quite 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.850
 much space and discard the contents 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.040
 these cabinets even hand does not rise 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.140
 especially if every book was bought 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.600
 of their blood here so it will stand 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.370
 this is a wardrobe further until the person has 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.170
 will buy an e-book in which you 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.390
 easily fit several cabinets 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 completely content and indeed for 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.200
 current youth who are studying in 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.120
 schools would be more convenient and most important 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.430
 more useful to carry one electronic 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.590
 a book rather than carrying 6 kilograms 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.290
 textbooks here and grows then 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.810
 generation with crooked backs but some 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.180
 parents even now limit their 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.980
 young children from such conveniently saying they say 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.020
 we can't afford it 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.750
 but actually one ebook 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.000
 can 1 5 recoup all tutorials it 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.670
 pretty good way with trees 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.350
 or budget smartphones dexp ixion need 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.350
 charge only once a week 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.070
 one charge is enough for 7 days and prices 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.850
