00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
on this unit is that this black exit

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.660 
on this unit is that this black exit
assembly<00:00:39.210> wouldn't<00:00:39.899> come<00:00:40.079> off<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:41.430> came<00:00:41.640> off

assembly wouldn't come off it came off

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060 
assembly wouldn't come off it came off
and<00:00:42.270> there<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.079> screw<00:00:43.469> down<00:00:43.829> here

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
and there was actually a screw down here

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.979 
and there was actually a screw down here
in<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> corner<00:00:44.640> which<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.300> put<00:00:45.510> mine<00:00:45.690> back<00:00:45.719> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
in the corner which I put mine back in

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.410 
in the corner which I put mine back in

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
but I noticed that the machine I used as

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.410 
but I noticed that the machine I used as
a<00:00:48.450> form<00:00:48.980> for<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.100> procedure<00:00:50.460> actually<00:00:50.969> had

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
a form for this procedure actually had

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
a form for this procedure actually had
been<00:00:51.570> taken<00:00:51.870> apart<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.770> missed<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.190> screw

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
let's go ahead and put the formatter

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
let's go ahead and put the formatter
board<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> put<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:06.030> my

board on I'm not going to put in all my

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.609 
board on I'm not going to put in all my
screws<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.659> I'm<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> try<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> speed<00:01:07.500> this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
screws so I'm going to try to speed this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.109 
screws so I'm going to try to speed this
video<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.189> little<00:01:08.400> bit<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
video up a little bit but you get the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.840 
video up a little bit but you get the
general<00:01:09.450> idea<00:01:10.040> here's<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> silver<00:01:11.520> screws

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
general idea here's the silver screws

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.390 
general idea here's the silver screws
with<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> washers<00:01:12.990> uh<00:01:13.020> built<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:13.830> let's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
with the washers uh built on them let's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.499 
with the washers uh built on them let's
uh<00:01:14.610> put<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> couple<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.540> couple<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.509> and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
friend on these repairs okay and just

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.640 
friend on these repairs okay and just
make<00:04:00.090> sure<00:04:00.120> that<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.570> plastic<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.290> lined<00:04:01.500> up

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
make sure that the plastic is lined up

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.890 
make sure that the plastic is lined up
all<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.830> way<00:04:01.920> around<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:03.300> let's<00:04:03.570> put<00:04:03.750> some

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
all the way around and let's put some

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.410 
all the way around and let's put some
screws<00:04:04.140> back<00:04:04.320> in<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:05.160> couple<00:04:05.520> on<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.850> left<00:04:06.000> side

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.780 

now<00:04:09.680> I'm<00:04:10.680> not<00:04:10.830> going<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.040> talk<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.280> lot<00:04:11.519> after

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
now I'm not going to talk a lot after

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.789 
now I'm not going to talk a lot after
this<00:04:12.120> repair<00:04:12.569> but<00:04:12.750> let's<00:04:12.989> say<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.230> you've

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
this repair but let's say that you've

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.090 
this repair but let's say that you've
got<00:04:13.830> everything<00:04:14.040> done<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:15.889> let's<00:04:16.889> say<00:04:17.010> you

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
got everything done and let's say you

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.250 
got everything done and let's say you
had<00:04:17.250> some<00:04:17.459> jamming<00:04:17.910> issues<00:04:18.269> you're

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
had some jamming issues you're

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.509 
had some jamming issues you're
unfortunately<00:04:19.949> you're<00:04:20.040> going<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.190> have<00:04:20.250> to

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
unfortunately you're going to have to

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.219 
unfortunately you're going to have to
take<00:04:20.699> the<00:04:20.820> machine<00:04:21.120> back<00:04:21.359> apart<00:04:21.780> again

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
take the machine back apart again

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.260 
take the machine back apart again
and<00:04:22.620> you're<00:04:22.800> going<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:22.949> have<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.280> look<00:04:23.850> at<00:04:24.030> some

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
and you're going to have to look at some

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.770 
and you're going to have to look at some
of<00:04:24.300> these<00:04:24.479> uh<00:04:25.610> making<00:04:26.610> sure<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.210> the

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
of these uh making sure that the the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.810 
of these uh making sure that the the
gear<00:04:27.990> cluster<00:04:28.470> is<00:04:28.620> correct<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.370> whatnot

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
gear cluster is correct and whatnot

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.340 
gear cluster is correct and whatnot
that's<00:04:30.030> why<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.240> said<00:04:30.479> take<00:04:30.660> your<00:04:30.690> time<00:04:31.139> when

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
that's why I said take your time when

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.129 
that's why I said take your time when
you<00:04:31.440> were<00:04:31.530> doing<00:04:31.740> those<00:04:31.889> gears<00:04:32.870> let's<00:04:33.870> say<00:04:34.080> you

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
you were doing those gears let's say you

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.409 
you were doing those gears let's say you
put<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.440> back<00:04:34.560> together<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.190> got<00:04:35.419> some

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
put it back together and you got some

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.480 
put it back together and you got some
error<00:04:36.660> code<00:04:36.930> lights<00:04:37.229> on<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.590> display<00:04:38.160> and

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
error code lights on the display and

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.770 
error code lights on the display and
again<00:04:38.760> you'd<00:04:38.880> have<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.180> go<00:04:39.270> on<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.449> internet

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
again you'd have to go on the internet

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.400 
again you'd have to go on the internet
and<00:04:40.080> look<00:04:40.530> up<00:04:40.680> those<00:04:40.889> error<00:04:41.190> codes<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.289> was

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
and look up those error codes and it was

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.290 
and look up those error codes and it was
a<00:04:43.440> fuser<00:04:43.800> error<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.400> probably<00:04:44.880> one<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.210> your

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
a fuser error that probably one of your

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.650 
a fuser error that probably one of your
wiring<00:04:45.660> harnesses<00:04:46.110> wasn't<00:04:46.530> correct<00:04:47.270> okay<00:04:48.270> now

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
wiring harnesses wasn't correct okay now

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.689 
wiring harnesses wasn't correct okay now
we<00:04:48.720> got<00:04:48.930> this<00:04:49.080> up<00:04:49.289> now<00:04:49.919> we<00:04:49.979> can<00:04:50.190> reinstall<00:04:50.430> the

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
we got this up now we can reinstall the

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.580 
we got this up now we can reinstall the
duplexing<00:04:51.360> assembly<00:04:51.750> what<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:51.930> like<00:04:52.139> to<00:04:52.260> do<00:04:52.380> is

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
duplexing assembly what I like to do is

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.279 
duplexing assembly what I like to do is
just<00:04:52.940> kind<00:04:53.940> of<00:04:54.199> grab<00:04:55.199> a<00:04:55.229> hold<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:57.289> get

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
just kind of grab a hold of it and get

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.689 
just kind of grab a hold of it and get
this<00:04:58.440> pin<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.680> go<00:04:58.919> back<00:04:59.130> into<00:04:59.340> its<00:04:59.550> little

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
this pin to go back into its little

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.629 
this pin to go back into its little
socket<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:01.470> you'll<00:05:01.770> see<00:05:01.979> that<00:05:02.039> you'll<00:05:02.430> see

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
socket and you'll see that you'll see

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:10.010 
socket and you'll see that you'll see
exactly<00:05:03.060> where<00:05:03.539> it<00:05:03.630> goes<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.850> you'll<00:05:09.780> get<00:05:09.870> the

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
exactly where it goes and you'll get the

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.890 
exactly where it goes and you'll get the
left<00:05:10.199> side<00:05:10.440> on<00:05:10.620> first<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.539> then<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:12.720> right

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
left side on first and then the right

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.610 
left side on first and then the right
side<00:05:14.479> got<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.570> kind<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.810> line<00:05:16.020> them<00:05:16.139> both<00:05:16.320> up

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
side got to kind of line them both up

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:24.529 
side got to kind of line them both up
this<00:05:17.550> is<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:17.910> hardest<00:05:18.180> part<00:05:23.330> I'm<00:05:24.330> almost

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
this is the hardest part I'm almost

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:25.779 
this is the hardest part I'm almost
there

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
there

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.800 
there
it's<00:05:26.789> kind<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.060> weird<00:05:27.210> with<00:05:27.450> these<00:05:27.599> machines

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
it's kind of weird with these machines

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.710 
it's kind of weird with these machines
they're<00:05:28.289> actually<00:05:28.710> uh<00:05:29.210> they're<00:05:30.210> built<00:05:30.479> with

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
they're actually uh they're built with

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.279 
they're actually uh they're built with
the<00:05:31.229> duplex<00:05:32.240> assembly<00:05:34.669> with<00:05:35.669> the<00:05:36.240> model<00:05:36.690> not

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
the duplex assembly with the model not

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.430 
the duplex assembly with the model not
being<00:05:37.620> a<00:05:37.740> duplexer<00:05:38.370> and<00:05:38.699> actually<00:05:39.389> so<00:05:40.289> it's

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
being a duplexer and actually so it's

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.990 
being a duplexer and actually so it's
kind<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.740> strange<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.160> machine<00:05:41.460> is<00:05:41.580> actually

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
kind of strange the machine is actually

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.710 
kind of strange the machine is actually
has<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.229> duplexer<00:05:43.800> built<00:05:44.070> into<00:05:44.340> it<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:44.720> let's

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
has the duplexer built into it and let's

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.779 
has the duplexer built into it and let's
put<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:45.900> screw<00:05:46.139> in<00:05:46.199> the<00:05:46.320> front<00:05:46.560> right<00:05:47.720> and<00:05:49.789> it's

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
put a screw in the front right and it's

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.520 
put a screw in the front right and it's
the<00:05:51.000> actual<00:05:51.300> board<00:05:51.660> that<00:05:51.900> controls<00:05:52.139> the

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
the actual board that controls the

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.500 
the actual board that controls the
duplexing<00:05:53.130> so<00:05:53.340> you<00:05:53.789> may<00:05:53.910> not<00:05:54.090> have<00:05:54.150> bought<00:05:54.389> it

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
duplexing so you may not have bought it

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.980 
duplexing so you may not have bought it
15<00:05:54.960> 20<00:05:55.560> d<00:05:56.130> which<00:05:56.580> stands<00:05:56.970> for<00:05:57.060> duplexer<00:05:57.750> but

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
15 20 d which stands for duplexer but

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.860 
15 20 d which stands for duplexer but
the<00:05:58.310> board<00:05:59.310> itself<00:05:59.610> is<00:05:59.849> actually<00:06:00.030> what

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
the board itself is actually what

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.450 
the board itself is actually what
controls<00:06:01.320> it<00:06:01.500> but<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.740> mission's<00:06:02.039> actually

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
controls it but the mission's actually

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.800 
controls it but the mission's actually
already<00:06:02.789> equipped<00:06:03.150> with<00:06:03.300> all<00:06:03.419> the<00:06:03.449> hardware

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
already equipped with all the hardware

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.610 
already equipped with all the hardware
for<00:06:04.169> it<00:06:04.880> okay<00:06:05.910> let's<00:06:06.389> go<00:06:06.570> ahead<00:06:06.690> now<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.380> just

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
for it okay let's go ahead now and just
