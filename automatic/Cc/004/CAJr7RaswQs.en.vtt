and all the guns that were available

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.600 
and all the guns that were available
only<00:01:25.600> real<00:01:25.780> time<00:01:28.800> it's<00:01:29.800> always<00:01:30.160> nice<00:01:30.340> when<00:01:30.490> you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
only real time it's always nice when you

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.870 
only real time it's always nice when you
have<00:01:30.729> an<00:01:30.820> authentic<00:01:31.240> location<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.930> shoot<00:01:32.080> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
have an authentic location to shoot in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.340 
have an authentic location to shoot in
it's<00:01:33.880> got<00:01:34.090> its<00:01:34.240> own<00:01:34.300> character<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:34.900> feeling

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
it's got its own character and feeling

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.290 
it's got its own character and feeling
and<00:01:35.560> I<00:01:35.710> think<00:01:35.770> Kobe<00:01:36.130> really<00:01:36.610> works<00:01:36.850> hard<00:01:37.090> to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
and I think Kobe really works hard to

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.300 
and I think Kobe really works hard to
find<00:01:37.570> something<00:01:38.380> genuine<00:01:38.830> on<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.070> shooting

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
find something genuine on the shooting

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.340 
find something genuine on the shooting
on<00:01:39.460> sets<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:39.970> really<00:01:40.660> not<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.930> same<00:01:40.960> thing

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
on sets is really not the same thing

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:58.070 
on sets is really not the same thing
when<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:41.890> see<00:01:42.100> these<00:01:42.310> places
