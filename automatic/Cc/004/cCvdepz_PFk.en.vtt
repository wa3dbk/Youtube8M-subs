 carrying out its activities for this purpose. 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.730
 construction companies need to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.520
 safety standards 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 generating the professionals involved in the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 more quality work environment and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.789
 I'm here for a personal fulfillment. 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.400
 work of the plaenge group we are realizing 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.650
 a security rescue simulation of the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 Work will engineer alceu gomes 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.489
 talk to people that with the importance of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.710
 this simulation is performed with this 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.440
 rescue simulation works height at 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.559
 people do periodically just 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.770
 ready to provide these activities is 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.899
 rescue we chose to have this team 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.789
 of security and being neither the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.170
 own technicians and extras that make 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.480
 This work is the work that the group 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.270
 of the legend it benefits the employees 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.730
 gives more security and certainly not 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.250
 people already have the teams and brigades of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.189
 emergency has the master's involvement 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.320
 in charge of the group's 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.960
 and the safety technicians together 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.580
 with me then we already have the brigades 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.070
 emergency we also now have this 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.280
 the team that makes the rescue in 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.979
 height security rescue link s 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.610
 currently works with r 35 that does not 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.920
 requires training of this team of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.299
 rescue the knowledge of the work all 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 this will really provide more 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.479
 security will leave the employee 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.909
 quiet in your activities 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.090
 Yes, we certainly do it. 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.430
 not only in this work but also in other 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.930
 to show you our work, right? 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.610
 so talk to us a little bit more 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.680
 protection equipment. 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.110
 personal protective equipment 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.840
 people begin to give an instruction to 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.579
 all in integration is what we do 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 with everyone who enters the flowerbeds 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.990
 part of the training the student 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.490
 only about the height equipment 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.070
 required for work in height 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.110
 specifically the safety belt of 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.899
 all of the teams is the belt so that 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.600
 said this belt normally used 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.280
 to stop the fall yes debts anyway 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.349
 for the specific jobs of 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.720
 facades on the outskirts of the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.410
 Rescue personnel we have a belt 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.870
 esp 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.480
 risk to make the rescue is not the same 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.610
 which is used for activities such as 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.190
 We are talking now about the rescue work. 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.430
 sixth he has a specific belt that 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.680
 has some devices in addition to the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.010
 staff is accustomed to using one of the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.310
 devices that are you saw is the brake 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.220
 8 and another the brake gri This is a kind of 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.620
 decomposition that we have chosen to do 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.780
 in our rescue kit in height 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.540
 there are several ways you can make 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.030
 composition of this kit, this is what the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.500
 most people found it suitable for this type 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.690
 work that we are 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.850
 performing here in the work to know 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.560
 as well as security functions within 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.690
 a work that for the employees who 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.240
 is doing a simulation and I'm 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.370
 I submitted to being the victim who rescued 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.980
 a large number of national companies 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.810
 sector is firmly committed to the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.220
 effort to further improve this 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.620
 professionals' situation 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.240
 a good strategy is to activate partnerships 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.250
 with trade unions and 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.250
 specialized government
