you're<00:00:14.500> going<00:00:14.830> to<00:00:15.130> demonstrate<00:00:15.790> all<00:00:16.600> of<00:00:16.960> the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
you're going to demonstrate all of the

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.280 
you're going to demonstrate all of the
major<00:00:17.260> phases<00:00:17.770> of<00:00:18.130> the<00:00:18.190> Moon<00:00:18.580> and<00:00:19.020> first<00:00:20.020> let's

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
major phases of the Moon and first let's

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
major phases of the Moon and first let's
consider<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:22.270> moon<00:00:22.570> out<00:00:23.080> in<00:00:23.500> space<00:00:23.890> is

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
consider that the moon out in space is

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.280 
consider that the moon out in space is
always<00:00:25.260> passing<00:00:26.260> shadow<00:00:26.590> and<00:00:27.130> hacen<00:00:27.910> light

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.290 
always passing shadow and hacen light

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.490 
always passing shadow and hacen light
just<00:00:29.290> like<00:00:29.680> the<00:00:30.010> earth<00:00:30.250> is<00:00:30.670> our<00:00:31.180> first<00:00:32.050> phase

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
just like the earth is our first phase

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.900 
just like the earth is our first phase
is<00:00:32.920> new<00:00:33.700> moon<00:00:34.059> this<00:00:34.930> takes<00:00:35.260> place<00:00:35.680> when<00:00:36.610> the

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
is new moon this takes place when the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.010 
is new moon this takes place when the
moon<00:00:37.420> is<00:00:37.840> directly<00:00:38.680> in<00:00:39.160> between<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.690> Sun

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
moon is directly in between the Sun

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.490 
moon is directly in between the Sun
which<00:00:41.980> has<00:00:42.220> set<00:00:42.489> behind<00:00:42.670> me<00:00:43.360> and<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:44.260> earth

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
which has set behind me and the earth

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.229 
which has set behind me and the earth
that's<00:00:45.100> you<00:00:46.200> now<00:00:47.200> when<00:00:47.739> the<00:00:47.980> moon<00:00:48.399> moves<00:00:48.910> out

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
that's you now when the moon moves out

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.900 
that's you now when the moon moves out
of<00:00:49.270> that<00:00:49.570> direct<00:00:49.989> alignment<00:00:50.460> you'll<00:00:51.460> begin<00:00:51.850> to

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
of that direct alignment you'll begin to

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.760 
of that direct alignment you'll begin to
see<00:00:52.120> a<00:00:52.840> small<00:00:53.640> Crescent<00:00:55.170> which<00:00:56.170> has<00:00:56.440> the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
see a small Crescent which has the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.170 
see a small Crescent which has the
couple<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.430> days<00:00:57.760> go<00:00:58.270> by<00:00:58.530> becomes<00:00:59.530> a<00:01:00.180> larger

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
couple of days go by becomes a larger

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.350 
couple of days go by becomes a larger
crescent<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.219> then<00:01:03.219> when<00:01:03.489> about<00:01:03.760> one<00:01:04.089> week

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
crescent and then when about one week

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.260 
crescent and then when about one week
has<00:01:04.600> passed<00:01:04.630> we've<00:01:05.619> got<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.310> first<00:01:06.640> quarter

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
has passed we've got the first quarter

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
moon as the moon continues on we have

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.030 
moon as the moon continues on we have
the<00:01:14.410> waxing<00:01:15.070> gibbous<00:01:15.100> phase<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.710> week

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
the waxing gibbous phase and one week

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.180 
the waxing gibbous phase and one week
after<00:01:18.670> first<00:01:19.630> quarter<00:01:20.080> moon<00:01:20.260> we<00:01:20.740> have<00:01:20.979> the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
after first quarter moon we have the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.289 
after first quarter moon we have the
full<00:01:21.220> moon<00:01:22.290> rising<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.619> east<00:01:24.250> as<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:25.000> Sun

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
full moon rising in the east as the Sun

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.750
