00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
the full run so you gotta test an

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.180 
the full run so you gotta test an
opponent<00:01:08.170> right<00:01:08.320> away<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.650> see<00:01:08.950> what<00:01:09.100> he's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
opponent right away to see what he's

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.609

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.280 
capable of hitting the ball on the run
and<00:01:12.190> secondly<00:01:12.850> what<00:01:13.180> type<00:01:13.390> of<00:01:13.540> fitness<00:01:13.780> level

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
and secondly what type of fitness level

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.960 
and secondly what type of fitness level
he<00:01:14.350> has<00:01:14.380> because<00:01:15.100> let's<00:01:15.280> face<00:01:15.369> it<00:01:15.549> as<00:01:15.850> the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
he has because let's face it as the

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.270 
he has because let's face it as the
match<00:01:16.150> progresses<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:17.110> you<00:01:17.619> start<00:01:17.920> wearing

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
match progresses and you start wearing

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.890 
match progresses and you start wearing
down<00:01:18.640> it's<00:01:18.940> tougher<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.299> come<00:01:19.479> up<00:01:19.600> with<00:01:19.780> those

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
down it's tougher to come up with those

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:46.680 
down it's tougher to come up with those
runs<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.350> passing<00:01:20.710> shots

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.110 

bad<00:01:47.690> luck<00:01:48.620> then<00:01:48.830> maybe<00:01:49.070> one<00:01:49.490> not<00:01:49.730> like<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.030> ask

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
bad luck then maybe one not like to ask

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.570 
bad luck then maybe one not like to ask
you<00:01:50.420> on<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:50.960> hot<00:01:51.170> bullet<00:01:51.530> bad<00:01:51.710> tactic<00:01:52.160> drop

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
you on the hot bullet bad tactic drop

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.520 
you on the hot bullet bad tactic drop
volley<00:01:52.820> perhaps<00:01:53.270> well<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.050> ball<00:01:54.230> is<00:01:54.260> gonna

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
volley perhaps well the ball is gonna

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.500 
volley perhaps well the ball is gonna
sit<00:01:54.830> up<00:01:54.980> more<00:01:55.220> obviously<00:01:55.700> as<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.850> truer<00:01:56.150> bounce

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
sit up more obviously as a truer bounce

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.090 
sit up more obviously as a truer bounce
and<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.080> ball<00:01:57.260> is<00:01:57.350> going<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.530> bounce<00:01:57.710> higher

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
and the ball is going to bounce higher

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.370 
and the ball is going to bounce higher
because<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.850> courts<00:01:59.150> harder<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.080> there's<00:02:00.260> not

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
because the courts harder so there's not

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.140 
because the courts harder so there's not
as<00:02:00.530> much<00:02:00.710> gift<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.370> that's<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.700> more<00:02:01.880> dangerous

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
as much gift so that's a more dangerous

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.410 
as much gift so that's a more dangerous
shot<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.710> likelihood<00:02:03.950> with<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.580> these

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
shot so the likelihood with the these

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.510 
shot so the likelihood with the these
guys<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:06.080> girls<00:02:06.440> being<00:02:06.680> such<00:02:06.980> great<00:02:07.310> athletes

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
guys and girls being such great athletes

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.340 
guys and girls being such great athletes
today<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.720> they're<00:02:08.869> going<00:02:08.960> to<00:02:09.050> be<00:02:09.140> able<00:02:09.200> to

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
today that they're going to be able to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.860 
today that they're going to be able to
track<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.590> ball<00:02:10.010> down<00:02:10.310> oh<00:02:16.240> hell<00:02:17.240> let<00:02:17.570> me<00:02:17.600> see

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
track that ball down oh hell let me see

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.780 
track that ball down oh hell let me see
that<00:02:17.900> we<00:02:18.230> never<00:02:18.470> see<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.860> girls<00:02:19.070> diving<00:02:19.580> for<00:02:19.760> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
that we never see the girls diving for a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.700 
that we never see the girls diving for a
volley<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:20.630> they<00:02:20.870> she<00:02:21.050> did<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.470> she's

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
volley then they she did it and she's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:42.060 
volley then they she did it and she's
done<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.980> perfectly<00:02:40.510> what<00:02:41.510> do<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:41.660> do<00:02:41.840> now

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
done it perfectly what do you do now

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.950 
done it perfectly what do you do now
just<00:02:43.070> go<00:02:43.280> for<00:02:43.490> even<00:02:43.610> more<00:02:43.940> take<00:02:44.390> something<00:02:44.810> off

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
just go for even more take something off

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.780 
just go for even more take something off
it<00:02:45.170> stay<00:02:45.410> back<00:02:45.710> -<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:45.980> switched<00:02:46.250> gears<00:02:46.550> that

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
it stay back - you switched gears that

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.060 
it stay back - you switched gears that
fast<00:02:47.120> well<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.989> think<00:02:48.170> first<00:02:48.800> couple<00:02:49.040> of

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
fast well you think first couple of

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.520 
fast well you think first couple of
points<00:02:49.340> have<00:02:49.430> been<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.550> bit<00:02:49.700> rusty<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:50.959> don't

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
points have been a bit rusty so I don't

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.080 
points have been a bit rusty so I don't
think<00:02:51.680> he's<00:02:51.770> got<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.070> hoping<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:52.550> you

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
think he's got to be hoping that you

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.760 
think he's got to be hoping that you
know<00:02:53.150> it's<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.600> bit<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.810> rhythm<00:02:53.959> here<00:02:54.290> maybe<00:02:54.590> not

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
know it's a bit of rhythm here maybe not
