mode photos now you'll probably notice

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.650 
mode photos now you'll probably notice
that<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.859> not<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.400> fast<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:17.940> least<00:00:18.150> right

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
that it's not that fast at least right

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.269 
that it's not that fast at least right
there<00:00:18.990> let<00:00:19.590> me<00:00:19.619> show<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.890> some<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
there let me show you some of the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.099 
there let me show you some of the
options<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.820> can<00:00:21.000> find<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.449> burst<00:00:21.660> mode<00:00:21.900> you

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
options you can find in burst mode you

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.429 
options you can find in burst mode you
have<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.590> whole<00:00:23.189> time<00:00:23.550> delay<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.390> amount<00:00:25.380> of

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
have a whole time delay so the amount of

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.349 
have a whole time delay so the amount of
time<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.859> takes<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.430> hold<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.880> shutter<00:00:27.240> button

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
time it takes to hold the shutter button

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.109 
time it takes to hold the shutter button
before<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.349> burst<00:00:28.529> mode<00:00:28.769> isn't<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.189> enacted

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
before the burst mode isn't is enacted

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.780 
before the burst mode isn't is enacted
or<00:00:30.240> activated<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.009> burst

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
or activated then you have the burst

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.959 
or activated then you have the burst
mode<00:00:32.940> interval<00:00:33.780> below<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.790> as<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
mode interval below that and as you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.850 
mode interval below that and as you
adjust<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.600> slider<00:00:37.020> little<00:00:37.590> knob<00:00:37.829> here

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
adjust the slider little knob here

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
adjust the slider little knob here
you'll<00:00:38.460> notice<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.149> interval<00:00:39.629> changes

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you'll notice that the interval changes

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.590 
you'll notice that the interval changes
along<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.890> slider<00:00:41.160> below<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:42.420> also

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
along with the slider below you also

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.959 
along with the slider below you also
have<00:00:42.899> something<00:00:43.230> called<00:00:43.379> safe<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:44.940> you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
have something called safe and if you

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.360 
have something called safe and if you
scroll<00:00:45.270> down<00:00:45.329> you'll<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.780> what<00:00:46.500> safe<00:00:46.800> does<00:00:47.129> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
scroll down you'll see what safe does it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.950 
scroll down you'll see what safe does it
basically<00:00:47.489> allows<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.420> continue<00:00:48.690> taking

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
basically allows you to continue taking

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
basically allows you to continue taking
photos<00:00:49.410> only<00:00:49.649> if<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.250> previous<00:00:50.489> photo<00:00:50.910> is

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
photos only if the previous photo is

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
photos only if the previous photo is
written<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.020> photo<00:00:52.230> album<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.620> basically

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
written in the photo album so basically

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.010 
written in the photo album so basically
this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> way<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.850> prevent<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.989> from

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
this is a way to prevent it from

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
this is a way to prevent it from
crashing<00:00:55.710> your<00:00:55.800> device<00:00:56.039> or<00:00:56.250> preventing<00:00:56.640> bugs

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
crashing your device or preventing bugs

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.930 
crashing your device or preventing bugs
when<00:00:57.539> capturing<00:00:58.079> lots<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.680> photos<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.730> let<00:00:59.879> me

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
when capturing lots of photos so let me

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490 
when capturing lots of photos so let me
just<00:01:00.090> test<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.629> again<00:01:00.930> show<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> guys

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
just test it out again show you guys

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.990 
just test it out again show you guys
again<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.309> works<00:01:02.520> out

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
again how this works out

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.270 
again how this works out
you<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.420> tap<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.840> hold<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.129> have

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you just tap and hold and then you have

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.130 
you just tap and hold and then you have
that<00:01:05.430> whole<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:06.060> interval<00:01:06.510> which<00:01:06.659> passes

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
that whole time interval which passes

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.800 
that whole time interval which passes
and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> burst<00:01:07.920> mode<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.460> activated<00:01:09.150> now

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and then the burst mode is activated now

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.260 
and then the burst mode is activated now
you'll<00:01:09.960> notice<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> shutter<00:01:11.270> animation

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
you'll notice that the shutter animation

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.700 
you'll notice that the shutter animation
is<00:01:12.420> still<00:01:12.659> there<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.560> actually

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
is still there if we we can actually

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.030 
is still there if we we can actually
eliminate<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.729> iris<00:01:15.720> shutter<00:01:16.380> animation

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
eliminate that iris shutter animation

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.420 
eliminate that iris shutter animation
and<00:01:17.280> make<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.180> photos<00:01:18.540> go<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> lot<00:01:19.229> faster<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.100> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and make the photos go a lot faster so I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.280 
and make the photos go a lot faster so I
can<00:01:20.700> disable<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.270> iris<00:01:21.570> animation<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.140> can

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
can disable the iris animation I can

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.130 
can disable the iris animation I can
disable<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.830> preview<00:01:23.250> animation<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.140> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
disable the preview animation and you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.719 
disable the preview animation and you
also<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.500> some<00:01:25.650> other<00:01:25.920> options<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.430> flash

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
also have some other options for flash

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.969 
also have some other options for flash
burst<00:01:27.090> HDR<00:01:27.659> burst<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> want<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
burst HDR burst if you want to do that

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.700 
burst HDR burst if you want to do that
but<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:30.060> those<00:01:30.210> animations<00:01:30.659> go<00:01:31.140> notice<00:01:31.560> how

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
but what those animations go notice how

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.649 
but what those animations go notice how
much<00:01:31.860> faster<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.700> when<00:01:32.970> taking<00:01:33.420> photos

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
much faster it is when taking photos

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.460 
much faster it is when taking photos
using<00:01:34.350> burst<00:01:34.680> mode<00:01:35.329> see<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:36.990> faster

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
using burst mode see that a lot faster

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.780 
using burst mode see that a lot faster
you<00:01:37.500> don't<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> deal<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.100> animations

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you don't have to deal with animations

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.969 
you don't have to deal with animations
you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.509> quickly<00:01:39.810> take<00:01:40.140> photos<00:01:40.530> now

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you can just quickly take photos now

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.190 
you can just quickly take photos now
still<00:01:41.610> even<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.630> those<00:01:42.810> animations

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
still even with those animations

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.100 
still even with those animations
disabled<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.520> fast<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.329> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.770 
here in just a second here I'll go ahead
and<00:02:24.560> take<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.740> photo<00:02:25.100> burst<00:02:26.060> mode<00:02:26.270> photo<00:02:26.480> just

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
and take a photo burst mode photo just

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.410 
and take a photo burst mode photo just
tap<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:27.110> hold<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.710> look<00:02:28.550> how<00:02:28.700> much<00:02:29.000> faster

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
tap and hold and look how much faster

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420 
tap and hold and look how much faster
that<00:02:29.720> is<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.560> animation<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.310> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
that is you have the animation on the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.650 
that is you have the animation on the
preview<00:02:31.760> at<00:02:31.910> least<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.240> don't<00:02:32.360> get<00:02:32.510> that

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
preview at least you don't get that

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.720 
preview at least you don't get that
animation<00:02:33.200> with<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.890> shutter<00:02:34.160> all<00:02:34.460> that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
animation with the shutter all that

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.360 
animation with the shutter all that
because<00:02:35.000> that's<00:02:35.180> gonna<00:02:35.450> no<00:02:35.780> 7<00:02:36.230> but<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.040> do<00:02:37.220> get

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
because that's gonna no 7 but you do get

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.830 
because that's gonna no 7 but you do get
that<00:02:37.490> preview<00:02:37.880> animation<00:02:38.390> in<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.600> bottom

left hand corner and then it's just

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.520 
left hand corner and then it's just
really<00:02:40.640> fast<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.210> efficient<00:02:41.720> as<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.350> see

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530
