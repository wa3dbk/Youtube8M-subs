leveling off and everything that's going

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.789 
leveling off and everything that's going
to<00:03:55.000> be<00:03:55.060> on<00:03:55.180> your<00:03:55.359> front<00:03:55.540> gangs<00:03:55.810> okay<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.680> then

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
on your side to side then basically

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.599 
on your side to side then basically
blocks<00:03:59.170> on<00:03:59.439> one<00:03:59.650> side<00:03:59.890> if<00:04:00.069> you're<00:04:00.189> actually<00:04:00.370> in

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
blocks on one side if you're actually in

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.640 
blocks on one side if you're actually in
a<00:04:00.670> place<00:04:00.909> that's<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.299> far<00:04:01.569> off<00:04:01.599> okay<00:04:02.409> most

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
a place that's that far off okay most

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.619 
a place that's that far off okay most
times<00:04:02.859> these<00:04:03.040> RV<00:04:03.400> parts<00:04:03.640> it<00:04:03.849> got<00:04:04.030> pretty<00:04:04.239> level

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
times these RV parts it got pretty level

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.640 
times these RV parts it got pretty level
ground<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.079> you're<00:04:05.200> not<00:04:05.290> going<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.560> be<00:04:05.620> that

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
ground so you're not going to be that

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.619 
ground so you're not going to be that
far<00:04:06.010> off<00:04:06.040> as<00:04:06.400> far<00:04:06.579> as<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.790> side<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.120> side<00:04:07.329> goes

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
far off as far as the side to side goes

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.869 
far off as far as the side to side goes
you're<00:04:08.319> not<00:04:08.470> gonna<00:04:08.560> have<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.010> bump<00:04:09.159> blocks<00:04:09.609> on

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
you're not gonna have a bump blocks on

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.789 
you're not gonna have a bump blocks on
one<00:04:10.090> side<00:04:10.359> here<00:04:10.689> didn't<00:04:11.019> want<00:04:11.170> to<00:04:11.230> get<00:04:11.409> to

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
one side here didn't want to get to
