 Machine tilt OS 4 points 1 

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:12.199
 I wish to introduce innovations 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:13.210
 on the one hand 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.490
 like to be performance problems to date, the iPhone 3g occurred 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.690

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.589
 Tester with these covering been moved 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.019
 on the other hand, sometimes Bluetooth problems 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.159
 that's why 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.900
 Thomas Holl more Firth and Bonham headset has Seifert easy 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.590

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.210
 and there probably higher proximity sensor which is found up here 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.609

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:48.740
 Ember fuel at Eltville market this was accidentally with 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.840

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.030

 the innovations as you can see 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.140
 come now the SRH at the can stop 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
 if Parreira sees what she's up there 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.860
 I can turn it off 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.450
 No nothing but Konstanzer flashes on Ramsthal's varieties too 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.250

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.590
 Hold back Philippe 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.530
 it is very fast 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.430
 What is Hertha has Dr 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.510
 He made 13 pictures 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.690
 and then put them together into one which is also that contrasts brightness 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.420
 and to see everything better I also have a few 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.120
 compares 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 photos taken 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.450

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.649

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.039
 Paris and pictures and it better to do this Loading landscape paintings left 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.299
 downstairs everything is relatively dark 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.929
 Sun have 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.669
 Melzer is sitting clearly stronger and not stuff 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.819
 One recognizes with so much quotes this much darker 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.600
 just looks beautiful it says full on also the sky the clouds municipalities 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.809
 over to validity 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:33.009
 what has not fallen like this, I still have a world 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.279
 you can see the very dark parts down here as well 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.249
 as Mr. Dr lightened the whole thing up a bit 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.469
 and just looks 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.569
 Round off and as well last but not least this picture here 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:49.019
 and for the comparative test had met humor, too, that really does 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:49.959
 a lot of 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.359
 more beautiful 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.889
 that's a novelty Hardy r 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.859
 the other is still painting once considered now guys 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:04.329
 On the iPhone, too, you find the Finn catching everything that it does 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.419
 PC 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.689
 already nine points and 10 1 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.400
 is it just here on the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.079
 in women 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.760
 is a kind of Facebook Imhof music forms can also bowed out 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.299
 Also new is that you can borrow in the form of television broadcasts 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.729

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:31.189
 You can now watch videos in HD quality on Mohr at Migrol YouTube 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.429
 from the iPhone 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:34.999
 only 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.689
 when we make ourselves available 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.929
 and I think the biggest change 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:43.269
 is Game Center 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.999
 Kastner 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.279
 PlayStation Network Xbox Live 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.509
 what service 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.679
 with friends themselves 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:55.849
 Lopatka on 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.499

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:00.849
 support 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.989
 then there are not any 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.219
 to have to say but it starts most of the day by dec 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.859
 be handed in later 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.009
 One can and his girlfriend over the center challenges online matches 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:18.719
 For example, the high score was almost a friend at Doodle Jump Watch 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:23.659
 to crack that must demand us banks - could see friends can happen 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.879
 about the census 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.680
 his friends had here 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.370
 Voigt now no names the games 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.599

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.840

 the status 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.300
 because I want 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.200
 You do not like to bet 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.939
 No if you want 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.580
 As I said my teams behind Aldi he is when people 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.309
 finally fall from the fisherman Co 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:59.669
