for Bill Clinton when he was the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.569 
Council and he was governor of Arkansas
and<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.379> a<00:00:34.410> time<00:00:34.710> within<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> party

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and that was a time within the party

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.610 
and that was a time within the party
when<00:00:36.150> everyone<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.750> Democratic<00:00:37.260> Party<00:00:37.410> or

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
when everyone in the Democratic Party or

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.560 
when everyone in the Democratic Party or
maybe<00:00:37.800> outside<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.490> party<00:00:38.790> said<00:00:38.970> no<00:00:39.120> no<00:00:39.390> he's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
maybe outside the party said no no he's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.390 
maybe outside the party said no no he's
too<00:00:39.780> conservative<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.740> a<00:00:40.770> Democrat<00:00:41.220> I

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
too conservative to be a Democrat I

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.130 
too conservative to be a Democrat I
think<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> question<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> labels<00:00:42.960> you're

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
think the question is the labels you're

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.780 
think the question is the labels you're
applying<00:00:43.410> don't<00:00:43.770> apply<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.130> either<00:00:44.400> of<00:00:44.670> these

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
applying don't apply to either of these

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.780 
applying don't apply to either of these
men<00:00:44.850> both<00:00:45.720> of<00:00:45.930> these<00:00:46.050> men<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:47.160> led<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
men both of these men have led and

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.030 
men both of these men have led and
clearly<00:00:48.420> President<00:00:48.989> Obama<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.410> continue<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
clearly President Obama will continue to

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.950 
clearly President Obama will continue to
lead<00:00:50.220> for<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.880> times<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.360> they're<00:00:51.630> in<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:51.930> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
lead for the times that they're in but I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
lead for the times that they're in but I
think<00:00:52.260> you're<00:00:52.410> using<00:00:52.620> antiquated<00:00:53.040> labels

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
think you're using antiquated labels

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.270 
think you're using antiquated labels
that<00:00:53.850> don't<00:00:54.060> represent<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:55.350> only<00:00:55.380> who<00:00:56.070> they

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
that don't represent not only who they

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.590 
that don't represent not only who they
are<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:56.700> they<00:00:56.880> do<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.239> they're<00:00:57.390> both

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
are and what they do but they're both

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
are and what they do but they're both
known<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.290> breaking<00:00:58.500> ground<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.370> doing

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
known for breaking ground and doing

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.950 
known for breaking ground and doing
what's<00:00:59.820> right<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> moving<00:01:00.390> forward<00:01:00.870> as
