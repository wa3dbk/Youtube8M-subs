hey guys welcome to another plugin tutor
on<00:00:08.480> today<00:00:08.719> it's<00:00:08.870> on<00:00:09.110> Nexus<00:00:09.620> inventory<00:00:10.190> so<00:00:11.120> this

is<00:00:11.690> a<00:00:11.930> really<00:00:12.559> good<00:00:12.710> replacement<00:00:13.400> to<00:00:13.700> the

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
is a really good replacement to the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.870 
is a really good replacement to the
multiverse<00:00:14.500> inventory<00:00:15.500> plugin<00:00:15.889> which<00:00:16.609> is

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
multiverse inventory plugin which is

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.880 
multiverse inventory plugin which is
sort<00:00:17.179> of<00:00:17.330> not<00:00:17.510> updated<00:00:18.109> you<00:00:18.259> have<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:18.560> use

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
sort of not updated you have to use

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.529 
sort of not updated you have to use
developer<00:00:19.400> builds<00:00:19.759> which<00:00:19.909> sometimes<00:00:20.359> are

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
developer builds which sometimes are

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.569 
developer builds which sometimes are
broken<00:00:20.929> but<00:00:21.470> this<00:00:21.679> is<00:00:21.769> a<00:00:21.829> really<00:00:22.069> good<00:00:22.220> plugin

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
broken but this is a really good plugin

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.769 
broken but this is a really good plugin
which<00:00:22.699> allows<00:00:22.999> you<00:00:23.239> to<00:00:23.569> save<00:00:24.259> or<00:00:24.649> not<00:00:25.099> save<00:00:25.779> its

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
which allows you to save or not save its

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.929 
which allows you to save or not save its
various<00:00:27.499> different<00:00:27.769> stats<00:00:28.039> such<00:00:28.310> as<00:00:28.579> flying

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
various different stats such as flying

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.889 
various different stats such as flying
hunger<00:00:29.689> health<00:00:31.210> experience<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.750> other

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
hunger health experience and other

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.630 
hunger health experience and other
things<00:00:33.200> including<00:00:33.829> enderchest<00:00:34.100> in<00:00:34.490> your

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
things including enderchest in your

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.210 
things including enderchest in your
inventory<00:00:34.940> when<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:35.870> change<00:00:36.260> worlds<00:00:36.830> so<00:00:37.160> you

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
inventory when you change worlds so you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.060 
inventory when you change worlds so you
can<00:00:37.550> set<00:00:37.700> up<00:00:37.850> different<00:00:38.000> groups<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:38.690> maybe

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
can set up different groups so maybe

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.160 
can set up different groups so maybe
this<00:00:40.070> world<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.760> factions<00:00:41.330> world<00:00:41.540> could<00:00:41.870> save

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
this world and factions world could save

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.920 
this world and factions world could save
the<00:00:42.860> same<00:00:43.070> inventory<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:43.760> experience<00:00:44.300> but

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
the same inventory and experience but

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.420 
the same inventory and experience but
then<00:00:45.050> if<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:45.320> went<00:00:45.410> into<00:00:45.650> creative<00:00:46.250> that

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
then if you went into creative that

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.650 
then if you went into creative that
would<00:00:46.610> have<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:46.940> completely<00:00:47.510> different

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
would have a completely different

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.390 
would have a completely different
inventory<00:00:47.990> and<00:00:48.500> experience

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
inventory and experience

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.200 
inventory and experience
so<00:00:50.150> the<00:00:50.900> rangefinders<00:00:51.380> nexus<00:00:51.770> in<00:00:52.010> help<00:00:52.850> and

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
so the rangefinders nexus in help and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.200 
so the rangefinders nexus in help and
that<00:00:53.420> shows<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:53.780> all<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.990> commands<00:00:54.290> so<00:00:55.210> you

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
that shows you all the commands so you

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.720 
that shows you all the commands so you
can<00:00:56.360> obviously<00:00:56.570> find<00:00:57.500> out<00:00:58.040> information<00:00:58.250> about

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
can obviously find out information about

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.220 
can obviously find out information about
the<00:00:59.030> plugin<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:01.730> page<00:01:02.150> so<00:01:02.690> I'll<00:01:02.930> leave<00:01:03.170> a

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
the plugin and the page so I'll leave a

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.170 
the plugin and the page so I'll leave a
link<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.650> that<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:03.890> description<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.610> you

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
link to that in the description and you

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.760 
link to that in the description and you
can<00:01:05.210> also<00:01:06.340> set<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:08.119> default<00:01:08.509> inventory<00:01:09.350> for<00:01:09.740> a

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
can also set the default inventory for a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.459 
can also set the default inventory for a
world<00:01:10.039> so<00:01:10.640> I'm<00:01:11.179> seeing<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:11.869> before<00:01:12.200> in<00:01:12.319> this

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
world so I'm seeing this before in this

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.859 
world so I'm seeing this before in this
kind<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:12.770> plugin<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:13.819> you<00:01:14.299> could<00:01:14.479> use<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.810> if

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
kind of plugin but you could use that if

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.569 
kind of plugin but you could use that if
you<00:01:14.990> want<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.380> for<00:01:15.409> maybe<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.829> hub<00:01:16.039> server<00:01:16.340> or

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
you want it for maybe a hub server or

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.819 
you want it for maybe a hub server or
factions<00:01:17.149> starter<00:01:17.749> kit<00:01:17.899> or<00:01:18.020> something<00:01:18.319> but<00:01:18.590> I

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
factions starter kit or something but I

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.879 
factions starter kit or something but I
wouldn't<00:01:19.460> use<00:01:19.639> that<00:01:19.850> personally<00:01:20.329> but<00:01:21.139> the

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:21.889 
wouldn't use that personally but the

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.800 
wouldn't use that personally but the
main<00:01:22.069> thing<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.549> in<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.210> config<00:01:23.569> so<00:01:23.689> we're

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
main thing is in the config so we're

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.090 
main thing is in the config so we're
going<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:23.960> hop<00:01:24.139> in<00:01:24.259> there<00:01:24.439> there's<00:01:24.649> two<00:01:24.829> files

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to hop in there there's two files

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.590 
going to hop in there there's two files
there's<00:01:25.490> obviously<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.850> groups<00:01:26.060> file<00:01:26.389> and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
there's obviously the groups file and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.080 
there's obviously the groups file and
the<00:01:26.749> main<00:01:27.020> config<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:27.799> let's<00:01:28.039> go<00:01:28.189> there<00:01:28.369> now<00:01:28.520> so

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
the main config so let's go there now so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.699 
the main config so let's go there now so
if<00:01:29.179> you<00:01:29.270> go<00:01:29.420> into<00:01:29.539> your<00:01:29.630> plugins<00:01:30.049> folder<00:01:30.259> and

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
if you go into your plugins folder and

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:34.059 
if you go into your plugins folder and
find<00:01:31.280> Nexus<00:01:31.670> inventory<00:01:32.149> here<00:01:32.389> it<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.889> you<00:01:33.889> can

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
find Nexus inventory here it is you can

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.910 
find Nexus inventory here it is you can
see<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.340> we<00:01:34.639> have<00:01:34.850> these<00:01:35.090> two<00:01:35.149> main<00:01:35.920> ymail

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
see that we have these two main ymail

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.529 
see that we have these two main ymail
files<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:37.340> it's<00:01:37.490> going<00:01:37.639> to<00:01:37.759> conflict<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.359> begin

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
files so it's going to conflict to begin

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.199 
files so it's going to conflict to begin
with<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:38.840> as<00:01:39.469> you<00:01:39.619> can<00:01:39.770> see<00:01:40.009> here<00:01:40.819> are<00:01:40.939> some<00:01:40.969> of

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
with and as you can see here are some of

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.819 
with and as you can see here are some of
the<00:01:41.329> ones<00:01:41.479> that<00:01:41.749> I<00:01:41.780> mentioned<00:01:41.899> in<00:01:42.229> game<00:01:42.439> and

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
the ones that I mentioned in game and

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.340 
the ones that I mentioned in game and
obviously<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.369> can<00:01:43.609> set<00:01:44.600> them<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:44.810> draw<00:01:45.020> false

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
obviously you can set them to draw false

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.010 
obviously you can set them to draw false
so<00:01:46.310> these<00:01:46.700> will<00:01:46.939> either<00:01:47.060> be<00:01:47.299> saved<00:01:47.659> when<00:01:47.990> you

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
so these will either be saved when you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.440 
so these will either be saved when you
change<00:01:48.380> world<00:01:48.709> or<00:01:49.009> not<00:01:49.639> saved<00:01:49.909> so<00:01:50.359> if

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
change world or not saved so if

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.499 
change world or not saved so if
someone's<00:01:50.749> flying<00:01:51.020> around<00:01:51.259> in<00:01:51.409> creative<00:01:51.799> mode

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
someone's flying around in creative mode

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.069 
someone's flying around in creative mode
in<00:01:53.509> one<00:01:53.719> world

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.370 
Udonis lee don't want that to carry over
into<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.539> next<00:01:56.779> world<00:01:56.959> so<00:01:57.950> um<00:01:58.749> yeah<00:01:59.749> that's

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
as well economy that's very interesting

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.080 
as well economy that's very interesting
I<00:02:11.540> know<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.080> lot<00:02:12.200> of<00:02:12.230> people<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:12.590> been<00:02:12.710> wanting

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
I know a lot of people have been wanting

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.520 
I know a lot of people have been wanting
economy<00:02:13.599> plug-in<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:13.989> works<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.290> different

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
economy plug-in the works in different

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.830 
economy plug-in the works in different
worlds<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.489> with<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.420> can<00:02:16.540> all<00:02:16.629> see

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
worlds so with this you can all see

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.170 
worlds so with this you can all see
setup<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.440> true<00:02:17.650> as<00:02:17.739> well<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.610> yeah<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:19.120> is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
setup to true as well so yeah this is

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.790 
setup to true as well so yeah this is
pretty<00:02:19.660> straightforward<00:02:19.989> then<00:02:20.349> if<00:02:20.500> we<00:02:20.620> go<00:02:20.739> to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
pretty straightforward then if we go to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.479 
pretty straightforward then if we go to
the<00:02:21.010> group's<00:02:21.280> file<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:23.170> have<00:02:23.560> an<00:02:23.920> example

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
the group's file we have an example

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.900 
the group's file we have an example
group<00:02:24.879> here<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.480> as<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.410> can<00:02:26.530> see<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
group here so as you can see this is the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.490 
group here so as you can see this is the
whole<00:02:28.300> game<00:02:28.540> mode<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.080> obviously<00:02:29.290> change

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
whole game mode you can obviously change

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.449 
whole game mode you can obviously change
this<00:02:29.739> so<00:02:30.040> let's<00:02:30.250> go<00:02:30.340> ahead<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.090> copy<00:02:31.720> this

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
this so let's go ahead and copy this

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.300 
this so let's go ahead and copy this
into<00:02:33.459> a<00:02:34.030> new<00:02:34.660> group<00:02:35.080> obviously<00:02:35.349> rename<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.069> so

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
into a new group obviously rename it so

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.430 
into a new group obviously rename it so
maybe<00:02:36.519> being<00:02:37.180> able<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.599> create<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.580> group<00:02:39.580> and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
maybe being able to create a group and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.289 
maybe being able to create a group and
you<00:02:41.440> could<00:02:41.590> add<00:02:41.739> as<00:02:42.310> many<00:02:42.459> worlds<00:02:43.090> as<00:02:43.180> you

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
you could add as many worlds as you

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.080 
you could add as many worlds as you
wanted<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:44.470> let's<00:02:45.250> go<00:02:45.400> ahead<00:02:45.579> and<00:02:45.730> add<00:02:45.849> a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
wanted so let's go ahead and add a

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.880 
wanted so let's go ahead and add a
creative<00:02:46.690> world<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.700> maybe<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:49.110> VIP<00:02:50.110> creative

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
creative world and maybe a VIP creative

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.280 
creative world and maybe a VIP creative
world<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.430> then<00:02:52.390> obviously<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:52.989> want<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
world and then obviously we want the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.860 
world and then obviously we want the
default<00:02:53.890> game<00:02:54.040> mode<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.310> be<00:02:54.400> creative<00:02:54.880> simple

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
default game mode to be creative simple

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.420 
default game mode to be creative simple
as<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.410> we<00:02:56.590> could<00:02:56.709> have<00:02:56.799> more<00:02:57.010> groups<00:02:57.280> if

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
as that so we could have more groups if

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.690 
as that so we could have more groups if
we<00:02:57.579> wanted<00:02:57.849> to<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.890> could<00:03:00.010> add<00:03:00.129> more<00:03:00.280> worlds

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
we wanted to you could add more worlds

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.880 
we wanted to you could add more worlds
to<00:03:00.879> these<00:03:01.030> groups<00:03:01.329> and<00:03:01.599> then<00:03:02.410> they<00:03:02.560> would<00:03:02.739> go

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
to these groups and then they would go

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.830 
to these groups and then they would go
ahead<00:03:03.129> and<00:03:03.340> share<00:03:03.819> their<00:03:04.150> inventory<00:03:04.989> so<00:03:06.840> you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
ahead and share their inventory so you

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.839 
ahead and share their inventory so you
don't<00:03:08.349> really<00:03:08.440> need<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.799> touching<00:03:09.099> any<00:03:09.730> of

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
don't really need to be touching any of

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.900 
don't really need to be touching any of
this<00:03:10.269> stuff<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.280> can<00:03:12.340> leave<00:03:12.579> that<00:03:12.790> alone

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
this stuff so you can leave that alone

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.180 
this stuff so you can leave that alone
it's<00:03:13.870> just<00:03:14.079> these<00:03:14.200> two<00:03:14.470> files<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.099> want

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190

it's just these two files that you want
to<00:03:15.459> be<00:03:15.640> editing<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.870> once<00:03:17.049> you've<00:03:17.200> done<00:03:17.380> that

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
to be editing and once you've done that

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.490 
to be editing and once you've done that
just<00:03:17.829> start<00:03:18.220> up<00:03:18.430> your<00:03:18.579> server<00:03:18.910> again<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.510> you

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
just start up your server again and you
