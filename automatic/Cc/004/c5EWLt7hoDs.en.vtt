enough you can't use that otherwise you

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.300 
enough you can't use that otherwise you
won't<00:03:27.830> get<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.190> star<00:03:28.430> coin<00:03:28.670> I<00:03:28.910> mean<00:03:29.210> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
won't get the star coin I mean the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.370 
won't get the star coin I mean the
star-metal<00:03:31.310> I<00:03:31.520> suppose<00:03:31.820> if<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.870> do<00:03:33.020> use<00:03:33.230> it

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
star-metal I suppose if you do use it

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.810 
star-metal I suppose if you do use it
then<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.650> suppose<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.070> have<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.310> do<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.520> level

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
then I suppose you have to do that level

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.130 
then I suppose you have to do that level
again<00:03:34.910> without<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:36.050> guidance<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:38.750> basically

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
again without the guidance so basically

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.290 
again without the guidance so basically
you<00:03:39.260> got<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.470> complete<00:03:39.739> all<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:39.980> levels<00:03:40.300> from

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
you got to complete all the levels from

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.630 
you got to complete all the levels from
your<00:03:41.600> own<00:03:41.870> doing<00:03:42.350> not<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.430> get<00:03:43.550> that<00:03:43.670> one<00:03:43.880> stop

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.330
