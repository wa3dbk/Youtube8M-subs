blue<00:03:19.970> Hayabusa<00:03:21.519> when<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.549> guess<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:22.970> goes

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
blue Hayabusa when I guess this goes

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.800 
blue Hayabusa when I guess this goes
into<00:03:23.420> his<00:03:23.569> back<00:03:23.920> yep<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:26.239> can<00:03:26.359> see<00:03:26.540> he's<00:03:26.660> got<00:03:26.750> a

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
into his back yep you can see he's got a

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.680 
into his back yep you can see he's got a
little<00:03:26.930> holder<00:03:27.319> in<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.530> back<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:29.180> stick<00:03:29.569> at

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
little holder in the back to stick at

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.160 
little holder in the back to stick at
that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.580 
that
and<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:32.130> assume<00:03:32.550> that<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.450> knife<00:03:33.630> or<00:03:34.260> sword

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and I assume that the knife or sword

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.510 
and I assume that the knife or sword
rather<00:03:34.890> King<00:03:35.730> asked<00:03:36.120> or<00:03:36.270> ate<00:03:36.360> his<00:03:36.510> back

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
rather King asked or ate his back

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.480 
rather King asked or ate his back
probably<00:03:38.520> have<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:38.970> turn<00:03:39.300> like<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.569> yeah<00:03:40.490> it's

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
probably have a turn like that yeah it's

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.330 
probably have a turn like that yeah it's
not<00:03:41.580> like<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.709> rare<00:03:43.980> blue

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
not like that so that is a rare blue

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.390 
not like that so that is a rare blue
Hayabusa<00:03:45.170> can<00:03:46.170> also<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.530> course<00:03:46.560> stick<00:03:47.280> the

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
Hayabusa can also of course stick the

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.530 
Hayabusa can also of course stick the
sword<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:47.820> his<00:03:47.910> hand

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.119 

it<00:03:53.079> can<00:03:53.260> look<00:03:53.379> a<00:03:53.409> little<00:03:53.469> bit<00:03:53.680> more<00:03:53.860> like<00:03:54.010> the

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
it can look a little bit more like the

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.699 
it can look a little bit more like the
picture<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.959> there's<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.170> rear<00:03:59.349> blue

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
every order that we may have still run

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:37.160 
every order that we may have still run
onto<00:04:24.190> our<00:04:24.550> final<00:04:25.030> one

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:45.750 

okay<00:04:38.460> we<00:04:39.460> got<00:04:43.740> just<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.950> other<00:04:45.160> air<00:04:45.400> green

coming<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.180> elite<00:04:46.390> I<00:04:46.660> think<00:04:47.590> it<00:04:47.800> might<00:04:47.980> be<00:04:49.260> now

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
coming and elite I think it might be now

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.190 
coming and elite I think it might be now
Green<00:04:51.520> covenant<00:04:52.150> elite<00:04:52.330> so<00:04:52.780> we<00:04:52.870> actually<00:04:52.960> got

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
Green covenant elite so we actually got

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.770 
Green covenant elite so we actually got
two<00:04:53.500> rears<00:04:53.710> here<00:04:54.010> are<00:04:54.100> three<00:04:54.310> packs<00:04:54.630> which<00:04:55.630> is

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
two rears here are three packs which is

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.440 
two rears here are three packs which is
a<00:04:55.810> lot<00:04:56.020> better<00:04:56.230> than<00:04:56.290> our<00:04:56.440> first<00:04:56.500> video<00:04:57.450> you

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
a lot better than our first video you

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.060 
a lot better than our first video you
don't<00:04:58.540> know<00:04:58.690> I'm<00:04:58.750> talking<00:04:59.050> about<00:04:59.110> go<00:04:59.650> check<00:04:59.920> it

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
don't know I'm talking about go check it

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.070 
don't know I'm talking about go check it
out<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.370> watch<00:05:00.490> yourself<00:05:01.030> it<00:05:01.570> was<00:05:01.750> quite

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
out and watch yourself it was quite

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.820 
out and watch yourself it was quite
disappointing<00:05:02.230> but<00:05:03.840> these<00:05:04.840> three<00:05:05.260> packs<00:05:05.500> help

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
disappointing but these three packs help

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.030 
disappointing but these three packs help
make<00:05:06.010> up<00:05:06.160> for<00:05:06.340> that<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:07.840> there<00:05:08.080> is<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.530> green
