the decoction lesson to know to know how

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.089 
the decoction lesson to know to know how
to<00:01:38.690> make<00:01:38.899> a<00:01:38.929> decoction<00:01:39.319> so<00:01:39.649> that's<00:01:39.830> why<00:01:39.979> we

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
to make a decoction so that's why we

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.089 
to make a decoction so that's why we
showed<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:40.610> decoction<00:01:40.970> lesson<00:01:41.539> first<00:01:42.099> so

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
showed you the decoction lesson first so

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.339 
showed you the decoction lesson first so
we're<00:01:43.700> gonna<00:01:43.819> turn<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:44.390> down<00:01:44.750> when<00:01:45.229> it<00:01:45.319> gets

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
we're gonna turn this down when it gets

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.969 
we're gonna turn this down when it gets
to<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.800> nice<00:01:46.099> low<00:01:46.670> simmer<00:01:47.319> we're<00:01:48.319> gonna<00:01:48.440> simmer

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
to a nice low simmer we're gonna simmer

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.089 
to a nice low simmer we're gonna simmer
it<00:01:49.190> covered<00:01:49.700> for<00:01:50.060> 20<00:01:50.450> minutes<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.110> it's<00:01:51.920> gonna

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
it covered for 20 minutes and it's gonna

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.910 
it covered for 20 minutes and it's gonna
basically<00:01:52.429> reduce<00:01:53.209> our<00:01:53.479> water<00:01:53.750> by<00:01:54.110> half<00:01:54.530> so

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
basically reduce our water by half so

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.820 
basically reduce our water by half so
this<00:01:55.130> was<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.369> pint<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.179> water<00:01:56.539> sorry<00:01:57.080> didn't

pint of water and by the time this

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.080 
pint of water and by the time this
simmers<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:03.080> reduces<00:02:04.009> in<00:02:04.190> 20<00:02:04.489> minutes<00:02:04.849> from

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
simmers and reduces in 20 minutes from

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.109 
simmers and reduces in 20 minutes from
now<00:02:05.300> we're<00:02:05.929> gonna<00:02:06.020> have<00:02:06.349> about<00:02:06.920> 8<00:02:07.340> ounces<00:02:07.580> of

more than 8 ounces of decoction just

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.470 
more than 8 ounces of decoction just
like<00:02:21.829> I<00:02:22.010> planned

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
like I planned

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.390 
like I planned
it<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.659> poured<00:02:23.900> into<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.140> bowl<00:02:24.470> or<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.769> just<00:02:25.129> have

it is poured into a bowl or I just have
it<00:02:25.580> in<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.879> larger<00:02:26.420> Pyrex<00:02:26.900> cuz<00:02:27.260> I<00:02:27.409> that<00:02:27.709> way<00:02:27.830> I

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
it in this larger Pyrex cuz I that way I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.339 
it in this larger Pyrex cuz I that way I
could<00:02:28.010> measure<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.549> and<00:02:29.299> for<00:02:29.930> demonstration

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
could measure it and for demonstration
