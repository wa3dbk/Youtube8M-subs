00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.019
 yes so we will show you now 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.019

 Yes 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.040

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.040
 many trophies 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.720

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.690
 success of putting his troops and also of 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.510
 look at whether their source in the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.880
 tanks or in cisse extractors 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.369
 in the extractors then you go 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.979
 make a big success and you go 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.979
 take a lot of resources 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.720
 if it's in the tank 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.750
 is going to be a bit complicated to get in 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.229
