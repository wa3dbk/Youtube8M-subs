00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
way I think Minnesota's online is a

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.280 
way I think Minnesota's online is a
little<00:03:32.640> bit<00:03:32.730> better<00:03:32.880> than<00:03:33.180> uh<00:03:33.360> than<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
little bit better than uh than the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.710 
little bit better than uh than the
