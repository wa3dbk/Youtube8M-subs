00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.469
 such 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.769
 the femoral block is a technique 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.330
 of locoregional anesthesia of the member 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.260
 lower that is practiced in 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.049
 different situations 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.520
 it interests the nerve and moral element 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.520
 essential scarpa triangle 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.360
 so we'll see at first 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.820
 the anatomy of the nerve and moral then the 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.560
 scarpa triangle then we 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.240
 will discuss the technique of the femoral block 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.160
 with these different indications 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.759
 the material used is the gesture 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.759
 practice 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.690
 the nerve and morality is a sensitive erp 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.880
 at the motor of the previous box of the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.200
 thigh and leg 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.530
 it comes from the meeting of the roots 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.330
 lumbar l2 l3 and l 4 they walk 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.600
 vertically between the iliac muscles 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.150
 and soas engages under the crural arch in 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.739
 out of the idiot pectinÃ© strip and 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.680
 is then in front of the psoas muscle 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.820
 in guinea in the fascia case 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.030
 the nerve and morals divide 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.770
 quickly into four branches terminal 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.310
 the nerve of the quadriceps which is motor 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.880
 pure the lateral muscle nerve that is 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.640
 mixed saphenous nerve that and sensory 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.180
 pure is the median muscle nerve that 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.220
 is mixed 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.930
 thanks to its four branches it ensures 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.750
 a mixed innervation of the thigh and 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.520
 the leg on the motor plane the nerve and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.830
 moral yesterday essentially the muscles 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.830
 quadriceps responsible for bending 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.600
 thigh and leg extension 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.430
 sensitively it ensures the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.640
 cutaneous sensitivity of the face 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.210
 anterior and medial thigh and 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.799
 the medial aspect of the knee and the leg 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.869
 the scare of scarpa is a triangle at low 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.439
 superior located on the anterior surface of 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.479
 thigh in anatomy surface line 2 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.759

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.940
 lateral is constituted by the board 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.769
 medialets of the sartorius muscle and the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 limit a farm and go there built 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.299
 by the lateral edge of the long muscle 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.980
 adductor in this tri gones spends three 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.849

 lower limbs 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.680
 the bisector of the triangle and the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.260
 projection of the femoral artery into 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.700
 in it is the femoral vein in 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.950
 out is the nerve and black 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.989
 after repair of the skin and fascia 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.330

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.720
 muscle outside in the box 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.950
 vascular is the femoral vein 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.790
 in which throws the big vein 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.810
 stage and femoral artery in the lodge 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.849
 muscular lies the nerve and moral 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.230
 and the psoas muscle both in guinea 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.500
 in the fascia there is 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.500
 t 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.310
 there are three indications 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.290
 main to the femoral block the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.600
 surgery of the anterior region and 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.540
 medial thigh and medial aspect 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.700
 the leg post operative analgesia 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.050
 to calm the pains locally and 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.080
 avoid analgesic treatment 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.760
 systemic or urgently in the 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.410
 treatment of post- traumatic pain 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.080
 like the fractures of the diaphysis 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.240
 femoral for example the femoral block 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.190
 can be associated with sciatic blocks and 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.050
 to the block dune shutter for 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.880
 surgical gestures that goes beyond his alone 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.100
 territory 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.470
 according to the indication several techniques 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.450
 are possible first of all in emergency 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.980
 the puncture is done blindly on 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.320
 necessary material is a needle 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.090
 beveled short and a syringe of 15 to 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.060
 20 stopped guilo kahina 2% 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.100
 the patient is supine on the 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.900
 lower limb clear before 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.970
 carry out the gesture we proceed to a 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.930
 rigorous asepsis and anesthesia 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.909
 local 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.069
 the line of evil guen and mark and the 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.230
 femoral pulse and palpate the point of 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.539
 puncture is three centimeters on 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.880
 the line of evil guen and a centimeter in 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.310
 outside the artery by introducing 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.560
 the eil we feel 3 resistance 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.800
 corresponding to the successive crossing 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.530
 fascia skin ata and fascia 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.960
 case the anesthetic is then injected 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.520
 in the muscle sheath or yop soas and 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.230
 diffuses along the branches of the nerve and 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.520
 morals 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.040
 on the other hand when an intervention 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.930
 surgical is planned we use the 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.400
 electrostimulation technique that 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.620
 allows a greater precision of the 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.229
 gesture 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.690
 to achieve a femoral block one 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.840
 uses standard aseptic equipment 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.479
 a local anesthetic a needle and a 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.610
 neurostimulation device and according 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.590
 the indication a catheter or 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.770
 specific anesthetic 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.240
 the patient is supine on the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.790
 lower limb slightly rotated 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.220
 external at first marked the 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.710
 full guinal palpate the femoral pulse is 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.930
 intended for the projection of the artery after 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.970
 rigorous asepsis we proceed to 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.040
 the local anesthetist taking care at 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:21.300
 do not prick arteries with tests 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.300
 successive suction 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:27.089
 the point of puncture is below the 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:28.039
 line of evil guen and outside of 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:29.969
 the femoral artery 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.979
 we introduce the probe 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.349
 electrostimulation and are looking for a 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.359
 motor response the contraction of the 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.639
 sartorius muscle indicates that the referrals 

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:40.559
 too superficial the contraction of 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.919
 pectinous and adductor muscles 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:45.689
 indicates that the dotted too median the 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.309
 probe is well positioned when 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.349
 observe a contraction of the muscle 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:56.489
 quadriceps with an ascent of the 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:58.139
 ball joint then decreases the intensity by 

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:59.849
 successive stages while getting 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.829
 getting closer to the nerve and morality 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.110
 for the motor response to remain 

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:05.879
 identical when with intensity 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.949
 minimum the ascent of the patella is 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.959
 still observed the probe is closer 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.879
 of a femoral hour then we can 

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:14.729
 removed the cui electrostimulation while 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.749
 leaving the guide in place according to 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.669
 nature of the intervention 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:20.369
 we can use the femoral blog in 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.409
 as intraoperative anesthesia in this 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:24.599
 If you inject the anesthetic 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:26.939
 diffuses into the fascia yaka and andorra the 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:28.769
 nerve one then observes the disappearance of 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:29.909
 the motor response one can also 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:31.679
 use the near by 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:33.539
 electrostimulation to place a 

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:36.329
 catheter that will be used for analgesics 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.869
 postoperative the catheter is introduced 

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:38.869
 in the guide 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:48.139
 then remove the guide leaving the 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.139
 catheter in place 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.580
 finally we fix the device 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.130
 before doing a last test 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.130
 suction 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.010
 the anatomical landmarks of the triangle of 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.140
 scarpe at the position of the nerve and moral 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.030
 apart from the moral could and the three 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.560
 perceived at the introduction of 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.780
 the eel are three essential elements 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.510
 to remember about the femoral blog 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:29.140
 however he is often associated with 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.140
 other blocks
