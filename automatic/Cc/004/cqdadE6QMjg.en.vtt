00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 I am the Santamaría I live here 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.109
 in the hill coria de carúpano then 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.120
 I will explain how the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.509
 mango outlet to the very famous jelly 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.849
 mango I have to listen to the mango well 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.849
 green 1 foot of the handle 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.369
 taking advantage of in this container then one 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.199
 grab these conchitas de rafa this 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.050
 because this is what gives life to the 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.700
 exit will give you the shine keeps peeling 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.380
 this recipe I learned it for a 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.989
 my sister 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.199
 who already told me look how bad and also in 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.300
 the terminal they sell the airport and she 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.420
 he defends himself then and I said good 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.030
 I'm going to do the test and I did it for 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.550
 first time with 50 handles 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.180
 then my mom told me that it seemed that 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.750
 they were raw 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.540
 the next candle I cook more then the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.780
 I did again with 100 something I gave more 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.240
 more lime from the most palette and I stayed 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.180
 good the green mango 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.120
 it calls enough sugar enough sugar 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.600
 because it's acid but when you 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.120
 throw white sugar they she is left 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.490
 the exit is clear well now I'm going 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.250
 to strain the handle this is here in this 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.100
 colander strainer spaghetti i'm going 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.189
 flying 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.150
 Look, it's been going down here in the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.150
 mango pulp way 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.920
 so 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.510
 because I ended up here all this from 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.830
 strain us 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.830
 is to cook it 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.230
 a man bought me 12 to take it to 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.330
 the daisy the plane thus escalates in 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.150
 Daisy got out and kept going 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.640
 maiquetía got the 12 away the 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:01.090
 part up and got off and given the exit 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:04.300
 and goes out to this when it 's tender sees boot 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.160
 the pipe is not so have the mangos ready 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.200
 and they grab sugar 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.240
 now when so pink tones there are 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.350
 Some painters have to be less 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.500
 amount of sugar 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.910
 but as something mature can not be done 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.220
 the more green the tastier they want 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.980
 stronger more consistent takes the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.250
 force the exit but almost never I 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.190
 they call my name because I call myself like that 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.420
 they do not tell me lady with the areas that I 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.420
 they call the street anything to bleach 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.910
 you have to pass them several times 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.040
 well pelarda good is already strained to the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.470
 mango now I will proceed to throw it in 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.470
 the cauldron the mango's fault 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.269
 when it takes 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.820
 to the good hand 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.830
 Now I have made a vanilla 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.440
 to taste 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.760
 then the sugar 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.760
 but this too 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.580
 believe well 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.930
 the candle still did not come out 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.930
 I put this 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.970
 so that I do not burn 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.820
 and here begins the function of such as 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.880
 good when the full pilot is given 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.460
 an hour and a half of palette but as 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.260
 be a little bit out like 20 minutes 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.260
 of the chicken or 15 minutes 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.170
 Sometimes I have the habit of 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.140
 try it to visit asia 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.630
 it's really sweet so it's good with a 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.570
 kilo 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.710
 there is a gentleman who has a city that 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.380
 they bought when I sold in the 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.450
 airport once the daughter told her that 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.740
 I got him 15 jellies with me 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.050
 airport lady, you know, my 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.010
 first name 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.260
 then we will buy in the market and 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.570
 he sent the sale to the papaíto daughter 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.240
 because all while he told me not my daughter 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.550
 I sent you the villages, no sir, they're just 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.710
 the areas of the airport signal and 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.480
 He came and tells me to stay in it 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.920
 support that room because in fact 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.709
 I know that the diaz chair knows more about 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.350
 amia by far black caramba but is that 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.010
 you have a tasty rhythm for 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.190
 areas all nine looks for this is 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.500
 they sang the very popular kills here in 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.160
 carúpano that there are some pips like that 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.160
 we arrived 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.399
 now they do not tell me that I was 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.899
 looking for them to discuss the jelly 

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:43.899
 Of the same 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.090
 on the same side 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.960
 she always sells more than I go to 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:58.249
 ride a double-decker bus and she gets 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.559
 walk and jump 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:03.249
 and the color is changing 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.249
 we are here she 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.409
 well this is ready and I do not know 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.960
 drip when you will not run here because 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.650
 it 's ready now I know now we're going to 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.389
 proceed 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.389
 on the mound here 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.810
 it accommodates itself 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.810
 from here they leave 6 a day 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:34.500
 the thing well with enough candela 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.780
 is already ready then what is already 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.750
 it cooled and he grabbed his little face 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.120
 and marked it 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.120
 and the stung this is the cellophane 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.960
 yes 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.240
 well in this tradition comes from my mom 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.950
 of my aunt and very good that they learn to 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.810
 do it because that's one thing that the 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.810
 traditional here count good
