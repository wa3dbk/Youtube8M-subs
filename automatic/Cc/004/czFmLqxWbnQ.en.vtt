00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.650
 or the classmates again here are 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.220
 being the others cultural how to install 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.570
 the good lopez the first step is to go to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.640
 link that I leave in the blog and in the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.220
 description of the first step video open 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.460
 the browser explorer we select and you 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.280
 we give and then we go to www opera 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.170
 puntocom in my case is is because this 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.739
 Spanish and the only thing we have to do 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.739
 is download 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.320
 and we will get a window that if 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.090
 we want to save it or execute myself 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.590
 I recommend that you keep it good and 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.770
 after we have addressed it we 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.530
 is going to be this one of an installer like this 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.060
 exe file point exe good 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.770
 I recommend operating since it is the best 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.559
 browser in my case since it is very 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.330
 accessible very little they chose and the truth 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.580
 does not consume as many resources as is 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.830
 chrome and more to big show the 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.960
 advantages that opera gym has is even 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.240
 leave in a brief description in the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.460
 blog and in the video so that you 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.340
 can observe the differences there 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.320
 between opera and google chrome and firefox and 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.940
 which are the most used safari is very 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.590
 good anyway but how are we in windows 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.520
 7 is recommended opera since it is a 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.410
 very very light browser good the only thing 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.869
 what we have to do is execute as 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.240
 administrator I get a window that 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.740
 want to allow you to make changes in the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.890
 team since they do remember that I do not 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.070
 it comes out since I'm recording we give it to 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.660
 if I was going to download some files this is not 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.580
 much delay depends on your collection in 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.990
 internet pause the video so that it 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.990
 do as fast as you can thanks 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.480
 well in my case it does not take long since 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.510
 my internet connection is very good 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.060
 We will continue waiting for another minute 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.530
 just arrived I think two minutes 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.320
 waiting good 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.350
 well I end as you see the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.319
 opera and it's extremely easy we give to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.600
 accept to install are being installed 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.780
 says that thanks for choosing opera we 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.730
 sends a shortcut and as they are 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.400
 opens opera automatically we give you that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.280
 if we wish for greater use to improve the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.830
 opper's opinion we give that if s 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.290
 edition in you and help them in order 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.420
 as you can see, it's a very 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.239
 quick installs too fast very 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.740
 accessible with all kinds and the truth is 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.720
 very well 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.850
 and something that I really like about this 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.470
 operator something that an example we are 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.690
 looking for an example page 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.960
 facebook or we are browsing in 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.330
 any other page and suddenly 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.820
 accidentally we closed what is the 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.410
 opera application and you say I already lost where 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.530
 I was and I have to go to my record and 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.300
 search and in the case of opera not since 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.160
 I'm going to put a type of captcha to store 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.380
 that already receives the one where we stayed in 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.910
 the last session and vote us where we 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.920
 We are what I like good 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.990
 thanks for watching the video classmates already 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.550
 They know that we always install the best 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.330
 most basic programs that are on your pc 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.470
 since they are essential and to say is a 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.420
 study in a race or etcetera 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.420
