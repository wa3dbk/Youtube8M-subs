00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.840
 It is a shame of guitarist sound creator this time. 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:14.910
 I would like to talk about the tips for playing picking fast . 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.330
 A quick question asked by beginners and hiss says you can't play fast phrases like this 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.400
 There is a question why you ca n't play and how can you get to play 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.770
 First, is it tips I would like to talk in more detail There are three in mitt roughly one 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.160
 The first trick is that you will not be strong at first 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.710
 With power in, you won't be able to play smoothly 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.360
 In particular 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.340
 This and repels in Cikarang I Gar doing this if the person you want to Toka technical play 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.149
 Fine that 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:45.309
 First of all, you need to pull without force, as you can not play fine phrases 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:49.059
 Because it becomes the cause of the Toka tendonitis splash of say but a strained rough there is a very important 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.730
 It is better to avoid by all means if you want to play the guitar for a long time 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.239
 really 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.829
 Though I think that come a lot I have to verification in rare professional fact also I 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.420
 I once do it once 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:03.449
 At that time, I will go through the needle already 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:09.119
 There is also a more classical sound guitarist in the way of guitarist teacher that person has a Well 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.750
 You'llcome teacher of acupuncture in that person to Well back much that half a year or one year in the case of I 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.590
 Already 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.409
 I noticed it at the entrance of tenodesitis and even if I enter treatment immediately, the guitar is closed for about half a year 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.550
 It was not 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.630
 Ndee there was a really time entered pessimistic courage But even in it 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.130
 somehow 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.159
 Almost now 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.700
 Though there is no such thing as tendon sheath inflammation 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:38.330
 Really it means for that failure guess guitarist this is very strong regardless of 6 Pro-Am 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:43.040
 It is that Tteyuu play in Cikarang this becomes the first step 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.960
 I think I really want everyone to play I used to play with great power 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.560
 Selfish Selfish Selfish Selfish Selfishness is already great 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.370
 Nde was also heard to put a force Well it is I think the Fu that I wonder if became a verification due 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.400
 Though 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:57.410
 First of all, it is one more thing 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.320
 It is that we make the movement compact and that difficult phrase fast phrase is often 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.390
 I am saying Tsu not play 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.010
 Many of them are the same with the movement of the right hand, but the movement is about 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.860
 Oh 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:16.040
 For example, when you play a phrase like this, if your right hand can not do such a compact movement 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.040
 If it becomes large movement or if it starts to move even if left, it will move 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:29.860
 It looks like it's like this is a lot of useless movement and this becomes normal 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.790
 Naturally, fast phrases and fine phrases can not be dealt with 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.230
 It will end 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:39.770
 So it is to make the movement a little more compact and eliminate the useless movement 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.700
 Naturally the left hand does not move, for example, the right hand can not catch up 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:48.380
 Of course I think I get that amount union if the unnecessary movement with a large pre 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:52.190
 This is completely same as sports, so it is smaller and more compact 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.670
 It is one of the points that we eliminate useless loss by doing 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.080
 I'm going to go to various places , but I 'm going to various places . 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.760
 It is a form 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.740
 First of all, the two cones of that guitar 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.410
 For example 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:12.510
 There are a lot of people who want to play fast, but if you try hard and practice, your attitude will be very bad 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.280
 Frequently the is try this It is this kind of attitude that say want Oh right shoulder down the left shoulder 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.799
 I really understand it when I get it 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.910
 It costs a great deal on the right shoulder and back 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:28.340
 In and say how to say and are practicing this phone Well 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:34.670
 Water talk was done at the time of picking, but that here is firm is the original picking 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:41.620
 I wonder if I say muscle movement say this because the movement is in a state where a large book of iodine is exhilarating 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:42.900
 Naturally, the movement of the arm is bad around here , so I try to force it in that way with power 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.049
 Move fast 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.090
 Assortment will naturally be a trick of failure 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:58.200
 It is better to why questioned what will be the absolute this Rette accumulation not become worse in Anosugu 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:02.890
 And say good or Once you have what in is a good deal and first bring the central axis of the body in the middle 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:06.190
 I think that I understand if you look at the figure I have that guitar, but I also wake up 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.630
 I comparatively high straight I think that such attitude is not bad 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:15.400
 Foot and I think I now I think the invisible pair has come straight I also with respect to the screen is 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:19.959
 I open my shoulders and use my right foot with that classic guitar 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.910
 Pedal that forms such a sleeping foot This is on the right foot 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.740
 Because I have short legs 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.970
 so 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.660
 If it's a song you 're sitting in , it's probably difficult to pull the guitar if it gets too low 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.610
 is 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:39.250
 Unfortunately in issue which the foot or rather positive pedal pedal to the prefecture 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.150
 It will be pretty easy to listen well if you leave it, and I'm doing it this way 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.729
 Do this 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:47.509
 Some people say that they practice together 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:54.499
 Um, this is a little bit more I wondered 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:56.870
 It's upper body I do, but I'm very easy to play go up also ensure this pelvis to this under side of the body 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:05:01.190
 But this I go my orthopedic clinic and duck 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:07.550
 I will tell you that the pelvis is bent 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:09.560
 It's a question of what kind of personally better it is. 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:15.140
 A form where the body can relax 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.300
 But that the casino is I think is a also good in both Well in Crossed also leg in the Open him to shoulder width 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.750
 Also 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.990
 First of all, you can relax John like this 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:27.070
 This is already like this 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:32.800
 I think that Mako Well high is not, but it is you Yappa large Naco 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:38.650
 Well my body does not bend at first If you give this spine or center axis straight, that is all it takes 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:42.980
 In considerably on this side is trimmed the You should see the First form is likely to play since become easier 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.940
 Do not put in force as I said before or after that compact movement 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.840
 If you do something to do 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.460
 I want to try by all means good luck because I think that it should speed comes so play faster 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:57.030
 I think that 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.030
