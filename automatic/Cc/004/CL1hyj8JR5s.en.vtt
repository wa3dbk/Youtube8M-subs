00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.540
 to teach how to get the mother and the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.730
 mother and that the weapon that has come out 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.380
 recently for xbox and that in play 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.410
 we have to wait until the 25th 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.720
 that there are still 22 days left when I'm 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.060
 recording this so it's good how is 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.560
 get it in private is also worth it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.330
 you can get in the online but there 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.669
 that having a play strip is in the mode 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.250
 of ex and good that because few people 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.200
 it has so good we're going to get it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.450
 in private mode it is worth the imparted 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.890
 private forgiveness so good at least the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.140
 we will be able to try our friends 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.820
 or alone as you want and well we go there 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.770
 let's do the tutorial of how 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.020
 do it since you have to do some 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.449
 how many little things the first thing is to put bots 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 because we are going to pick them up at the bots 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.379
 it's the bots that carry the ones 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.329
 they carry the marvel ike sorry so 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.210
 well you put it for example you put six 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.280
 bots is worth if you want to put out or what 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.049
 that you want and good you put it in recruit 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.170
 ok I have an English but well that gives 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.450
 totally equal treason maps 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.000
 you have to put two teams worth not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 we get into options and good if 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.170
 you want to put on you the active radar it is worth 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.509
 you can put it to be everything more 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.950
 easy and thoroughly test it thoroughly is 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.680
 say that it goes without accessories but 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.590
 It is also an armada with what for 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.110
 what I have been able to fuck does not come to me 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.330
 word so I could prove is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.530
 a fairly good weapon so wins 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.930
 what you have to do is come here to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.060
 restricted classes 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.039
 get into primary school get in here 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.869
 to go removing them like that or putting them 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.200
 all with the square this yellow is worth 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.590
 minus markmann ride rifles that you have to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.690
 let the sw do the same is lethal 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.000
 we mark all do the same thing in 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.990
 tactics demonstrating all and if we want 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.450
 so in strike to agree what for me 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.069
 like a lame or not say we also remove 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.690
 the assault and that's why they do not hold 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.270
 the boat is worth because they are quite can 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.560
 pere test in this mode so good there 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.110
 to do that and the last thing that needs to be done 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.569
 Crearte sun do is start well and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.640
 put you get advantage voucher what 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.730
 that come out of the eggs and start the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.769
 departure 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.250
 so well let's wait until 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.379
 start the game as I say it is a 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.540
 pretty good trick then to try it 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.659
 maverick thoroughly is good enough 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.180
 of those of ps3 sorry I'm a little 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.709
 foolish now is to say that it's 2 o'clock 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.290
 tomorrow so well then I'm a 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.569
 little silly because that is what said 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.489
 those of the kind in those of play 3 sorry 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.860
 Well, we can not have this weapon 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.819
 unfortunately until a month passes 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.769
 It is what it is 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.870
 Microsoft has a contract with 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.720
 activision and I accept it is worth something 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.549
 pay those of xbox that's true so 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.459
 well as I say we have this 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:54.370
 little trick how good that seen 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.349
 in the channel of a second that look at the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.629
 name as it was called what was seen in the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.549
 inflate channel this inflated ticket inflates 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.049
 what good will you have in the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.420
 description since good told me that 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.430
 I could upload it if you have asked for permission 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.410
 because I like to ask permission for these 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.640
 things yes I have asked permission to 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.579
 upload this and told me that without 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.100
 problem well then let's see why 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.770
 this weapon is a fucking shit 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.890
 in theory as I say we would have to 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.160
 jump the bots the gun let's see if 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.160
 It is true 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.900
 this is a mier where armed by the way 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.480
 as you know at the moment nothing has been released 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.060
 remember that they carry the sv and lamadrid 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.230
 look here you have it madrid here you see it 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.670
 kids, hello madrid, it's not a lie, it's worth 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.950
 la madrid as you see here put the clock 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.540
 you have to recharge and square I'm 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.549
 playing in play 3 vale 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.580
 I'm in play 3 can not be done in 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.790
 any console that can be x 2 363 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.799
 play 4 up to even pc up to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.530
 win can be done in all that 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.390
 you want to watch the boots and 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.299
 that's good as I say kids that's 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.040
 pretty good the trick already you know if 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.349
 You liked the video because you give the 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.599
 current and I have nothing more to say 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.329
 let's see if we get one that in 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.220
 against the bots I would feel quite 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.859
 but the truth as you see the gun is going 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.690
 quite pretty well is an armada for 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.560
 what I thought was a piece 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.570
 weapon 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.550
 or they kill me that they are going to do 15 0 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.270
 good kids a greeting and even the 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.570
 next 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.570
 goodbye
