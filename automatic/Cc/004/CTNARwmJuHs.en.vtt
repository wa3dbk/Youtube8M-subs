00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.570

 Greek grill cheese that is actually perfect 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.020
 is to make on the barbecue 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.640
 because if you heat it quickly, don't 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.410
 so hard and then it does n't fall through it 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.990
 grill the barbecue is on 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.950
 in the meantime I'm going to cut the ground 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.410
 went to oversee me 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.510

 grille easy and home that it is one 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.160
 good byte all in one container 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.489
 what I am going to ff on the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.719
 also marinate the zucchini in about 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.399
 stick equally thick 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.289
 I also leave bell peppers nice and big 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.780
 then it is easy to grill in a moment 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.909
 also a large one is cut a whole one 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.460
 make a simple marinade 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.749
 she first garlic a little coarse it 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.640
 don't need all of them for the 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.559
 marinade but I'll have another one soon 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.929
 delicious loosening 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.929
 this can be in the container for a while 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.489
 some olive oil on it 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.850
 not too spicy pepper and 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.439
 pinch salt a little 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.969
 and if you are a bit well distributed 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.310
 then you let me know 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.259
 meanwhile i am going to make how i had to 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.289
 the chickpeas ff washed off and out 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.329
 leaks can not be broken in as can 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.740
 cut some garlic 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.899
 you train a teaspoon of cumin and then 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.570
 tablespoon of this delicious 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.439
 sesame paste tahini is called that lemon 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.500
 there 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.270
 trick all the pitches in your hand 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.979
 then I do a little water at 50 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.810
 milliliter is about enough enough 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.560
 so always do a little bit 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.560
 begining agree 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.430
 little bit there almost finally bit 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.430
 pepper 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.009
 top I want the timetable and first so that 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.259
 I use the pliers and can take care of that 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.090
 all coaches are well distributed I have 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.710
 namely the entire surface needed to 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.989
 all vegetables can have many 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.850
 distribute well let it be quiet 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.110
 because the grille does the work and 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.709
 then you get such a beautiful one 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.709
 diamond on top 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.000
 so go faster there 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.280
 the eggplant is ready a little faster than 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.810
 the zucchini and the bell pepper then I go too 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.069
 still a bit through if you are one of them 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.590
 met the barbecue 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.000
 looks great on the halloumi and the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.180
 make asparagus 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.790
 I first cut Halloumi into block at 8 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.140
 about a small centimeter each 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.629
 so 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.650
 then we grab the asparagus 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.650
 always the ass off 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.870
 a little bit of olive oil and right again 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.139
 on this may be slightly longer than to one 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.420
 lumi 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:03:00.650
 so they rank first on the lume 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.189
 you only have to change once 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.290
 to turn 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:07.000
 You need a bit of asparagus back and forth 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.000
 turn the hello who's ready 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.159
 asparagus and also nicely brown and ready 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.780
 al dente and then we actually have 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.340
 everything ready to the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.680
 I am just going to make halloumi Turks 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:25.480
 but the sandwiches still very briefly on the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.480
 grill 5 4 3 2 1 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.340
 perfect just like a normal burger 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.260
 the principle is easy 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.799
 start stacking with him once 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:40.420
 a little not economical what grilled 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:42.879
 vegetables of course the colony one more 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.010

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.810
 do you know how and then you have 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.620
