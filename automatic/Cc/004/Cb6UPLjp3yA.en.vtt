it was some today I want to show you
what<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.829> my<00:00:01.979> favorite<00:00:02.730> rectus<00:00:03.540> abdominus

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
what is my favorite rectus abdominus

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.440 
what is my favorite rectus abdominus
abdominal<00:00:04.890> exercise<00:00:05.339> just<00:00:06.060> so<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.240> know<00:00:06.270> that

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
abdominal exercise just so you know that

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.270 
abdominal exercise just so you know that
the<00:00:06.720> abdominal<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.259> are<00:00:07.350> set<00:00:07.560> up<00:00:07.710> where<00:00:07.980> you've

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
the abdominal is are set up where you've

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.950 
the abdominal is are set up where you've
got<00:00:08.460> multiple<00:00:08.730> different<00:00:09.210> muscles<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:09.900> your

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
got multiple different muscles in your

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.930 
got multiple different muscles in your
core<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.920> got<00:00:11.070> your<00:00:11.219> transversus<00:00:11.820> abdominus

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
core you got your transversus abdominus

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.060 
core you got your transversus abdominus
which<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> muscle<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.049> stabilizes<00:00:13.980> your

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
which is the muscle that stabilizes your

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.700 
which is the muscle that stabilizes your
pelvis<00:00:14.580> when<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.450> draw<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.870> right<00:00:16.440> when<00:00:16.619> you

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
pelvis when you draw it right when you

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.130 
pelvis when you draw it right when you
suck<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.250> your<00:00:17.400> tummy<00:00:17.640> vacuum<00:00:18.330> that's<00:00:18.960> what

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
suck in your tummy vacuum that's what

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.090 
suck in your tummy vacuum that's what
your<00:00:19.260> training<00:00:19.500> there's<00:00:19.770> actually<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
your training there's actually the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.650 
your training there's actually the
muscle<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.430> supports<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.539> then

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
muscle that supports that and then

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.970 
muscle that supports that and then
you've<00:00:21.779> got<00:00:21.869> your<00:00:21.960> external<00:00:22.380> obliques<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
you've got your external obliques and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.070 
you've got your external obliques and
internal<00:00:23.550> obliques<00:00:23.850> which<00:00:24.029> act<00:00:24.300> very

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
internal obliques which act very

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.380 
internal obliques which act very
similarly<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.760> transversus<00:00:27.300> abdominus

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
similarly to the transversus abdominus

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.080 
similarly to the transversus abdominus
but<00:00:27.900> these<00:00:28.080> muscles<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.880> chunky<00:00:29.880> ones

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
but these muscles are the chunky ones

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.820 
but these muscles are the chunky ones
obviously<00:00:30.599> I've<00:00:30.750> got<00:00:30.900> some<00:00:31.050> body<00:00:31.199> fat<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.710> so

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
obviously I've got some body fat here so

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.620 
obviously I've got some body fat here so
you<00:00:31.920> can't<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.489> well<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.420> big

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you can't see it that well but the big

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.990 
you can't see it that well but the big
chunky<00:00:34.200> muscles<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.800> top<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.550> act

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
chunky muscles on top it's really act

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.270 
chunky muscles on top it's really act
like<00:00:36.270> armoring<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.469> two<00:00:37.620> purposes

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
like armoring they have two purposes

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.150 
like armoring they have two purposes
they<00:00:38.489> act<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.820> armoring<00:00:39.510> against<00:00:40.170> blows<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
they act like armoring against blows to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.240 
they act like armoring against blows to
your<00:00:41.309> stomach<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> boxer<00:00:42.840> or<00:00:43.020> any<00:00:43.980> athlete

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
your stomach so a boxer or any athlete

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.520 
your stomach so a boxer or any athlete
who<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.879> possibly<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.870> enacted<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.410> theirs

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
who can possibly get enacted for theirs

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.350 
who can possibly get enacted for theirs
knowing<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:47.070> need<00:00:47.340> protections<00:00:48.090> those

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
knowing they need protections those

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.840 
knowing they need protections those
muscles<00:00:48.780> tend<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> hypertrophy<00:00:49.829> they<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:50.520> big

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
muscles tend to hypertrophy they get big

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.790 
muscles tend to hypertrophy they get big
and<00:00:50.879> swollen<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.110> that's<00:00:52.260> why<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> end<00:00:52.590> up

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and swollen and that's why you end up

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.340 
and swollen and that's why you end up
having<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.190> 6-pack<00:00:53.789> chunky<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.449> also<00:00:55.020> one

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
having like 6-pack chunky look also one

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.889 
having like 6-pack chunky look also one
of<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> reasons<00:00:55.829> why<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.789> tends<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.329> seem<00:00:57.690> as

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
of the reasons why it tends to seem as

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
of the reasons why it tends to seem as
if<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> big<00:00:58.680> belly<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.129> lot<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.430> times

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
if I have a big belly a lot of times

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.779 
if I have a big belly a lot of times
simply<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.350> big<00:01:01.789> rectus

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
simply because I have really big rectus

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
simply because I have really big rectus
abdominus<00:01:02.910> muscles<00:01:03.719> these<00:01:03.870> muscles<00:01:04.290> tend<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
abdominus muscles these muscles tend to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.399 
abdominus muscles these muscles tend to
get<00:01:04.589> really<00:01:04.830> chunky<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.000> push<00:01:06.180> out

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
get really chunky on so they push out

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.870 
get really chunky on so they push out
the<00:01:07.409> other<00:01:07.560> thing<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.460> they're<00:01:08.670> also

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the other thing is that they're also

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.230 
the other thing is that they're also
designed<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.720> help<00:01:09.990> prevent<00:01:11.240> hyperextension

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
designed to help prevent hyperextension

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600 
designed to help prevent hyperextension
right<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.590> could<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> pelvis<00:01:14.400> or

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
right and that could be at the pelvis or

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.969 
right and that could be at the pelvis or
at<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.560> ribs

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
at the the the ribs

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.640 
at the the the ribs
hyperextension<00:01:17.820> meaning<00:01:18.479> falling<00:01:19.170> backwards

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
hyperextension meaning falling backwards

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.520 
hyperextension meaning falling backwards
too<00:01:19.890> far<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.670> your<00:01:21.090> hips<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> tendency<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
too far if your hips have a tendency to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.550 
too far if your hips have a tendency to
rock<00:01:23.340> back<00:01:23.580> too<00:01:23.850> far<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.689> can<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
rock back too far you can get them to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350 
rock back too far you can get them to
come<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.770> under<00:01:26.220> by<00:01:26.340> training<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.820> rectus

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
come back under by training your rectus

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
come back under by training your rectus
abdominus<00:01:27.560> because<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.680> goes<00:01:28.890> from<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.159> hips

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
abdominus because it goes from your hips

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.330 
abdominus because it goes from your hips
to<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.850> ribcage<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:31.020> also<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
to your ribcage and also if you have a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.810 
to your ribcage and also if you have a
tendency<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.909> well<00:01:33.570> most<00:01:33.810> people<00:01:33.930> don't<00:01:34.259> but

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
tendency to well most people don't but

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.480 
tendency to well most people don't but
it<00:01:35.820> prevents<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:37.140> ribcage<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:38.009> popping<00:01:38.369> up

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
it prevents your ribcage from popping up

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.880 
it prevents your ribcage from popping up
to<00:01:38.700> my<00:01:38.909> right<00:01:39.810> someone<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.680> big

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
to my right someone with a really big

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.010 
to my right someone with a really big
belly<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.420> stuff<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.840> just

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
belly you know all this stuff is just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.200 
belly you know all this stuff is just
spilling<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.799> well<00:01:44.369> there's<00:01:44.820> almost<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.119> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
spilling out well there's almost like a

doesn't become engage you'll just feel

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.550 
doesn't become engage you'll just feel
crap<00:02:05.840> okay<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.050> you<00:02:07.260> guys<00:02:07.350> thought<00:02:07.530> about

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
crap okay so you guys thought about

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
crap okay so you guys thought about
snapping<00:02:08.130> your<00:02:08.250> backup<00:02:08.640> only<00:02:09.030> way<00:02:09.210> you<00:02:09.300> snap

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
snapping your backup only way you snap

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.570 
snapping your backup only way you snap
your<00:02:10.020> back<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:10.650> you<00:02:10.740> reference<00:02:10.950> abdominus

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
your back is if you reference abdominus

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.490 
your back is if you reference abdominus
is<00:02:11.760> non-existent<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.930> those<00:02:13.110> are<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.320> two

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is non-existent so those are the two

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
is non-existent so those are the two
main<00:02:13.710> reasons<00:02:14.190> why<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.580> protection<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
main reasons why you have protection and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.640 
main reasons why you have protection and
to<00:02:16.230> prevent<00:02:16.500> hyperextension<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.750> anyway<00:02:19.020> like

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
to prevent hyperextension so anyway like

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.010 
to prevent hyperextension so anyway like
I<00:02:19.800> said<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.280> because<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.940> hypertrophy<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
I said it because it hypertrophy the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.230 
I said it because it hypertrophy the
external<00:02:22.530> obliques<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.700> rectus

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
external obliques and the rectus

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.520 
external obliques and the rectus
abdominus<00:02:24.390> haven't<00:02:24.900> tend<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.290> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
abdominus haven't tend to have to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.890 
abdominus haven't tend to have to
tendency<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.280> hypertrophy<00:02:26.940> there<00:02:27.630> are<00:02:27.720> much

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
tendency to hypertrophy there are much

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.220 
tendency to hypertrophy there are much
more<00:02:27.930> explosive<00:02:28.620> muscles<00:02:29.310> than<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
more explosive muscles than the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.810 
more explosive muscles than the
stabilizing<00:02:31.230> effect<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.860> your<00:02:32.070> transversus

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
stabilizing effect of your transversus

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.660 
stabilizing effect of your transversus
abdominus<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.450> internal<00:02:33.900> obliques<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.670> that

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
abdominus and internal obliques so that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.310 
abdominus and internal obliques so that
means<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.180> they<00:02:36.360> have<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.660> tendency<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.200> get

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
means that they have a tendency to get

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.500 
means that they have a tendency to get
big<00:02:37.740> chunky<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.730> strong<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.210> like<00:02:39.390> your

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
big chunky and strong just like your

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.430 
big chunky and strong just like your

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
to lift weights we lift weights used to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.699 
to lift weights we lift weights used to
train<00:03:19.350> all<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.560> our<00:03:19.709> muscles<00:03:19.970> so<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:22.500> cool

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
train all of our muscles so the cool

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.320 
train all of our muscles so the cool
thing<00:03:22.920> about<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.250> exercise<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.910> this<00:03:24.030> setup

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
thing about this exercise in this setup

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.740 
thing about this exercise in this setup
is<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:26.250> we<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.610> use<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> lot<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.270> heavy<00:03:27.510> weight

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
is that we can use a lot of heavy weight

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.970 
is that we can use a lot of heavy weight
to<00:03:27.930> Train<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.260> rep<00:03:28.410> from<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.650> rectus

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
to Train the rep from the rectus

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.820 
to Train the rep from the rectus
abdominis<00:03:29.330> this<00:03:30.330> here<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.870> really<00:03:31.110> important

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
abdominis this here is really important

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.070 
abdominis this here is really important
this<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.130> BOSU<00:03:32.700> balance<00:03:33.600> trainer<00:03:33.870> they

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
this is a BOSU balance trainer they

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.750 
this is a BOSU balance trainer they
should<00:03:34.260> probably<00:03:34.380> pay<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.950> quickness<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
should probably pay the quickness in the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.000 
should probably pay the quickness in the
video<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.720> happen<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.260> be<00:03:37.470> letting

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
video but I just happen to be letting

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.310 
video but I just happen to be letting
you<00:03:38.070> know<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.580> what<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.760> use<00:03:39.120> you<00:03:39.989> can<00:03:40.140> also

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
you know this is what I use you can also

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.130 
you know this is what I use you can also
use

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
use

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.930 
use
sandbag<00:03:41.770> if<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.250> don't<00:03:42.430> have<00:03:42.550> one<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.850> these

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
sandbag if you don't have one of these

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.690 
sandbag if you don't have one of these
or<00:03:43.600> you<00:03:43.630> possibly<00:03:44.200> use<00:03:44.410> your<00:03:44.590> Swiss<00:03:44.830> ball<00:03:45.100> but

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
or you possibly use your Swiss ball but

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.460 
or you possibly use your Swiss ball but
the<00:03:45.790> reason<00:03:46.120> why<00:03:46.240> I<00:03:46.270> have<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:46.840> set<00:03:47.170> up<00:03:47.290> in

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
the reason why I have this set up in

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.010 
the reason why I have this set up in
between<00:03:47.830> here<00:03:48.160> is<00:03:48.459> because<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.360> want<00:03:49.569> a<00:03:49.660> full

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
between here is because you want a full

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.440 
between here is because you want a full
range<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.770> motion<00:03:51.069> when<00:03:52.030> you're<00:03:52.180> training

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
range of motion when you're training

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.570 
range of motion when you're training
your<00:03:53.380> rectus<00:03:53.709> abdominus<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.280> want<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.520> be

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
your rectus abdominus you want to be

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.550 
your rectus abdominus you want to be
able<00:03:54.640> to<00:03:54.760> extend<00:03:55.150> fully<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.200> want<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.470> get

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
able to extend fully and you want to get

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.580 
able to extend fully and you want to get
my<00:03:56.680> flats<00:03:57.100> fully<00:03:57.490> most<00:03:58.390> people<00:03:58.930> when<00:03:59.470> they

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
my flats fully most people when they

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.410 
my flats fully most people when they
train<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.100> rectus<00:04:00.430> abdominus<00:04:00.580> they're

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
train the rectus abdominus they're

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.600 
train the rectus abdominus they're
laying<00:04:01.660> on<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.930> floor<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.620> it's<00:04:02.950> a<00:04:03.040> very<00:04:03.280> short

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
laying on the floor so it's a very short

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.670 
laying on the floor so it's a very short
range<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.940> motion<00:04:04.270> this<00:04:04.750> here<00:04:05.050> allows<00:04:05.290> for

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
range of motion this here allows for

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.590 
range of motion this here allows for
full<00:04:06.250> extension<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:06.970> flexion<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.180> set<00:04:10.480> it

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
full extension and flexion so I set it

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.440 
full extension and flexion so I set it
up<00:04:10.690> such<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.860> like<00:04:12.010> I'm<00:04:12.250> sitting<00:04:12.700> right<00:04:12.880> at

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
up such that like I'm sitting right at

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.740 
up such that like I'm sitting right at
the<00:04:13.510> edge<00:04:13.959> here<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.940> then<00:04:15.940> I<00:04:15.970> lock<00:04:16.269> my<00:04:16.450> feet

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
the edge here and then I lock my feet

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.630 
the edge here and then I lock my feet
under<00:04:16.989> some<00:04:17.169> dumbbells<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:17.859> way<00:04:18.040> I<00:04:18.070> can<00:04:18.430> I

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.480 
under some dumbbells that way I can I
can<00:04:19.919> anchor<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.310> I<00:04:21.579> like<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.270> use<00:04:22.660> this<00:04:23.490> rope

can anchor it in I like to use this rope

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.150 
can anchor it in I like to use this rope
I<00:04:24.970> set<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.660> up<00:04:25.750> right<00:04:25.990> now<00:04:26.140> I'm<00:04:26.410> pretty<00:04:26.620> Lyons<00:04:27.040> I

athlete<00:05:31.309> like<00:05:31.789> I've<00:05:31.969> mentioned<00:05:32.089> before<00:05:32.269> a

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
athlete like I've mentioned before a

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.019 
athlete like I've mentioned before a
boxer<00:05:33.080> or<00:05:33.289> football<00:05:34.099> player<00:05:34.369> who<00:05:34.639> needs<00:05:34.669> it

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:35.029 
boxer or football player who needs it

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:36.969 
boxer or football player who needs it
for<00:05:35.119> protection<00:05:35.719> and<00:05:35.869> to<00:05:36.679> prevent

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
for protection and to prevent

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.429 
for protection and to prevent
hyperextension<00:05:37.879> you<00:05:38.419> can<00:05:38.629> add<00:05:39.019> some<00:05:39.409> more

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:39.439 
hyperextension you can add some more

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:44.489 
hyperextension you can add some more
weight<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.099> go<00:05:40.279> you<00:05:40.909> know<00:05:41.740> four<00:05:42.740> to<00:05:42.949> six<00:05:42.979> reps

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:44.499 
weight and go you know four to six reps

00:05:44.499 --> 00:06:04.529 
weight and go you know four to six reps
so<00:05:45.499> I<00:05:46.069> think<00:05:46.309> I<00:05:46.369> double<00:05:46.729> the<00:05:46.819> weight<00:05:46.969> there

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.670 

so<00:06:05.539> that's<00:06:05.719> it<00:06:05.900> again<00:06:06.110> you<00:06:06.259> know<00:06:06.379> these<00:06:06.529> are

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
so that's it again you know these are

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.379 
so that's it again you know these are
just<00:06:06.710> basic<00:06:07.069> principles<00:06:07.550> of<00:06:07.699> body<00:06:08.120> building

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
just basic principles of body building

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.029 
just basic principles of body building

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.219 
of strength training your training for

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
hypertrophy no matter what the muscle

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.950 
hypertrophy no matter what the muscle

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
set if it's your biceps if your calves

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.920

four sets eight to twelve repetitions if

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.129 
four sets eight to twelve repetitions if
you're<00:06:28.639> training<00:06:28.879> for<00:06:28.999> power<00:06:29.449> and<00:06:29.779> strength

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
you're training for power and strength

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.100 
you're training for power and strength
it's<00:06:30.949> going<00:06:31.129> to<00:06:31.189> be<00:06:31.310> a<00:06:31.340> bit<00:06:31.550> more<00:06:31.789> like<00:06:32.110> three

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
it's going to be a bit more like three

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.670 
it's going to be a bit more like three
to<00:06:33.229> five<00:06:33.879> maybe<00:06:34.879> even<00:06:35.060> six<00:06:35.240> sets<00:06:35.870> but<00:06:36.439> you<00:06:36.529> keep

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
to five maybe even six sets but you keep

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.730 
to five maybe even six sets but you keep
the<00:06:36.800> reps<00:06:37.039> a<00:06:37.219> lot<00:06:37.339> lower<00:06:37.550> three<00:06:38.509> to<00:06:38.629> five<00:06:38.870> reps

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
the reps a lot lower three to five reps

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.010 
the reps a lot lower three to five reps
longer<00:06:40.490> rest<00:06:40.669> intervals<00:06:40.969> and<00:06:41.569> perhaps<00:06:41.719> less

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
longer rest intervals and perhaps less

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.659 
longer rest intervals and perhaps less
frequency<00:06:42.499> that's<00:06:43.159> it<00:06:43.400> what<00:06:43.969> that<00:06:44.150> helps<00:06:44.330> done
