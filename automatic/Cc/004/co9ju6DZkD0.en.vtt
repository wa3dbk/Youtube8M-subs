what's up guys it's Nightwing to 3:03
from<00:00:07.020> we're<00:00:07.200> testers<00:00:07.560> calm<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.250> today

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670

from we're testers calm and today
finally<00:00:09.030> pick<00:00:09.269> up<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.540> Air<00:00:09.660> Jordan<00:00:09.690> project

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
finally pick up the Air Jordan project

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.749 
finally pick up the Air Jordan project
right<00:00:10.679> where<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:10.860> left<00:00:11.099> off<00:00:11.309> at<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.610> Air<00:00:11.730> Jordan

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
right where I left off at the Air Jordan

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.669 
right where I left off at the Air Jordan
20<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.019> being<00:00:13.200> said<00:00:13.320> let's<00:00:13.559> go

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
20 so with that being said let's go

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.530 
20 so with that being said let's go

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
ahead and get right into it so when you

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.939 
ahead and get right into it so when you
first<00:00:15.780> look<00:00:15.929> at<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> traction<00:00:16.350> provided<00:00:16.859> you

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
first look at the traction provided you

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:17.960 
first look at the traction provided you
can't<00:00:17.190> help<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.460> thing<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.760> you're<00:00:17.880> going

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
can't help the thing that you're going

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.640 
can't help the thing that you're going
to<00:00:18.090> receive<00:00:18.330> some<00:00:18.630> really<00:00:18.900> awesome<00:00:19.050> traction

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
to receive some really awesome traction

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.320 
to receive some really awesome traction
especially<00:00:20.130> since<00:00:20.340> there's<00:00:20.580> herringbone<00:00:21.090> in

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
especially since there's herringbone in

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.150 
especially since there's herringbone in
these<00:00:21.660> pods<00:00:21.930> unfortunately<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.980> wasn't

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
these pods unfortunately that wasn't

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160 
these pods unfortunately that wasn't
always<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.760> case<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.300> herringbone<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.930> bit

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
always the case the herringbone is a bit

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.750 
always the case the herringbone is a bit
inconsistent<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.310> quite<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
inconsistent which is quite a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.040 
inconsistent which is quite a
disappointment<00:00:27.000> because<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
disappointment because this is the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.720 
disappointment because this is the
section<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.680> shoe<00:00:29.099> where<00:00:29.550> you'd

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
section of the the shoe where you'd

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.160 
section of the the shoe where you'd
really<00:00:30.330> assume<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:30.869> gonna<00:00:31.019> perform

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
really assume that it's gonna perform

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.290 
really assume that it's gonna perform
exceptionally<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:32.250> its<00:00:32.520> main<00:00:32.700> problem<00:00:33.180> is

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
exceptionally well its main problem is

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.000 
exceptionally well its main problem is
just<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.899> kind<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.500> gets<00:00:34.620> clogged

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
just that it kind of just gets clogged

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.190 
just that it kind of just gets clogged
up<00:00:35.190> super<00:00:35.730> fast<00:00:35.760> there's<00:00:36.510> not<00:00:36.719> very<00:00:36.750> much

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
up super fast there's not very much

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.680 
up super fast there's not very much
herringbone<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.640> little<00:00:38.940> coverage<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
herringbone so what little coverage you

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.780 
herringbone so what little coverage you
do<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> herringbone<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.640> kind

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
do have of the herringbone it just kind

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.220 
do have of the herringbone it just kind
of<00:00:41.850> gets<00:00:42.030> caked<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.750> whatever<00:00:42.930> debris

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
of gets caked up with whatever debris

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.450 
of gets caked up with whatever debris
might<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> floor<00:00:44.190> surprisingly

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
might be on the floor surprisingly

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.580 
might be on the floor surprisingly
enough<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.450> whole<00:00:45.600> exterior<00:00:46.050> section

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
enough of this whole exterior section

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.080 
enough of this whole exterior section
these<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.920> big<00:00:47.160> thick<00:00:47.460> grooves<00:00:47.789> they

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
these like big thick grooves they

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
these like big thick grooves they
actually<00:00:48.510> grip<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> floor<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.680> really

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
actually grip the floor really really

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
actually grip the floor really really
nicely<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.059> awesome<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
nicely it would be really awesome if it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
nicely it would be really awesome if it
was<00:00:51.840> more<00:00:52.469> consistent<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> pattern

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
was more consistent with the pattern

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.790 
was more consistent with the pattern
either<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> way<00:00:55.379> or<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> other

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
either one kind of way or the other

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.340 
either one kind of way or the other
either<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.610> herringbone<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.079> stuff

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
either all herringbone or all this stuff

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.799 
either all herringbone or all this stuff
so<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.920> constant<00:00:59.430> wiping<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> upkeep<00:01:00.329> while

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
so with constant wiping and upkeep while

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.209 
so with constant wiping and upkeep while
on<00:01:00.989> court<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> big<00:01:01.800> deal<00:01:01.980> especially

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
on court it's not a big deal especially

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.560 
on court it's not a big deal especially
on<00:01:02.640> clean<00:01:02.850> core<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
on clean core it's not going to be a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
on clean core it's not going to be a
huge<00:01:03.780> factor<00:01:04.019> but<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.589> play<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.799> pretty

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
huge factor but if you do play on pretty

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.190 
huge factor but if you do play on pretty
dusty<00:01:05.850> courts<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> definitely<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
dusty courts this is definitely going to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.960 
dusty courts this is definitely going to
give<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> some<00:01:07.619> inconsistent<00:01:08.280> coverage<00:01:08.610> so

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
give you some inconsistent coverage so

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.870 
give you some inconsistent coverage so
the<00:01:09.090> cushioning<00:01:09.420> system<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:10.020> IPS<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:11.430> also

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the cushioning system is IPS that's also

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
the cushioning system is IPS that's also
known<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.090> independent<00:01:12.930> popular<00:01:13.290> suspension

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
known as independent popular suspension

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.530 
known as independent popular suspension
it's<00:01:14.070> an<00:01:14.189> interesting<00:01:14.490> cushion<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it's an interesting cushion and this is

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.910 
it's an interesting cushion and this is
the<00:01:15.659> first<00:01:15.869> shoe<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.380> ever<00:01:16.530> featured

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the first shoe that it was ever featured

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.499 
the first shoe that it was ever featured
on<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> guys<00:01:17.640> watch<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:18.150> previous

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
on now if you guys watch my previous

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.240 
on now if you guys watch my previous
review<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.470> shoe<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.100> like

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
review of this shoe just kind of like

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.010 
review of this shoe just kind of like
the<00:01:20.369> click<00:01:20.580> look<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.060> already<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the click look you already know that the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.370 
the click look you already know that the
IPS<00:01:22.920> system<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.210> place<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> older

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
IPS system that is in place in the older

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620 
IPS system that is in place in the older
models<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> little<00:01:26.580> bit<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:26.820> firm<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
models is a little bit more firm and it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.149 
models is a little bit more firm and it
gets<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.930> way<00:01:28.080> over<00:01:28.350> time<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.130> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
gets that way over time so what I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.190 
gets that way over time so what I
recommend<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.820> getting<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.210> fresh<00:01:30.450> pair<00:01:30.720> just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
recommend is getting a fresh pair just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.690 
recommend is getting a fresh pair just
because<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> foam<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.009> not<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.460> hard

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
because the foam is not going to be hard

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.999 
because the foam is not going to be hard
so<00:01:32.970> basically<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> PS<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.650> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
so basically what I PS is is you have a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
so basically what I PS is is you have a
file<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.400> midsole<00:01:35.909> which<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.540> carrier<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
file on midsole which is the carrier and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.050 
file on midsole which is the carrier and
then<00:01:37.259> each<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:37.740> potted<00:01:38.130> sections<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.030> a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
then each of these potted sections is a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.940 
then each of these potted sections is a
different<00:01:39.630> density<00:01:39.720> foam<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.770> don't

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
different density foam and then I don't

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.840 
different density foam and then I don't
know<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.159> could<00:01:41.310> see<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
know if you could see it but it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.090 
know if you could see it but it
basically<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.479> pod<00:01:42.780> protrudes<00:01:43.290> out<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.710> couple

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
basically the pod protrudes out a couple

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
basically the pod protrudes out a couple
millimeters<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.909> then<00:01:45.119> there's<00:01:45.299> also<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.600> few

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
millimeters and then there's also a few

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.020 
millimeters and then there's also a few
millimeters<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.470> space<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:47.040> between<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.700> pod

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
millimeters of space in between this pod

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
millimeters of space in between this pod
and<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.600> file<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.020> itself<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.470> what<00:01:49.740> basically

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and the file on itself so what basically

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.230 
and the file on itself so what basically
happens<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.060> these

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
happens if you have you have these

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.899 
happens if you have you have these
little<00:01:51.630> Pistons<00:01:52.170> everywhere<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:53.610> kind<00:01:53.850> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
little Pistons everywhere it kind of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.060 
little Pistons everywhere it kind of
like<00:01:54.060> marshmallows<00:01:54.750> marshmallow<00:01:55.619> Pistons

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
like marshmallows marshmallow Pistons

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
like marshmallows marshmallow Pistons
and<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.670> you're<00:01:56.820> stepping<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> floor<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
and so you're stepping on the floor and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.690 
and so you're stepping on the floor and
it's<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.590> compress<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.430> wipe

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
it's going to compress and then wipe

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
it's going to compress and then wipe
mount<00:02:00.000> giving<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.570> impact<00:02:01.079> protection<00:02:01.229> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
mount giving you impact protection and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.200 
mount giving you impact protection and
then<00:02:01.890> when<00:02:02.040> you're<00:02:02.189> releasing<00:02:02.460> pressure<00:02:02.790> off

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
then when you're releasing pressure off

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.030 
then when you're releasing pressure off
your<00:02:03.420> stride<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.020> gonna<00:02:04.170> bounce<00:02:04.530> back<00:02:04.710> into

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
your stride it's gonna bounce back into

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.380 
your stride it's gonna bounce back into
shape<00:02:05.219> giving<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.670> some<00:02:05.880> responsiveness

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
shape giving you some responsiveness

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.180 
shape giving you some responsiveness
like<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.869> said<00:02:07.020> earlier<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.770> an<00:02:07.860> older

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
like I said earlier if it's on an older

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.979 
like I said earlier if it's on an older
pair<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.550> an<00:02:08.670> original<00:02:08.879> pair<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.810> whatever

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
pair like an original pair for whatever

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.839 
pair like an original pair for whatever
reason<00:02:10.470> unless<00:02:10.739> these<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:10.950> broken<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
reason unless these are broken in the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.700 
reason unless these are broken in the
softer<00:02:12.810> foam<00:02:13.020> is<00:02:13.200> just<00:02:13.379> going<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
softer foam is just going to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.810 
softer foam is just going to
firm<00:02:13.830> up<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.190> it's<00:02:14.310> gonna<00:02:14.460> be<00:02:14.640> pretty

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
firm up and it's gonna be pretty

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.190 
firm up and it's gonna be pretty
uncomfortable<00:02:15.270> but<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.840> get<00:02:15.960> anything

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
uncomfortable but if you get anything

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.870 
uncomfortable but if you get anything

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
like you're running on marshmallow

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.020 
like you're running on marshmallow
clouds<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.440> it's<00:02:25.980> amazing<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.790> really

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
clouds it's it's amazing so I do really

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.670 
clouds it's it's amazing so I do really
like<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.330> cushion<00:02:27.690> setup<00:02:28.020> another<00:02:28.350> shoe<00:02:28.560> that

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
like the cushion setup another shoe that

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.170 
like the cushion setup another shoe that
you<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:28.920> actually<00:02:29.040> find<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
you can actually find this in is the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.300 
you can actually find this in is the
Jordan<00:02:30.540> icons<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.620> basically<00:02:31.740> uses<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
Jordan icons and it basically uses the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.760 
Jordan icons and it basically uses the
Air<00:02:32.670> Jordan<00:02:32.900> 22<00:02:33.900> length<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.440> midsole

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
Air Jordan 22 length so the midsole

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.620 
Air Jordan 22 length so the midsole
outsole<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.730> cushion<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:36.300> they<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.600> a

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
outsole and cushion and then they have a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.150 
outsole and cushion and then they have a
redesigned<00:02:37.170> effort<00:02:37.470> now<00:02:37.590> materials<00:02:38.100> are

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
redesigned effort now materials are

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.500 
redesigned effort now materials are
gonna<00:02:38.280> vary<00:02:38.580> depending<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> colorway

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
gonna vary depending on the colorway

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.000 
gonna vary depending on the colorway
that<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.750> choose<00:02:40.050> but<00:02:40.350> they<00:02:40.470> basically<00:02:40.740> give

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
that you choose but they basically give

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.560 
that you choose but they basically give
you<00:02:41.100> three<00:02:41.370> options<00:02:41.730> they<00:02:41.940> give<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.240> patent

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
you three options they give you patent

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.030 
you three options they give you patent
leather<00:02:42.720> such<00:02:43.080> as<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.350> Stealth's<00:02:43.830> and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
leather such as the Stealth's and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.740 
leather such as the Stealth's and
they're<00:02:44.160> gonna<00:02:44.250> give<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.940> leather<00:02:45.300> option

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
they're gonna give you a leather option

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.060 
they're gonna give you a leather option
which<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.170> these<00:02:46.320> guys<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.860> then<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
which is like these guys and then you

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.010 
which is like these guys and then you
also<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.730> suede<00:02:48.120> versions<00:02:48.570> such<00:02:48.870> as

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
also have the suede versions such as

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.050 
also have the suede versions such as
this<00:02:49.170> basically<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.220> pairs<00:02:50.460> with<00:02:50.670> patent

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
this basically the pairs with patent

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.550 
this basically the pairs with patent
leather<00:02:51.180> they're<00:02:51.570> gonna<00:02:51.690> require<00:02:52.050> slightly

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
leather they're gonna require slightly

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.260 
leather they're gonna require slightly
more<00:02:52.710> break-in<00:02:53.100> time<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.790> they<00:02:53.910> will<00:02:54.090> offer

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
more break-in time that they will offer

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.030 
more break-in time that they will offer
a<00:02:54.450> little<00:02:54.750> bit<00:02:54.840> more<00:02:54.990> support<00:02:55.440> while<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.890> new

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
a little bit more support while the new

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.920 
a little bit more support while the new
buck<00:02:56.220> pairs<00:02:56.490> offer<00:02:56.700> less<00:02:57.030> support<00:02:57.450> as<00:02:57.630> well<00:02:57.780> as

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
buck pairs offer less support as well as

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.420 
buck pairs offer less support as well as
less<00:02:58.110> break-in<00:02:58.500> time<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:58.920> that's<00:02:59.130> only

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
less break-in time but that's only

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.980 
less break-in time but that's only
slightly<00:02:59.760> less<00:03:00.150> support<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.660> not<00:03:00.690> like

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
slightly less support it's not like

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.450 
slightly less support it's not like
anything<00:03:01.320> crazy<00:03:01.560> I've<00:03:01.740> played<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.130> both<00:03:02.430> of

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
anything crazy I've played and both of

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.310 
anything crazy I've played and both of
them<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.820> they<00:03:03.180> played<00:03:03.390> almost<00:03:03.690> identically

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
them and they played almost identically

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.540 
them and they played almost identically
and<00:03:04.470> then<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.620> have<00:03:04.770> these<00:03:04.890> guys<00:03:04.950> here<00:03:05.400> which

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
and then you have these guys here which

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.040 
and then you have these guys here which
is<00:03:05.700> kind<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.270> random<00:03:06.630> release<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
is kind of like the random release I

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.140 
is kind of like the random release I
don't<00:03:07.200> remember<00:03:07.500> too<00:03:07.980> many<00:03:08.130> Air<00:03:08.580> Jordan<00:03:08.880> 20s

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
don't remember too many Air Jordan 20s

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.850 
don't remember too many Air Jordan 20s
having<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.540> full-on<00:03:09.780> leather<00:03:10.140> upper<00:03:10.440> like<00:03:10.620> this

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
having a full-on leather upper like this

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.980 
having a full-on leather upper like this
but<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.580> actually<00:03:11.880> like<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.330> really<00:03:12.750> nice

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
but this is actually like a really nice

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.870 
but this is actually like a really nice
leather<00:03:13.260> it's<00:03:13.500> very<00:03:13.710> soft<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.370> there's<00:03:14.640> very

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
leather it's very soft so there's very

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.370 
leather it's very soft so there's very
little<00:03:15.060> break-in<00:03:15.360> time<00:03:15.660> required<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.290> it

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
little break-in time required and it

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.840 
little break-in time required and it
offers<00:03:16.680> support<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.370> kind<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.580> like<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
offers support so it's kind of like the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.130 
offers support so it's kind of like the
best<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.180> both<00:03:18.300> worlds<00:03:18.330> it's<00:03:18.840> out<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.080> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
best of both worlds it's out of the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.080 
best of both worlds it's out of the
three<00:03:19.380> options<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.980> patent<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.610> leather<00:03:20.850> and

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
three options the patent the leather and

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.370 
three options the patent the leather and
the<00:03:21.270> new<00:03:21.420> but<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.720> leather<00:03:21.900> is<00:03:22.050> going<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.260> be

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
the new but the leather is going to be

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.990 
the new but the leather is going to be
like<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.680> most<00:03:22.890> neutral<00:03:23.310> but<00:03:23.490> it's<00:03:23.790> kind<00:03:23.970> of

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
like the most neutral but it's kind of

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.760 
like the most neutral but it's kind of
nice<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.390> they<00:03:24.570> have<00:03:24.600> those<00:03:25.170> three<00:03:25.440> options

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
nice that they have those three options

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.590 
nice that they have those three options
available<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.340> gives<00:03:27.030> everybody<00:03:27.390> something

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
available so gives everybody something

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.150 
available so gives everybody something
to<00:03:28.020> kind<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.260> look<00:03:28.350> forward<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:28.890> no<00:03:29.040> matter

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
to kind of look forward to so no matter

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.860 
to kind of look forward to so no matter
if<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.550> want<00:03:29.730> extra<00:03:30.060> support<00:03:30.480> or<00:03:30.600> less

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
if you want extra support or less

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.750 
if you want extra support or less
support<00:03:31.260> there's<00:03:31.890> something<00:03:32.220> out<00:03:32.400> there<00:03:32.430> for

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
support there's something out there for

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.220 
support there's something out there for
everyone<00:03:33.000> now<00:03:33.270> as<00:03:33.390> far<00:03:33.540> as<00:03:33.600> their<00:03:33.810> fit<00:03:34.020> I<00:03:34.170> do

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
everyone now as far as their fit I do

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.290 
everyone now as far as their fit I do
feel<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.860> 20s<00:03:35.190> fit<00:03:35.370> slightly<00:03:35.940> big<00:03:36.150> I

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
feel that the 20s fit slightly big I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.150 
feel that the 20s fit slightly big I
have<00:03:36.540> two<00:03:36.900> different<00:03:37.050> sizes<00:03:37.350> these<00:03:37.860> are<00:03:38.070> an

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
have two different sizes these are an

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.860 
have two different sizes these are an
eight<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.430> half<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.820> blue<00:03:39.060> pair<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.330> have<00:03:39.420> is

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
eight and a half the blue pair I have is

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.990 
eight and a half the blue pair I have is
a<00:03:39.900> nine<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.590> then<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.100> red<00:03:41.250> pair<00:03:41.490> is<00:03:41.730> an<00:03:41.850> eight

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
a nine and then the red pair is an eight

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.460 
a nine and then the red pair is an eight
and<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> half<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.540> out<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.810> tube<00:03:43.050> they

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
and a half and out of the tube they

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.320 
and a half and out of the tube they
pretty<00:03:43.890> much<00:03:44.100> work<00:03:44.400> for<00:03:44.430> me<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:44.970> do<00:03:45.060> prefer

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
pretty much work for me but I do prefer

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.820 
pretty much work for me but I do prefer
the<00:03:45.720> eight<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:45.990> a<00:03:46.020> half<00:03:46.140> it's<00:03:46.380> just<00:03:46.560> got<00:03:46.800> a

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
the eight and a half it's just got a

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.530 
the eight and a half it's just got a
slightly<00:03:47.130> more<00:03:47.400> snug<00:03:47.730> feel<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.210> it's<00:03:48.300> kind<00:03:48.480> of

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
slightly more snug feel and it's kind of

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.090 
slightly more snug feel and it's kind of
wraps<00:03:49.020> around<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.470> envelopes<00:03:49.770> your<00:03:49.920> foot<00:03:50.070> a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
wraps around and envelopes your foot a

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.440 
wraps around and envelopes your foot a
little<00:03:50.220> bit<00:03:50.430> better<00:03:50.550> in<00:03:50.760> my<00:03:50.880> opinion<00:03:50.970> so

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
little bit better in my opinion so

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.030 
little bit better in my opinion so
that's<00:03:51.720> what<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.930> personally<00:03:52.410> prefer<00:03:52.740> but<00:03:52.950> if

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
that's what I personally prefer but if

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.320 
that's what I personally prefer but if
you<00:03:53.160> are<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> wide<00:03:53.580> footer<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:53.910> might<00:03:54.120> want<00:03:54.300> to

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
you are a wide footer you might want to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.580 
you are a wide footer you might want to
just<00:03:54.480> try<00:03:54.630> going<00:03:54.870> with<00:03:55.080> your<00:03:55.200> true<00:03:55.410> size

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
just try going with your true size

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.780 
just try going with your true size
because<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.250> said<00:03:56.310> there's<00:03:56.550> just<00:03:56.610> a

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
because like I said there's just a

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.100 
because like I said there's just a
little<00:03:56.970> bit<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.120> extra<00:03:57.330> space<00:03:57.600> which<00:03:57.900> might

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
little bit of extra space which might

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.660 
little bit of extra space which might
work<00:03:58.230> out<00:03:58.410> really<00:03:58.590> well<00:03:58.830> for<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:59.130> plus<00:03:59.550> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
work out really well for you plus the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.980 
work out really well for you plus the
materials<00:04:00.090> on<00:04:00.240> most<00:04:00.420> of<00:04:00.480> these<00:04:00.570> pairs<00:04:00.810> with

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
materials on most of these pairs with

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
materials on most of these pairs with
the<00:04:01.020> exception<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.650> patent<00:04:01.920> leather

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
the exception of the patent leather

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.470 
the exception of the patent leather
versions<00:04:02.520> are<00:04:02.730> gonna<00:04:02.850> break<00:04:03.120> in<00:04:03.270> really

of the support comes from that lockdown

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.600 
of the support comes from that lockdown
that<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:37.620> was<00:05:37.710> explained<00:05:38.010> about<00:05:38.160> earlier<00:05:38.490> in

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
that I was explained about earlier in

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.280 
that I was explained about earlier in
the<00:05:38.700> fit<00:05:38.880> section<00:05:39.270> this<00:05:39.479> strap<00:05:39.780> is<00:05:39.930> awesome

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290

one<00:05:40.470> thing<00:05:40.620> that<00:05:40.740> I<00:05:40.800> like<00:05:40.950> about<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:41.280> strap<00:05:41.490> is

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
one thing that I like about the strap is

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.980 
one thing that I like about the strap is
that<00:05:41.729> when<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:42.000> tie<00:05:42.180> your<00:05:42.270> laces<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.780> tuck

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
that when you tie your laces you tuck

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.719 
that when you tie your laces you tuck
them<00:05:43.110> under<00:05:43.350> you<00:05:43.560> strap<00:05:43.860> them<00:05:44.010> closed<00:05:44.250> you

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
them under you strap them closed you

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:45.920 
them under you strap them closed you
don't<00:05:44.910> have<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.120> double<00:05:45.419> knot<00:05:45.540> and<00:05:45.570> you<00:05:45.720> just

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
don't have to double knot and you just

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.300 
don't have to double knot and you just
forget<00:05:46.200> about<00:05:46.320> them<00:05:46.560> all<00:05:46.620> together<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:47.160> also

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
forget about them all together it also

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.100 
forget about them all together it also
gives<00:05:47.610> you<00:05:47.700> lateral<00:05:48.150> support<00:05:48.540> as<00:05:48.660> well<00:05:48.840> so<00:05:49.020> if

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
gives you lateral support as well so if

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.570 
gives you lateral support as well so if
you're<00:05:49.260> shifting<00:05:49.620> side<00:05:49.860> to<00:05:50.010> side<00:05:50.190> moving

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
you're shifting side to side moving

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.680 
you're shifting side to side moving
change<00:05:50.820> of<00:05:50.940> directions<00:05:51.030> whatever<00:05:51.450> you<00:05:51.630> might

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
change of directions whatever you might

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.240 
change of directions whatever you might
be<00:05:51.840> doing<00:05:51.960> this<00:05:52.470> strap<00:05:52.800> is<00:05:52.830> basically

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
be doing this strap is basically

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.710 
be doing this strap is basically
creating<00:05:53.729> tension<00:05:54.120> because<00:05:54.390> it's<00:05:54.540> wrapped

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
creating tension because it's wrapped

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.180 
creating tension because it's wrapped
all<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:54.900> way<00:05:55.020> on<00:05:55.229> to<00:05:55.470> the<00:05:55.590> other<00:05:55.740> side<00:05:56.010> of<00:05:56.040> the

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
all the way on to the other side of the

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.590 
all the way on to the other side of the
medial<00:05:56.490> there<00:05:56.669> is<00:05:56.790> a<00:05:56.850> second<00:05:57.180> strap<00:05:57.360> on<00:05:57.510> the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
medial there is a second strap on the

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.810 
medial there is a second strap on the
shoe<00:05:57.780> which<00:05:58.020> is<00:05:58.050> very<00:05:58.500> apparent<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.070> this<00:05:59.610> one

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
shoe which is very apparent and this one

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.580 
shoe which is very apparent and this one
absolutely<00:06:00.060> does<00:06:00.600> nothing<00:06:00.990> it's<00:06:01.229> just<00:06:01.410> kind

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
absolutely does nothing it's just kind

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.440 
absolutely does nothing it's just kind
of<00:06:01.650> there<00:06:01.770> for<00:06:02.010> placebo<00:06:02.550> and<00:06:02.790> most<00:06:03.300> of<00:06:03.390> the

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
of there for placebo and most of the

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.820 
of there for placebo and most of the
time<00:06:03.630> it<00:06:03.750> just<00:06:03.780> kind<00:06:04.080> of<00:06:04.140> gets<00:06:04.260> in<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.440> way<00:06:04.650> the

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
time it just kind of gets in the way the

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.140 
time it just kind of gets in the way the
only<00:06:04.979> thing<00:06:05.130> I<00:06:05.250> really<00:06:05.520> like<00:06:05.669> it<00:06:05.820> for<00:06:05.850> is<00:06:06.060> that

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
only thing I really like it for is that

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.640 
only thing I really like it for is that
it<00:06:06.270> helps<00:06:06.360> me<00:06:06.600> get<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:06.840> shoe<00:06:07.020> on<00:06:07.050> and<00:06:07.440> if<00:06:07.530> it

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
it helps me get the shoe on and if it

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.110 
it helps me get the shoe on and if it
wasn't<00:06:07.830> for<00:06:07.979> that<00:06:08.100> I'd<00:06:08.340> probably<00:06:08.460> have<00:06:08.910> cut

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
wasn't for that I'd probably have cut

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.460 
wasn't for that I'd probably have cut
this<00:06:09.270> thing<00:06:09.450> off<00:06:09.600> already<00:06:09.900> one<00:06:10.169> thing<00:06:10.320> that

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
this thing off already one thing that

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.870 
this thing off already one thing that
you<00:06:10.560> can<00:06:10.770> do<00:06:10.919> to<00:06:11.010> keep<00:06:11.130> it<00:06:11.250> out<00:06:11.400> of<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.550> way<00:06:11.669> is

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
you can do to keep it out of the way is

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.460 
you can do to keep it out of the way is
open<00:06:12.150> this<00:06:12.330> little<00:06:12.510> flat<00:06:12.810> tab<00:06:13.080> here<00:06:13.290> and<00:06:13.380> then

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
open this little flat tab here and then

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.690 
open this little flat tab here and then
you're<00:06:13.590> gonna<00:06:13.680> put<00:06:13.950> that<00:06:14.100> in<00:06:14.280> between<00:06:14.610> the

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
you're gonna put that in between the

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.969 
you're gonna put that in between the
strap<00:06:15.000> and<00:06:15.780> close<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:16.290> and<00:06:16.470> it<00:06:16.560> turns<00:06:16.800> into

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
strap and close it and it turns into

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.980 
strap and close it and it turns into
almost<00:06:17.370> a<00:06:17.640> one-piece<00:06:18.030> so<00:06:18.330> there's<00:06:18.540> no<00:06:18.690> moving

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
almost a one-piece so there's no moving

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.659 
almost a one-piece so there's no moving
and<00:06:19.290> things<00:06:19.410> like<00:06:19.590> that<00:06:19.800> cuz<00:06:19.919> I<00:06:19.979> really<00:06:20.460> didn't

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
and things like that cuz I really didn't

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.070 
and things like that cuz I really didn't
like<00:06:20.790> how<00:06:20.970> this<00:06:21.120> thing<00:06:21.330> moved<00:06:21.570> with<00:06:21.750> my<00:06:21.870> ankle
