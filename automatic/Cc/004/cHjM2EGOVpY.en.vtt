00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.080 
the buccaneers I'm not hating on them I
just<00:01:29.359> think<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:29.689> uniform<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.409> just<00:01:30.859> ugly<00:01:31.670> it's

just think the uniform is just ugly it's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.469 
just think the uniform is just ugly it's
just<00:01:33.609> it's<00:01:34.609> so<00:01:35.740> just<00:01:36.880> amateur<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:37.909> guess<00:01:38.270> it's

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.029 
just it's so just amateur I guess it's
not<00:01:38.659> something<00:01:39.109> you<00:01:39.170> would<00:01:39.259> think<00:01:39.469> an<00:01:39.619> NFL

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
not something you would think an NFL

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.139

that<00:01:44.329> they<00:01:44.539> have<00:01:44.719> shown<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.319> far<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:45.859> just

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
that they have shown so far it's just

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.599 
that they have shown so far it's just
that<00:01:46.279> they're<00:01:46.609> away<00:01:46.909> uniform<00:01:47.539> their<00:01:47.779> way
