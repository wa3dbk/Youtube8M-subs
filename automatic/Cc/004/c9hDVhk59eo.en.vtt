 when it's cold inside it's 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.949
 spectacular but on the outside it's very 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.419
 simple 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.419
 this is the waiting area 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.829
 from above they will be shown to 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.829

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.650
 the airlines that go back and forth we go to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.650
 use the airlines to do the 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.190
 check-in here below for able to 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.190
 migration 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.170
 when we go to panama 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.610
 when we are going to get out of all this this 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:07.750
 line for you can be check-in here 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.750
 there is parking outside 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.920
 there is a part where the track is a 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.920
 spectacular thing ok let's go down 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.900
 nothing there is people making their little 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.640
 go out 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.130
 there is a little bit of people the other 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.760
 we defined and I was not there were you a 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.330
 little less we will see a little 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.330
 managements 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.340
 here the main cup airline does not 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.789
 it's a state airline is a 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.399
 it's a private line for the main 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.790
 panama airline we leave a 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.940
 focuses and excellent 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.590
 but I'm going to go to the bottom where 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:06.010
 is the arrival the problems all the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.440
 flights to show you a little bit how 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.340
 it's down we're going pretty small a 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.400
 single exit out there will come and good 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.770
 nothing this week showed and is for 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.890
 that country has a little located where 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.620
 get there 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.310
 this is already the bottom of 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.310
 From the airport 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.180
 here there is to rent cars there is a 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.870
 lots of companies to rent cars 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.430
 and various things 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.920
 so they know how to get to this side 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.650
 everything is here precisely that opens 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.480
 door 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.439
 and that's where our migration comes from 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.439
 etc 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.030
 many people waiting 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.100
 for that door decisions of lady 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.380
 it is precisely where they leave 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.380
 normally the grandfather 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.810
 waiting for people arriving 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.459
 but good 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.980
 that's the exit where normally with 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.080
 tones 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.709
 and those steady hand answers 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.709
 little ones 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.290
 a good recommendation very well 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.290
 important 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.980
 here it is very expensive if they sell it in payments 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.750
 the chinese 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.940
 everything I do here is the output that 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.030
 they would wait the taxi or person 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.030
 he is waiting for them in the case 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.510
 I do not understand here because it's expensive not 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.280
 they do it 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.069
 already then and let's make a video again 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.810
 about the service operators of 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.120
 video because I put the front camera and the 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.810
 and the back one to read me too 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.810
 I 'm going to cover 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.170
 why 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.170
 we'll think of another director though
