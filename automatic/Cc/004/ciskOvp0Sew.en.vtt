00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.470
 hello people i welcome you right 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.670
 heartily on my youtube channel my 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.320
 name is not a study from the company 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.550
 Kiki and I want you today 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.050
 once again an alarm system once 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.849
 Imagine that we made here 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.849
 have in a current 6 series cabriolet 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.010
 the statistics are right for us 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.060
 big navigation systems will be very 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.040
 often stolen 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.510
 a factory alarm system protects 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.310
 Unfortunately you are not ours 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.750
 installed systems of the company impire 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.750
 Protect new vehicle optimally 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.680
 new is now if you the vehicle 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.820
 leave generates the vehicle at the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.250
 to lock 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.740
 worthy even comfortable access is her 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.000
 see a so often die so can 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.160
 I'm sure that the vehicle 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.780
 is optimally protected and I know the 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.670
 alarm system sharp and pointed my 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.560
 vehicle if I have valuables in that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.300
 It's important that I have a vehicle 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.100
 him extra drama if any 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.900
 crooks are interested in the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 The system generates the alarm immediately 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.710
 a software turn on the blinker and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.350
 beat the rogue in the escape 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.270
 the crime takes place when 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.830
 I returned to the vehicle I open 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.540
 the vehicle again comfortable the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.150
 comfort access not at all 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.650
 factory key 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.000
 The system is built in such a way that I am in 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.710
 the practice of seeing nothing at all 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.430
 And yet my vehicle will be optimal 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.350
 protected 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.600
 important the alarm systems we 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.550
 have blocked a so-called free 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.210
 Alamein warning can do this 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.340
 to generate 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.280
 in conjunction with the rhader sensor the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.170
 company continues 1 2 to the microwave rader 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.950
 I can do such crimes 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.170
 prevent 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.149
 that happen for example when i mine 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.710
 park the vehicle without an alarm system 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.090
 if i had the vehicle and one 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.110
 alarm system off 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.150
 My advice to fruit is gone 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.950
 and the crooks know exactly as they do 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.989
 always find medium and possibilities around 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.250
 to come to the vehicle parts or on 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.250
 the things that I'm in the car 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.819
 is very practical that we solved 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.739
 this theme always in ours 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.540
 because new vehicle can block 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.220
 we only play the daily updated ones 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.540
 campus protocol in the vehicles 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.540
 and so says the optimally protected 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.650
 the vehicle in the worst against the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.480
 turn off you can be quite sure 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.610
 that the vehicle is optimally protected 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.710
 if we additionally obstruct a gps gsm 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.230
 Location system of the company impire in this 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.360
 fall of empire lures 200 so we are 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.680
 always sure the vehicle left that 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.570
 even if we are out of reach 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.750
 a funk pages would be that you 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.480

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.490
 yes in this bmw 6er is installed the 39 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.440
 03 connection with the radar module the 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.210
 We can adjust levels continuously
