it it's going to come stock with white
bushings<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.119> are<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:29.010> bad

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
bushings that are really really bad

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.269 
bushings that are really really bad
quality<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.260> super<00:00:31.260> hard<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.920> you're<00:00:32.070> not

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
quality and super hard so you're not

going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> want<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.850> use<00:00:32.910> those<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.480> got<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
going to want to use those you got to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.900 
going to want to use those you got to
remember<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.050> get<00:00:34.230> other<00:00:34.500> bushings<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.370> would

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
remember to get other bushings I would

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.930 
remember to get other bushings I would
recommend<00:00:36.440> double<00:00:37.440> barrel<00:00:37.770> venom<00:00:38.520> bushings

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
recommend double barrel venom bushings

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.500 
recommend double barrel venom bushings
or<00:00:39.329> some<00:00:40.170> sort<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.980> set<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.430> similar<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.390> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
or some sort of set up similar to that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.720 
or some sort of set up similar to that
so<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> molding<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> trucks<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> little

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
so the molding on the trucks is a little

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.580 
so the molding on the trucks is a little
sloppy<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.660> doesn't<00:00:45.930> affect<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> writing<00:00:46.500> at

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
sloppy it doesn't affect the writing at

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.680 
sloppy it doesn't affect the writing at
all<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:46.980> where<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> kingpin<00:00:48.059> goes<00:00:48.300> through

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
all but where the kingpin goes through

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.170 
all but where the kingpin goes through
on<00:00:49.079> every<00:00:49.800> truck<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.309> different<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:50.969> some

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
on every truck it's different for some

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.209 
on every truck it's different for some
reason<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.500> taking<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
reason just from taking it out of the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.619 
reason just from taking it out of the
mold<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.870> not<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> perfect<00:00:55.410> job<00:00:56.600> such<00:00:57.600> as

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
mold so it's not a perfect job such as

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.990 
mold so it's not a perfect job such as
other<00:00:57.989> trucks<00:00:58.379> which<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> nice<00:00:59.609> moldings

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
other trucks which have a nice moldings

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
other trucks which have a nice moldings
the<00:01:00.270> cool<00:01:00.449> thing<00:01:00.480> about<00:01:00.660> these<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.230> can

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the cool thing about these is you can

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.429 
the cool thing about these is you can
flip<00:01:01.859> them<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.280> it'll<00:01:02.910> drop<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> baseplate

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
flip them and it'll drop the baseplate

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
flip them and it'll drop the baseplate
three<00:01:04.830> degrees<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.090> better<00:01:06.270> for

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
three degrees so this is better for

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.210 
three degrees so this is better for
downhill<00:01:06.990> you're<00:01:07.409> not<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.040> much

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
downhill you're not going to get as much

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.270 
downhill you're not going to get as much
turn<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.600> truck<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.740> dropped

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
turn out of your truck if it's dropped

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.390 
turn out of your truck if it's dropped
it'll<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> lot<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.119> stable<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.780> lower

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
it'll be a lot more stable and lower

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.700 
it'll be a lot more stable and lower
when<00:01:14.400> you're<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.700> downhill<00:01:15.350> as<00:01:16.350> far<00:01:16.619> as

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
when you're going downhill as far as

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.710 
when you're going downhill as far as
