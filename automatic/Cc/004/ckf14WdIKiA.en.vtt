could this be we don't know we know that
the<00:00:39.390> data<00:00:39.719> comes<00:00:40.020> from<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.379> soil<00:00:40.710> sample<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the data comes from a soil sample that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
the data comes from a soil sample that
was<00:00:41.610> analyzed<00:00:42.149> by<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.450> rover<00:00:42.899> sample

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
was analyzed by the rover sample

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.700 
was analyzed by the rover sample
analysis<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.250> uh<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.960> that's<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.499> all

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
analysis and uh that that's really all

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
analysis and uh that that's really all
we<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:47.010> at<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.190> point<00:00:47.399> now<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:48.269> know<00:00:48.449> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
we know at this point now we know that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.869 
we know at this point now we know that
NASA<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.170> keeping<00:00:49.679> this<00:00:49.800> mostly<00:00:50.219> under<00:00:50.640> wraps

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
NASA is keeping this mostly under wraps

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.239 
NASA is keeping this mostly under wraps
because<00:00:51.179> it<00:00:51.570> could<00:00:51.839> be<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> false<00:00:52.289> alarm<00:00:52.440> but

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:53.249 
because it could be a false alarm but

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:54.649 
because it could be a false alarm but
you<00:00:53.399> would<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:54.059> there's<00:00:54.390> still<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
you would think if there's still a

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.959 
you would think if there's still a
chance<00:00:54.749> it's<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> false<00:00:55.499> alarm<00:00:55.679> don't<00:00:56.670> tell<00:00:56.879> us

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
chance it's a false alarm don't tell us

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.840 
chance it's a false alarm don't tell us
anything<00:00:57.179> at<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.920> well<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> mean<00:00:59.219> they<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.670> must

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
anything at all well I mean they it must

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.989 
anything at all well I mean they it must
mean<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.059> they're<00:01:00.390> pretty<00:01:00.859> pretty<00:01:01.859> sure<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
mean that they're pretty pretty sure it

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.060 
mean that they're pretty pretty sure it
is<00:01:03.239> what<00:01:03.510> they're<00:01:03.839> thinking<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.739> what<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
is what they're thinking it what do you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.010 
is what they're thinking it what do you
think<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.400> could<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.600> could<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.870> one

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
think it could be like what could be one

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.300 
think it could be like what could be one
for<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> history<00:01:07.380> books<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:09.080> I<00:01:10.080> don't<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
for the history books I I don't know I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.050 
for the history books I I don't know I
mean<00:01:11.810> you'd<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:13.770> uh<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.970> was

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
mean you'd think if it was uh if it was

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120 
mean you'd think if it was uh if it was
some<00:01:15.270> form<00:01:15.510> of<00:01:15.600> microbial<00:01:16.530> life<00:01:16.770> or

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
some form of microbial life or

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.550 
some form of microbial life or
fossilized<00:01:18.020> microbial<00:01:19.020> life<00:01:19.140> or<00:01:19.320> something

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
fossilized microbial life or something

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.249 
fossilized microbial life or something
like<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:20.210> they<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.450> might<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> bit

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
like that they they might be going a bit

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
like that they they might be going a bit
more<00:01:22.469> crazy<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.280> uh<00:01:23.610> well<00:01:24.180> they're<00:01:24.329> saying

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
more crazy but uh well they're saying

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.179 
more crazy but uh well they're saying
for<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.899> history<00:01:25.320> books<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.829> mean<00:01:25.979> how<00:01:26.070> much

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
for the history books I mean how much

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.800 
for the history books I mean how much
crazier<00:01:26.579> can<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:27.000> these<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.540> NASA

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
crazier can you get these this is NASA

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.870 
crazier can you get these this is NASA
scientists<00:01:28.530> did<00:01:28.649> i<00:01:28.770> canno<00:01:29.009> one<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.820> the

scientists did i canno one for the
history<00:01:30.000> books<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.450> different<00:01:30.750> from<00:01:30.899> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
history books is different from this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.050 
history books is different from this
one's<00:01:31.500> gonna<00:01:31.649> change<00:01:31.950> everything<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.640> know

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
found on Mars which means that there's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.919 
found on Mars which means that there's
