same type of energy even though a little
different<00:02:51.010> sports<00:02:51.280> we<00:02:51.520> all<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:51.850> get<00:02:52.090> along

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
and we know that like what what is hard

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.970 
and we know that like what what is hard
in<00:02:55.420> every<00:02:55.750> sport<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.319> like<00:02:56.560> when<00:02:56.770> someone

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
in every sport and like when someone

lands something right what the hell like
wheels<00:02:59.170> on<00:02:59.500> his<00:02:59.590> wheelchair<00:03:00.040> it's<00:03:00.160> crazy<00:03:00.459> like

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
wheels on his wheelchair it's crazy like

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.699 
wheels on his wheelchair it's crazy like
building<00:03:01.450> front<00:03:01.660> flips<00:03:01.870> double<00:03:02.200> flips<00:03:02.440> and

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
building front flips double flips and

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.590 
building front flips double flips and
then<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.430> go<00:03:03.550> people<00:03:03.970> motor<00:03:04.180> box<00:03:04.390> doing

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
then you go people motor box doing

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.080 
then you go people motor box doing
double<00:03:04.930> flips<00:03:05.140> it's<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.739> like<00:03:05.850> ridiculous<00:03:06.850> I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
double flips it's just like ridiculous I

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.580 
double flips it's just like ridiculous I
think<00:03:07.570> this<00:03:07.750> year<00:03:07.959> is<00:03:07.989> better<00:03:08.170> because<00:03:08.410> the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
think this year is better because the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.990 
think this year is better because the
addition<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.190> couple<00:03:09.489> stops<00:03:09.730> like

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
addition of a couple stops like

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.449 
addition of a couple stops like
specifically<00:03:10.510> Amsterdam<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.980> came<00:03:12.280> out<00:03:12.430> here

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
specifically Amsterdam we came out here

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.940 
specifically Amsterdam we came out here
after<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.090> arnhem<00:03:13.480> show<00:03:13.690> for<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.440> night<00:03:14.650> but<00:03:14.680> i

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
after the arnhem show for a night but i

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.800 
after the arnhem show for a night but i
think<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.730> energy<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.330> crowd<00:03:16.569> out<00:03:16.780> here

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
think the energy and a crowd out here

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.270 
think the energy and a crowd out here
will<00:03:17.110> be<00:03:17.230> pretty<00:03:17.470> sweet<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:18.010> I'm<00:03:18.160> looking

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
will be pretty sweet so I'm looking

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.300 
will be pretty sweet so I'm looking
forward<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.730> getting<00:03:19.030> out<00:03:19.090> here
