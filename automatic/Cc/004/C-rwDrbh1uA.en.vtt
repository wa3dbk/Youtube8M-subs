00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.229 
lower maybe need to take out the trigger
maybe<00:00:36.930> spring<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.890> broken<00:00:38.399> or<00:00:38.730> just

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239

a very neat little thing
then<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.969> actually<00:02:15.150> came<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.719> a<00:02:15.750> decal

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
then it actually came with like a decal

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.160 
then it actually came with like a decal
but<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> decal<00:02:17.099> got<00:02:17.430> haps<00:02:17.700> scraped<00:02:18.150> off<00:02:18.359> just

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
but the decal got haps scraped off just

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.270 
but the decal got haps scraped off just
cuz<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.409> was<00:02:19.500> working<00:02:19.829> and<00:02:20.569> actually<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:22.250> want<00:02:23.250> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
cuz I was working and actually I want to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.179 
cuz I was working and actually I want to
say<00:02:23.489> some<00:02:23.909> oil<00:02:24.150> got<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:26.010> know<00:02:26.099> just

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
say some oil got on it and you know just

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.250 
say some oil got on it and you know just
kind<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.489> made<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.269> come<00:02:27.569> off<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.719> little<00:02:27.959> bit

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
kind of made it come off a little bit

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.649 
kind of made it come off a little bit
but<00:02:29.099> again<00:02:29.609> you<00:02:29.909> know<00:02:29.969> it's<00:02:30.120> very<00:02:30.150> easy<00:02:30.540> to

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
but again you know it's very easy to

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.069 
but again you know it's very easy to
clean<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:32.010> very<00:02:32.730> very<00:02:33.090> nice<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.480> smooth

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
clean so it's very very nice and smooth

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.170 
clean so it's very very nice and smooth
get<00:02:34.799> kind<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.099> close<00:02:35.340> up<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.969> it's<00:02:36.060> you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
get kind of a close up on that it's you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.129 
get kind of a close up on that it's you
can<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.719> glossiness<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.139> it's

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
can see the glossiness so it's

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.569 
can see the glossiness so it's
definitely<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.769> guarantee<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.459> it

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
definitely in the guarantee that it

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.699 
definitely in the guarantee that it
won't<00:02:41.639> harm<00:02:41.969> the<00:02:42.150> gun<00:02:42.299> either<00:02:42.659> as<00:02:42.989> well<00:02:43.260> which

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
won't harm the gun either as well which

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.729 
won't harm the gun either as well which
I<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.489> never<00:02:44.639> had<00:02:44.819> a<00:02:44.879> problem<00:02:44.939> with<00:02:45.569> now<00:02:46.439> I've

do this J type whatever random stuff you

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.809 
do this J type whatever random stuff you
know<00:03:06.419> and<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:07.019> sucked<00:03:07.379> ass<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.129> I<00:03:08.459> was

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
know and it sucked ass and then I was

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.459 
know and it sucked ass and then I was
just<00:03:08.969> like<00:03:09.120> okay<00:03:09.450> now<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:09.810> actually<00:03:10.260> doing

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
just like okay now it's actually doing

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.890 
just like okay now it's actually doing
with<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:11.129> worked<00:03:11.340> out<00:03:11.459> well<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.359> think

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
with this it worked out well so I think

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.030 
with this it worked out well so I think
it's<00:03:13.079> definitely<00:03:13.109> worth<00:03:13.409> if<00:03:13.680> you're<00:03:13.799> planning

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.610 
it's definitely worth if you're planning
on<00:03:14.250> maintaining<00:03:15.239> your<00:03:15.569> AR<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.959> lot<00:03:16.169> or<00:03:16.439> if<00:03:16.530> you
