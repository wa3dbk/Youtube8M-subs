00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.020
 there must be many people here today 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.150
 I had never seen a concert or my 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:34.980
 previous group nor of these some 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.980
 friends of always we know each other 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.800
 but maybe it 's more already than ever 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.900
 every time he sang the song that 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.130
 sang this nation told the story of 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.680
 a child 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.960
 so those who already know that pastor of the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.960
 area that costs it back 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.750
 the source back for what ever 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.670
 listened 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.120
 then the story is that there was a 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.150
 well long ago naked 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.330
 about ten or fifteen years maybe the one 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.590
 big need for who knows they had 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.590
 been on the river bank 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.250
 waiting and days ago 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.500
 to be able to cross in the way that was 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.450
 in the east river that is there centuries ago 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.899
 ran and ran with a tremendous tide 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.710
 without stopping on the other side of the river I expected 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.140
 to his mom 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.140
 to see it to hear it 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.930
 then the baby after days of 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.910
 wait for the river to calm down 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.830
 and seeing that the river does not calm down with the 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.080
 Failure marked on the face while it has 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.980
 a cut 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:08.370
 First he asks and speaks to him 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.370
 then he cries disconsolately 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.800
 pray 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.740
 and the east river 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.090
 dark of the sun 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.090
 and I never heard it 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 and then as the child said knowing 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.400
 who loses 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.200
 the child plants 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.510
 and the singing crosses the mother hears 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.400
 then the child knows and the mother knows 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.500
 Y 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.500
 that is what unites us 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.989
 if we know what unites us 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.519
 we know who is to blame 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.519
 who has the truth 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.780
 the song of the king 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.840
 apple river 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.140
 let me go that my mother sickens my 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.140
 mother 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.100
 but my power 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.490
 and if he's going to die in heaven I'm going 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.490
 with him 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.290
 I'm not leaving with that 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.360
 does not disappear 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.510
 ah 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.090
 in this his recorded memories 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.810
 fighting to leave 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.810
 no longer 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.850
 two 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.849
 why not 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.690
 an emotion squeezing inside 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.750
 by passion he does give us will
