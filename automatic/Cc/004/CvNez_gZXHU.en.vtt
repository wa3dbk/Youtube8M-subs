really boring me and I kind of ran out

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.920 
really boring me and I kind of ran out
of<00:00:25.769> money<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.220> 89<00:00:26.760> which<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.480> another<00:00:27.660> awkward

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
of money at 89 which is another awkward

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.359 
of money at 89 which is another awkward
level<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.320> leave<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.560> at<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.800> mean<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.099> so

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
level to leave it at I mean it's so

physically possible because to bring

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.960

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
back as a version of the game like this

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.219 
back as a version of the game like this
they<00:01:21.479> would<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.720> had<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.990> made<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
they would have had to have made a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
they would have had to have made a
backup<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.830> luckily<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.430> was<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> backup

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
backup and luckily there was a backup

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.570 
backup and luckily there was a backup
made<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.450> 2007<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> he's<00:01:25.860> did<00:01:26.040> say<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
made in 2007 and he's did say it was the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.030 
made in 2007 and he's did say it was the
only<00:01:26.880> backup<00:01:27.420> made<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> game<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
only backup made of the game so that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
only backup made of the game so that
means<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.369> he<00:01:30.150> can't<00:01:30.390> bring<00:01:30.630> back<00:01:30.840> any<00:01:31.110> other

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
means that he can't bring back any other

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.630 
means that he can't bring back any other
year<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.799> he<00:01:31.890> can't<00:01:32.100> bring<00:01:32.250> back<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
year like he can't bring back like a

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
year like he can't bring back like a
2008<00:01:33.240> he<00:01:33.600> didn't<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.960> option<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.320> bring

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
2008 he didn't have the option to bring

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.960 
2008 he didn't have the option to bring
back<00:01:34.740> any<00:01:34.979> other<00:01:35.159> year<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.640> else<00:01:35.820> he<00:01:35.880> probably

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
back any other year or else he probably

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.580 
back any other year or else he probably
would<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.329> given<00:01:36.479> us<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> ocean<00:01:37.049> he<00:01:37.409> brought

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
would have given us the ocean he brought

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.289 
would have given us the ocean he brought
back<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> one<00:01:38.130> backup<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.790> he<00:01:38.880> had<00:01:39.030> saved

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
back the one backup that he had saved

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.960 
back the one backup that he had saved
which<00:01:39.540> was<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.140> 2007<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.579> early<00:01:41.850> two

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
which was in 2007 I think it's early two

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.460 
which was in 2007 I think it's early two
thousand<00:01:42.299> seven<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.659> backup<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.079> made<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
thousand seven this backup was made and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.660 
thousand seven this backup was made and
that's<00:01:43.860> why<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.159> was<00:01:44.189> quite<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> few

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that's why there was quite a few

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.060 
that's why there was quite a few
glitches<00:01:45.110> came<00:01:46.110> back<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.470> player<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.829> toast

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
glitches came back like player on toast

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.920 
glitches came back like player on toast
glitches<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.579> things<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.270> I'm

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
glitches and things like that but I'm

I'm just not really wanting a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.780 
I'm just not really wanting a

have gone in if we had our say and then
this<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.140> our<00:03:04.260> chance<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.740> can<00:03:04.860> choose

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
this is like our chance we can choose

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.860 
this is like our chance we can choose
what<00:03:05.370> goes<00:03:05.550> in<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.150> whether<00:03:06.300> skills<00:03:06.690> get

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
what goes in and whether skills get

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.500 
what goes in and whether skills get
easier<00:03:07.230> or<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:08.430> just<00:03:08.490> new<00:03:08.730> methods<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.240> Train

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
easier or it's just new methods to Train

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.660 
easier or it's just new methods to Train
I<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:10.500> think<00:03:10.620> new<00:03:10.890> stuff<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.580> be

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
I just think new stuff is going to be

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.920 
I just think new stuff is going to be
kind<00:03:11.850> of<00:03:11.940> essential<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> this<00:03:12.540> game<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
kind of essential to this game and

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.120 
kind of essential to this game and
maintaining<00:03:13.380> some<00:03:13.590> sort<00:03:13.740> of<00:03:13.800> player<00:03:13.980> base

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
maintaining some sort of player base

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.290 
maintaining some sort of player base

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
because if you look at games that

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.730 
because if you look at games that
