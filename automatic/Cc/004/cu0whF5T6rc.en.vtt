00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:16.640
 the birds were flying there in the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:20.609
 heights and watched the agitated men 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.470
 walking like disoriented ants of 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.630
 side by side 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.840
 in that bustle and the flying birds 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.829
 in that blue and tranquil sky 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.300
 walks him above the clouds and observing 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.879
 anxiety and agitation of men 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.079
 a little bird asked the other 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.440
 why will men be the beings 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:55.320
 humans live so anxious as 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:00.629
 bored are suffering 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.580
 both crawling that way and another 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:12.680
 replied that the bird was wiser answered 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:19.040
 it is because mankind does not have as we do 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:25.200
 a heavenly father feeds them 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.990
 in fact they have but do not want 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.340
 to know of the heavenly Father 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:39.899
 and do not want to trust him to support 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:43.649
 and so the little birds will continue 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:48.890
 flying happy while men 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:53.030
 they were still fighting for crumbs 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.030
 suffering for the daily bread 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.679
 torturing in this world 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.780
 confirming this illustration you 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:13.519
 Jesus and if the following 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.519
 so do not be careful 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:24.370
 for your life by that made 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:28.060
 to eat or drink 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.130
 as your body, so that the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.080
 wear 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:40.260
 Life is not more than food and 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:45.990
 the body more than the dress look and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:52.360
 for the birds of the air do not sow nor 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:56.340
 they blind or gather it into barns and your 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:01.510
 Heavenly Father feeds them 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.720
 no voice says much more value than 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.720
 they 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.820
 My friend, my friend, or if these 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.820
 words of lord jesus 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.850
 if god cares for the birds of the sky 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.850
 lilo will take care of you 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.170
 if god does not let a bird die 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.080
 of hunger that will leave you worth 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:38.130
 more than a sparrow that will leave 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.190
 You starve to death and said 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:47.820
 I regret that claim to crawl saw 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:51.540
 suffer and trust in this heavenly peace to 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.680
 careful and careful walking anxious and 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.170
 anxious about your life 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.450
 worrying if every minute with day of 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.070
 tomorrow and now it's now that I go 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.550
 eat what I'm going to drink what I'm going to 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:12.930
 wear life and if jesus is much more 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.690
 that the grocery and the body more than the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:21.520
 clothes you wear 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:25.580
 Remember, God wants to take care of you. 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:30.080
 He wants to take care of himself the way he does. 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:34.010
 take care of the birds of the sky because for the father 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.150
 celestial to the creative father of all 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.440
 things 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.460
 you have much more value than all 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.460
 the little birds
