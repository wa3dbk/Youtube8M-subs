00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
everything that happens but Elizabeth

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.810 
everything that happens but Elizabeth
the<00:01:52.790> main<00:01:53.030> character<00:01:53.600> Liz<00:01:53.930> she<00:01:54.800> ends<00:01:55.760> up

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
the main character Liz she ends up

the main character Liz she ends up
passing<00:01:56.060> away<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.870> she<00:01:57.110> gets<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.560> through<00:01:57.770> a

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
passing away and she gets that through a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.680 
passing away and she gets that through a
place<00:01:58.010> called<00:01:58.310> elsewhere<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.180> it's<00:01:59.330> kind<00:01:59.510> of<00:01:59.600> a

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690
