00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.289
 Hello everyone and in this video I want to show 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.640
 own budget purchases 

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:12.519
 little things look like this 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.050
 way and let's see more 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.009
 and the first thing I show is two products 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.430
 from brand 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.400
 Grandmother Agafya and I purchased these two 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.320
 fix price store 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.509
 so this juniper foot bath 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:35.039
 steam it as I understand salt for 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:38.579
 baths well rather in this case for the legs and 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:41.140
 there is juniper extract 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.350
 which indicates unpicked soup and 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.570
 impact well let's see how will he 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.960
 act further acquired store fix 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.640
 price here is such a cloudberry you shampoo 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.880
 moisturizing and restoring composition 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.890
 good one has 2 products price 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.620
 was very very acceptable therefore 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.510
 By the way, I got it and 500 milliliters 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.559
 the volume here you are interested can 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.559
 view composition 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.480
 Also from this brand I purchased two 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.390
 funds, but I already got them not fixed 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.190
 price and just 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.120
 stores instant mask-care for 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.330
 hair 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.850
 I repeat this purchase a second time 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.420
 somehow in the empty jars I already 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.700
 talked about him about this tool and in 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.710
 In general, you do not like it, but of course 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.340
 mask it can not be called most likely 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.290
 it's like such a nice balm before 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.940
 considering by the way its value in my opinion 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.450
 up to 30 rubles further this is a mask for 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.040
 hair 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.110
 Lemon mustard nobody here too 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 interesting to test it the same price 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.410
 quite a budget of 50 rubles for 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.410
 quite a large amount of 300 milliliters 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.290
 I also want to show this shampoo with 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.110
 sap 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.540
 from neva cosmetics in my opinion I already 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.410
 Showed like that in his purchases so 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.890
 I bought 2 more 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.780
 only 39 rubles but I got it 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.280
 discounted at carousel shop in 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.900
 Hypermarket Here's sodium laureth sulfate 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.840
 certainly not with clothes not so sulphate 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.840
 it is interesting for ducks to watch the composition 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.280
 Delivery of course is written so here is very 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.410
 finely 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.090
 but in general, here I see washing 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.310
 basis in second place homonym 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.180
 lauryl sulfate and then sodium 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.780
 laureth sulfate 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.900
 that is, in principle, a little bit they 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:49.810
 softened this this composition to the recipe but 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.290
 I liked it and shampoos in their 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.140
 properties and in general I am satisfied therefore 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.530
 I got empty jars 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.840
 tell in more detail 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.730
 further acquired firming shampoo and 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.420
 hamann for all hair types and finnish 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.810
 soft hair balm from the brand 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.890
 planeta organica 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:21.260
 also way interesting to test here 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.260
 I will also tell you in an empty jar 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.350
 then I want to show this big 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.140
 soap set 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.930
 varied somehow here we have 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.880
 turned off the water recently about a month 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:42.140
 back and I stopped using gel 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.130
 for the soul that moment well, somehow you know 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.430
 washed away 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.670
 shower gel is much worse than soap 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.350
 more water is required for this on 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.130
 boil all this in general is not very 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:58.130
 conveniently therefore began to wash soap and 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:02.080
 somehow I acquired it for the whole 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.450
 here is such a soap duru 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.970
 I drink rental people 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:12.709
 I really liked the fragrance of this soap 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:15.410
 he is so tender and delicate floral and very 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.450
 like that soap itself is beautiful 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.360
 She looks so white 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.820
 absolutely so nice aesthetically on 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.960
 purchased soap from le petit 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.070
 Marseilles with orange flower but 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.160
 I smell for some reason 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.630
 it is as if the lilies are very well 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.060
 nice floral scent 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.400
 further from the Neva cosmetics took here 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.220
 This cream soap is natural with proteins 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.320
 silk nourishes and softens seems 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.940
 someone also recently saw a review on this 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.890
 little girl washed and how here 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.800
 it is the gel for washing used 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.780
 instead of gel for washing and it seems like on 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.890
 them pretty pretty she coped 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.740
 did not dry the skin 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.860
 so that's what I took to test also 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.280
 for the strength of this is the soap from neve very 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.410
 I love soap giving also acquired 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.050
 and I liked that from 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.480
 few estimates kim and even here already 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.169
 can we opened it nice smells 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.129
 it's a lime color 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:24.919
 further acquired two products for eyelashes 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:28.840
 this is such a serum from evelyn for 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:31.580
 eyelashes also known on youtube 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.810
 I have seen enough reviews from girls and also in 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:40.009
 In general, I saw her in a magnet of cosmetics by 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:43.330
 I bought it and see it in the same way 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:46.330
 took a mascara from divage which is called 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.330
 ninety sixty ninety 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.220
 Further I want to show pharmacy purchases 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:57.120
 here in the pharmacy acquired 10 milliliters 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:59.310
 I know vanilla essential oil so 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.860
 liked this scent actually i 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:06.539
 I use it now in the summer 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:12.349
 as a perfume a very pleasant aroma in 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:17.940
 overall pretty and got baby cream 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:20.849
 called trying here it seems like 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.740
 natural here is ten ninety seven 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.380
 percent 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:31.500
 natural active ingredients here 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:34.740
 good composition here so that, in principle, 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:38.849
 we will use let's see maybe 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.190
 I will use it as a cream 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.979
 for the face can be as a cream for 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.750
 hands depending on its consistency on 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.120
 the second place here is oil 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.250
 so maybe it will be pretty 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.800
 the same market and the volume here is 100 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.370
 milliliters in the pharmacy it cost mine 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.990
 150 rubles here, too, will test and 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.020
 tell you 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.110
