00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
permanent in 24 hours we've tested it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.240 
permanent in 24 hours we've tested it
after<00:01:09.380> three<00:01:09.560> or<00:01:09.590> four<00:01:09.680> days<00:01:09.979> it's

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
basically it's an uneven graphite type

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.740 
basically it's an uneven graphite type
of<00:01:19.040> line<00:01:19.220> that<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.670> can<00:01:19.820> do<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.149> fades<00:01:20.509> in<00:01:20.720> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
of line that you can do it fades in and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.800 
of line that you can do it fades in and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
out at clumps it's just generally not a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.139 
out at clumps it's just generally not a
good<00:01:24.049> writing<00:01:24.439> experience<00:01:25.340> yeah<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.670> mean<00:01:25.850> the
