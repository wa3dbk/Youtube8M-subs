00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.160 

that's<00:00:07.980> what<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.630> electric<00:00:09.630> guitar<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.050> this

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
that's what this electric guitar is this

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.100 
that's what this electric guitar is this
more<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.280> get<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.550> lot<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.030> but<00:00:12.630> even

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
more so you get a lot of this but even

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.620 
more so you get a lot of this but even
that<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:13.769> mean<00:00:14.070> from<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> people<00:00:15.240> who<00:00:15.389> come

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
that I mean from the people who come

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.200 
that I mean from the people who come
from<00:00:15.660> from<00:00:16.320> like<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.890> know<00:00:16.920> rock<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.910> roll<00:00:18.060> or

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
from from like you know rock and roll or

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.910 
from from like you know rock and roll or
some<00:00:18.390> other<00:00:18.570> background<00:00:18.840> on<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> classical

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
some other background on to classical

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.279 
some other background on to classical
this<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> very<00:00:20.789> common<00:00:21.180> problem<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.810> York<00:00:22.050> is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
this is a very common problem in York is

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.130 
this is a very common problem in York is
one<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> least<00:00:23.570> visible<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.869> I've<00:00:24.990> ever

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
one of the least visible that I've ever

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.460 
one of the least visible that I've ever
seen<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:26.250> people<00:00:26.699> who<00:00:26.970> make<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.990> transition

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
seen in people who make that transition

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
seen in people who make that transition
so<00:00:29.250> I'm<00:00:29.340> pointing<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> good<00:00:30.240> things<00:00:30.480> they

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
so I'm pointing out the good things they

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:46.540 
so I'm pointing out the good things they
are<00:00:31.170> they're<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:44.430> transfer<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.270> energy

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
are they're the transfer of this energy

00:00:46.550 --> 00:01:10.480 
are they're the transfer of this energy
yeah

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.100 

I'll<00:01:11.490> write<00:01:11.730> it<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> take

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
I'll write it down this is going to take

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.460 
I'll write it down this is going to take
some<00:01:13.320> time<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:15.240> then<00:01:20.480> play<00:01:21.480> me<00:01:21.720> second<00:01:22.200> finger

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
some time and then play me second finger

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:32.570 
some time and then play me second finger
open<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:26.630> together<00:01:29.570> from<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
open be together from here to there and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.750 
open be together from here to there and
it<00:01:33.270> starts<00:01:33.660> climbing<00:01:33.870> back<00:01:34.320> ok<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.580> more

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
it starts climbing back ok so it's more

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:49.640 
it starts climbing back ok so it's more
abstract<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.600> terms<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.290> feel<00:01:48.650> good

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
abstract in terms of what we feel good

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.830 
abstract in terms of what we feel good
now<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.430> see<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:50.910> doing<00:01:51.210> now<00:01:51.420> when<00:01:51.750> I

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
now you see what I'm doing now when I

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.480 
now you see what I'm doing now when I
play<00:01:52.050> along<00:01:52.260> with<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.590> while<00:01:52.800> I'm<00:01:52.979> really

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
play along with you while I'm really

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.840 
play along with you while I'm really
making<00:01:54.180> more<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.630> our<00:01:54.900> children<00:01:55.470> go<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:55.890> turn

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
making more of our children go and turn

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.830 
making more of our children go and turn
down<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.060> more<00:01:57.360> present<00:01:59.360> can<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.660> go

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
down the more present can we can we go

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.310 
down the more present can we can we go
directly<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:05.369> more<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.990> beginning

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
directly there and more the beginning

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:19.810 
directly there and more the beginning
forest<00:02:07.680> land<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.790> especially

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.640 

clearest<00:02:20.820> equation<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.720> surely<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.410> are

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
clearest equation so surely we are

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.840 
clearest equation so surely we are
changing<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.459> with<00:02:23.700> me<00:02:23.880> talking<00:02:24.090> instead<00:02:24.690> of
