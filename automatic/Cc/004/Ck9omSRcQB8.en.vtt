our<00:06:34.560> youngest<00:06:34.770> son<00:06:35.129> and<00:06:35.460> then<00:06:35.939> maybe<00:06:36.270> as<00:06:36.449> a

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 
our youngest son and then maybe as a

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.350 
our youngest son and then maybe as a
finisher<00:06:36.990> on<00:06:37.439> the<00:06:38.400> ones<00:06:38.580> who<00:06:38.729> use<00:06:38.939> the<00:06:39.090> super

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 
finisher on the ones who use the super

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.959 
finisher on the ones who use the super
hold<00:06:39.539> or<00:06:39.810> the<00:06:40.020> deluxe<00:06:40.740> pomade<00:06:41.189> this<00:06:41.460> $15.99

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:41.969 
hold or the deluxe pomade this $15.99

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.390 
hold or the deluxe pomade this $15.99
it's<00:06:42.569> the<00:06:42.689> same<00:06:42.870> price<00:06:43.050> as<00:06:43.259> the<00:06:43.349> super<00:06:43.620> hold<00:06:43.800> so

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
it's the same price as the super hold so

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.709 
it's the same price as the super hold so
it's<00:06:44.550> just<00:06:44.729> a<00:06:44.819> dollar<00:06:45.000> more<00:06:45.210> than<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.509> deluxe

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:45.719 
it's just a dollar more than the deluxe

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:47.749 
it's just a dollar more than the deluxe
hold<00:06:46.020> and<00:06:46.379> I<00:06:46.919> think<00:06:47.099> it's<00:06:47.219> definitely<00:06:47.370> going

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
hold and I think it's definitely going

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.439 
hold and I think it's definitely going
to<00:06:47.819> be<00:06:47.879> worth<00:06:48.090> it<00:06:49.340> if<00:06:50.340> they<00:06:50.610> have<00:06:50.819> samples<00:06:51.360> that

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
to be worth it if they have samples that

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:53.629
