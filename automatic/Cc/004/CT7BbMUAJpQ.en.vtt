hey guys
Lukie<00:00:07.710> again<00:00:08.420> so<00:00:09.830> basically<00:00:10.830> what<00:00:11.160> happened

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
Lukie again so basically what happened

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.580 
Lukie again so basically what happened
recently<00:00:11.730> as<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.540> was<00:00:12.719> using<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.139> slitting<00:00:13.559> saw

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
recently as I was using the slitting saw

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.580 
recently as I was using the slitting saw
cutting<00:00:14.519> through<00:00:14.820> there<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.089> Alan<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.990> got

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
cutting through there but Alan and I got

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.990 
cutting through there but Alan and I got
a<00:00:16.619> little<00:00:16.740> bit<00:00:16.890> greedy<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.520> ended<00:00:17.940> up

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
a little bit greedy and ended up

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.019 
a little bit greedy and ended up
breaking<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.480> sore<00:00:18.720> but<00:00:19.050> uh<00:00:19.220> also<00:00:20.220> managed<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
breaking the sore but uh also managed to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.800 
breaking the sore but uh also managed to
break<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.570> motor<00:00:21.840> control<00:00:23.210> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> process

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
break the motor control in the process

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.900 
break the motor control in the process
which<00:00:25.109> kinda<00:00:25.410> sucks<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:25.980> uh<00:00:26.039> Stewart<00:00:26.789> from

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
which kinda sucks but uh Stewart from

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.019 
which kinda sucks but uh Stewart from
Titan<00:00:27.359> machinery<00:00:27.920> I<00:00:28.920> contacted<00:00:29.670> him<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:29.939> he's

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
Titan machinery I contacted him and he's

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.330 
Titan machinery I contacted him and he's
sending<00:00:30.330> me<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.720> Monday<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.340> hopefully

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
sending me one on Monday so hopefully

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.500 
sending me one on Monday so hopefully
you<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.579> get<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.850> back<00:00:33.000> up<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.329> running

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
you can get it back up and running

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.979 
you can get it back up and running
you're<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.290> did<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.450> was<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:36.750> so

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you're going I did I was I'm so

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.330 
you're going I did I was I'm so
impatient<00:00:37.530> that's<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.770> funny<00:00:38.100> that's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
impatient that's so funny that's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.240 
impatient that's so funny that's
probably<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.540> demise<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.930> me<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.680> tried

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
probably be the demise of me but I tried

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.779 
probably be the demise of me but I tried

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.429 
trying to hook it up we've got it to run
but<00:01:20.360> just<00:01:21.360> can't<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.900> run<00:01:22.049> right<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
but just can't get it to run right and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.530 
but just can't get it to run right and
get<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:22.770> 28<00:01:23.130> Hertz<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.880> like

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
get you like 28 Hertz and just like

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
get you like 28 Hertz and just like
stalls<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.290> make<00:01:25.439> horrible<00:01:25.830> noise<00:01:26.100> tried<00:01:26.640> all

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
stalls and make horrible noise tried all

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.789 
stalls and make horrible noise tried all
sorts<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.119> settings<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> VFD<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.500> can't

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
sorts of settings on the VFD I was can't

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
sorts of settings on the VFD I was can't
get<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.189> work<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:30.329> frustrating

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
get it to work so really frustrating

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.569 
get it to work so really frustrating
because<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> guys<00:01:32.040> using<00:01:32.280> them<00:01:32.490> on

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
because I see you guys using them on

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 
because I see you guys using them on
their<00:01:32.729> lathes<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.689> something<00:01:34.320> so

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
their lathes on you to do something so

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.200 
their lathes on you to do something so
it<00:01:35.070> must<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.280> something<00:01:35.549> else<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.060> around

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it must be something else to do around

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.640 
it must be something else to do around
and<00:01:37.040> I<00:01:38.390> tried<00:01:39.390> some<00:01:39.600> settings<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.439> motor

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and I tried some settings and the motor

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.340 
and I tried some settings and the motor
got<00:01:40.799> crazy<00:01:41.100> hot<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.540> back<00:01:42.750> off<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.229> get

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
got crazy hot so it's back off and get

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.370 
got crazy hot so it's back off and get
the<00:01:43.439> right<00:01:43.560> control<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.570> yeah<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.869> anyway

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the right control for it yeah so anyway

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.810 
the right control for it yeah so anyway
in<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> meantime<00:01:46.740> because<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.399> kind<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.640> used

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
in the meantime because I kind of used

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.060 
in the meantime because I kind of used
the<00:01:47.909> mill<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.360> made<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.320> enclosure<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the mill I made this enclosure for the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.639 
the mill I made this enclosure for the
table<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.610> keep<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> chips<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.649> it's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
table to keep the chips in this it's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.230 
table to keep the chips in this it's
made<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.189> 12<00:01:53.490> millimeter<00:01:54.000> thick

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
made of 12 millimeter thick

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.830 
made of 12 millimeter thick
polycarbonate<00:01:55.640> actually<00:01:56.640> 120<00:01:57.090> dollars<00:01:57.659> worth

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
polycarbonate actually 120 dollars worth

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.389 
polycarbonate actually 120 dollars worth
of<00:01:57.930> polycarbonate<00:01:58.439> Brodie<00:01:58.920> went<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.250> bit

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
of polycarbonate Brodie went a bit

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.660 
of polycarbonate Brodie went a bit
overkill<00:01:59.880> there<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.799> it's<00:02:01.799> super<00:02:02.100> rigid

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
overkill there but it's super rigid

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.540 
overkill there but it's super rigid
if<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.300> chucks<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.720> tool<00:02:03.960> or<00:02:03.990> anything<00:02:04.550> yeah

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
if that chucks a tool or anything yeah

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.940 
if that chucks a tool or anything yeah
it<00:02:05.909> could<00:02:06.150> praise<00:02:06.360> shoot<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.720> gun<00:02:06.870> in<00:02:07.080> it<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
it could praise shoot a gun in it and it

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.330 
it could praise shoot a gun in it and it
would<00:02:08.130> be<00:02:08.160> safe<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:09.560> if<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.709> had<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> gun<00:02:11.100> I'll

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
would be safe like if I had a gun I'll

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.800 
would be safe like if I had a gun I'll
try<00:02:11.880> that<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.690> don't<00:02:13.500> have<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.709> gun<00:02:14.810> so

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
try that but I don't have a gun so

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.970 
try that but I don't have a gun so
you're<00:02:15.959> pretty<00:02:16.080> happy<00:02:16.290> with<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.530> might<00:02:16.800> put

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
you're pretty happy with that might put

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.140 
you're pretty happy with that might put
some<00:02:17.130> handles<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.640> front<00:02:17.910> because<00:02:18.060> you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
some handles on the front because you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.720 
some handles on the front because you
can<00:02:18.240> actually<00:02:18.330> just<00:02:18.630> lift<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:19.050> out<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:20.580> get

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
can actually just lift this out to get

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:28.220 
can actually just lift this out to get
in<00:02:20.850> there<00:02:21.740> so<00:02:22.740> easy<00:02:23.160> access<00:02:23.430> man<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.709> boss

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.350 

I<00:02:28.260> did<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.310> cut<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> little<00:02:29.970> recess

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
why so I can still put my handle on

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.940 
why so I can still put my handle on
there
