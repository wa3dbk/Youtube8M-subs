00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hi guys, I'm going to make these today. 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.549
 Celebratory balls made with goal 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.549
 toilet paper 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.340
 so I'll use the roll of toilet paper 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.700
 glue stick glue instant scissors 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.890
 a satin ribbon is to see the printed and 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.770
 colored satin paper so I go 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.500
 get the roll of toilet paper and I'll 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.070
 measure here on the tissue paper at least 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.590
 one hand on each side to do the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.850
 that little piece of bullet here on the side 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 so just cut 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:54.100
 and here it is also only gives up a walk 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.100
 here then stopped here I did not cut here 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.690
 Go now, just go stick glue. 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.690
 to be able to paste the paper 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:34.580
 go here now from the side just press a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.580
 and tie a satin ribbon 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.610
 When you go to class , here it is. 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.590
 be careful not to squeeze too much 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.500
 paper does not rip that it is too thin 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.150
 and he can arrange ease 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.150
 Just make a goal like that. 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.480
 now you take a piece of paper from 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.100
 silk and will cut thin strips 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:09.950
 to put inside the roll of paper 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:14.680
 hygienic is just to make a volume there 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.680
 inside there lay in there 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.420
 will put us and will put 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.310
 bullets in there 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.310
 now just close the other side 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.640
 there it will be like this 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.700
 Then just get one and see the print 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.600
 you will measure the size of the roll and 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.600
 will cut 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.580
 now I only saw is that the size that will give 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.799
 to paste iraq I'll use a glue 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:04.030
 that you can use as well 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.030
 a glue for the event 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.890
 so they stay like this 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.030
 It's super simple to do if you 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.819
 can change the material too 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.700
 I tried to do with the cheaper ones 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.870
 I got that tissue paper them 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.150
 also have this paper stamped not 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.640
 You must be loyal but I have not found 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.500
 Do you want to make it have been too? 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.239
 It looks nice but I found the fabric and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.420
 stay a little more expensive so I preferred 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.420
 do so and the stuffing from within you 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.150
 can also choose as you 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.540
 want or conform to the party of the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.459
 Child can throw lollipop gum 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.379
 I think it's a really cool toast to. 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.459
 have a party and it's a good thing 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.349
 cockroach 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.840
