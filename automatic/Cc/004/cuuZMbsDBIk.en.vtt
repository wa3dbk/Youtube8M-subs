in this case I'm going to actually bring

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.050 
in this case I'm going to actually bring
my<00:01:30.270> hand<00:01:30.540> down<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.140> doesn't<00:01:31.560> slip<00:01:31.770> out

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
my hand down so this doesn't slip out

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.109 
my hand down so this doesn't slip out
and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.210> I'm<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> take<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:33.810> thumb<00:01:34.079> and

and then I'm going to take my thumb and
I'm<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.570> catch<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.590> edge<00:01:38.070> right

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
I'm just going to catch that edge right

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.230 
I'm just going to catch that edge right
there<00:01:38.369> pull<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:40.189> one<00:01:41.189> smooth<00:01:41.549> motion<00:01:41.820> like

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
there pull it one smooth motion like

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.569 
there pull it one smooth motion like
this<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.380> said<00:01:43.590> I'm<00:01:43.710> gonna<00:01:43.799> hold<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.280> down

this and I said I'm gonna hold this down

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.940 
this and I said I'm gonna hold this down
so<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.420> won't<00:01:45.570> slip<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.920> peel<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.030> top

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
so it won't slip out and peel the top

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.100 
so it won't slip out and peel the top
okay<00:01:50.030> now<00:01:51.170> what<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:54.110> then

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.320 
move it from side to side so now we have
the<00:02:15.290> 3d<00:02:15.620> if<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.040> saw<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.370> live<00:02:16.550> you'd<00:02:17.210> be

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
the 3d if you saw it live you'd be

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.450 
the 3d if you saw it live you'd be
looking<00:02:17.480> through<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:17.960> hole<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.950> 3d<00:02:19.430> right

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
looking through this hole in 3d right

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.300 
looking through this hole in 3d right
through<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.060> ocean<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.440> can<00:02:21.590> see<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:22.070> it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
through the ocean and you can see and it

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.170 
through the ocean and you can see and it
flipped<00:02:22.550> back<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:22.970> forth<00:02:23.210> it<00:02:24.110> will<00:02:24.260> flip<00:02:24.500> back

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
flipped back and forth it will flip back

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.000 
flipped back and forth it will flip back
and<00:02:26.180> then<00:02:26.330> there's<00:02:26.660> your<00:02:26.780> 3d<00:02:27.140> print<00:02:27.410> laminated

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
and then there's your 3d print laminated

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.710 
and then there's your 3d print laminated
the<00:02:28.490> only<00:02:28.640> thing<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.880> have<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.060> do<00:02:29.270> now<00:02:29.450> is

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
the only thing you have to do now is

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.530 
the only thing you have to do now is
take<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.530> straight<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.790> box<00:02:32.090> cutters

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
take the straight of the box cutters

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.840 
take the straight of the box cutters
trim<00:02:33.410> these<00:02:33.650> off<00:02:33.830> put<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.400> frame<00:02:34.610> then

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
trim these off put it in a frame then

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.300 
trim these off put it in a frame then
you're<00:02:35.000> ready<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.270> go<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.020> this<00:02:36.740> is<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:37.010> way

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
you're ready to go and this is the way

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.010 
you're ready to go and this is the way
you're<00:02:37.460> going<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.640> eliminate<00:02:37.820> all<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.930> them

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
you're going to eliminate all of them

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.360 
you're going to eliminate all of them
whether<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:39.830> 3d<00:02:40.250> or<00:02:41.170> flip<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.190> what<00:02:43.340> I

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
whether it's a 3d or flip and and what I

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.130 
whether it's a 3d or flip and and what I
do<00:02:43.520> is<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:43.790> my<00:02:44.150> way<00:02:44.300> of<00:02:44.330> doing<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:44.840> actually

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
do is just my way of doing it I actually

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.350 
do is just my way of doing it I actually
just<00:02:45.530> put<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.830> knife<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.220> here<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:46.670> go<00:02:47.330> like

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
just put the knife in here and go like

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.280 
just put the knife in here and go like
this<00:02:47.780> using<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.830> edge<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.580> limbs<00:02:50.290> still

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
this using the edge of the limbs still

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.090 
this using the edge of the limbs still
laying<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.740> down<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.740> seems<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.010> work

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
laying it down and it just seems to work

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.780 
laying it down and it just seems to work
for<00:02:55.370> me<00:02:55.480> everybody<00:02:56.480> would<00:02:56.660> get<00:02:56.750> their<00:02:57.790> their

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
for me everybody would get their their

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.020 
for me everybody would get their their
favorites

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.180 

and<00:03:08.030> there<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.600> go<00:03:08.750> they<00:03:09.560> have<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.830> trimmed<00:03:10.810> 3d

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
and there you go they have a trimmed 3d

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.550 
and there you go they have a trimmed 3d
ready<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.400> go
