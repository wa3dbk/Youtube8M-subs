00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
newest XF me you can see that I use a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.580 
newest XF me you can see that I use a
new<00:01:19.830> mold<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.369> which<00:01:20.970> has<00:01:21.240> fairly<00:01:22.200> lower

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
new mold now which has fairly lower

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.410 
new mold now which has fairly lower
kicks<00:01:23.990> but<00:01:24.990> enough<00:01:25.320> cake<00:01:25.560> height<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.390> get<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
kicks but enough cake height to get a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.149 
kicks but enough cake height to get a
decent<00:01:27.869> amount<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.110> pop<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.790> grain<00:01:30.360> is

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
decent amount of pop the grain is

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.590 
decent amount of pop the grain is
vertical<00:01:32.159> which<00:01:32.810> makes<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.259> more<00:01:34.560> pop

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
vertical which makes it a lot more pop

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.230 
vertical which makes it a lot more pop
this<00:01:36.600> decks<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.110> 5-ply<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.090> it

alternating flies and you can see it

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.030 
alternating flies and you can see it
pretty<00:03:22.420> much<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.600> looks<00:03:23.079> like<00:03:23.170> maple<00:03:23.890> all

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
pretty much just looks like maple all

the this one has a die blue fly you can

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.520 
the this one has a die blue fly you can
see<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.359> it's<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.079> lot<00:03:32.260> more<00:03:32.530> darker<00:03:34.109> see<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.260> a

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
see it it's a lot more darker see it a

see it it's a lot more darker see it a
lot<00:03:35.950> better<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:37.630> holes<00:03:38.190> now<00:03:39.190> are<00:03:39.570> very<00:03:41.040> even<00:03:42.040> I

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
lot better the holes now are very even I

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.300 
lot better the holes now are very even I
have<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.299> new<00:03:43.630> way<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.079> drilling<00:03:44.380> them<00:03:44.680> what<00:03:45.280> I

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
have a new way of drilling them what I

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.199 
have a new way of drilling them what I
do<00:03:45.430> is<00:03:45.820> I<00:03:45.850> drill<00:03:46.180> one<00:03:46.420> hole<00:03:46.799> drew<00:03:47.799> the

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
do is I drill one hole drew the

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.330 
do is I drill one hole drew the
countersinking<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.480> then<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.410> get<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.829> this

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
countersinking and then I get it this

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.599 
countersinking and then I get it this
right<00:03:51.670> here<00:03:52.440> let's<00:03:53.440> just<00:03:53.650> say<00:03:53.980> base<00:03:54.250> plate

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
right here let's just say base plate

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.449 
right here let's just say base plate
with<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.030> kingpin<00:03:55.510> knocked<00:03:55.840> out<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:57.220> what<00:03:57.430> I

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
with the kingpin knocked out and what I

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.640 
with the kingpin knocked out and what I
do<00:03:57.579> is

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
do is

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.509 
do is
screw<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.069> one<00:03:59.640> screw<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.180> there<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:01.519> then

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
screw that one screw on there and then

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.610 
screw that one screw on there and then
mark<00:04:02.879> where<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.239> rest<00:04:03.599> of<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.810> holes<00:04:04.049> are<00:04:04.319> and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
mark where the rest of the holes are and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.729 
mark where the rest of the holes are and
even<00:04:05.159> the<00:04:05.430> king<00:04:05.700> pin<00:04:05.970> hole<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.930> every<00:04:07.319> single

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
even the king pin hole so every single

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.520 
even the king pin hole so every single
hole<00:04:08.010> including<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.120> king<00:04:09.360> pin<00:04:09.689> is<00:04:10.430> dead<00:04:11.430> on

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
hole including the king pin is dead on

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
hole including the king pin is dead on
so<00:04:13.530> yeah<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.980> was<00:04:14.220> just<00:04:14.370> some<00:04:14.879> of<00:04:14.909> the
