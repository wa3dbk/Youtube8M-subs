00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.400 
lines or 600 watts bridged into 4 ohms
alright<00:00:51.649> let's<00:00:51.800> try<00:00:51.949> a<00:00:52.039> certified<00:00:52.640> run<00:00:53.410> using

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
alright let's try a certified run using

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.049 
alright let's try a certified run using
one<00:00:54.769> of<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.949> loads<00:00:55.190> here<00:00:55.609> and<00:00:55.789> we're<00:00:55.910> going<00:00:56.030> to

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
one of the loads here and we're going to

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.119 
one of the loads here and we're going to
do<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.390> 8<00:00:56.570> ohm<00:00:56.780> it's<00:00:57.379> only<00:00:57.530> going<00:00:57.679> to<00:00:57.739> show<00:00:57.829> up

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
do the 8 ohm it's only going to show up

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.000 
do the 8 ohm it's only going to show up
in<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:58.399> second<00:00:58.789> track<00:00:59.350> we<00:01:00.350> want<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.649> do<00:01:00.800> this

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
in the second track we want to do this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.580 
in the second track we want to do this
so<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.030> can<00:01:02.149> simulate<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.719> 4<00:01:03.140> own<00:01:03.320> stereo<00:01:03.890> load

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
so we can simulate the 4 own stereo load

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.020 
so we can simulate the 4 own stereo load
so<00:01:06.590> we'll<00:01:06.740> just<00:01:06.920> half<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.430> number<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.790> comes

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
so we'll just half a number that comes

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
so we'll just half a number that comes
up<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.600> that<00:01:08.660> will<00:01:08.870> give<00:01:09.050> us<00:01:10.660> the<00:01:11.660> correct

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
up and that will give us the correct

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.790 
up and that will give us the correct
number<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.460> 300<00:01:14.300> would<00:01:14.450> be<00:01:14.600> 150<00:01:15.080> per<00:01:15.230> channel

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:28.290 

man<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:20.720> thing<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.140> crazy<00:01:21.560> underrated

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.510 

five<00:01:28.930> hundred<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.440> forty<00:01:29.560> three<00:01:29.860> watts<00:01:30.130> and

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
five hundred and forty three watts and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.820 
five hundred and forty three watts and
Holmes<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.450> only<00:01:31.600> ready<00:01:31.870> to<00:01:32.020> do<00:01:32.140> three<00:01:32.470> hundred

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
Holmes is only ready to do three hundred

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.120 
Holmes is only ready to do three hundred
Wow

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.700 

so<00:01:41.130> let's<00:01:41.310> start<00:01:41.490> off<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.939> normally<00:01:42.149> do

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
so let's start off like we normally do

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.450 
so let's start off like we normally do
and<00:01:43.710> let's<00:01:43.950> run<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> certified<00:01:44.850> mode<00:01:45.210> run<00:01:46.850> at<00:01:49.460> 4

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and let's run a certified mode run at 4

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.289 
and let's run a certified mode run at 4
ohms<00:01:52.429> start<00:01:53.429> up<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> danau<00:01:55.939> let's<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:57.149> what

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
ohms start up the danau let's see what

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:57.950 
ohms start up the danau let's see what
we<00:01:57.450> get

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
we get

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.490 
we get
again<00:01:58.530> rated<00:01:58.829> at<00:01:58.920> 600<00:01:59.220> watts<00:01:59.579> at<00:02:00.450> 12<00:02:01.079> point<00:02:01.319> 5

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
again rated at 600 watts at 12 point 5

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:11.210 
again rated at 600 watts at 12 point 5
volts<00:02:06.469> yes<00:02:07.469> sir<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:09.090> beat<00:02:09.299> that<00:02:09.330> easily<00:02:10.220> 841

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
volts yes sir we beat that easily 841

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.380 
volts yes sir we beat that easily 841
Watts<00:02:11.700> at<00:02:12.150> thirteen<00:02:12.540> point<00:02:12.780> two<00:02:12.840> six<00:02:13.230> volts<00:02:14.390> so

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
Watts at thirteen point two six volts so

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.610 
Watts at thirteen point two six volts so
what<00:02:15.510> I'm<00:02:15.630> talking<00:02:16.019> about<00:02:18.140> okay<00:02:19.140> let's<00:02:19.319> go

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
what I'm talking about okay let's go

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.170 
what I'm talking about okay let's go
dynamic<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:22.019> let's<00:02:22.530> go<00:02:22.769> into<00:02:23.010> four<00:02:23.400> ohms<00:02:26.180> and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
dynamic and let's go into four ohms and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.520 
dynamic and let's go into four ohms and
I'm<00:02:27.329> gonna<00:02:27.420> make<00:02:27.599> sure<00:02:27.630> I've<00:02:27.870> got<00:02:28.079> my<00:02:28.200> track

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
I'm gonna make sure I've got my track

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.790 
I'm gonna make sure I've got my track
set<00:02:29.040> right

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.210 

and<00:02:34.010> let's<00:02:34.280> watch<00:02:34.670> her<00:02:34.880> go<00:02:35.800> what<00:02:36.800> can<00:02:37.010> she<00:02:37.040> do

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
and let's watch her go what can she do

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.020 
and let's watch her go what can she do
and<00:02:40.220> we<00:02:40.310> bust<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.700> thousand<00:02:42.550> can<00:02:43.550> we<00:02:43.640> bust<00:02:43.880> a

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
and we bust a thousand can we bust a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.140 
and we bust a thousand can we bust a
thousand<00:02:47.710> whoo

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
thousand whoo

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.720 
thousand whoo
not<00:02:50.540> quite<00:02:50.870> we're<00:02:51.290> almost<00:02:51.380> there<00:02:52.040> nine<00:02:52.370> eighty

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
not quite we're almost there nine eighty

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.820 
not quite we're almost there nine eighty
four<00:02:53.060> thirteen<00:02:53.720> point<00:02:53.990> seven<00:02:54.290> nine<00:02:54.470> volts

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
four thirteen point seven nine volts

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.110 
four thirteen point seven nine volts
alright<00:02:57.830> let's<00:02:57.980> try<00:02:58.100> this<00:02:58.190> baby<00:02:58.490> out<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.000> she

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
alright let's try this baby out so she

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.860 
alright let's try this baby out so she
can<00:02:59.330> really<00:02:59.660> do<00:03:00.700> it's<00:03:01.700> good<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.060> dynamic<00:03:02.660> power

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
can really do it's good to dynamic power

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.180 
can really do it's good to dynamic power
run<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:05.120> let's<00:03:05.300> do<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.510> 2<00:03:05.900> ohm<00:03:06.110> run<00:03:08.830> samp<00:03:09.830> is<00:03:10.010> not

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
run and let's do a 2 ohm run samp is not

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.480 
run and let's do a 2 ohm run samp is not
rated<00:03:10.460> to<00:03:10.670> handle<00:03:10.820> 2<00:03:11.120> ohms<00:03:11.330> mono<00:03:12.190> but<00:03:13.190> normally

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
rated to handle 2 ohms mono but normally

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.130 
rated to handle 2 ohms mono but normally
the<00:03:13.580> dynamic<00:03:14.090> run<00:03:14.270> will<00:03:14.450> not<00:03:14.570> hurt<00:03:14.810> an<00:03:14.930> amp

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
the dynamic run will not hurt an amp

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.740 
the dynamic run will not hurt an amp
because<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.710> does<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> quick<00:03:16.580> burst<00:03:16.820> Oh

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:31.290 

check<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:20.990> out<00:03:24.820> 1600<00:03:25.820> watts<00:03:28.450> 1600<00:03:29.620> watts

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
check that out 1600 watts 1600 watts

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:40.080 
check that out 1600 watts 1600 watts
from<00:03:32.300> this<00:03:32.480> amp
