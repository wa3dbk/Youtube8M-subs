00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the design for this on the internet for

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.670 
the design for this on the internet for
all<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.219> rubik's<00:00:14.580> cube<00:00:15.000> nuts<00:00:15.450> out<00:00:15.660> there<00:00:15.719> it's

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
all you rubik's cube nuts out there it's

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.250 
all you rubik's cube nuts out there it's
uh<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.730> cool<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.940> guess<00:00:18.180> desk<00:00:18.600> accessory

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
uh it's a cool I guess desk accessory

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.170 
uh it's a cool I guess desk accessory
you<00:00:19.380> could<00:00:19.529> call<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.470> calendar<00:00:22.470> cube

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
you could call it it is a calendar cube

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.250 
you could call it it is a calendar cube
maybe<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.330> could<00:00:24.449> call<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> perpetual

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
maybe you could call it a perpetual

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.570 
maybe you could call it a perpetual
calendar<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.769> whatever<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> call<00:00:26.400> it

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
calendar or whatever you want to call it

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.570 
calendar or whatever you want to call it
but<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.779> neat<00:00:27.930> thing<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.070> turn<00:00:29.310> this

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
but the neat thing is you can turn this

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.130 
but the neat thing is you can turn this
with<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.390> combination<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.960> letters

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
with the right combination of letters

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.250

and numbers to any day of the week and
month<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.130> day<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.030> year<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
month and day of the year so it's like a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.740 
month and day of the year so it's like a
little<00:00:37.770> calendar<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.940> add<00:00:39.090> three<00:00:39.420> middle

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
little calendar the add three middle

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.290 
little calendar the add three middle
right<00:00:40.500> here<00:00:40.710> across<00:00:41.010> will<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> month<00:00:42.120> of

right here across will be the month of
radiation<00:00:42.840> these<00:00:43.649> two<00:00:43.860> numbers<00:00:44.160> down<00:00:44.370> here

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
radiation these two numbers down here

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.560 
radiation these two numbers down here
will<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> day<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.280> month<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.789> this

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
will be the day of the month and this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
right here can go one two or three and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.090 
right here can go one two or three and
in<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.420> ten<00:00:51.420> digits<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> top<00:00:52.949> two

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
in this ten digits and then the top two

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.970 
in this ten digits and then the top two
up<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> day<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> week<00:00:54.980> so

uh to give you an example today is March
19th<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.420> Wednesday<00:01:00.870> March<00:01:01.079> 19th<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
19th it's Wednesday March 19th so to

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.100 
19th it's Wednesday March 19th so to
give<00:01:02.760> an<00:01:02.820> example<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.539> abbreviation<00:01:04.049> of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
give an example the abbreviation of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.190 
give an example the abbreviation of
March<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.470> NIR<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.880> find<00:01:06.210> my<00:01:06.330> middle<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.689> here

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
March is NIR so I find my middle a here

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.859 
March is NIR so I find my middle a here
and<00:01:07.950> then<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.400> my<00:01:08.820> M<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.360> right<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.840> so

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
and then I get a my M is right here so

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.310 
and then I get a my M is right here so
and<00:01:10.520> I'm<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.790> speed<00:01:12.090> solver<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.570> guys<00:01:12.900> so

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and I'm not a speed solver you guys so

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.899 
and I'm not a speed solver you guys so
don't<00:01:13.590> leave<00:01:13.799> me<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> comment<00:01:14.310> saying<00:01:14.700> oh

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
care I don't ever want to learn how to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330 
care I don't ever want to learn how to
speed<00:01:18.600> solve<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.250> really

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
speed solve because I just don't really

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.880 
speed solve because I just don't really
care<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.869> cool<00:01:22.080> invention

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
letters for that so then I find my day I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.580 
letters for that so then I find my day I
have<00:01:29.700> one<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.540> sticker<00:01:30.869> that's<00:01:30.990> his<00:01:31.170> day<00:01:31.409> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590

it always goes right here above the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.170 
it always goes right here above the
middle<00:01:33.570> letter<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> I'll<00:01:35.100> find<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
middle letter so I'll find it there it

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.120 
middle letter so I'll find it there it
is<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.079> bring<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.040> it

throughout the mr. hero it says day and
then<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.700> read<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.850> first<00:03:28.209> part<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.570> word

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
then you read the first part of the word

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.890 
then you read the first part of the word
right<00:03:28.840> here<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:30.180> it's<00:03:31.180> really<00:03:31.239> simple<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.870> make

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
right here so it's really simple to make

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.840 
right here so it's really simple to make
it<00:03:32.290> takes<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.620> little<00:03:32.769> bit<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:33.280> it's<00:03:33.790> really

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
it takes a little bit but it's really

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.330 
it takes a little bit but it's really
simple<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.600> it's<00:03:34.750> really<00:03:34.930> cool<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.310> just
