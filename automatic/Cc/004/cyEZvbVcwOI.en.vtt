00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hello, this is rprentki, and this is the fifth tutorial video of EyeWire. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 This is another cube. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Again, you choose everything will be blue, neither red nor green, not like before. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 We may have to scroll up and down a few times to make sure we get everything in this one. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
 This will be a bit challenging. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Ok, let's get this little seed. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 And we can see the 2D image. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Let's get started. 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.000
 Ok, you see a small checkerboard pattern - 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 This sometimes happens when the computer will load the image, but hopefully this is not a problem. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.500
 Ok, I press the SHIFT key to make sure it is not wired here. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Let's put the color in it. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 This looks like a very long, thin branch that goes into the cube. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.500
 Keep in mind that almost always the branches you look at, they enter the entire cube. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.000
 Do not stop in the middle of peace. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Also, if they stop midway, they should have a nice rounded end instead of a rough edge. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Let's take a look at 3D and let me draw a little closer. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Have you seen this rough edge? 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 This shows that it is not finished yet, it does not look like it should. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 So let's continue. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Ok, let's just add a blockbuster, I can take a look at 3D. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Look, we are approaching the edge. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Even if it reaches the edge, you have to continue and find all the small pieces, 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Because sometimes it can run a little along the side of the cube, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And you can miss a lot of things. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.500
 Ok, the trick is about to finish yesterday. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 It is there, it disappears. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Let us press "Check my work". 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 97% correct, it seems that just a small piece was unintentionally joined, and we missed two small things. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 congratulations.
