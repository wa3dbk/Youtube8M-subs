00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.669
 Huss my rest are 90 us was that we from the future the black box 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.009
 and in play around 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.199
 Sniper 1 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.119
 strikingly human 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.810
 and the state has with Dr 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.999
 VG 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.890
 and who plays I know percent 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.880
 Everything has the same weapon 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.499
 or does Lexa have the weapon 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.749
 or agriculture as you fly the first time far 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.060
 for the start to Warendorf second time Nordhorn and percent 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.210
 the lands remained sheet to the 11th Washington 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 and there dies when Access reset again 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 and Sierre the first three people in the end 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.320
 So what could the money use to pump the pumps? 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.540
 and the others go empty-handed 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.960
 and yes, yes, but unfortunately are better 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.250
 HP's the Heckler &amp; Koch 1 20 meters 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.250
 Arco XVI for Roehler in the other 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.870
 which they secured annually 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.830
 and yes he is just as wide of town as said not so great Arber 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.860
 much improved again 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.450
 we do not upload it again 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.920
 soft but way as I said before is noticed that it was not fun like it 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.640
 to watch 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.300
 where you just just the currently bulls 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.330
 even if the end result would be if acceptable 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.310
 where is there what is where the chamber 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.050
 can not last long 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.050
 Century to die 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.670
 the amount of reimbursement will worsen 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.560
 Stocker is now getting better and better 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.360
 Brome 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.080
 Cytos I think so 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.490
 their followers 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.520
 and everyone sent me a goal but that was not really noticed 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 under last bit 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.580
 and diversity wanted to go 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.980
 finally get it 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.720
 and there is still a knife of money therefore all are now right in the corner Fickert 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.890
 get and lightweight 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.210
 and of course big or 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.999
 and now it's up again 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.879
 and Iran 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.879
 The cards are basically limited in this boat like 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.529
 Percent Swatch July 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:21.529
 "But favorite to say so small that Premier 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.099
 how to get stuck 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.509
 and it goes to the pistol with silencer 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.529
 and then I realize for sure now, Wacker gets the SEC weak 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:31.059
 pistol 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.439
 So sample me Colombo treasures the people there to shoot 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.409
 but to improve full eyesight 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.009
 because I realized what brings almost more 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.129
 good for now it's still around here if you can save on that 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.479
 this silenced pistol but who shot with Alsace or pesto 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:48.679
 himself 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:51.969
 And yes, you have been listening to her as the last Suisse Extras 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.170
 CDM ap / sda has it 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.679
 to make better use of it as well 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.679
 and now double starting points for fawn 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.410
 and around 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.379
 For Strasser, I believe not only for the weapon 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.379
 now changed now ammann is open questions 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.319
 and the doctors more positive 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.319
 with the questions open, the people he'll stand 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.159
 and yes, the first kick with the Dragon Oath 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.519
 colorful because I unfortunately cheese Reap was now double points 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.159
 were you going to make me decisive and regulate the Ziethe? 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.929
 does not work 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:30.519
 And yes, as we said we have to look at customers with double starting points 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:33.689
 and Premich in these 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:34.829
 this time 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.229
 make worldwide 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:42.429
 and percent's dumbness Kirsten Vester died but Hauptthuis Sieber 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.619
 Dots or the branches 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:47.109
 Westhausen 200 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.309
 and while he takes the lead from texts the gun and 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.059
 that has become a sniper 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.399
 of which would be good or 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:56.879
 frequently 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.510
 and imagine similar Eichenberger for the often very short range 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.469
 function 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.309
 and yes, that's just it 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.309
 he expected to fight back with the pistol 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.459
 but 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.260
 you could easily have had these bonuses 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.589
 which advantage over most others 

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:19.639
 I'm up here eating pretty good point Walter Schwab you just do not have to 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.150
 talk 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.439
 and 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:25.439
 yes, I really have a lot of kids now 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.309
 for the fact that she had no talent for the pistol 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.039
 and the old practice is growing again 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.229
 And saving money must be the best weapon 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.979
 Armin Klein 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.340
 small move 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.749
 WiÃŸkirchen 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:43.330
 I now secures Kapielski Beck kEUR is the First Vectra 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.219
 for the municipal library St 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.939
 Topping-out ceremony of her father 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.340
 send how important the weapon is not so good 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.539
 Erich Kimmich a bit better with those 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.279
 Modern and weapons 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.879
 from cabbage to those with her and Na then there's and percent the old guns 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:59.620
 east 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.669
 no war as little as that 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.860
 and he knows the last weapon there are only extra points we might have 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.020
 have noticed or that already firmly 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.690
 and that's about hurting offenses he was referring to 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.099
 but that was embarrassing 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.430
 and yes he did some education 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.779
 2 the curve 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.490
 and he gets back to come 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.129
 and that's why I first died from 2 20 boxes eight times 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.709
 five knife money percent as said with the pistol of the Schalke fanclub 

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:29.559
 done three things 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.020
 and around 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.330
 yes its the game 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.849
 Locksmith I hope you liked it 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.349
 and managed to percent on the WAZ in the world commented and 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:40.669
 Yorkshire Plata was 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.210
 if the answer is so but like us media 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.629
 many of them 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:48.229
 Much better or better have freshwater digital Sewell 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:49.389
 Game modes Wittlich 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.389
 Birthday still seen very few videos on YouTube in the field 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.379
 and again goes on 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:56.629
 you shoot until next time
