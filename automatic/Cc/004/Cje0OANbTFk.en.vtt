00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
as well when he was allowed to play the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
as well when he was allowed to play the
way<00:01:49.530> he<00:01:49.560> likes<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.040> yeah<00:01:50.640> well<00:01:50.790> Jared<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.299> was

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
way he likes to yeah well Jared I was

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.210

there<00:01:51.659> last<00:01:51.689> year<00:01:52.049> too<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.009> made

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
there last year too so I think that made

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.830 
there last year too so I think that made
a<00:01:53.250> big<00:01:53.340> difference<00:01:53.520> probably<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> Sandow<00:01:54.630> they

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
a big difference probably to Sandow they

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.539 
a big difference probably to Sandow they
would<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.079> joined<00:01:55.259> forces<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.799> fair<00:01:56.070> bit<00:01:56.219> if

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
would have joined forces a fair bit if

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.490 
would have joined forces a fair bit if
Jarryd<00:01:57.030> Hayne<00:01:57.060> wanted<00:01:57.570> Chris<00:01:57.810> Santa<00:01:58.170> applying

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
Jarryd Hayne wanted Chris Santa applying

off<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> cuff<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.610> would<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.880> happened

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
off the cuff that would have happened

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.580 
off the cuff that would have happened
Jared<00:02:00.479> I'd<00:02:00.600> pretty<00:02:00.810> much<00:02:00.930> were<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> run<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
