them past shoot them well past 10 meters
at<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> backstop<00:00:38.969> behind

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
at all and I have a backstop behind

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.729 
at all and I have a backstop behind
those<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> catch<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> pellets<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.620> can

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
those to catch the pellets so we can

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.170 
those to catch the pellets so we can
recover<00:00:41.010> those<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.610> how<00:00:41.760> well<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.120> did

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
recover those and see how well they did

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.690 
recover those and see how well they did
as<00:00:42.390> far<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.719> expansion<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:44.430> should<00:00:44.579> be

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
as far as expansion this should be

00:00:44.700 --> 00:01:10.090 
as far as expansion this should be
pretty<00:00:44.879> good<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:45.960> go

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:33.149 

okay<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.300> guess<00:01:11.900> that's<00:01:11.930> good

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.740 

okay<00:01:34.159> first<00:01:34.430> off<00:01:34.640> let<00:01:34.880> me<00:01:34.909> say<00:01:35.000> before<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.600> even

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
okay first off let me say before we even

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.389 
okay first off let me say before we even
get<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.960> looking<00:01:36.289> at<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:36.560> onions<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.340> I

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
get to looking at the onions that I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:38.200 
get to looking at the onions that I
guess<00:01:37.640> shot

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
guess shot

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.660 
guess shot
or<00:01:38.719> should<00:01:38.930> I<00:01:38.960> say<00:01:39.140> liberated<00:01:39.740> um<00:01:39.950> hopefully

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
or should I say liberated um hopefully

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.690 
or should I say liberated um hopefully
in<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.000> audio<00:01:41.329> was<00:01:41.509> good<00:01:41.720> on<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.520> because<00:01:43.520> I

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
in the audio was good on this because I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.190 
in the audio was good on this because I
have<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.939> TTL<00:01:44.420> twenty-two<00:01:44.810> muzzle<00:01:45.079> brake

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
have the TTL twenty-two muzzle brake

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.859 
have the TTL twenty-two muzzle brake
installed<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.009> is<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:47.000> good<00:01:47.719> distance

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
installed and this is a good distance

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.050 
installed and this is a good distance
for<00:01:48.259> me<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.439> be<00:01:48.530> shooting<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:49.549> for<00:01:49.759> an<00:01:49.850> audio

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
for me to be shooting that for an audio

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.499 
for me to be shooting that for an audio
test

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
test

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.510 
test
so<00:01:50.659> hopefully<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.619> audio<00:01:51.860> came<00:01:52.100> out<00:01:52.310> great

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
so hopefully the audio came out great

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.669 
so hopefully the audio came out great
and<00:01:52.789> I<00:01:52.819> can<00:01:53.030> call<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.450> sound<00:01:54.200> comparison

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
and I can call this sound comparison

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.499 
and I can call this sound comparison
test<00:01:55.630> too<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.740> first<00:01:57.979> off<00:01:58.159> let<00:01:59.000> me<00:01:59.030> show<00:01:59.270> you

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
test too so first off let me show you

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.880 
test too so first off let me show you
the<00:01:59.750> first<00:02:00.679> onion<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:02.890> completely

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
the first onion that is completely

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.729 
the first onion that is completely
internal<00:02:04.880> sounding<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.420> down<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.659> little<00:02:05.959> bit

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.270 

this<00:02:12.739> onion<00:02:13.069> is<00:02:13.580> completely<00:02:15.099> tore<00:02:16.099> apart<00:02:18.280> hell

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
this onion is completely tore apart hell

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.670 
this onion is completely tore apart hell
it<00:02:19.400> impacted<00:02:20.120> here<00:02:22.510> hole<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.780> about<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:24.200> big

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
it impacted here hole is about this big

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.509 
it impacted here hole is about this big
instead<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.430> coming<00:02:25.790> on<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:27.519> yeah

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
instead this is coming on to you yeah

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.449 
instead this is coming on to you yeah
that's<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.849> little<00:02:29.000> bit<00:02:29.120> better<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.980> exit

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
that's a little bit better and the exit

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.970 
that's a little bit better and the exit
it<00:02:32.239> actually<00:02:32.799> ripped<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:34.579> path<00:02:35.920> through<00:02:36.920> the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
it actually ripped a path through the

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.340 
it actually ripped a path through the
under<00:02:37.700> layers<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.120> onion<00:02:38.299> if<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.049> can<00:02:39.200> see

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
under layers of onion if you can see

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.250 
under layers of onion if you can see
that<00:02:39.530> it's<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.769> pretty<00:02:39.920> nice<00:02:40.130> path<00:02:41.019> very<00:02:42.019> wide

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
that it's a pretty nice path very wide

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.970 
that it's a pretty nice path very wide
at<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.560> top<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:43.190> as<00:02:43.609> the<00:02:44.299> petal<00:02:44.799> folds<00:02:45.799> back

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
at the top and as the petal folds back

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.590 
at the top and as the petal folds back
and<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.630> diameter<00:02:47.870> decreases<00:02:48.290> and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
and the diameter decreases and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.890 
and the diameter decreases and
penetrates<00:02:50.600> off<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.900> bag<00:02:51.079> very<00:02:51.290> small<00:02:52.900> this

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
penetrates off the bag very small this

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.340 
penetrates off the bag very small this
is<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:54.200> little<00:02:54.410> bit<00:02:54.530> better<00:02:56.739> 150<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.420> if

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
is a little bit better 150 that is if

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.819 
is a little bit better 150 that is if
you<00:03:00.470> can<00:03:00.650> see<00:03:00.859> through<00:03:01.069> that<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.670> awesome

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
you can see through that that is awesome

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.020 
you can see through that that is awesome
diameter<00:03:03.829> at<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.489> beginning<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:04.940> the

diameter at the beginning of the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.090 
diameter at the beginning of the
penetration<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.660> also<00:03:05.780> very<00:03:06.170> wide<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.799> has

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
penetration is also very wide and has

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.759 
penetration is also very wide and has
the<00:03:07.250> pedal<00:03:07.579> that<00:03:08.180> expands<00:03:08.660> folds<00:03:09.260> back<00:03:09.410> it

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
the pedal that expands folds back it

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.039 
the pedal that expands folds back it
exits<00:03:10.250> very<00:03:10.519> small<00:03:13.480> sink<00:03:14.480> interpret<00:03:14.810> rubber

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
exits very small sink interpret rubber

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.150 
exits very small sink interpret rubber
so<00:03:15.260> these<00:03:15.470> works

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
so these works

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.539 
so these works
both<00:03:16.670> of<00:03:16.880> them<00:03:17.030> hopefully<00:03:17.319> I<00:03:18.319> got<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.160> look<00:03:19.340> long

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
both of them hopefully I got a look long

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.319 
both of them hopefully I got a look long
one<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.769> two<00:03:21.769> so<00:03:22.280> basically<00:03:22.700> I'm<00:03:22.880> gonna<00:03:23.030> set

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
one and two so basically I'm gonna set

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.800 
one and two so basically I'm gonna set
these<00:03:23.510> two<00:03:23.810> pellets<00:03:24.200> up<00:03:25.120> next<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.359> pellet

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
these two pellets up next to a pellet

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.440 
these two pellets up next to a pellet
that<00:03:26.900> has<00:03:27.049> not<00:03:27.260> been<00:03:27.440> shot<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.269> gives<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:29.389> a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
that has not been shot and gives you a

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.099 
that has not been shot and gives you a
very<00:03:29.660> clear<00:03:30.079> look<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:31.780> explain<00:03:32.780> what's<00:03:33.049> going

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
very clear look and explain what's going

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:42.839 
very clear look and explain what's going
on<00:03:33.410> here<00:03:33.680> if<00:03:33.769> you<00:03:33.859> don't<00:03:34.040> know

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.350 

this<00:03:43.849> clear<00:03:44.120> it's<00:03:44.269> not<00:03:44.390> perfect<00:03:44.989> okay<00:03:46.360> first

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
this clear it's not perfect okay first

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.610 
this clear it's not perfect okay first
of<00:03:47.510> all<00:03:47.800> the<00:03:48.800> TSB<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.879> is<00:03:50.030> not<00:03:50.269> expanded<00:03:50.900> is

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
of all the TSB that is not expanded is

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:04.240 
of all the TSB that is not expanded is
right<00:03:51.920> there<00:03:58.630> if<00:03:59.630> you<00:03:59.780> can<00:03:59.959> see<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:03.250> outer

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
right there if you can see this outer

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.580 
right there if you can see this outer
edge<00:04:04.610> right<00:04:05.299> here<00:04:05.360> let's<00:04:05.870> fold<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.230> down<00:04:06.379> near

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
edge right here let's fold it down near

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.780 
edge right here let's fold it down near
the<00:04:06.739> skirt<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:08.260> actually<00:04:09.260> what<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.790> expands

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
the skirt it is actually what it expands

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.670 
the skirt it is actually what it expands
and<00:04:11.000> goes<00:04:11.360> out<00:04:11.569> to<00:04:11.599> a<00:04:11.810> very<00:04:11.870> large<00:04:12.349> diameter

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
and goes out to a very large diameter

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.210 
and goes out to a very large diameter
and<00:04:13.630> dumps<00:04:14.630> all<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:15.079> its<00:04:15.230> energy<00:04:15.410> into

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
and dumps all of its energy into

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.069 
and dumps all of its energy into
whatever<00:04:16.400> you're<00:04:16.669> shooting<00:04:16.880> which<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.870> why

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
whatever you're shooting which is why

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.129 
whatever you're shooting which is why
they're<00:04:18.290> so<00:04:18.320> great<00:04:18.680> for<00:04:18.799> small<00:04:19.040> game<00:04:19.250> hunting

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
they're so great for small game hunting

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.350 
they're so great for small game hunting
the<00:04:21.139> polymer<00:04:21.560> tip<00:04:21.769> allows<00:04:22.310> that<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.910> expand

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
the polymer tip allows that to expand

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.020 
the polymer tip allows that to expand
very<00:04:23.510> rapidly<00:04:23.660> and<00:04:24.169> effectively<00:04:24.880> such<00:04:25.880> as

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
very rapidly and effectively such as

they did on this test on the the onions
I've<00:04:29.389> shot<00:04:29.889> now<00:04:30.889> so<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:32.900> remember<00:04:33.110> if<00:04:33.470> you

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
I've shot now so just remember if you

want to get some of these predator poly

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.830 
want to get some of these predator poly
bags<00:04:44.539> very<00:04:44.919> expensive<00:04:45.919> though<00:04:46.100> 14<00:04:46.610> almost<00:04:47.510> 14

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
bags very expensive though 14 almost 14

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.650 
bags very expensive though 14 almost 14
bucks<00:04:48.020> for<00:04:48.260> 200<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.039> ten<00:04:49.300> but<00:04:50.300> as<00:04:50.419> you<00:04:50.539> can

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
bucks for 200 and the ten but as you can

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.960 
bucks for 200 and the ten but as you can
see<00:04:50.720> they<00:04:50.990> did<00:04:51.050> perform<00:04:51.500> very<00:04:51.710> well<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:52.250> the

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
see they did perform very well and the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.610 
see they did perform very well and the
difference<00:04:53.270> between<00:04:53.419> these<00:04:54.289> and<00:04:54.530> other

outer<00:05:02.840> edge<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:04.010> see<00:05:04.250> that's<00:05:04.550> folded

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
outer edge that you see that's folded

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.960 
outer edge that you see that's folded
back<00:05:05.120> it<00:05:05.780> peels<00:05:06.440> off<00:05:06.650> during<00:05:07.130> penetration<00:05:07.310> and

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
back it peels off during penetration and

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.000 
back it peels off during penetration and
makes<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.750> pellet<00:05:09.050> actually<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.470> very<00:05:09.919> very

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
makes the pellet actually a very very

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.890 
makes the pellet actually a very very
smaller<00:05:10.850> diameter<00:05:11.840> than<00:05:11.870> it<00:05:12.830> was<00:05:13.900> before
