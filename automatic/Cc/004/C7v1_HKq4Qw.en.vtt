what<00:00:46.580> that<00:00:46.730> means<00:00:47.000> is<00:00:47.530> some<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.650> these<00:00:48.740> are

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
what that means is some of these are

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.320 
what that means is some of these are
going<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.070> come<00:00:49.220> out<00:00:49.400> some<00:00:49.850> of<00:00:49.940> these<00:00:50.000> are<00:00:50.180> not

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
going to come out some of these are not

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.570 
going to come out some of these are not
going<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:50.660> come<00:00:50.780> out<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.590> I<00:00:51.620> shave<00:00:52.160> off<00:00:52.340> these

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
going to come out so I shave off these

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.440 
going to come out so I shave off these
these<00:00:52.880> little<00:00:53.300> pieces<00:00:54.100> from<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.250> inside<00:00:55.640> in

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
these little pieces from the inside in

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:09.789 
these little pieces from the inside in
this<00:00:56.630> way

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.399 

and<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.759> other<00:01:10.939> half<00:01:11.240> that's<00:01:11.509> not<00:01:11.960> melted

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
and that other half that's not melted

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.310 
and that other half that's not melted
actually<00:01:12.890> tempers<00:01:13.399> it<00:01:13.579> so<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.509> bought<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.990> red

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
actually tempers it so I bought a red

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.410 
actually tempers it so I bought a red
jewel<00:01:15.679> color<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.369> also<00:01:16.969> the<00:01:17.840> red<00:01:18.259> pearl<00:01:18.649> color

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
jewel color and also the red pearl color

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.209 
jewel color and also the red pearl color
what<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.450> do<00:01:20.539> is<00:01:20.840> is<00:01:21.079> with<00:01:21.350> my<00:01:21.530> my<00:01:21.950> little

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
what I do is is with my my little

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.249 
what I do is is with my my little
syringe<00:01:22.490> here<00:01:22.819> I'm<00:01:23.090> just<00:01:23.240> pulling<00:01:23.840> some<00:01:23.990> cocoa

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
syringe here I'm just pulling some cocoa

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.940 
syringe here I'm just pulling some cocoa
butter<00:01:24.530> up<00:01:24.710> into<00:01:25.009> it<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.590> just<00:01:27.770> put<00:01:27.920> one

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
butter up into it and I just put one

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:40.059 
butter up into it and I just put one
drop<00:01:28.399> in<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.640> corner<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:31.390> blow<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:38.439> and<00:01:39.439> the

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:40.069 
drop in a corner and I blow it and the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:42.669 
drop in a corner and I blow it and the
idea<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.490> for<00:01:40.759> each<00:01:40.909> one<00:01:41.049> some<00:01:42.049> of<00:01:42.140> us<00:01:42.200> look<00:01:42.560> a

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
idea is for each one some of us look a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.479 
idea is for each one some of us look a
little<00:01:42.829> different<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:45.979> think<00:01:46.069> what<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.340> like

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
don't get me wrong but sometimes you can

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:59.620 
don't get me wrong but sometimes you can
create<00:01:58.759> something<00:01:59.060> just<00:01:59.390> from<00:01:59.509> being

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
create something just from being

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.899 
create something just from being
challenged

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.470 

Thanks

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.850 

imagine<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.750> cast<00:02:13.019> this<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.410> milk<00:02:13.650> white

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
imagine if you cast this in a milk white

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.550 
imagine if you cast this in a milk white
or<00:02:14.040> dark<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.459> get<00:02:14.610> three<00:02:14.879> different<00:02:14.910> looks

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
or dark you get three different looks

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.660 
or dark you get three different looks
because<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.830> pops<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.310> three<00:02:17.519> different

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
because it pops the three different

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.089 
because it pops the three different
colors<00:02:18.110> now<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.170> think<00:02:19.440> what<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.830> coolest

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
colors now I think what the coolest

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.280 
colors now I think what the coolest
thing<00:02:20.340> about<00:02:20.519> this<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.060> after<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.959> put

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
thing about this is is after you put

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.949 
thing about this is is after you put
your<00:02:22.319> chocolate<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.690> taken<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.810> you've
