is<00:01:13.260> great<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.729> particular<00:01:15.210> instance

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
is great in this particular instance

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030

and<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> fourth<00:01:26.369> strings<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.360> chord

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
and the fourth strings of this a chord

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.649 
and the fourth strings of this a chord
now<00:01:29.280> again<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.759> hit<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> third<00:01:30.270> string<00:01:30.540> it's

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
now again if I hit the third string it's

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.580 
now again if I hit the third string it's
perfectly<00:01:31.079> fine

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
perfectly fine

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.210 
perfectly fine
if<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.549> hit<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.759> second<00:01:34.119> string<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.950> still

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
if I hit the second string it's still

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.249 
if I hit the second string it's still
okay<00:01:36.579> but<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.329> goal<00:01:37.479> with<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.689> power<00:01:37.899> cord<00:01:38.200> is

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
okay but the goal with the power cord is

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.050 
okay but the goal with the power cord is
to<00:01:38.350> try<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.680> keep<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.100> cord<00:01:39.460> relatively

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
to try and keep that cord relatively

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.969 
to try and keep that cord relatively
small<00:01:40.420> when<00:01:40.630> I<00:01:40.659> strum<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.140> okay<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:41.770> I've<00:01:41.950> got

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
small when I strum it okay so I've got

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.710 
small when I strum it okay so I've got
my<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.250> cord<00:01:42.670> here<00:01:42.939> and<00:01:43.090> then<00:01:43.450> I've<00:01:43.539> got<00:01:43.689> a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
my a cord here and then I've got a

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.359 
my a cord here and then I've got a
strumming<00:01:44.170> pattern<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.680> now<00:01:45.100> I'm<00:01:45.189> going<00:01:45.310> to

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
strumming pattern and now I'm going to

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.679 
strumming pattern and now I'm going to
show<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:45.700> basic<00:01:46.060> outline<00:01:46.479> of<00:01:46.509> the

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
show you the basic outline of the

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:55.919 
show you the basic outline of the
strumming<00:01:47.020> pattern<00:01:47.049> here<00:01:47.409> it's<00:01:47.530> going<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.810> in

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
strumming pattern here it's going so in

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:56.999 
strumming pattern here it's going so in
between<00:01:56.049> there<00:01:56.380> what<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.590> want<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.799> do<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:56.950> you

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
between there what you want to do is you

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.770 
between there what you want to do is you
want<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.220> stop<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.820> strings<00:01:58.119> from<00:01:58.299> vibrating

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
want to stop the strings from vibrating

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.870 
want to stop the strings from vibrating
and<00:01:59.049> you<00:01:59.740> can<00:01:59.890> either<00:02:00.009> do<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.369> by<00:02:00.520> using<00:02:00.700> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
and you can either do that by using the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.179 
and you can either do that by using the
karate-chop<00:02:01.689> part<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:02.049> your<00:02:02.170> hand<00:02:02.409> and<00:02:02.649> kind

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
karate-chop part of your hand and kind

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.350 
karate-chop part of your hand and kind
of<00:02:03.340> touch<00:02:03.490> right<00:02:03.700> over<00:02:03.909> where<00:02:04.060> your<00:02:04.149> middle

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
of touch right over where your middle

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.880 
of touch right over where your middle
position<00:02:04.959> pickup<00:02:05.289> would<00:02:05.409> be<00:02:05.560> somewhere

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
position pickup would be somewhere

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.759 
position pickup would be somewhere
around<00:02:05.950> there<00:02:09.750> okay<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:11.470> somewhere<00:02:11.680> in

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
around there okay just somewhere in

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.320 
around there okay just somewhere in
there<00:02:11.890> not<00:02:12.250> really<00:02:12.549> in<00:02:12.640> your<00:02:12.760> palm<00:02:13.000> muting

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
stance if you know where palm muting is

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.920 
stance if you know where palm muting is
you<00:02:15.010> want<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.250> be<00:02:15.310> further<00:02:15.640> up<00:02:15.760> than<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.360> okay

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
you want to be further up than that okay

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
hand I'm just kind of crowded chopping

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.479 
hand I'm just kind of crowded chopping
across<00:02:40.570> all<00:02:40.750> six<00:02:40.989> strings<00:02:41.170> my<00:02:41.769> hand<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.190> open

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
across all six strings my hand is open

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.710 
across all six strings my hand is open
I'm<00:02:42.640> touching<00:02:43.450> miles

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.000 

okay<00:02:49.720> now<00:02:50.050> as<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.319> start<00:02:50.380> feeling<00:02:50.830> that

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
okay now as you start feeling that

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.949 
okay now as you start feeling that
rhythm<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.580> little<00:02:51.819> bit<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.390> can<00:02:52.540> start<00:02:52.780> adding

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
rhythm a little bit you can start adding

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.690 
rhythm a little bit you can start adding
a<00:02:53.140> couple<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.530> scratches<00:02:53.770> here<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.370> there<00:02:54.490> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
a couple of scratches here and there and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.030 
a couple of scratches here and there and
no<00:02:54.880> rhyme<00:02:55.240> or<00:02:55.270> reason<00:02:55.480> I'm<00:02:55.930> thinking<00:02:56.770> of<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
no rhyme or reason I'm thinking of the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.410 
no rhyme or reason I'm thinking of the
rhythm<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.430> more<00:02:57.640> like<00:02:57.819> this<00:02:58.000> so<00:03:00.420> what's

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
rhythm is more like this so what's

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.610 
rhythm is more like this so what's
happening<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.870> every<00:03:02.050> once<00:03:02.230> in<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.380> while<00:03:02.500> I'm

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
happening is every once in a while I'm

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:11.820 
happening is every once in a while I'm
adding<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.130> one<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.459> them<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:11.170> if<00:03:11.380> that's<00:03:11.560> too

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
adding in one of them and if that's too

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.440 
adding in one of them and if that's too
weird<00:03:12.040> for<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.490> for<00:03:12.700> now<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.850> can<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.300> stay

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
weird for you for now you can just stay

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.600 
weird for you for now you can just stay
with<00:03:13.600> that<00:03:13.720> outline<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:18.100> as<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.459> get<00:03:18.580> more

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
with that outline and as you get more

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.100 
with that outline and as you get more
comfortable<00:03:18.970> than<00:03:19.300> start<00:03:19.540> kind<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.810> adding

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
comfortable than start kind of adding

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:26.699 
comfortable than start kind of adding
that<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:24.510> now<00:03:25.510> if<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.080> try<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.380> play<00:03:26.440> along

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
that in now if you try and play along

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.380 
with it and it's out of tune you could
go<00:03:58.989> purchase<00:03:59.440> something<00:03:59.650> like<00:03:59.890> that<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:01.120> then

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
that the first two are AG da then you do

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.540 
that the first two are AG da then you do
that<00:06:44.080> little<00:06:44.229> segue<00:06:44.620> which<00:06:44.770> is<00:06:44.889> A<00:06:44.919> to<00:06:45.070> D<00:06:45.190> and
