00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
concerned about it's not that I'm

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.440

concerned<00:00:05.850> it's<00:00:06.810> more<00:00:07.290> that<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.890> feel<00:00:08.760> like<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
concerned it's more that I feel like the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.230 
concerned it's more that I feel like the
TSA<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.349> making<00:00:11.219> travelers<00:00:11.580> uncomfortable

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
TSA is making travelers uncomfortable

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.570 
TSA is making travelers uncomfortable
and<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:13.049> think<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.679> we<00:00:13.830> can<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.130> security

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
and I think that we can have security

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.220 
and I think that we can have security
measures<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.179> don't<00:00:15.599> make<00:00:15.750> people<00:00:16.049> feel

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
measures that don't make people feel

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.410 
measures that don't make people feel
uncomfortable<00:00:16.820> so<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.150> decided
