a<00:00:02.490> request<00:00:03.210> tutorial<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:04.140> how<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.440> make<00:00:04.859> an

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
a request tutorial on how to make an

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.730 
a request tutorial on how to make an
easy<00:00:05.759> east<00:00:06.120> keyframe<00:00:06.720> as<00:00:06.930> an<00:00:07.080> After<00:00:07.470> Effects

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
easy east keyframe as an After Effects

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.580 
easy east keyframe as an After Effects
but<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.429> cinema<00:00:08.880> 4d<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:10.170> if<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.410> got<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
but in cinema 4d so if you got a

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.700 
but in cinema 4d so if you got a
animation<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:11.759> want<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.030> smooth<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.509> out

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
animation and you want to smooth it out

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.189 
animation and you want to smooth it out
this<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> way<00:00:14.130> how<00:00:14.540> I'm<00:00:15.540> gonna<00:00:15.719> go<00:00:15.900> pretty

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
this is the way how I'm gonna go pretty

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.529 
this is the way how I'm gonna go pretty
basic<00:00:16.410> not<00:00:16.920> going<00:00:17.250> into<00:00:17.369> render<00:00:17.789> settings<00:00:18.150> or

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
basic not going into render settings or

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.130 
basic not going into render settings or
making<00:00:19.020> any<00:00:19.199> complex<00:00:19.770> animations<00:00:20.720> I'm<00:00:21.720> just

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
making any complex animations I'm just

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.009 
making any complex animations I'm just
gonna<00:00:22.470> make<00:00:22.740> what<00:00:23.310> looks<00:00:23.789> good<00:00:23.910> rotating<00:00:24.869> I'm

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
gonna make what looks good rotating I'm

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.019 
gonna make what looks good rotating I'm
gonna<00:00:25.410> make<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> platonic<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.430> move<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:26.939> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
gonna make a platonic and I move it up a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.759 
gonna make a platonic and I move it up a
bit<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:28.320> above<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.949> line<00:00:30.260> hold<00:00:31.260> shift<00:00:31.590> by

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
bit so it's above the line hold shift by

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.160 
bit so it's above the line hold shift by
the<00:00:31.830> way<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> drag<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.610> steps<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.090> 10<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.960> we're

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
the way to drag in steps of 10 and we're

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
the way to drag in steps of 10 and we're
gonna<00:00:34.320> set<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> few<00:00:34.829> keyframes<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.700> gonna

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
gonna set a few keyframes so I'm gonna

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.330 
gonna set a few keyframes so I'm gonna
set<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> keyframe<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.829> move<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.860> forward<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
set a keyframe here move it forward to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.290 
set a keyframe here move it forward to
frame<00:00:38.670> 40<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.280> rotate<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> around<00:00:41.579> quite<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
frame 40 and rotate it around quite a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.520 
frame 40 and rotate it around quite a
bit<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.860> yeah<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:45.450> about<00:00:45.690> come

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
bit so here we go yeah that's about come

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.990 
bit so here we go yeah that's about come
on<00:00:46.850> that's<00:00:47.850> good<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.450> set<00:00:49.320> another<00:00:49.469> keyframe

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
on that's good and set another keyframe

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.740 
on that's good and set another keyframe
so<00:00:51.199> let's<00:00:52.199> play<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.620> back<00:00:56.510> hmm

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
so let's play that back hmm

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.170 
so let's play that back hmm
let's<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:59.010> move<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.399> back<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> little<00:00:59.670> bit<00:00:59.879> so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
let's just move it back a little bit so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.760 
let's just move it back a little bit so
you<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> bit<00:01:01.170> more<00:01:01.199> abrupt

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you can so it's a bit more abrupt

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
you can so it's a bit more abrupt
because<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> change<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> let's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
because we want to change that and let's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.700 
because we want to change that and let's
set<00:01:03.960> another<00:01:04.170> keyframe<00:01:05.540> right<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:08.570> and

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
set another keyframe right here and

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.690 
set another keyframe right here and
let's<00:01:10.710> play<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:10.979> back<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:13.159> as<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.460> see

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
let's play that back and as you can see

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.830 
let's play that back and as you can see
it<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.240> stops<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.450> I'm<00:01:18.450> gonna<00:01:18.630> make

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
it just stops like that I'm gonna make

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.310 
it just stops like that I'm gonna make
this<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> little<00:01:19.259> bit<00:01:19.560> less<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:21.320> nobody

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
this a little bit less because nobody

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.370 
this a little bit less because nobody
needs<00:01:22.729> vertigo<00:01:23.729> from<00:01:24.659> watching<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.080> tutorial

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
needs vertigo from watching a tutorial

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
needs vertigo from watching a tutorial
so<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:28.080> stops<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.579> now<00:01:29.850> we're

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so and it stops like that so now we're

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.050 
so and it stops like that so now we're
going<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> control<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.759> first<00:01:32.759> we're

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
going to go to control this first we're

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.840 
going to go to control this first we're
gonna<00:01:33.210> click<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.350> hold<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.100> select

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
gonna click and hold this and select

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.670 
gonna click and hold this and select
animation<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:38.900> as<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.170> see<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
animation and as you can see the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.319 
animation and as you can see the
timeline<00:01:41.369> opens<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:43.880> there<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:44.909> three

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
timeline opens up and there are three

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.679 
timeline opens up and there are three
keyframes<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:47.340> rotation<00:01:48.000> which<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.420> set

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
keyframes for the rotation which we set

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.109 
keyframes for the rotation which we set
here<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.649> click<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:49.860> rotation<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.670> select

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
here if you click on rotation you select

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.469 
here if you click on rotation you select
all<00:01:51.329> three<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.750> them<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:53.040> even<00:01:53.520> adds<00:01:53.700> some

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
all three of them and it even adds some

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.539 
all three of them and it even adds some
values<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.170> them<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:55.979> much<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.520> are

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
values to them to how much they are

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.459 
values to them to how much they are
rotated<00:01:58.490> go<00:01:59.490> ahead<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:01.549> rotate<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:03.060> about

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
rotated go ahead and rotate this about

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.889 
rotated go ahead and rotate this about
130<00:02:04.469> more<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.100> as<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.180> can<00:02:06.270> see<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.570> value

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
130 more and as you can see the value

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.949 
130 more and as you can see the value
was<00:02:07.020> updated<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:09.110> with<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.289> selected

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
was updated so with this selected

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.800 
was updated so with this selected
go<00:02:12.170> here<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:13.099> let's<00:02:14.090> see<00:02:14.299> if<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.569> shows<00:02:14.780> up

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
go here to the let's see if it shows up

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.220 
go here to the let's see if it shows up
a<00:02:15.049> tab<00:02:15.909> nope<00:02:16.939> but<00:02:17.480> just<00:02:17.629> click<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.959> little

select<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.599> rotation<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:25.959> as<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.200> can<00:02:27.319> see

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
select the rotation and as you can see

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.670 
select the rotation and as you can see
let's<00:02:27.950> zoom<00:02:28.129> out<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.310> bit<00:02:28.549> here<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.750> our<00:02:29.930> here

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
let's zoom out a bit here is our here

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.190 
let's zoom out a bit here is our here
are<00:02:30.829> two<00:02:31.219> keyframes<00:02:31.719> which<00:02:32.719> are<00:02:32.900> actually

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
are two keyframes which are actually

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.050 
are two keyframes which are actually
looking<00:02:33.319> pretty<00:02:33.530> smooth<00:02:34.099> as<00:02:34.310> they<00:02:34.489> are<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:34.909> we

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
looking pretty smooth as they are but we

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.800 
looking pretty smooth as they are but we
want<00:02:35.239> them<00:02:35.329> even<00:02:35.659> more<00:02:35.810> smooth<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:37.389> let's<00:02:38.389> just

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
want them even more smooth so let's just

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.080 
want them even more smooth so let's just
click<00:02:39.530> on<00:02:39.739> this<00:02:39.920> thing<00:02:40.489> right<00:02:40.519> here<00:02:40.849> and<00:02:41.000> as

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
click on this thing right here and as

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.449 
click on this thing right here and as
you<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.299> see<00:02:41.569> we<00:02:42.230> got<00:02:42.409> a<00:02:42.439> little<00:02:42.620> handle<00:02:43.099> here

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
you can see we got a little handle here

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.729 
you can see we got a little handle here
so<00:02:43.609> if<00:02:44.389> we<00:02:44.419> just<00:02:45.079> drag<00:02:45.409> this<00:02:45.650> out<00:02:45.829> a<00:02:45.889> bit<00:02:46.359> and

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
so if we just drag this out a bit and

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.640 
so if we just drag this out a bit and
maybe<00:02:48.739> puts<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.560> bigger<00:02:51.560> line<00:02:51.829> here<00:02:52.250> and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
maybe puts the bigger line here and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.920 
maybe puts the bigger line here and
let's<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:54.950> same<00:02:55.159> for<00:02:55.220> this<00:02:55.549> one<00:02:55.819> okay<00:02:56.480> so

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
let's do the same for this one okay so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.860 
let's do the same for this one okay so
what<00:02:57.620> we<00:02:57.739> have<00:02:57.919> got<00:02:58.280> now<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.819> a<00:02:59.120> curve<00:02:59.569> that<00:02:59.810> is

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
what we have got now is a curve that is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.379 
what we have got now is a curve that is
slowly<00:03:00.260> going<00:03:00.560> up<00:03:00.799> going<00:03:01.159> up<00:03:01.400> going<00:03:01.639> faster

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
slowly going up going up going faster

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.199 
slowly going up going up going faster
and<00:03:02.919> reaching<00:03:03.919> a<00:03:03.980> peak<00:03:04.219> and<00:03:04.489> then<00:03:04.549> slowly

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
and reaching a peak and then slowly

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.170 
and reaching a peak and then slowly
moving<00:03:05.599> down<00:03:06.189> until<00:03:07.189> a<00:03:07.370> certain<00:03:07.579> point<00:03:08.000> so

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
moving down until a certain point so

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.589 
moving down until a certain point so
let's<00:03:08.450> just<00:03:08.659> preview<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:10.120> oops<00:03:11.120> wrong

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
let's just preview that oops wrong

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.979 
let's just preview that oops wrong
button

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
button

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:20.050 
button
my<00:03:12.980> bad<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:17.620> this<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.859> bit<00:03:19.159> harsh<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:19.849> let's

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
my bad and this is a bit harsh so let's

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.949 
my bad and this is a bit harsh so let's
move<00:03:20.269> this<00:03:20.479> one<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.900> bit<00:03:21.079> more<00:03:21.319> further<00:03:22.010> away

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.300 

and<00:03:27.220> it's<00:03:28.220> rotating<00:03:28.750> back<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.159> what<00:03:31.159> I've

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
and it's rotating back so what I've

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.949 
and it's rotating back so what I've
probably<00:03:31.669> done<00:03:32.000> wrong<00:03:32.239> yeah<00:03:32.479> I've<00:03:32.780> only

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
probably done wrong yeah I've only

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.740 
probably done wrong yeah I've only
learned<00:03:33.319> this<00:03:33.560> recently<00:03:33.829> so<00:03:34.459> I'm<00:03:35.000> kind<00:03:35.659> of

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
learned this recently so I'm kind of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.809 
learned this recently so I'm kind of
experimenting<00:03:36.470> myself<00:03:36.949> here<00:03:37.189> but<00:03:37.400> that's<00:03:37.669> a

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
experimenting myself here but that's a

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.390 
experimenting myself here but that's a
that's<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.479> fun<00:03:39.199> of<00:03:39.349> making<00:03:39.379> tutorials<00:03:40.159> you

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
that's the fun of making tutorials you

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.759 
that's the fun of making tutorials you
learn<00:03:41.090> more<00:03:41.389> yourself<00:03:41.659> than<00:03:42.199> you're<00:03:42.319> teaching

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
learn more yourself than you're teaching

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.789 
learn more yourself than you're teaching
others<00:03:43.069> though<00:03:43.400> if<00:03:44.139> if<00:03:45.139> you<00:03:45.319> like<00:03:45.500> making

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
others though if if you like making

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.339 
others though if if you like making
tutorials<00:03:46.280> keep<00:03:46.939> on<00:03:47.120> going<00:03:47.540> because<00:03:47.720> it's<00:03:48.169> a

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
tutorials keep on going because it's a

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.990 
tutorials keep on going because it's a
great<00:03:48.560> learning<00:03:48.739> tool<00:03:48.949> for<00:03:49.129> yourself<00:03:49.699> and

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
great learning tool for yourself and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.890 
great learning tool for yourself and
others<00:03:50.319> so<00:03:51.319> that's<00:03:51.650> just<00:03:51.979> and<00:03:52.689> there<00:03:53.689> it

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
others so that's just and there it

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.490 
others so that's just and there it
smoothes<00:03:54.199> out<00:03:54.409> if<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.310> keep<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.669> below<00:03:55.939> a<00:03:56.500> top

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
smoothes out if you keep it below a top

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.849 
smoothes out if you keep it below a top
line<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:58.269> above<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.780> bottom<00:04:00.319> line<00:04:00.560> it

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
line and above the bottom line it

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.949 
line and above the bottom line it
smoothes<00:04:01.669> out<00:04:01.879> so<00:04:02.180> as<00:04:02.239> you<00:04:02.329> can<00:04:02.449> see<00:04:02.659> it's

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
smoothes out so as you can see it's

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.550 
smoothes out so as you can see it's
stopping<00:04:03.889> really<00:04:04.400> smoothly<00:04:04.699> and<00:04:05.000> if<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:06.079> just

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
stopping really smoothly and if you just

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.860 
stopping really smoothly and if you just
pull<00:04:06.829> this<00:04:06.949> away<00:04:07.129> further<00:04:07.579> and<00:04:08.000> let's<00:04:08.449> maybe

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
pull this away further and let's maybe

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.629 
pull this away further and let's maybe
pull<00:04:09.349> this<00:04:09.500> down<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:09.769> bit<00:04:10.479> and<00:04:11.479> make<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:11.900> more

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
pull this down a bit and make this more

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:19.009 
pull this down a bit and make this more
flat

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.890 

hmm<00:04:19.620> well<00:04:20.579> this<00:04:20.819> is<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> bit<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.239> experimenting

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
hmm well this is a bit of experimenting

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.900 
hmm well this is a bit of experimenting
for<00:04:21.930> me<00:04:22.259> too<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:22.919> let's<00:04:23.250> just<00:04:23.460> play<00:04:23.669> around

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
for me too so let's just play around

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.480 
for me too so let's just play around
with<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.419> bit<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:26.810> there<00:04:27.810> we<00:04:27.840> go<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.490> it

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
with this a bit and there we go and it

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.430 
with this a bit and there we go and it
just<00:04:29.789> takes<00:04:30.000> a<00:04:30.150> bit<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.330> messing<00:04:30.629> around<00:04:30.900> and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
just takes a bit of messing around and

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.869 
just takes a bit of messing around and
working<00:04:31.770> with<00:04:31.889> it<00:04:32.039> until<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:32.430> get<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.610> nice

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
working with it until you get a nice

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.140 
working with it until you get a nice
curved<00:04:33.360> keyframe<00:04:34.349> I<00:04:35.190> do<00:04:35.610> not<00:04:35.819> recommend

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
curved keyframe I do not recommend

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.659 
curved keyframe I do not recommend
placing<00:04:36.840> too<00:04:36.990> many<00:04:37.199> keyframes<00:04:37.800> behind<00:04:38.580> the

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
placing too many keyframes behind the

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.200 
placing too many keyframes behind the
channel<00:04:38.970> because<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.569> will<00:04:40.050> make<00:04:40.229> it<00:04:40.289> hard<00:04:40.650> to

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
channel because it will make it hard to

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.300 
channel because it will make it hard to
make<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.810> end<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.409> end<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.979> animation

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
make the end and end of the animation

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.450 
make the end and end of the animation
smooth<00:04:44.789> out<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.780> let's<00:04:46.620> see<00:04:46.800> if<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:47.009> can<00:04:47.190> find

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
smooth out and let's see if I can find

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.950 
smooth out and let's see if I can find
