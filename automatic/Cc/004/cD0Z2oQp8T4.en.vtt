00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.930
 person who has played a lot of latin 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.180
 american poker tour who many of you were 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.710
 protagonist but you had never accessed 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.290
 to a final table and it was something that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.570
 I really wanted to know how mario is very 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.630
 happy and obviously excited about 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.780
 this achievement because as you say you do 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.860
 a lot that I was trying to get to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.630
 a final table on one side and good is the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.490
 first that I have on me good 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.970
 he played to win it apart then nothing very 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.970
 happy very happy you have more than 30 tables 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.770
 final more than 15 titles titles in the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.600
 Vegas desire 70 here lie down Illán 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.170
 who feels like accessing a final table 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.320
 a final table that cost to arrive and in the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.869
 that when you arrived, you highlighted this and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.540
 then it got complicated from a madness 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.630
 this in a moment at the final table 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.659
 when that happens to me 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.430
 until they give a lot and then 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.410
 I fall down 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.540
 well I was tremendously sorry 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.320
 because for me the strategy I had 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.390
 that to follow there was another adjust a little 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.300
 If you adjusted a touch and did not enlarge 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.180
 wells because 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.670
 I mean, I think I could add chips 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.840
 playing for the little ones with these 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.079
 players that were here and with my stack 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.200
 when you lose are 12 large wells there in 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.719
 that moment what 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.430
 this under the million continue to be a 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.920
 to touch 800 when my craft if 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.840
 weakened I have to put the cole it 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.820
 share 6 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.820
 against the lifting that had the match 4 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.570
 nothing luckily he could go back there 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.480
 I tell myself this game gave me as a 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.720
 second chance because I think that in 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.390
 half of the final table I think that in 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.380
 a specific play but good to me the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.000
 final table I had liked a lot 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.650
 really like there was game pérez with 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.290
 who quarter heads up but when 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.290
 they arrive at gestar change everything is 241 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.180
 below and how was your strategy before 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.270
 get to that heads up and how it went 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.270
 developing 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:35.090
 I went with a lot less chips 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.090
 I tried to make my game 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.040
 about what game 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.180
 by flower pretty well 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.310
 then one tried to shrink also the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.730
 wells 42 wells guys play it in 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.730
 position 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.170
 good nothing first after the bent 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.120
 obviously 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.440
 play more pits still out in position and 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.530
 no one a little bit I was wearing it I think 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.110
 that I was increasing the stack 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.730
 remarkably but little by little until 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.100
 good if that hand that I really do not 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.950
 I wanted that 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.530
 finished line and frank to clean 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.990
 for the title not so big but good 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.930
 I did not have another one that is the first thing 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.730
 you thought when you saw the old me 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.830
 you said I was thinking strategy to 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.300
 keep on that why I'm left jordi just not 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.790
 we reach the man who is served at 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.140
 heads also the rhythm and will have 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.480
 to do everything again 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.520
 when you started playing poker and several 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.570
 as good as texas hold'em poker 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:46.010
 I started playing when I graduated 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:51.700
 in the two stockings it became half this 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:55.209
 and good with a group of friends 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.930
 from bariloche that if we have a club 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:03.069
 caravan service that can name more 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.810
 development to pancho ice cream and many 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.170
 many many great players come out of 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.330
 bariloche taking 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.810
 several several guys of my age to 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.900
 some bigger people also what 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.720
 who were pioneers in this club 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.290
 and good there 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.020
 I took my first steps, let's say 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.830
 we started participating in tournaments in the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.430
 region in patagonia and little by little 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.070
 they were giving some results and 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.720
 we started to travel 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.870
 buenos aires- we came to chile and 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.270
 rest of Latin America 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.400
 and leaving humility aside 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.930
 when you think that you became so 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.510
 good and why do you think you 're so good 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.670
 leaving the unit aside 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:58.240
 I believe that 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:05:01.750
 I do not know what to say to you I have improved 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.630
 a lot of reading studying and playing day to 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:12.330
 day long after good sharing 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:14.610
 experiences travel moments with friends 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.310
 I think that also made me 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.300
 evolve a lot that I am use now 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.289
 marc I want to concentrate a bit more 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.050
 in the online game 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.710
 try to make me a little more solid and 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:34.119
 more regular because I was always a 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.139
 semi regular player with travel in 

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:38.099
 alive 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.099
 it's more complicated 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.169
 that's a point that a goal to 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.560
 comply 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:51.330
 then maybe another would win more 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.330
 things outside Latin America and Europe 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
 USA 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.090
 would have to see if you can this year if 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.620
 not the other calm I would like to play 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.280
 the whole circuit of evolution by 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.790
 correctly 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.270
 I do not know if everything but go to participate in 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.590
 some and not all because good 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.430
 for me it's quite enough to travel so much 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.470
 knowing your career we have seen you 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.790
 several times to reach general tables of 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.529
 the important tournaments and so 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:25.499
 when you get to the end the properties 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:27.940
 a good vibes around good people 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:31.560
 wave do you think that also influences 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:34.260
 yes yes it is very likely that yes and then 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.440
 also good the final tables like that 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.139
 I'm very concentrated I try 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.330
 make as little mistake as possible 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.840
 and good and there have been the 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.879
 results are happy is said with the 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.390
 results I am very happy I am very happy 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:53.670
