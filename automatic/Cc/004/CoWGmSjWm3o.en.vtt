00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.330
 so much adventure in the lost kingdom 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.700
 try to effectively recreate a kingdom 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.910
 lost in the area of ​​cambodia vietnam 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.029
 thailand et cetera etcetera and it's about 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.090
 that people really live a 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.910
 adventure and fighting for it like 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.140
 listen to a battle type attraction of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.160
 that is to say it will go through a tour of 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.799
 finding this different scenarios 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.620
 where you will go from a jungle to a 

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:49.650
 typical Cambodian village to an area of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.600
 battle an area of ​​monuments and also 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.339
 people who do not want to get on the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 attraction as we always think of them 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.909
 they can also interact with those who 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.909
 They make attraction from outside 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.890
 the most important feature is that 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.170
 a journey has been made in which the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.110
 people do not wait what is going to 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.479
 find is to say instead of making a 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.549
 open pool in this case we have done 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.229
 a river where it goes and goes 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.240
 finding different surprises at 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.270
 the length of the journey 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.180
 the design is being done in parallel to 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.070
 the construction is to say a 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.799
 first design of a first package or 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.479
 lots is running and while you're 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.909
 running the zero t is being designed 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.610
 the following that allows us in certain 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.409
 go very fast and on the other hand go 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.080
 correcting possible errors that had 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.700
 happening throughout the process 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.950
 are we doing let's say the layer 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.020
 superficial of the whole project everything 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.869
 what are pavements or what are 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.610
 handrails banks finalizing also 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.009
 gardening plantation and so on 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.600
 etcetera and obviously to be able 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.270
 doing that means that all the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.830
 infrastructure all facilities 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.080
 all buildings are already built 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.830
 therefore we are in the final stretch to 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.830
 finalize the details 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.760
