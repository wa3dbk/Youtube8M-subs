00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.609
Intro:What's Pixy ??

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.360
Out ATW is stride the ball and

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.656
catch the ball directly by same leg

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.855
Pixy is catch the ball by opposite leg

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.329
and What's Pixy set ??

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.493
it's higher pixy !?

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:31.684
Still it is not Wrong answer

00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:33.629
but essence of pixy set is

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:37.885
the leg passes the ball and

00:00:38.202 --> 00:00:40.202
pass the right above of the ball

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:43.225
After the leg passed on the ball, ball still keeps rising.

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:47.187
it's the essence of pixy

00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:50.052
by pixy set, the flight duration of the ball is extended.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:55.679
it's enables Over the world, Phenix and Magellan and so on

00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:57.762

00:01:08.573 --> 00:01:10.573
Point is the form of touching the ball

00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:14.354
The moment of ball touch, bend the ankle inner

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:16.623
insert the toe the bottom of the ball

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:18.995
and left the knee inner

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:21.926
if the knee left the right above of the ball

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.740
the knee must go 
right ⇒up ⇒ left

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
but if the knee left inner

00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:33.962
knee goes only
up ⇒ left

00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:37.342
by the angle of ankle

00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:39.513
The orbit of the knee is short-cut

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.249
you can make pixy set in compact motion

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.000
when the pixy set

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.746
shift the ball outward slightly

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.220
In pixy set,shift the ball outward

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280
compare with out ATW

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350
you can make easily

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:09.265
Let's confirm the ball-touch

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.439
In pixy set,

00:02:14.132 --> 00:02:16.132
the ball is higher and forward than ATW

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:18.668
why?

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:21.188
Because you must kick the back side of the ball

00:02:22.665 --> 00:02:24.665
this position is suitable for kicking back side of the ball

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.890
if you kick the ball at normal position

00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:30.858
The ball would fly away!!

00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:33.731
To kick the back side of the ball

00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:35.686
the position of the ball is higher and forward than ATW

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330
and [direction of the kick]

00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:42.165
then, the ball is far position,

00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:44.033
Kick the ball toward yourself

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.320
the fall spot of the ball of..

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.100
out ATW and Pixy set is same

00:02:52.427 --> 00:02:54.427
Out ATW is here

00:02:55.911 --> 00:02:57.911
Pixy set is here(same point)

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.350
Let's make sure the NG pattern

00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.811
this is simple mistake

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:10.652
why the ball hits on the leg??

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.330
The leg is raised higher, it is good but

00:03:16.892 --> 00:03:18.892
swing down without

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.969
movement to the side

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.700
so the ball hits on the leg

00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:25.431
Don't dodge the ball only in upper direction

00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:29.778
Dodge the ball not only upper

00:03:30.603 --> 00:03:32.603
but also side direction

00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.311
it's important point!

00:03:37.615 --> 00:03:39.615
and not only upper and side

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:41.236
but also back and forth

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:43.715
this is simple mistake too

00:03:45.864 --> 00:03:47.864
When the foot is raised.

00:03:48.748 --> 00:03:52.248
as if there is the  wall on the ball

00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:55.053
the foot raised straight

00:03:56.817 --> 00:03:58.817
in this case, the ball hits on the leg easily

00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.131
there is the space of back and forth enough

00:04:04.698 --> 00:04:08.118
swing the leg forward

00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:11.731
by this motion

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.019
you can use the enough space to dodge the ball

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.520
swing the leg forward

00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:21.096
it's very important!

00:04:21.746 --> 00:04:25.466
use the 3D space

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.520
and dodge the ball!

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.795
Let's review all

00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:32.053
Insert the toe bottom of the ball

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.449
Left the knee inner

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:38.829
Position of the ball is slightly outward

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.839
and raise the leg

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.742
not only upper but sideward

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.940
kick the ball at upper and forward slightly

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:55.596
by this, you can kick the back side of the ball

00:04:56.383 --> 00:04:58.383
and you can kick the ball toward yourself

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:03.799
swing the leg forward

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:07.263
and swing higher

00:05:07.263 --> 00:05:09.185
you can get enough space to dodge the ball

00:05:09.636 --> 00:05:11.636
you can pixy set !!
