00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.759
 beautiful boys how many zo we say to 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.319
 questions about my top ten channel and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.319
 this time we are here to comment with 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.240
 guys and brands and here we are back healthy 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 of age 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.449
 let's start immediately with the first clip that is 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.789
 a 12 4 suite made from cat planes but 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.109
 price an enemy of hiv just makes us 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.849
 sappers we already expect in slow motion 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.380
 and let's sit this a little bit 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.880
 that with mac that you then make player 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.710
 a quadruple and a triple 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.059
 we leave immediately for the ninth position 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.640
 is a trick shot in two in a row map 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.760
 querrey on the laser trento lauder son 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.920
 very nice armored shield there 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.170
 I'm the creative of nothing and what to say 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.449
 nothing very nice 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.059
 let's do a little to the eighth click though 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.680
 still apple trees and has already weighed the Rome e 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.350
 we can do this activity in red 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.770
 still this is the guys here a triple 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.420
 one ballet made with brino ha 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.790
 could that you can adjust that not 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.020
 no black ops run two just the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.430
 I normally make any with a viewfinder 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.400
 any looks there is no 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.710
 circle movement strange things 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.009
 to me zoom for the most normal life ever 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.350
 treat the raid not to start follow 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.479
 instead we suffered a trick shot like 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.360
 seventh position 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.729
 and well what about the soil really 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.970
 controcazzi for laughs are still okay 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.740
 switch is really spectacular 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.799
 then I can't see the names of the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.390
 therefore people that you will find all 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.710
 how many of the rankings we pass immediately 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.979
 at the sixth position which is a triple of 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.040
 c4 followed by a triple mallett is 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.930
 in fact, it also stops the fourth but let's say 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.300
 that 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.140
 and you are never crazy to be mad 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.210
 seen anything quite so new 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.630
 I didn't see a few clicks on 12 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.900
 the fifth position is very beautiful instead 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.860
 a cyber ballet marted always up 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.040
 ride done by our hicks fan rusher 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.550
 I must say that it was really beautiful here no 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.750

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.520
 acer sia the prelate is in the film a lot 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.190

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.860
 unfortunately for him but a lot of stuff 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.130

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.170
 immediately to the fourth position 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.959
 exact and we always consider hicks fan rush 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.700

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.200
