00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.820
 starting calmly and then you've 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:24.230
 finished almost double that does not explain a 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.330
 little of things we are with the team I 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.789
 down and already icex and mines as now 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.519
 you know a community channel with 31 others 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.840
 gods we got to play us to 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.370
 Sometimes we find ourselves skilled tacs 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.680
 Candy got the one and I stayed in 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.210
 20 streak and they killed me a penalty for 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.789
 stay nice that would have been 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.350
 very very very good was that these birds are 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.359
 very good players and good the truth 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.649
 that many think is good to climb the 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.940
 step on the video for reproductions 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.350
 but good reproductions of that if it is 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.449
 that I have 1,600 subscribers that is a 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.820
 shit is to say me about this video 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.590
 because it's going down 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.879
 I upload this video because it's coming 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.140
 good to me because it suits me to grow 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.850
 for the channel and because I think it is 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.920
 a game to climb is one that in 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.449
 facebook against them and travel and 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.880
 that understands what you do if you look and so 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.560
 I take advantage and I tell you that you can see it 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.450
 from your camera I leave the channel of the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.840
 description so good kids and 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.579
 I hope 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.409
 and I wanted to give you a couple of things you will say 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.149
 good buy us 7 you take the first one 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.159
 you found abel and I say you are not 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.679
 mistaking already I have one that and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.920
 it is precisely on this map the cities that 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.469
 tomorrow I made a run of 28 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 station could have made more streak of 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.920
 I will try to get more out of that good 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 I'm ready, I 'm happy with this 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.020
 cultivation is because I'm improving a lot 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.090
 very much I see how the people because every 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.979
 it seems worse to me compared to the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.289
 first day and I'm getting better I hope 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.360
 keep improving the truth little by little 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.640
 that this month and the one that I have always 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.369
 the section 2010 I carry it with 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.649
 silencer and took it to the enlarged 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.140
 also good then in this case not 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.729
 I was a specialist, I like it 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.399
 less take specialist than the rat 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.989
 it helps you even though I would tell you 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.429
 made of rivers but very very very good 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:05.360
 idea and that you can put 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.360
 Bulletproof that goes very well 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.179
 we are on a map that looks like a 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.039
 desert the truth that I do not know how it is 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.010
 how it's called the truth is pretty 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.560
 cool little by little I'm getting used to 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.000
 the call of duty goes the maps from time to time 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.530
 when we already know a bit how 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.860
 they work the answer domains is 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:34.620
 so competitive advantages guide 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:37.080
 of assault weapons I will explain how 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.750
 SAT works with perfection 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.260
 hopefully it will work fine well I can 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.880
 explain the whole and then nothing if 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.580
 you want posts I'll leave with this 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.900
 double that in order until you know I hope 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.100
 that you like the video kids species 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.570
 assess how good are two 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.910
 hits and it's not accurate almost this 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.230
 departure so what I said I hope that you 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.230
 like like favorites 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.330
 in the cee de sa coma activated 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.120
 we take terry 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.130
 when destroyed its arcs 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.520
 yes 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.130
 best 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.620
 to the bottom we lose we have lost 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.539
 in the head 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.539
 positions 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.090
 the finished demolition link 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.090
 active direct sarcoma 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.379
 now 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.720
 we are losing 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.310
 as an ally at the helm 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.210
 do not 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.210
 that we lose to look for 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.840
 action 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.310
 we take bravo 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.120
 an allied helicopter 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.329
 we go 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.940
 to get to the next 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.940
 we have prepared
