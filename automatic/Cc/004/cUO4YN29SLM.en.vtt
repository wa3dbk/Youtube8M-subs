00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.820
 if this cup Italy for Rome 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.040
 it represented something really 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.630
 particular having to exorcise that 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.370
 which had happened a year ago and is not 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.609
 it was certainly a nice return to the san 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.080
 paolo per morgan de santis that we salute 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.220
 almost the morgan always with alessandra 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.779
 concerning you good evening everyone was 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.310
 a bitter return indeed for 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.810
 morgan de santis I would start the 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.489
 review of the morgan game six 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.079
 agree from what did not happen 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.210
 that is, the project was the plan was 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.630
 mark for first right there is gone 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.520
 close 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.320
 rome did the game for one 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.660
 good portion of the first half but it is not 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.730
 managed to score from this failure 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.070
 then chain comes all that is 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:51.460
 success in the rest of the match it was 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.860
 this is the theme of the game 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.780
 we came here to giocarcela 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.100
 this was evident from the first minutes 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.740
 we had opportunities not for you 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.999
 we have exploited this leaves us of 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.170
 regret however it is clear that 

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:12.119
 elimination must also be considered 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.890
 over the 180 minutes it is evidently 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.049
 more mistakes have been made by 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.630
 ours that they are 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.590
 met two strong teams 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.930
 perhaps Naples prevailed 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.780
 the advantage of playing the second in 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.460
 home has produced a little bit but affect 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.729
 it is only this in hindsight 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.260
 because anyway I repeat you there 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.200
 they faced two great teams 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.780
 at the end the episodes of the situations 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.310
 limit have determined the difference 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.380
 here I would like to anticipate a theme that 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.880
 we will listen in a little rough garcia already 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.470
 spoken I listened to our colleague 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.270
 dario di gennaro according to him of garcia 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.550
 the qualification of Rome lost her 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.860
 at the Olympic stadium 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.450
 subscribe think you did too 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.440
 lost a little with those two goals 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.740
 cashed at the Olympic but look at you 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.160
 I repeat the consideration must be made in 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.950
 180 minutes because when you play a 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.899
 round knockout round 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.440
 and return 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.810
 it is necessary to reason like this ee 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.610
 in this case both in the consignment of 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.410
 outward than in the return we have 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.840
 committed to naivety we do not have 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.890
 took advantage of the situations that exist 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.440
 it happens and I repeat it went like this 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.120
 and I 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.400
 anyway, we had come here anyway 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.230
 with a goal of advantage and they were all there 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.299
 the premises to be able to eventually 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.440
 also don't lose then pass the 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.230
 round 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.629
 now I see 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.110
 I didn't know there was any maradona in 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.110
 tribune
