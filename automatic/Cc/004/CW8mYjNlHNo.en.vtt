00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.220
 I will be doing to you on how to record 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.530
 your games without prats and nor band and camps 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.020
 this program that comes on screen will 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.510
 I'll leave them to download here below is 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.480
 very easy to install and so with our 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.140
 program in science is to record your 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.160
 screen or record multiple windows that is 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.350
 the option that we are going to use this 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:32.930
 program is going to leave you the video so 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:36.170
 less in about 100 mb and noticing how you 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.960
 it would leave a French a van dyck am and 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 the truth is that this program has very 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.690
 good quality is very good good audio 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.670
 let's start to configure it Havana 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.770
 double click to open it and you will see that 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.540
 there are several tabs here to which 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.640
 we are going to focus on this one 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.280
 greece writes a record 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.320
 once they are here as you will see here 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.320
 come to trace your area is going to 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.329
 look like an area or an X for 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.489
 that the transcend that up here or as 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.430
 you want I have I do it because I do not 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.470
 is going to see because I have the field like this 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.670
 recording here this is the option that 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.939
 let's use the window 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.350
 if you can see that here below 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.420
 appears as a rectangle with lines 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.380
 white that is plotting everything that goes 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.409
 to record the program 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.049
 in the case of what we are doing in 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.880
 Kraft will be to give you the little window 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.460
 minecraft and it's going to plot with these 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.119
 white lines to what nothing else is going to 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.729
 record that the good program now let's 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.990
 to move on to configure it this is the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.490
 microphone 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.829
 if you have a microphone and what is the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.929
 I separate audio you are going to select 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.909
 in my case what you have and if not 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.610
 what will disable this box 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.220
 something that is not going to record any car 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.909
 we move general is what is going to 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.189
 record the audio of the game act video 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.729
 here is something very important here is going to 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.530
 be the folder where I was going to keep their 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.899
 videos you can modify it 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.360
 giving you here at the three points and they're going to 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.160
 create a folder where you want it to 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.540
 it's the same here is something very important 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.030
 as well 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.030
 since here you can stop it after 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.340
 so many seconds two minutes for that go 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.900
 to give in the box and they will modify 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.220
 this 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.140
 so why 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.910
 so that you have so many seconds 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.310
 here they do the same as me 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.020
 start after the seconds that you 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.210
 want if you want three seconds of 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.780
 preparation as well as singing and at the same time 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.620
 to give three seconds and so you're going to leave 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.900
 this is going to fulfill a real 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.099
 manually each time you record 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.459
 well now once you have this happen 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.260
 to minimize must begin here 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.060
 I'm going to mean that when it starts it 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.939
 they start to start then the screen 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.209
 and if you do not give it will be followed by the 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:07.140
 way that screen but hey they'll 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.140
 give here in minimize 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.660
 well once they start they will be able to 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.510
 start for before that we're going to 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.970
 grab the minecraft 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.560
 we are going to open it 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.560
 and we will be in the tri 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.170
 well now, you're nothing more, every time 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.629
 that you get in window and select here 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.450
 the minecraft window is going to 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.569
 appear some white lines like 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.250
 as I am treating them with red there 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.400
 the whales that appear a few lines 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.530
 white like the ones that appear here 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.620
 as it seems a more muted the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.319
 little picture is what will record good 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.800
 now that the captain cya and 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.490
 will begin to record spread 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.490
 surround 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.930
 well you will see that here is being recorded and 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.879
 Well, here in the little windows this 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.459
 here in these parts here would not let me 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.890
 see beyond the mouse but here in this 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.709
 part of here or in the little windows 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.799
 it's going to seem like 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.989
 reminders like these the ones that are 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.139
 appearing like an ele at home 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.540
 window that in each corner in what 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.990
 I would say it is recording good as you will see 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.539
 is recording here and forgive the lines 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.210
 are not white are black lines hopefully and 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.310
 reach them is not distinguish and therefore 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.400
 good as you will see is that I see a new 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.520
 world that would be little survival 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.310
 create a world and well, as you will see there 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.100
 it's fine you're not working hard to 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.430
 what I think is not treated much 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.980
 and good as you will see it is already 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.380
 see how you do not work as much as in 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.380
 the fields would already be working 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.940
 what it is that the hand looks a 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.340
 little bit black but I think that's not 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.509
 it matters what mind really matters 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.160
 is that minecraft look good without 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:18.820
 I know what 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:22.150
 as it does not stay so much but also 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.180
 there is a trick in this if you know 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.330
 many of ways so you do not get stuck 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.410
 they will both have to download the optical 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.410
 so that it does not lock so much 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.720
 well I think that 's all 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.310
 It is only worth mentioning that in 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.530
 these corners as I'm putting it 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.060
 it's going to look like something red in what 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.480
 I saw that that is the window that is 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.910
 recording 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.360
 well then 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.010
 I hope you liked the video 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.350
 but good here they left an image 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.480
 about how much the video weighs 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.110
 recording right now with the minecraft and 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.180
 You will see that it does not weigh so much 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.080
 and only with mentioning that you 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.960
 do it well in qantas ya or in sony 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.690
 vegas the program that you want or 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.060
 whatever you like, they will reuse it and 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.150
 Well it's good that's been all 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.750
 thanks for watching the video and well 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.380
 until the next bye 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:29.990
 good here is what would be the video 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:34.090
 see 381 megabytes with a duration of 2 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.090
 23 minutes and you can 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:50.529
 there's the video and well, that's what 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:51.669
 been everything but that you liked and 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:53.849
 until next time 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:53.849
 bye
