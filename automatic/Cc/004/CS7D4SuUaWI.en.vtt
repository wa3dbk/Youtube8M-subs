00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
wanted to tell you I found like three of

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.030 
wanted to tell you I found like three of
these<00:03:40.290> quarters<00:03:41.690> they<00:03:42.690> were<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.770> ground

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
these quarters they were in the ground

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.790 
these quarters they were in the ground
like<00:03:44.910> that<00:03:45.350> and<00:03:46.350> then<00:03:46.530> right<00:03:46.800> next<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:48.800> was

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
like that and then right next to it was

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.780 
like that and then right next to it was
this<00:03:50.040> in<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.820> same<00:03:51.060> hole<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:53.430> was<00:03:53.580> awesome

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
this in the same hole and it was awesome

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.990 
this in the same hole and it was awesome
because<00:03:54.210> I'm<00:03:55.110> guessing<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:56.280> might<00:03:56.580> be<00:03:56.760> why<00:03:56.970> I

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
because I'm guessing that might be why I

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.990 
because I'm guessing that might be why I
mean<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.750> came<00:03:57.990> up<00:03:58.170> strong<00:03:58.560> quarter<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.220> guess

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
mean it came up strong quarter I guess

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.340 
mean it came up strong quarter I guess
that's<00:04:00.270> why<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.450> might<00:04:00.750> have<00:04:00.900> missed<00:04:01.110> it<00:04:01.230> with

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
that's why I might have missed it with

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.200 
that's why I might have missed it with
the<00:04:01.440> Bounty<00:04:01.740> Hunter<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.910> Bounty<00:04:03.180> Hunter

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
the Bounty Hunter the Bounty Hunter

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.450 
the Bounty Hunter the Bounty Hunter
probably<00:04:04.020> gave<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.710> bunch<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:05.100> mixed

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
probably gave it a bunch of mixed

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.250 
probably gave it a bunch of mixed
signals<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:06.270> just<00:04:06.510> probably<00:04:06.750> didn't<00:04:07.110> dig

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
signals and I just probably didn't dig

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.180 
signals and I just probably didn't dig
it<00:04:07.410> because<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.830> thought<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.070> was<00:04:08.250> trash<00:04:08.600> but

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190
