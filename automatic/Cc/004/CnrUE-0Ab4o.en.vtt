00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.259
 hey you tube and welcome to one 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.480
 new episode of me on the new map 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.530
 and javi I would like to join you today 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.330
 introduce you 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.400
 You've been here for three weeks now 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.960
 nothing is mine and yes I want 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.400
 Just show you a bit that I am 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.160
 the last three weeks something 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.869
 I have done and yes I need 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.110
 afterwards also your help or 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.460
 your opinion you said and yes we 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.989
 Just start here for me 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.360
 make the whole thing so general 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.149
 before and then I need your help 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.920
 So what we see here is the new spot 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.399
 on a small hill 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.050
 Here is the new town hall 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.809
 is a bit like the mountain rhein 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.989
 built but not quite full 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.670
 I set that up extra times 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.370
 Unfortunately, I still know exactly when 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.070
 not and here we start with the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.879
 modern sake 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:08.990
 anja otto big houses he said and yes 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.850
 there is always the facade the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.850
 street and so the general stuff yes 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.860
 everything fg 66 b built that has me too 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.750
 a little bit with the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.250
 Landscaping helped 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.130
 You must know that this is not so 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.890
 looked as we the map 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.860
 have configured and yes we have there 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.299
 a bit yes with world edit the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.659
 landscape changes so that the 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.030
 Modern homes just fit 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.670
 and yes I hope that until now 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.619
 you can of course like what you see 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.509
 not much, however, you have to 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.490
 say that this is very much work 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.560
 to build such facades 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.170
 and I'm doing it relatively hard 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.270
 that does not all look the same and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.820
 I try different too 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.820
 to use materials in the facade 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.290
 that just does not repeat 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.320
 but it keeps coming back 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.820
 somehow gets some new accents 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.800
 and now we're actually coming to it 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.259
 my question and indeed 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.450
 So far I have always mixed the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.990
 houses ready presented or just 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.110
 made a picture with you like 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.600
 I the interior of the houses 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.790
 I have built and I want to do that now 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.840
 just know from you how should I this 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.720
 imagine houses 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.760
 should I invite you together with you picture 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.400
 So I do that within me 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.710
 a week within three follow in 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.690
 set up his house from the inside and then 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.700
 the finished imagine or should I just 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.590
 a house just once a week 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.720
 imagine or even two 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.570
 a house in two weeks that's on it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.390
 how it is with me or time 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.820
 yes how should I do 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.770
 with a picture or ready 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.120
 So you can decide that 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.709
 just write below in the comments 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.740
 I will be very, very much 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.970
 happy and yes, if there is nobody 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.470
 then I should be interested 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.340
 probably the finished houses 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.860
 imagine 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.290
 that means a house every week or 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.070
 every two weeks follow come normally 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.780
 every Monday and I'm curious 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.830
 you can me down into the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.080
 Write comments 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.760
 what should I do as I should do 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.019
 and best of all, why then look forward to it 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.390
 I already have many comments 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.680
 of you and hope that you the little one 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.489
 watch videos for bridging and 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.670
 also here plenty of tips and 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.410
 Support is perfect 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.860
 thank you for a nice week and 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.860
 bye for now
