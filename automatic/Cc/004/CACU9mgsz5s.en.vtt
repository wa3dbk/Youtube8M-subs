00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.600
 see how to make a duck 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.230
 origami paper one starts first 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:19.710
 by apa square feet we start with the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:29.970
 client 2 to form a triangle here 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:35.219
 we mark our triangle once 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.030
 do it unfold and then we just bend 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.030
 like this 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.640
 that's the same on the other side 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:19.410
 we will then close our tip 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 superior on the lower tip and 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:30.560
 we notice the folding on flap 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.560
 then we both sides on the center 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.650
 same for the other side 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:57.899
 see that the folding is here we open 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:03.049
 then lightly and stand out for 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.049
 train those here we go well then there is 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.250
 then we flip this site to form a 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.250
 triangle 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:37.430
 once obtained in us and we fold 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:45.540
 this inside to get this form 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:48.540
 of support correctly we then move on to 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.020
 folding this part back to the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.020
 the center 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:09.650
 here and there on the other side 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.650
 also back to the center 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.960
 that we will then fold this whole 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:29.870
 small part out and we 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:32.230
 bring in the same way 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.230
 the other side 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.390
 we will then create a small triangle 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.310
 where we also bring back inside 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.210
 the same on the other side 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.870
 we then go to the folding of the head 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.199
 bring back our big triangle like 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.199
 this 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.860
 there we press properly 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:53.040
 then unfold the open and the 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:05:00.550
 return to the fold then slightly 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:09.250
 and we fold it here you get 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:12.750
 worry about unfolding it again then we 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.750
 will bend our big tip 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:32.750
 to then fold it in half 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.280
 from there we then close our head 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:44.730
 but as just now an effected on 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:47.960
 even folding with a pencil one can 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.960
 possibly mourn him 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.040
 side impact 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.970
 and that's our paper duck is ready 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.970
 see you soon
