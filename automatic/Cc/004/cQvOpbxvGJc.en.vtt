00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.230
 time 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.230
 yoga 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.540
 you spent 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920
 1 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.270
 m 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:06.290
 and that's the end of the little editing 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:09.409
 I hope you enjoyed it was the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.780
 japan expo 2014 through my eyes so 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.609
 it was really really great 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.190
 would never have imagined that it could have 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.320
 to be as good after it's true that 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.299
 I screamed a lot and talked a lot 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.210
 so I lost a little bit 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.280
 voice so you hear it necessarily but 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.660
 it's a blessing in disguise finally it was 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.090
 really great 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.910
 I met some really cool people 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.310
 I finally put faces on 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.900
 names or nickname the staff in the cam 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.490
 was really super hospitable with 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.199
 everyone is very warm very 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.150
 funny very funny always with 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.310
 smile 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.870
 subscribers alike I took a lot of 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.180
 photos with you signing autographs 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.680
 and everything is super fine 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.570
 you have been adorable you have me all 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.599
 asked questions and everything was very 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.729
 nice end frankly i draw 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:59.270
 really very good things 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.490
 it was perfect even at the 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.720
 japan of the activities they had it's 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.039
 true that there were quite a few people who 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.440
 were known to the player style of 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.449
 attic all that animates enormously even 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.330
 Marcus and all were very funny 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.830
 at level 2 of the events he was doing 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.240
 there are small animations precisely 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.740
 with video games and yes commented 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.720
 it was very funny the attic player 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.340
 also accessible at questions level 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.009
 we will ask him a little bit 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.039
 wanted finally here there was plenty of 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.050
 world it was great even the cosplays 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.919
 I love it you have necessarily seen 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.970
 in the video but it's true that me 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.440
 it's really something that I love 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.849
 cosplay and then especially when they are 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.750
 handmade because it's a 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.000
 crazy job 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.190
 and in addition when his faithful or enough 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.669
 great i love sir i am a big 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:46.849
 fan of those of this kind of event 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.830
 pretty much do it again without 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.840
 moderation I 'll go next year and 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.979
 the year after I think if you want 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.270
 come finally I really advise you 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.680
 japan is really a cool thing 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.930
 even if it's a financial blow 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.180
 to go there especially since I come from 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.970
 bordeaux so here you have to go there 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.900
 you have to sleep on the spot you have to pay 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.840
 the entrance etc 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.380
 but frankly it was top it will be at 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.190
 again probably I'll go to tgs so at 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.860
 toulouse game show 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:19.400
 in my opinion the paris games week I know 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.800
 not but in any case there japan I 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.419
 draws a very very good memory and 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.430
 I hope all future years 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.830
 will be like that I also want to 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.570
