lighting perspectives today we're
discussing<00:00:07.970> outdoor<00:00:08.970> lighting<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> want

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
discussing outdoor lighting and I want

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.980 
discussing outdoor lighting and I want
to<00:00:10.650> show<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:10.920> how<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.610> wire<00:00:11.910> up<00:00:12.210> your<00:00:12.599> outdoor

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
to show you how to wire up your outdoor

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.440 
to show you how to wire up your outdoor
lighting<00:00:13.290> system<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> very<00:00:14.759> important

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
lighting system this is a very important

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.109 
lighting system this is a very important
aspect<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.109> how<00:00:16.590> your<00:00:16.890> final<00:00:17.400> project<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
aspect to how your final project is

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.349 
aspect to how your final project is
going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.570> look<00:00:19.580> one<00:00:20.580> thing<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.119> must

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
going to look one thing that you must

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.790 
going to look one thing that you must
take<00:00:21.570> into<00:00:21.750> account<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:22.380> low-voltage

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
take into account with low-voltage

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.730 
take into account with low-voltage
lighting<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.580> voltage<00:00:24.000> drop<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.260> as<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
lighting is voltage drop that is as you

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.429 
lighting is voltage drop that is as you
get<00:00:25.890> farther<00:00:26.189> from<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> transformer<00:00:27.510> there's

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
get farther from the transformer there's

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.349 
get farther from the transformer there's
a<00:00:28.529> greater<00:00:28.859> strain<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.550> your<00:00:29.699> wire<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
a greater strain on your wire and the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.690 
a greater strain on your wire and the
voltage<00:00:30.810> which<00:00:31.349> will<00:00:31.529> cause<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.710> fixtures<00:00:32.430> or

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
voltage which will cause the fixtures or

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.510 
voltage which will cause the fixtures or
the<00:00:32.820> light<00:00:33.000> bulb<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.390> appear<00:00:33.660> less<00:00:33.960> bright

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
the light bulb to appear less bright

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.459 
the light bulb to appear less bright
with<00:00:35.520> fixtures<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.149> our<00:00:36.300> under<00:00:36.870> 50<00:00:37.230> feet<00:00:37.440> from

with fixtures at our under 50 feet from
the<00:00:37.739> transformer<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.780> recommend<00:00:39.780> three<00:00:40.200> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the transformer we recommend three to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.340 
the transformer we recommend three to
four<00:00:40.559> fixtures<00:00:40.980> per<00:00:41.460> line<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.960> get<00:00:43.110> farther

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
four fixtures per line as we get farther

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.040 
four fixtures per line as we get farther
away<00:00:43.620> from<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.070> transformer<00:00:44.760> 50<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.510> 100<00:00:45.899> feet

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
away from the transformer 50 to 100 feet

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
away from the transformer 50 to 100 feet
we<00:00:46.230> might<00:00:46.440> only<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.829> two<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.430> three<00:00:47.670> fixtures

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
we might only have two to three fixtures

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.389 
we might only have two to three fixtures
per<00:00:48.450> wire<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.989> when<00:00:49.770> we're<00:00:49.920> over<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> hundred

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
per wire and when we're over a hundred

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.549 
per wire and when we're over a hundred
feet<00:00:50.700> we're<00:00:51.539> typically<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> look<00:00:52.440> at

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
feet we're typically going to look at

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.400 
feet we're typically going to look at
one<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.980> two<00:00:53.010> fixtures<00:00:53.550> many<00:00:54.420> cases<00:00:54.930> even<00:00:55.199> one

fixture as we're very far from that
transformer<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.379> will<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:58.739> sure<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
transformer this will make sure that you

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.970 
transformer this will make sure that you
have<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.520> consistent<00:01:00.020> light<00:01:01.020> output<00:01:01.620> from<00:01:01.890> one

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
have a consistent light output from one

have a consistent light output from one
light<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> next<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:04.229> right<00:01:04.470> now<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.680> begin

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
light to the next all right now we begin

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.289 
light to the next all right now we begin
the<00:01:05.129> fun<00:01:05.339> part<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> job

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the fun part of the job

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.030 
the fun part of the job
trenching<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.020> getting<00:01:07.590> all<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> wire

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
trenching and getting all the wire

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.280 
trenching and getting all the wire
buried<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:09.180> important<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> try<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.080> get

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
buried it's important to try and get

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.770 
buried it's important to try and get
that<00:01:10.439> wire<00:01:10.740> buried<00:01:11.280> deep<00:01:11.520> enough<00:01:11.780> my

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that wire buried deep enough my

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
that wire buried deep enough my
recommendation<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.740> go<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.220> six<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.670> nine

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
recommendation is to go for six to nine

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.969 
recommendation is to go for six to nine
inches<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:16.170> don't<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> grab<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> tool

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
inches you don't want to grab a tool

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
inches you don't want to grab a tool
like<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> plat<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.850> shovel<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.330> get<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> whole

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
like a plat and shovel and get the whole

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230 
like a plat and shovel and get the whole
family<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.890> start<00:01:20.850> trenching

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
family out here and start trenching

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
family out here and start trenching
basically<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:22.530> what<00:01:23.310> we're<00:01:23.460> doing

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
basically you can see what we're doing

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.840 
basically you can see what we're doing
is<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.759> making<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.299> line<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.560> grass<00:01:25.850> as

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
is just making a line in the grass as

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.950 
is just making a line in the grass as
we're<00:01:27.000> trenching<00:01:27.330> you're<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
we're trenching you're going to do the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.410 
we're trenching you're going to do the
same<00:01:28.170> thing<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> mulch<00:01:29.030> once<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.299> our

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
same thing in the mulch once we get our

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.200 
same thing in the mulch once we get our
trench<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.049> take<00:01:31.259> our<00:01:31.439> wire<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.790> simply

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
trench in we take our wire and we simply

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
trench in we take our wire and we simply
lay<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.170> our<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.950> our<00:01:35.490> trench<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.710> like<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
lay it in our in our trench I like to

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.679 
lay it in our in our trench I like to
get<00:01:37.920> some<00:01:38.250> kind<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.640> poking<00:01:39.060> stick<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.540> could

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
get some kind of poking stick you could

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.679 
get some kind of poking stick you could
use<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> screwdriver<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.860> by<00:01:40.979> hand

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
use a screwdriver or do it by hand

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.170 
use a screwdriver or do it by hand
you're<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.869> poke<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you're going to poke this in to the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.789 
you're going to poke this in to the
ground<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:47.189> what's<00:01:47.520> nice<00:01:47.729> about<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.390> is

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
ground and what's nice about this is

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.499 
ground and what's nice about this is
it's<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:50.009> surgical<00:01:50.310> once<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.210> done<00:01:51.360> with

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
it's very surgical once we get done with

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.140 
it's very surgical once we get done with
it<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.720> could<00:01:51.810> flatten<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> ground<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.829> up
