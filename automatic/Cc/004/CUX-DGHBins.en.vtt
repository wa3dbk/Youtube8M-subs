00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.709
 There are about twelve people where with it 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:05.109
 make the people technically 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.569
 Oriented is programmatically and 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.899
 So do not just say behind the tree 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.869

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.600
 whole infrastructure without big budget 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.530
 Watching TV and so many 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.000

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.510
 The material is much harder for customers 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.270
 it 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.400
 the technical material that comes from 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.250
 My own group that's what I am 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.910
 homepage there are all technical 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.890
 There are roxy there are four 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.640

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.510
 has us easy as well as the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.670
 fractions to me as they are 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.030
 if you credit them on your heels 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.100

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.630
 it's good 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.250
 We hope the future looks like it 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.660
 if it is so clear that they are legal 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.470

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.510
 But this is the big bet of mango 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.580
 do not scare off 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.760
 It is clear that it is illegal 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.840
 can use cheap televisions 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.640
 copyright of the film nothing 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.410

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.080
 shines that is not fair 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.330
 The Author vs. Pirates The Thought 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.910

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.799
