 hello today we will be with you 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.550
 knit here such a pattern of facial and 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.680
 purl loops 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.620
 called lan zigzag bumps 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.299
 pattern repeat 4 rows for 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.480
 sample recruit the number of loops 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:23.130
 multiple of eight + two edge loops 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.409
 start knitting the first row of rapport 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.339
 edge knit knit face and start 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:36.010
 knit rapport horizontally 1 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:42.070
 purl loop 3 face 1 2 3 then 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:45.850
 repeat 1 purl loop 3 facial 1 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.109
 2 3 here we tied rapport by 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:56.260
 horizontals from 8 loops then repeat 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:01:03.879
 1 purl loop 3 facial 1 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:12.000
 purl loop 3 face 1 2 3 1 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:18.760
 purl 3 facial 1 2 3 1 purl 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.760
 3 front 1 2 3 and edge at the end of the row 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.520
 we knit seam loop here we 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.150
 tied up the first row of rapport 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.230
 turn over and knit the second row 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.770
 knitting facial and starting 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.610
 knit rapport horizontally 1 front 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:50.440
 a loop 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:53.830
 5 purlins 1 2 3 4 5 1 front 1 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.570
 wrong here we tied rapport by 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:10.360
 horizontals from 8 loops then repeat 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:15.770
 1 face loop 5 purl 1 2 3 4 5 1 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.410
 facial 1 purl and so 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.300
 knit until the end of the second row 3 row 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.770
 rapport 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.220
 edge knit facial and 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:33.430
 proceed to knitting rapport pattern 2 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:42.280
 facial 1 2 1 purl loop 3 facial 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:45.740
 1 2 3 1 purl loop 1 front 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:53.150
 we tied the rapport horizontally out of 8 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:03:01.640
 loops then repeat 2 facial 1 2 1 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:06.320
 purl loop 3 face 1 2 3 1 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.490
 purl loop 1 face you and tied 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.240
 one more report 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.430
 and how to boom knit until the end of the third row 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.870
 4 row rapport 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.370
 edge knit facial and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:28.070
 start knitting 2 purl loops 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:35.420
 1 2 1 front loop 1 purl 1 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:38.240
 front loop 3 purl 123 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:42.320
 here we tied rapport horizontally out 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:49.490
 8 loops then repeat 2 purl 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:59.720
 loops 1 2 1 front loop 1 purl 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:04:02.870
 loop 1 face loop 3 purl 123 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.200
 here we tied another report and so 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.030
 bumm knit until the end of 4 rows 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.160
 fourth row we tied the whole rapport 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.620
 pattern 5 row begin to knit with the first 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.440
 rows here is such a pattern 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.690
 zigzag shaped tubercles of facial and 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.690
 purl loops we have turned
