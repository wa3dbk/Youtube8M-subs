00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 different tastes yes and we have 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.680
 here to eat a chocolate sex with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.029

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.730
 chocolate

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.090
 see these issues layer chocolate with 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.800
 and I still have them leading edge 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.980
 morning noodles but I think it says 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.360

 chocolate yes but these are three 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.020
 misleading and yet I think I was 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.579
 here you see groups that are my eyes or that 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.539

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.539

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:55.819

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.780

 Dutch word and efficient if so what 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.960
 them for themselves 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:52.140
 I am another way hole the absolute yes 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:03:01.600

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:03.750
 jesus jesus the winner may take the 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.750
