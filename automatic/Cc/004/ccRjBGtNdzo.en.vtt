00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
I'm not that young just about a year ago

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.779 
I'm not that young just about a year ago
I<00:00:27.990> mean<00:00:28.680> people<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> little<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.519> over<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
I mean people have a little bit over a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.299 
I mean people have a little bit over a
year<00:00:29.849> ago<00:00:30.230> but<00:00:31.230> basically<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.130> hard

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
year ago but basically what I was hard

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.190 
year ago but basically what I was hard
to<00:00:32.399> doing<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.790> maybe<00:00:32.969> had<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.329> 100<00:00:33.750> k<00:00:33.899> coins

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
to doing I maybe had about 100 k coins

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.580 
to doing I maybe had about 100 k coins
but<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.309> sort<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.870> going<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.140> picking<00:00:37.530> up

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
but I was sort of going for picking up

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.850 
but I was sort of going for picking up
bits<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:38.070> items<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.180> open<00:00:39.450> bid<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.620> sort<00:00:40.800> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
bits on items on open bid and I sort of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.260 
bits on items on open bid and I sort of
realized<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.370> little<00:00:41.610> bit<00:00:41.700> later<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.090> night

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
realized a little bit later at night

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.840 
realized a little bit later at night
maybe<00:00:42.570> around<00:00:42.899> 1am<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.739> something<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.309> my<00:00:44.550> time

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
maybe around 1am or something at my time

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.209 
maybe around 1am or something at my time
I<00:00:45.120> was<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> lot<00:00:46.200> easier<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.620> pick<00:00:46.739> up<00:00:46.860> deals<00:00:47.100> on

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
I was a lot easier to pick up deals on

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.680 
I was a lot easier to pick up deals on
open<00:00:47.430> bid<00:00:47.610> because<00:00:47.760> there<00:00:48.090> were<00:00:48.180> last<00:00:48.390> people

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
open bid because there were last people

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.380 
open bid because there were last people
on<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> wanted<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> figure<00:00:50.430> out<00:00:50.670> was

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
on so what I wanted to figure out was

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.560 
on so what I wanted to figure out was
what<00:00:51.809> would<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> best<00:00:52.440> time<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.070> that

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
what would be the best time to do that

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.900 
what would be the best time to do that
so<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.530> developer<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.039> chief<00:00:56.190> 11<00:00:56.640> there

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
so on the developer on chief 11 there

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
so on the developer on chief 11 there
was<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.539> number<00:00:58.170> which<00:00:58.320> would<00:00:58.469> show<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
was this number which would show the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.590 
was this number which would show the
total<00:00:59.100> number<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.340> items<00:00:59.550> step<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> market

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
total number of items step on the market

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
total number of items step on the market
I<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.680> know<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.190> shows<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
I think you know it also shows on the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.410 
I think you know it also shows on the
console<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.439> play<00:01:04.589> 12<00:01:04.850> but<00:01:05.850> anyway

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
console as well on to play 12 but anyway

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.789 
console as well on to play 12 but anyway
I<00:01:06.479> think<00:01:06.570> that's<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.900> pretty<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.229> analogy<00:01:07.770> of

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I think that's a pretty good analogy of

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.179 
I think that's a pretty good analogy of
how<00:01:08.130> many<00:01:08.510> players<00:01:09.510> are<00:01:09.780> trading<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
how many players are trading or going to

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.160 
how many players are trading or going to
be<00:01:11.280> bidding<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.670> stuff<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.990> kind<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
be bidding on stuff and that kind of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.490 
be bidding on stuff and that kind of
thing<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.509> when<00:01:15.509> there's<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> last<00:01:15.960> number<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
thing so when there's the last number of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.289 
thing so when there's the last number of
items<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> market<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.460> recipe<00:01:18.060> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
items on the market this recipe this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.660 
items on the market this recipe this
amount<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.810> people<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> market<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.640> well

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
amount of people on the market as well

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.600 
amount of people on the market as well
if<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.659> were<00:01:21.840> lying<00:01:22.080> around<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.470> my<00:01:22.590> house<00:01:22.740> so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
if you were lying around in my house so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.070 
if you were lying around in my house so
I<00:01:23.640> found<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.330> would<00:01:24.509> refresh<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
I found this like I would refresh the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.830 
I found this like I would refresh the
page<00:01:25.460> every<00:01:26.460> 30<00:01:26.700> minutes<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.420> i<00:01:27.450> opened<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
page every 30 minutes so i opened the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
page every 30 minutes so i opened the
web<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> dance<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.310> i<00:01:29.340> also<00:01:29.460> found<00:01:29.820> them

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.630 
web and the dance then i also found them
which<00:01:30.720> would<00:01:30.990> take<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.259> screenshot<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.070> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
which would take a screenshot and I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.730 
which would take a screenshot and I
plans<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.900> basically<00:01:34.259> left<00:01:34.500> around

plans as well so basically left around

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.480 
plans as well so basically left around

day<00:01:41.759> showing<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.810> total<00:01:43.079> number<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.320> items

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
day showing the total number of items

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.330 
day showing the total number of items
throughout<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.909> day<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> after<00:01:46.619> looking<00:01:47.130> at

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
throughout that day so after looking at

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.249 
throughout that day so after looking at
all<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> image<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.479> lot<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.899> images

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
all the image as a lot of the images

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.560 
all the image as a lot of the images
that<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.439> took<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.180> us<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.390> remember

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
that I took and I think us to remember

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.960 
that I took and I think us to remember
the<00:01:51.780> numbers<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.320> think<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> most<00:01:53.280> number<00:01:53.790> of

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the numbers I think the most number of

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.209 
the numbers I think the most number of
items<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.689> where<00:01:55.049> were<00:01:55.439> around<00:01:55.770> one

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
items are up where were around one

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.819 
items are up where were around one
thirty<00:01:56.729> thousand<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.079> least<00:01:58.290> was<00:01:58.560> about

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
thirty thousand and the least was about

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.459 
thirty thousand and the least was about
80,000<00:01:59.820> which<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.110> look<00:02:01.380> at

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
80,000 which I think if you just look at

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
80,000 which I think if you just look at
it<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.070> think<00:02:02.579> usually<00:02:02.729> now<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.390> Elvis

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
it now I think usually now but Elvis

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.469 
it now I think usually now but Elvis
about<00:02:03.930> 400<00:02:04.409> k<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.860> average<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.240> goes<00:02:06.390> to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
about 400 k the average so just goes to

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.389 
about 400 k the average so just goes to
show<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.689> how<00:02:06.869> much<00:02:06.930> fifa<00:02:07.290> 12<00:02:07.590> has<00:02:07.860> wronged

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
show you how much fifa 12 has wronged

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.139 
show you how much fifa 12 has wronged
and<00:02:08.429> ultimately<00:02:08.910> has<00:02:09.179> grown

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
and ultimately has grown

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.720 
and ultimately has grown
and<00:02:10.299> its<00:02:10.599> best<00:02:10.810> year<00:02:11.220> anyway<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.430> said<00:02:12.549> I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and its best year anyway like I said I

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.059 
and its best year anyway like I said I
think<00:02:12.939> it<00:02:13.000> was<00:02:13.060> 80,000<00:02:13.720> released<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.319> at<00:02:14.920> that

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
think it was 80,000 released and at that

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.509 
think it was 80,000 released and at that
time<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:15.519> was<00:02:15.790> 6am<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:17.110> my<00:02:17.230> time<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:18.189> tender

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
time it was 6am for my time the tender

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.850 
time it was 6am for my time the tender
there<00:02:18.730> was<00:02:18.909> the<00:02:19.180> least<00:02:19.329> amount<00:02:19.599> of<00:02:19.720> items<00:02:19.870> so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
there was the least amount of items so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.360 
there was the least amount of items so
basically<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.340> was<00:02:21.489> like<00:02:21.730> okay<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.299> 6am<00:02:22.930> so

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
basically I was like okay so 6am so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.220 
basically I was like okay so 6am so

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
he actually never happened because I

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.809 
he actually never happened because I
just<00:02:41.200> didn't<00:02:41.620> want<00:02:41.799> to<00:02:41.829> wake<00:02:42.010> up<00:02:42.190> at<00:02:42.340> 6am<00:02:42.639> I

just didn't want to wake up at 6am I
rather<00:02:43.150> sleep<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:45.030> what<00:02:46.030> would<00:02:46.150> happen<00:02:46.329> is

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
rather sleep so what would happen is

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.089 
rather sleep so what would happen is
sometimes<00:02:47.139> I<00:02:47.230> will<00:02:47.349> stay<00:02:47.500> up<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.799> little<00:02:47.950> bit

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099

the<00:03:30.280> most<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.639> that<00:03:30.879> so<00:03:31.239> I'm<00:03:31.780> trying<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:32.139> say<00:03:32.319> is

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
the most of that so I'm trying to say is

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.129 
the most of that so I'm trying to say is
like<00:03:32.889> if<00:03:33.190> you<00:03:33.699> have<00:03:34.150> time<00:03:34.389> maybe<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.870> little<00:03:34.989> bit

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
like if you have time maybe a little bit

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.199 
like if you have time maybe a little bit
later<00:03:35.290> at<00:03:35.500> night<00:03:35.680> like<00:03:35.919> i<00:03:36.069> do<00:03:36.129> then<00:03:36.849> definitely

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
later at night like i do then definitely

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.719 
later at night like i do then definitely
you're<00:03:37.510> going<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.810> look<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:39.400> improve<00:03:39.699> your

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:39.729 
you're going to look to to improve your

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:43.140 
you're going to look to to improve your
bidding<00:03:40.859> techniques<00:03:41.859> because<00:03:42.579> that's<00:03:42.760> what's

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
bidding techniques because that's what's

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.569 
bidding techniques because that's what's
going<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.479> work<00:03:43.510> out<00:03:43.810> better<00:03:44.250> do<00:03:45.250> related

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
going to work out better do related

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.180 
going to work out better do related
matter<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.030> there's<00:03:46.180> less<00:03:46.359> people<00:03:46.690> on<00:03:46.840> but<00:03:47.799> if

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
matter and there's less people on but if

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.520 
matter and there's less people on but if
on<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.370> other<00:03:48.489> hand<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.900> only<00:03:50.049> have<00:03:50.290> our

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
on the other hand you only have our

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.530 
on the other hand you only have our
sometimes<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:51.579> ray<00:03:51.760> doing<00:03:52.060> like<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.389> video

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
sometimes it's ray doing like the video

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.349 
sometimes it's ray doing like the video
of<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.750> day<00:03:52.959> on<00:03:53.260> our<00:03:54.010> far<00:03:54.519> on<00:03:54.819> high<00:03:55.060> traffic

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
of the day on our far on high traffic

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.819 
of the day on our far on high traffic
areas<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:56.220> traffic<00:03:57.220> times<00:03:58.169> then<00:03:59.169> I<00:03:59.290> might<00:03:59.620> want

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
areas I traffic times then I might want

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.379 
areas I traffic times then I might want
to<00:03:59.949> look<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.370> doing<00:04:00.609> maybe<00:04:00.849> something<00:04:01.269> like

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
to look to doing maybe something like

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.180 
to look to doing maybe something like
this<00:04:01.510> tonight<00:04:01.780> technique<00:04:02.260> maybe<00:04:02.889> something

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
this tonight technique maybe something

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.219 
this tonight technique maybe something
like<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.549> I<00:04:03.819> mean<00:04:04.299> a<00:04:04.449> little<00:04:04.599> bit<00:04:04.690> depends<00:04:05.109> on

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
like that I mean a little bit depends on

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.379 
like that I mean a little bit depends on
your<00:04:05.590> personality<00:04:05.949> and<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.400> got<00:04:06.579> erself<00:04:06.879> you

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
feel comfortable with teen trading I

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.309

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
mean me personally if enough even if I'm

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.569 
mean me personally if enough even if I'm
going<00:04:11.500> straight<00:04:11.829> in<00:04:11.979> the<00:04:12.069> middle<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.459> day

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
going straight in the middle of the day

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.599 
going straight in the middle of the day
I<00:04:12.930> just<00:04:13.930> don't<00:04:14.379> have<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.650> patience<00:04:15.099> to<00:04:15.190> sit<00:04:15.340> on

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
I just don't have the patience to sit on

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.360 
I just don't have the patience to sit on
59<00:04:16.150> minutes<00:04:16.539> waiting<00:04:17.409> for<00:04:17.560> deals<00:04:17.889> but<00:04:18.159> maybe

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
59 minutes waiting for deals but maybe

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.709 
59 minutes waiting for deals but maybe
there's<00:04:18.609> something<00:04:18.849> that<00:04:19.180> you're

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:19.719 
there's something that you're

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.290 
there's something that you're
comfortable<00:04:19.959> doing<00:04:20.260> so<00:04:20.769> by<00:04:20.979> all<00:04:21.099> means<00:04:21.270> go<00:04:22.270> for

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
comfortable doing so by all means go for

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.940 
comfortable doing so by all means go for
it

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
it

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.320 
it
so<00:04:24.950> to<00:04:25.010> close<00:04:25.400> up<00:04:25.610> here<00:04:25.820> when<00:04:25.940> I'm<00:04:26.060> trying<00:04:26.240> to

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
so to close up here when I'm trying to

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330 
so to close up here when I'm trying to
tell<00:04:26.510> you<00:04:26.570> guys<00:04:26.780> is<00:04:27.230> I<00:04:27.620> don't<00:04:27.740> think<00:04:27.890> there's<00:04:28.220> a

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
tell you guys is I don't think there's a

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.250 
tell you guys is I don't think there's a
best<00:04:28.550> time<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.940> trade<00:04:29.240> I<00:04:29.480> think<00:04:29.960> there's<00:04:30.110> our

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
best time to trade I think there's our

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.500 
best time to trade I think there's our
best<00:04:30.500> times<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:31.010> do<00:04:31.190> certain<00:04:31.490> different<00:04:32.300> types

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
best times to do certain different types

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.920 
best times to do certain different types
of<00:04:32.690> techniques<00:04:33.370> so<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:35.120> course<00:04:35.420> if<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:35.750> like

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
of techniques so of course if you like

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170 
of techniques so of course if you like
doing<00:04:36.260> open<00:04:36.530> beats<00:04:36.710> then<00:04:37.250> try<00:04:37.670> going<00:04:37.910> a<00:04:38.030> little

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
doing open beats then try going a little

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.910 
doing open beats then try going a little
bit<00:04:38.300> later<00:04:38.510> at<00:04:38.690> night<00:04:38.870> you<00:04:39.380> will<00:04:39.470> be<00:04:39.650> easier

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
bit later at night you will be easier

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.670 
bit later at night you will be easier
there<00:04:40.070> will<00:04:40.160> be<00:04:40.250> less<00:04:40.430> competition<00:04:40.930> but<00:04:41.930> you

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
there will be less competition but you

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.080 
there will be less competition but you
really<00:04:42.860> in<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.370> end<00:04:43.400> they<00:04:43.640> just<00:04:43.820> gonna<00:04:43.970> have

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
really in the end they just gonna have

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.390 
really in the end they just gonna have
to<00:04:44.210> adapt<00:04:44.450> to<00:04:44.720> whatever<00:04:45.050> time<00:04:45.440> you<00:04:45.470> have<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:46.190> I

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
to adapt to whatever time you have and I

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.800 
to adapt to whatever time you have and I
mean<00:04:46.580> all<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:47.030> techniques<00:04:47.420> are<00:04:47.570> all<00:04:47.690> the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
mean all the techniques are all the

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.900 
mean all the techniques are all the
stuff<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.230> like<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.650> trade<00:04:48.950> I<00:04:49.250> mean<00:04:49.700> maybe

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
stuff that I like to trade I mean maybe

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.780 
stuff that I like to trade I mean maybe
if<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.180> had<00:04:50.300> another<00:04:50.660> time<00:04:50.960> diff<00:04:51.550> available<00:04:52.550> I

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
if I had another time diff available I

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.400 
if I had another time diff available I
would<00:04:53.330> have<00:04:53.450> done<00:04:53.540> something<00:04:53.780> completely

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
would have done something completely

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.260 
would have done something completely
different<00:04:54.590> is<00:04:54.920> just<00:04:55.040> kind<00:04:55.400> of<00:04:55.430> stuff<00:04:55.670> that

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
different is just kind of stuff that

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.300 
different is just kind of stuff that
I've<00:04:56.930> been<00:04:57.140> experimenting<00:04:57.440> with<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.130> I<00:04:58.190> have

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
I've been experimenting with and I have

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.760 
I've been experimenting with and I have
been<00:04:58.430> working<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:59.000> now<00:04:59.960> I<00:04:59.990> completely

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770

when I start out all this stuff that I

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.040 
when I start out all this stuff that I
do<00:05:10.190> and<00:05:10.520> I'm<00:05:10.760> sort<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.360> comfortable<00:05:11.600> doing
