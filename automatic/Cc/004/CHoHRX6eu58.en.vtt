extremely<00:00:26.860> busy<00:00:27.070> day<00:00:27.520> yesterday<00:00:27.850> over<00:00:28.450> here

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
extremely busy day yesterday over here

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.429 
extremely busy day yesterday over here
at<00:00:28.780> Ben's<00:00:28.990> aquariums<00:00:29.680> I<00:00:30.090> spent<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.840> better

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
at Ben's aquariums I spent the better

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.200 
at Ben's aquariums I spent the better
part<00:00:32.590> of<00:00:33.100> like<00:00:33.730> four<00:00:34.300> hours<00:00:35.910> insulating<00:00:36.910> my

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
part of like four hours insulating my

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.140 
part of like four hours insulating my
fish<00:00:37.570> tanks<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.550> basically<00:00:40.120> this<00:00:40.420> was<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
fish tanks and basically this was to

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.390 
fish tanks and basically this was to
reduce<00:00:43.150> the<00:00:43.450> amount<00:00:43.629> of<00:00:43.840> time<00:00:44.830> that<00:00:44.860> the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
reduce the amount of time that the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.140 
reduce the amount of time that the
heaters<00:00:45.820> run<00:00:46.770> which<00:00:47.770> then<00:00:48.190> in<00:00:48.400> turn<00:00:48.430> saves

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
heaters run which then in turn saves

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.780 
heaters run which then in turn saves
money<00:00:49.629> on<00:00:49.780> electricity<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.550> what<00:00:52.449> I<00:00:52.480> did<00:00:52.600> was

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
money on electricity so what I did was

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.500 
money on electricity so what I did was
for<00:00:54.790> example<00:00:55.210> this<00:00:55.840> tank<00:00:56.940> was<00:00:57.940> running<00:00:58.390> at

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
for example this tank was running at

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.939 
for example this tank was running at
about<00:00:58.600> 78<00:00:59.530> degrees<00:00:59.909> no<00:01:00.909> insulation<00:01:01.949> space

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
about 78 degrees no insulation space

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.660 
about 78 degrees no insulation space
this<00:01:03.280> big<00:01:03.309> in<00:01:03.729> between<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.150> two<00:01:04.330> tanks<00:01:04.570> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
this big in between the two tanks and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.600 
this big in between the two tanks and
what<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:06.700> did<00:01:07.000> was<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.420> bought<00:01:07.659> some<00:01:08.080> styrofoam

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
what I did was I bought some styrofoam

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.280 
what I did was I bought some styrofoam
inch<00:01:09.610> thick<00:01:10.150> styrofoam<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:13.240> covered<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.110> in

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
inch thick styrofoam and I covered it in

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.210 
inch thick styrofoam and I covered it in
black<00:01:14.650> plastic<00:01:16.229> yeah<00:01:17.229> black<00:01:17.530> plastic<00:01:17.770> and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
black plastic yeah black plastic and

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.910 
black plastic yeah black plastic and
then<00:01:18.970> I<00:01:19.210> duct-taped<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.650> is<00:01:20.770> those

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
then I duct-taped it so this is those

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.950 
then I duct-taped it so this is those
duct<00:01:21.159> tape<00:01:21.370> here<00:01:21.610> holding<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.120> and<00:01:22.299> then<00:01:22.900> I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
duct tape here holding it and then I

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.190 
duct tape here holding it and then I
just<00:01:23.229> put<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.619> onto<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:24.040> side<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.460> tank

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
just put it onto the side of the tank

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.780 
just put it onto the side of the tank
duct-taped<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.500> there<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.130> then<00:01:27.549> there's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
duct-taped it there and then there's

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.580 
duct-taped it there and then there's
some<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:29.200> there<00:01:29.229> on<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.830> back<00:01:30.100> as<00:01:30.370> well<00:01:30.400> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
some back there on the back as well and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.240 
some back there on the back as well and
then<00:01:34.200> there's<00:01:35.200> some<00:01:35.470> in<00:01:35.620> between<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.070> two

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
then there's some in between the two

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.980 
then there's some in between the two
tanks<00:01:36.700> here<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.010> tank<00:01:39.280> went<00:01:40.030> from<00:01:40.210> 74

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
tanks here and so the tank went from 74

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:49.499 
tanks here and so the tank went from 74
degrees<00:01:41.760> up<00:01:42.760> to

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.940 

seventy<00:01:50.820> eighty<00:01:51.820> four<00:01:52.329> degrees<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.469> jumped

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
seventy eighty four degrees so it jumped

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.940 
seventy eighty four degrees so it jumped
six<00:01:54.430> degrees<00:01:55.360> just<00:01:55.950> from<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.039> insulation<00:01:57.789> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
six degrees just from the insulation so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.190 
six degrees just from the insulation so
that<00:01:59.950> means<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.549> I<00:02:00.610> can<00:02:00.850> then<00:02:01.030> turn<00:02:01.509> down<00:02:01.869> my

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
that means that I can then turn down my

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.100 
that means that I can then turn down my
heater<00:02:03.479> which<00:02:04.479> is<00:02:04.600> going<00:02:04.719> to<00:02:04.780> save<00:02:04.960> me

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
heater which is going to save me

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.679 
heater which is going to save me
electricity<00:02:06.119> which<00:02:07.119> is<00:02:07.210> going<00:02:07.329> to<00:02:07.420> save<00:02:07.569> me

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
electricity which is going to save me

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.850 
electricity which is going to save me
money<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:09.300> basically<00:02:10.300> what<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.230> insulation

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
money so basically what the insulation

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.580 
money so basically what the insulation
does<00:02:12.099> is<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:13.120> keeps<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.840> air<00:02:14.260> from

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
does is it keeps the air from

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.570 
does is it keeps the air from
circulating<00:02:15.310> around<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.269> cooling<00:02:16.720> off<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
circulating around and cooling off the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.940 
circulating around and cooling off the
water

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.089 

so<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.490> did<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.240> tank<00:02:22.920> with<00:02:23.920> this

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
so I did that with this tank with this

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.600 
so I did that with this tank with this
tank<00:02:24.400> styrofoam<00:02:25.270> here<00:02:25.830> coated<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:26.950> plastic<00:02:27.489> to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
tank styrofoam here coated in plastic to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.449 
tank styrofoam here coated in plastic to
keep<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:28.030> waterproof<00:02:28.950> duct<00:02:29.950> taped<00:02:30.330> up<00:02:31.330> there

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
keep it waterproof duct taped up there

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:40.650 
keep it waterproof duct taped up there
and<00:02:34.260> then<00:02:36.690> styrofoam<00:02:37.690> on<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.989> back<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:39.660> start

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
and then styrofoam on the back to start

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.880 
and then styrofoam on the back to start
from<00:02:41.080> here

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
from here

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.180 
from here
styrofoam<00:02:42.250> there<00:02:43.770> styrofoam<00:02:44.770> in<00:02:44.890> between

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
styrofoam there styrofoam in between

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.580 
styrofoam there styrofoam in between
these<00:02:45.400> two<00:02:45.640> tanks<00:02:46.150> styrofoam<00:02:46.959> on<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.170> back<00:02:47.410> of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
the tank as you can see is black now it

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.120 
the tank as you can see is black now it
doesn't<00:02:50.170> have<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.500> fish<00:02:51.599> fake<00:02:52.599> fish<00:02:53.590> fake

this thing flips up styrofoam on this
side<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:01.840> tank<00:03:02.140> jumped<00:03:03.130> from<00:03:03.430> 78<00:03:04.330> up<00:03:04.600> to

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
side and this tank jumped from 78 up to

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
side and this tank jumped from 78 up to
80<00:03:04.959> 80<00:03:05.830> 82<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:07.840> tank

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
wall cut around for the filters and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.920 
wall cut around for the filters and
slows<00:03:18.340> excess<00:03:18.910> styrofoam<00:03:19.480> so<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> made<00:03:19.900> a

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
slows excess styrofoam so I made a

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.009 
slows excess styrofoam so I made a
styrofoam<00:03:20.380> lid<00:03:20.590> here<00:03:21.330> styrofoam<00:03:22.330> here<00:03:22.810> and

most energy suckers on here are the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.030 
most energy suckers on here are the
heaters<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:09.500> hopefully<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.710> going<00:04:10.950> to

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040

going<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:40.680> happen<00:04:40.830> they're<00:04:41.700> going<00:04:41.820> to<00:04:41.880> use

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
going to happen they're going to use

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.210 
going to happen they're going to use
electricity<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.630> save<00:04:42.870> me<00:04:43.020> money<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.500> two
