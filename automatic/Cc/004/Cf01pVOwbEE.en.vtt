 and verón is located in the municipality of 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.400
 rioverde san luis potosí in the ejido el 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.699
 boar approximately 130 km from the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.910
 capital of the state of san luis potosí is 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.269
 a lagoon of both geothermal oscillate 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.429
 Water temperatures between 26 and 30 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.099
 degrees Celsius all year long because it is 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:33.400
 a unique ecosystem for its 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:36.399
 characteristics in some as there 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.260
 much we are doing flowing from the 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:44.129
 bottom of the lagoon turn 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.690
 colors very very crystal blue waters 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.210
 very nice 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.629
 very characteristic of the place 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.180
 fish species predominate 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.610
 there are three species that are endemic to 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.670
 she's alone 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.800
 nowhere in the world does it exist except 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.980
 this type of your systems 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.970
 people come from all over the world 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.970
 Norway 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.530
 two 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.560
 to shoot the photograph and follow the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.689
 life tracking of these fish 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.580
 because they are particular and why not 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.730
 they exist here 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.130
 curiously the lagoon one of the 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.930
 great importance is that they have been made 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.720
 archaeological finds 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.380
 of great importance were made 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.680
 findings of a prehispanic culture 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.200
 of the year 650 after Christ in the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.040
 culture for me and they made pots of 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.610
 mud and arrowhead crimes 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.280
 obsidian and deposited to the lagoon as 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.860
 a kind of offering became a 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.390
 very particular and very important finding 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.270
 what was 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.570
 the maxilla of a head of 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.929
 mammoth as well as his bones some bones 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.429
 and the fangs the most interesting thing is 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.240
 that were found under the water 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:17.060
 diving at a depth of 18 and 20 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.250
 meters deep in what now in 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.280
 the present is known as archeology 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.230
 underwater is important to take in 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.860
 account that it is a pretty ecosystem 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.930
 delicate where it is always important that 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.040
 the people use them know that it is a 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.579
 natural area 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.500
 they are also protected areas that's why 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.170
 How good people should recognize that it is 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.870
 a place that you can visit him know them 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.609
 but you have to respect it so that 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.500
 than all the other generations that 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.739
 come, you can have the opportunity to 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.739
 do
