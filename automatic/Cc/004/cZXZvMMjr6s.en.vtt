00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.140
 good evening everyone I wanted to do you a 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.660
 little video today to make you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.220
 see the speed of recovery by large 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.510
 tides so here today is the 22 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.759
 January is tied with 109 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.740
 I am on the northeastern tip of the big 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.289
 bay the mother is going back up 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.550
 so this is going to happen have they 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.380
 rock this line will be immersed 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.470
 very quickly and the whole area 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.960
 behind me is flat it's going to go very 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.529
 very quickly so much in voiceover 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.859
 she's getting ready to go there and for 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.680
 the moment the seaweed does not move and that 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.899
 there is they arrive it was really worth 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
 very quickly there we are in the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.719
 third hour of blur the beginner 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.649
 the third hour of show at the moment 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.170
 the coast is currently 3 meters 50 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:52.440
 so the speed of ascent of the pond 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.680
 and amplifies and try and starts to 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:02.250
 to flow there she already goes to the end it goes 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.530
 to be long very spectacular but for 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.530
 the moment we have seaweed do not shower here 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:23.760
 and the flow will soon be reversed on 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 and she started 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.410
 we will not be slow to reverse 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.860
 was trying the stream is in the process of 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.670
 reverse 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.670
 look 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.940
 yes she changes direction that it 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:56.159
 begins to sink clearly and that's it 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.159
 she goes away so here it goes 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:08.470
 yes it'll be really impressive 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:11.160
 we have a real dump but the speed 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.160
 that's it's gone 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:28.530
 current seemed so fast nor the speed to 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.530
 which she comes back to 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.210
 it's really once this 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.580
 barrier the rock there is going to be beautiful 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:46.250
 it's wonderful that it's going to be very 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:49.910
 quickly on the area the flat area see that 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.910
 starts pushing anyway 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.880
 it goes up very fast 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.720
 there is nothing 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.700
 begin to advance on the platter there 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.700
 that's it 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:40.209
 spectacular in this sport with the little 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:42.299
 and to the longer more impressive it is 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.349
 truly when she will get there 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.780
 it's rock in the middle of the screen that 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.980
 it's a little bit in vat is so a 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.980
 continuous progression 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.540
 but I have a lot of water we would do 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:14.489
 soiled these particles and she sinks the 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.489
 whose lan is ahead 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:41.250
 it's impressive jm I'm 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:43.020
 now send there this angle there the 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.180
 see taking spectacular levels 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.960
 what we are a little bit in decline is 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:52.410
 there see my votes 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:55.520
 there is no water look well the 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.520
 speed she comes back to 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.840
 and speed look good 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.659
 we have ten centimeters already spectacular 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.140
 I still remember that I jump from 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.140
 47 years so to scale you 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.440
 12 cm is really the first wave 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.520
 since it's in a bowl that puts 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.520
 a lot of water but no less 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.440
 to enter very fast see that's it 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.760
 the platier completely sunk yes he 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.640
 do not be sure surrounded since that's it 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:09.910
 badly she is progressing very quickly and by all 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:12.220
 well there is 20 cm the group royer lo 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.160
 for this this little dish thiel enough 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.850
 spectacular see he enjoyed nine 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:26.470
 there are 30 cm to people no I'm flowing in 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:28.150
 the east and Germans to push that the 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.370
 few things and we are not friends marc 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.730
 ayrault no we start the third hour 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.730
 blur 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.670
 so on a larger scale we see this 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:50.440
 that it can give particular think 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:53.300
 michel for example this rock have 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.160
 imagined kz3 a sandbar facing 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.290
 several hundred meters from 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.450
 length and width 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.860
 the water goes from elsewhere will first forgive 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.840
 invade the lower parts of the foreshore 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.020
 and we can be completely 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.700
 isolated as on an island 1 and of course and 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.630
 well he will find himself 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.630
 quickly under the fleet 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:25.120
 she is coming very fast now 

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:34.050
 there it is 5:15 pm and in half an hour 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:38.999
 this whole area will be under water the 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:41.699
 granby pass will be submerged it's 

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:43.390
 always spectacular to see that this 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:46.990
 power 

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:50.790
 we go where I was with my botia there is a 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.790
 big of a rebound to put me already 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.980
 so here for this little video thank you
