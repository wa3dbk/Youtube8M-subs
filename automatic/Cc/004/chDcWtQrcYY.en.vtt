video in the video I'm actually making
it<00:00:43.280> look<00:00:43.519> a<00:00:43.640> little<00:00:43.730> bit<00:00:43.910> more<00:00:44.000> difficult<00:00:44.510> than

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
it look a little bit more difficult than

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.049 
it look a little bit more difficult than
it<00:00:44.720> actually<00:00:44.870> is<00:00:45.350> just<00:00:45.879> because<00:00:46.879> it's

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
it actually is just because it's

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.479 
it actually is just because it's
difficult<00:00:47.269> to<00:00:47.690> hold<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.170> drum<00:00:48.440> turn<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.220> knob

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
difficult to hold the drum turn the knob

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.149 
difficult to hold the drum turn the knob
and<00:00:49.760> drop<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.330> rounds<00:00:50.629> in<00:00:50.780> we<00:00:51.440> found<00:00:51.650> that<00:00:52.010> the

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
and drop the rounds in we found that the

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.729 
and drop the rounds in we found that the
easiest<00:00:52.430> way<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.670> load<00:00:52.970> it<00:00:53.120> is<00:00:53.269> to<00:00:53.720> put<00:00:54.710> the

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
easiest way to load it is to put the

there's a series of four holes that when

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.760 
there's a series of four holes that when
there<00:01:32.300> are<00:01:32.330> rounds<00:01:32.600> in<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.170> drum<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.530> can<00:01:33.650> see

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
there are rounds in the drum you can see

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.650 
there are rounds in the drum you can see
the<00:01:33.890> brass<00:01:34.150> showing<00:01:35.150> through<00:01:35.300> those<00:01:35.420> four

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
the brass showing through those four

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.710 
the brass showing through those four
holes<00:01:35.900> as<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:37.100> approach<00:01:37.910> to<00:01:38.240> running<00:01:38.540> out<00:01:38.690> of

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
holes as you approach to running out of

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.800 
holes as you approach to running out of
ammunition<00:01:39.670> those<00:01:40.670> holes<00:01:41.000> turn<00:01:41.240> black<00:01:41.480> and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
ammunition those holes turn black and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.300 
ammunition those holes turn black and
then<00:01:41.900> to<00:01:42.050> red<00:01:42.230> this<00:01:42.440> is<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.560> red<00:01:42.800> follower<00:01:43.190> that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
then to red this is a red follower that

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.550 
then to red this is a red follower that
follows<00:01:43.730> us<00:01:43.909> around<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.870> it's<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.140> early

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
follows us around so it's a early

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.600 
follows us around so it's a early
indicator<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.040> you're<00:01:46.190> about<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.370> run<00:01:46.490> out

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
indicator that you're about to run out

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.940 
indicator that you're about to run out
of<00:01:46.670> ammunition
