I'd<00:05:04.030> recommend<00:05:04.450> trying<00:05:04.630> it<00:05:04.750> out<00:05:04.900> really

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
I'd recommend trying it out really

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.600 
I'd recommend trying it out really
because<00:05:05.680> if<00:05:05.830> you've<00:05:05.950> ever<00:05:06.010> done<00:05:06.250> mercury

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
because if you've ever done mercury

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.900 
because if you've ever done mercury
fillings<00:05:06.910> I've<00:05:07.090> warned<00:05:07.950> or<00:05:08.950> just<00:05:09.430> general

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
fillings I've warned or just general

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.730 
fillings I've warned or just general
pollution<00:05:10.390> in<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.750> water<00:05:10.930> like<00:05:11.380> this<00:05:11.530> like

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
pollution in the water like this like

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.990 
pollution in the water like this like
all<00:05:11.890> sorts<00:05:12.100> of<00:05:12.250> like<00:05:12.370> heavy<00:05:12.550> methods<00:05:12.880> in<00:05:12.940> the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
all sorts of like heavy methods in the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.370 
all sorts of like heavy methods in the
tap<00:05:13.150> water<00:05:13.360> if<00:05:13.540> you've<00:05:13.660> ever<00:05:13.780> been<00:05:13.930> having<00:05:14.200> tap

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
tap water if you've ever been having tap

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.770 
tap water if you've ever been having tap
water<00:05:14.650> just<00:05:14.920> even<00:05:15.190> in<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.340> air<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:15.910> do<00:05:16.690> you

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
water just even in the air and do you

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.450 
water just even in the air and do you
know<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:19.320> Z<00:05:20.320> lights<00:05:20.590> are<00:05:20.710> being<00:05:20.890> used<00:05:21.130> just

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
know that Z lights are being used just

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.390 
know that Z lights are being used just
to<00:05:22.150> take<00:05:22.840> for<00:05:23.170> radiation<00:05:23.650> protection<00:05:23.860> it

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
to take for radiation protection it

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.340 
to take for radiation protection it
helps<00:05:24.700> so<00:05:24.880> get<00:05:25.090> radioactive<00:05:25.720> particles<00:05:26.200> from

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
helps so get radioactive particles from

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.830 
helps so get radioactive particles from
a<00:05:26.440> polity<00:05:26.890> which<00:05:27.100> are<00:05:27.220> very<00:05:27.400> disruptive<00:05:27.840> it's

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
a polity which are very disruptive it's

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.520 
a polity which are very disruptive it's
been<00:05:29.050> used

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
been used

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.650 
been used
hopefully<00:05:30.460> in<00:05:30.580> Chernobyl<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.240> think<00:05:31.450> in

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
hopefully in Chernobyl I think in

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.630 
hopefully in Chernobyl I think in
radioactive<00:05:32.440> waste<00:05:32.680> grounds<00:05:33.130> when<00:05:33.520> you're

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
radioactive waste grounds when you're

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.370 
radioactive waste grounds when you're
dumping<00:05:33.940> radioactive<00:05:34.510> waste<00:05:34.690> they<00:05:34.990> often

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
dumping radioactive waste they often

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.810 
dumping radioactive waste they often
like<00:05:35.560> cover<00:05:35.830> covered<00:05:36.790> in<00:05:36.940> zeolites<00:05:38.730> for<00:05:39.730> the

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
like cover covered in zeolites for the

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.780 
like cover covered in zeolites for the
reasons<00:05:40.180> I'm<00:05:40.270> telling<00:05:40.600> so<00:05:41.140> they're<00:05:41.590> not<00:05:41.860> they

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
reasons I'm telling so they're not they

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.630 
reasons I'm telling so they're not they
are<00:05:42.910> really<00:05:43.510> a<00:05:43.540> very<00:05:43.840> strong<00:05:43.990> real<00:05:44.890> and<00:05:45.250> potent
