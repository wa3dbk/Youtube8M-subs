00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:29.509

 but effective because prices are low 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.000
 for his fixed price estimate 110 euros the room 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.810
 the rest is interesting because nothing is less certain of this 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.870
 nasty treasure surrounded by a forest world 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.800

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.750
 stormy atmosphere and sailing in places

 the director of mercedes 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.910
 the club will make everyone 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.460
 because he was restless 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.830
 we can watch it for hours all under control what gave 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.650
 all I think it's an illness 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.690
 some reminders 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.630
 and the restaurant the bank for their support besides applied more than 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 perfect that is to say a little 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 it must embark on the bill taken into account 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.790
 so we want to go back and walk around and especially we have 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.200
 look forward to arriving as to the final destination of his sentence no doubt 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.999
 alinghi before going to the case that made the Loire 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.689
 when I arrived I realized that it was the same thing to say because it is a 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.360
 lack situation 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.590
 Bédié in the history of the flyer that tells all this very very well 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.820
 nearly a dozen second homes heaven is not bad of 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.910
 all is well we walk in the streets they stand well in the streets 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.790
 is that they are planned to spread on the ankles this project 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.260
 North 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.360
 at least we can watch the shapes prevents the postcards it's under 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.180
 which is hiding a statement 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.630
 is not that annoying that the scudetto gold we like not too heavy but 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.230
 not too touristy we breathe a tune in different ways not been too much 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.620
 breathed narcotics and we all end up at the coffee shop not only because 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.809
 that the basic education system 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.319
 that's as good as I watched it too hot heated debate that 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.159
 dragged 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.529
 and that's part of the provincial city a way to be part of 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.549
 inhabitants 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.250

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.189
 we just went through 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.329

 a famous singer in the usa when we know that it will always be 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.379
 it was unlicensed 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.909
 peillon continues especially 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.209
 in concert at a restaurant at lunch time 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.230
 from Tuesday to Friday because these two days of walking was first and foremost beliefs 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.819

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.309
 cheese 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:06.309
 which means that one of the market I proposed to 24 euros after 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.329
 month of struggle 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.099

 and for this restaurant the sole judge 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.739
 located in the financial journal 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.769

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.769
