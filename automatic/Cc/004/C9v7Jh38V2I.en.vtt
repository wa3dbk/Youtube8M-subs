by<00:00:11.210> heart<00:00:11.509> you<00:00:12.410> can<00:00:12.589> just<00:00:12.830> take<00:00:13.129> three<00:00:13.639> four

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
by heart you can just take three four

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.000 
by heart you can just take three four
moves<00:00:14.179> and<00:00:14.599> combine<00:00:15.379> them<00:00:15.589> in<00:00:15.769> a<00:00:15.860> beautiful

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
moves and combine them in a beautiful

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.940 
moves and combine them in a beautiful
way<00:00:16.490> and<00:00:16.850> maybe<00:00:17.630> you<00:00:17.840> will<00:00:17.960> accumulate<00:00:18.380> a<00:00:18.590> few

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
way and maybe you will accumulate a few

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.080 
way and maybe you will accumulate a few
of<00:00:19.070> these<00:00:19.250> combinations<00:00:19.660> then<00:00:20.660> you<00:00:21.170> can<00:00:21.380> dance

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
of these combinations then you can dance

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.220 
of these combinations then you can dance
improvisationally<00:00:23.120> from<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.720> very<00:00:23.930> first

improvisationally from the very first
steps<00:00:24.620> and<00:00:25.150> because<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:26.300> don't<00:00:26.570> repeat<00:00:27.020> the

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
steps and because you don't repeat the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.830 
steps and because you don't repeat the
most<00:00:27.440> you<00:00:27.890> repeat<00:00:28.190> combinations<00:00:29.090> you'll<00:00:29.660> look

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
most you repeat combinations you'll look

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.489 
before or after a triplet for instance
you<00:02:01.130> can<00:02:01.340> make<00:02:01.609> one<00:02:02.209> set<00:02:02.599> of<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:03.079> steps

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:03.499 
you can make one set of the steps

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.309 
you can make one set of the steps
diagonally<00:02:04.369> if<00:02:04.579> I<00:02:05.060> start<00:02:05.419> with<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.779> foot<00:02:06.109> I
