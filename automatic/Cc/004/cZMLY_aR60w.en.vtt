00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.529
 All right 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.629
 [Music] 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.119
 I'll teach you how to be temperate. 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.250
 We'll start by putting the steaks. 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.350
 within itself the bag these here 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.190
 own complete food that comes in the 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.290
 roll is any serve and sanitized 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.330
 you can put a hole in the hole 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.070
 You put the animals in here that 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.110
 has 600 grams 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.830
 this amount of seasoning can make 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.370
 of 6 and 500 to 700 grams 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.140
 then they are more or less 6 to 8 to 10 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.050
 billion depending on the size of your 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.810
 book is that I 'm using bebi to stay 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.670
 of the rump is not in the early 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.170
 Contrary to what everyone thinks but 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.390
 You can choose meat that you 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.550
 prefer the ones at the same time whole 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.489
 We're going to make a little sauce I have. 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.079
 here half a tablespoon of mustard 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.239
 Let's not know even more strongly about 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.219
 herbs but you can wear a mask that 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.239
 You wish it could be the one from hot 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.620
 dog 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.930
 Then I'll add three tablespoons 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.579
 I found this colleague here three tablespoons of 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.530
 soya sauce soy sauce you 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:17.270
 very full spoon can not be scooped 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.409
 Shallow even 10 tablespoons of sauce 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.929
 of soybeans 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.490
 I'll also add a spoonful of 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:25.520
 olive oil soup 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.529
 you can add oil in place of the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.560
 olive oil is actually olive oil when 

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:33.709
 heated it loses properties then 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.539
 the function of himself here is from moisture to 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:37.219
 meat does not let it then dries 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.700
 may be soybean oil 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:43.159
 and then I'll also use half a spoon of 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.020
 more or less salt coffee 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.729
 quantity here 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.299
 I'll put the garlic here and I'll use this here. 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.399
 that you buy industrialized already 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.740
 crushed but you can crush one 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.299
 add garlic and add then I'll 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.859
 use an amount equivalent to more than 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.499
 or less a tooth of water there 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.599
 pepper to taste very much 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:10.990
 Pepper of the kingdom that I like right now 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.890
 with salt and pepper 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.620
 and to finish 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.020
 a spoon, no problem, it's just water 3 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.760
 tablespoons of water that is needed 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.450
 time to get more fluid 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.450
 liquid 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:33.450
 3 we will mix and blend has 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.100
 problem is the mustard gumbo 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.450
 Why were we supposed to play in the flesh? 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.150
 to handle it will come undone 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.160
 on here 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.250
 Of course he has oil and water so will 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.650
 an emotion so homogeneous but now 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.800
 I want to get in the face and everything goes mixed 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.430
 then I'll get my bag with 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.430
 beef 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:11.280
 I'll throw in here and there'll tie 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.290
 They will handle why not serve 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.620
 can be fine-tuned at that time you 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.170
 they make a lot of dirt in the kitchen 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.329
 op you are announcing so that you ask well 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.720
 all the pieces of meat 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.950
 you do not get the dish on the soiled one 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.870
 wonderful 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.750
 ready you have your tempered meat 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.549
 It lasts up to three days in the hard refrigerator. 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.130
 until a little more but I prefer to be 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.200
 cautious then three days in the refrigerator 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.860
 for you and staying as you 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.079
 want to 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.700
 the next video will be like grilling the 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:46.040
 your steak in a way that you do not 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.040
 You need to use oil, that's it.
