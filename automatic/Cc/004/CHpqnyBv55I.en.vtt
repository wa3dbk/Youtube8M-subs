again<00:01:38.840> Lexi's<00:01:39.440> run<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.070> court<00:01:40.310> as<00:01:40.460> far<00:01:40.670> as

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
again Lexi's run to the court as far as

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.840 
again Lexi's run to the court as far as
spoil<00:01:41.390> but<00:01:41.660> I<00:01:41.990> think<00:01:42.620> that's<00:01:42.800> that's<00:01:43.340> what's

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
spoil but I think that's that's what's

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.180 
spoil but I think that's that's what's
most<00:01:44.090> beef<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:45.320> anyway<00:01:45.710> it's<00:01:45.920> not<00:01:46.010> there

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
most beef that anyway it's not there

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.500 
most beef that anyway it's not there
anymore<00:01:46.370> so<00:01:46.640> of<00:01:46.850> course<00:01:46.970> it's<00:01:47.180> not<00:01:47.330> going<00:01:47.420> to

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
anymore so of course it's not going to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.820 
anymore so of course it's not going to
sit<00:01:47.630> down<00:01:47.780> but<00:01:47.930> he's<00:01:48.080> going<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.320> continue<00:01:48.710> to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
sit down but he's going to continue to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.940 
sit down but he's going to continue to
look<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.160> you<00:01:49.460> know<00:01:49.490> see<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:51.230> so<00:01:51.560> my<00:01:51.710> job

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
look and you know see and and so my job

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.800 
look and you know see and and so my job
would<00:01:52.160> be<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.280> dictate<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:52.940> him<00:01:53.120> what<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.450> want

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
would be to dictate to him what I want

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.300 
would be to dictate to him what I want
in<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.080> search<00:01:54.290> because<00:01:55.010> if<00:01:55.130> you're<00:01:55.280> thinking

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
in the search because if you're thinking

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.890 
in the search because if you're thinking
that<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.880> bomb<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.330> going<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.600> look<00:01:56.690> like<00:01:56.840> that

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
that the bomb is going to look like that

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.150 
that the bomb is going to look like that
big<00:01:57.260> bowling<00:01:57.770> ball<00:01:58.070> with<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.370> few<00:01:58.580> seconds
