00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.139
 speak soft personality 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.080
 Today I came to do a tutorial here. 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.859
 totally different that many are so 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.720
 presenting this ps in is too much 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.340
 people are being bothered with this with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
 system error 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.029
 So today's tutorial here, you see the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.210
 skin is that this here is a dll file 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.329
 Can you see people? 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.489
 here with the right button and property 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.870
 on top of it you will see that it is a 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.540
 dll file accidentally when you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.780
 was to open some file or certain file 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.489
 for example I'll show you 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.340
 no one passes a game for example we 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.079
 It's if you notice here I have it here. 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.840
 the right dll 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.840
 have enough of all of them all 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.870
 games we pass in dll file then like 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.339
 Here it is possible to compare 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 accidentally you have seen as a 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.710
 dll file is like another type of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.040
 file and if you notice here 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.979
 System Page 122 of you will be 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.110
 as it is how corrupted here still everything 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.170
 as for example I open here to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.290
 show you how explorer is 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.330
 then all the files you have in your 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.220
 computer with dll files have been 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.740
 corrupted games programs and files 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.729
 of your system and so the staff 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.259
 you will have some errors right for tá 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.189
 running a program sometimes 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.140
 starting a game there any kind of 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.100
 problem any program whatsoever 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.630
 music is music also until music then 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.689
 to solve this problem that is well 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.390
 simple then it 's a serve 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.030
 properties and may be conferring 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.350
 and dll file may be 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.180
 catching any one we go here in the folder 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.570
 of the game or choose any game here 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.570
 same 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.520
 So, folks, the problem is that you 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.800
 I should have done it here, open it with 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.820
 to select how to open 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.250
 program there when usually 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.760
 on this flap here usually did not have 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.160

 It's already going to open there. 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.620
 as the program that you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.080
 selected and then there people who 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.410

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.620
