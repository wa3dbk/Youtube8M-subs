00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:05.000
 We'll go inside, have a good wine dinner. You can relax. 

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.000
 Don't be mad at me, but I've already eaten. 

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.000
 DINNER WITH AMANDA 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Have you already eaten ?! 

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.000
 I had a piece of cheese pie. And then another ... 

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:20.000
 You know what I'm like when I start. Before I realized it, I ate the whole cake. 

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.000
 You ate the whole cheese pie ?! 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 And then I realized, so I finished cold spaghetti from the fridge ... 

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:31.000
 ... and I finished the lobster tail, and then ... 

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.000
 GETTING TO KNOW AMANDA 

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.000
 I've been into you since we met. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Can you say I ignored you? 

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.000
 There was something like that with your empathy. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 LOVING AMANDY 

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.000
 - You think I'm fat? - I think you look amazing. 

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.000
 - You've visibly looked into me. - Yes. 

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:55.000
 I'd say totally. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I can't believe I'm in love with a smoker. 

00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.000
 LIFE WITH AMANDA 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 - Stop it. - Why? 

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.000
 I can not. 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.000
 Do you love me? 

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:06.000
 What kind of question is it just because I'm out of touch if you want to touch me? 

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.000
 I have a great idea. 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.000
 Instead of going home, let's go to the hotel. 

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.000
 - There's too much light. - The power of light? 

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:14.000
 Yeah. 

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:15.000
 So it is. 

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.000
 Take off the turtleneck, I'll take off my pants ... 

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:23.000
 I'm sorry. 

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.000
 I can not breathe. 

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:27.000
 - I need a doctor. - I don't think you need a doctor. 

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.000
 I'm checking your neck. 34 00: 01: 32,001 -&gt; 00: 00: 33,000 That doctor had a better sexual experience than I did in six months! 

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.000
 Breathe. Good. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 What to do? What am I doing? What would you do? 

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:39.000
 THIS AUTUMN 

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.000
 I think it would be good for us to be apart. 

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.000
 I am moving. 

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:45.000
 I'm back. 

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.000
 I think I have a commitment problem. 

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.000
 I can not live without you. 

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:50.000
 Did she cheat on me? 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 NOTHING LIKE LOVE 

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.000
 God Jerry, what do you think I am? 

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.000
 NOTHING ELSE 

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.000
 I slept well with the wrong one. 

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:01.000
 - I had to try if I could have sex. - And you can? 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Yeah. Good news, I can. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
