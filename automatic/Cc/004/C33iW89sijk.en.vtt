00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.199
 the objective that we talked about with possibility 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.199
 to arrive 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.889
 and colombia 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.960
 if it has not been a good region like 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.270
 America to do 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.810
 we also with the ugly duckling as 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.810
 I thought anxiety rationalize 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.300
 Brazil and Colombia and I think Venezuela 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.030
 we gave seasonal surprise 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.140
 the key to facing Colombia today 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.640
 work on laterals and avoid 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.920
 exit square from the distraction of 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.809
 the solution the sides have 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.809
 colombia its strong was for the bands 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.460
 when our jackson did not move anymore 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.440
 the cd defense yes because it came together 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.470
 the different portals to see 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.630
 we will not be solid the work of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.229
 basically what points they contain 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.310
 and since the Peruvian soccer did not return 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.540
 the same will not return 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.189
 to the position of the ball that always 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.020
 he had but everyone who had it but 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:22.050
 let's go back is also has 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.870
 renewals of young players 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.580
 we are coming out with all the desire and 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.370
 let's hope four friends overcome 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.310
 sentence what is the mind 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.720
 we are not going to pass 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.520
 in the first stage that was to classify 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.520
 We go step by step game by game 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.980
 but not 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:02:07.060
 now what are we trying to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.800
 ecological and good the colombia has 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.800
 some 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.280
 let's say that fight others in conce time 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.390
 let it be said 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.170
 I speak much d 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.209
 of the defense because 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.709
 I think we were attacked by everyone 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.630
 sides the first minutes but difficult 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.700
 for us 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.080
 little by little wealthy nations had 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.640
 much confidence arose the battles 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.640
 miral of the Canaries that they needed 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:46.740
 for what we wanted 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.000
 but we propose the result but what 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.970
 lesson of confidence would be for those who 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.970
 they keep playing well 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.370
 A) Yes 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.720
 how are we going to see if there 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.530
 of the 70 but almost uninterrupted 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.530
 good 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:33.410
 but good now comes the hardest and 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:36.410
 let's try it down at the end no 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.410
 import 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:04:01.930
 let's say we're not seeing now it's going to 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:04:04.930
 be very good relationship 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.730
 for a long time we have faced 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.099
 exhibition teammates is a 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.840
 worker another person and in this 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.840
 moment we only change shirt nothing more 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.709
 why 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.359
 but we say something that is a lot 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.359
 lets have that yes we did not
