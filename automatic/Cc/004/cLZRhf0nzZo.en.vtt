00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.470
- It's this key right?
- Ehm... nope. The other one.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.480
- The big black one? 
- Yeap.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.726
- Welcome here today.
Hmmm, today we got something really special. 

00:00:10.728 --> 00:00:13.502
- And it’s a Saab 900 from the 1981.

00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:16.292
- It's a little bit special.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.997
- We swapped the engine 
and instead of four-cylinder we putted there V engine with eight cylinders. 

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.076
- Come to look at it a little closer.

00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:32.933
- Here it is. 
The legendary Swedish Saab.

00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:52.238
- The engine is V8 from Mustang 1967. 
Four liter eight-cylinder, 350 HP, compressor. So let’s hear it.

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:41.513
- So for the first sight you can recognize 
that the car has an incredible amount of moment of force
which starts at 500 RPM. 

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.778
- That sound is so unbelievable!

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:55.499
- The exhaust is tuned by the company Acarpovic. 
It’s titan stainless steel exhaust, 
which ends at the side of the car. 

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:10.097
- FUCK YEAAAH!!!! I WANT THIS!!!!

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:15.425
- Wait a sec. Look at those people.

00:02:44.448 --> 00:02:48.563
- Fuck. What do you need more to make it louder?!

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:35.111
- This is the most porn thing I’ve ever seen!

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.573
- Okay. What should I say at the end...

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.000
... you don’t need rear wheel drive car, 
or all-wheel drive car and you definitely don’t need V8 engine. 

00:03:56.007 --> 00:04:00.466
- You just need a scumbag four-cylinder engine and rip off the exhaust.
That's all you need.
