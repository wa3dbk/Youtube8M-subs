00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.569
 or the one that has been his and js with sting or 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.399
 commented gameplay of knock down for the 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.410
 channel first of all then tell them that 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:09.969
 the rolls that I'm using can be 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.129
 find a video in previous days 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.929
 that was called thank you to kill them in 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.429
 general stealth helicopter and chess 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.170
 are streaks that really go very well in 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.210
 any game mode in any 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.369
 map also yes that is to finish some 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.720
 games of more than 40 casualties that kill you 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.369
 little and have very controlled where 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.380
 people appear because they are the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.359
 recommendations that I make you can not 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.339
 watch the video do not have many views 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.810
 but but you know they are very good and they 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.300
 can help a lot look for it in the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.500
 channel and nam going back a bit more to what 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.450
 which is the temple in your hand with the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.520
 faces I'm pretty much controlling the 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.110
 respond the enemies with them I understand 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.820
 the box to put there for example avoided 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.260
 that people can go by 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.260
 center and as you can see is going to be 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.780
 really very very very good massacres go 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.789
 to be charged to everyone who passes 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.050
 in half the scale and is a weapon that 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.670
 it goes very well at long range so 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.710
 I can control very well where they are going to 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.570
 appear enemies sectors like the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.519
 car is not change you can see 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.379
 that I'm getting all the time to 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.120
 kill the enemies to the backups 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.980
 attack those who do not want to leave because 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.180
 are afraid because they can not the 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.550
 I blame not the truth 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.110
 we are trapped and just the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.490
 furtive helicopter is something that is going to 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.020
 greatly help people who are 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.440
 remain in the back of the response 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.410
 because let's say they're going to have a way of 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.910
 knock it down and on the contrary it is going to 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.190
 control pretty well or we will leave 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.650
 leaving the agr also has its own 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.600
 utility obviously as I always say 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.880
 chivas is to catch the streaks you have to 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.470
 choose the because something is going to do 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.690
 they will interact with each other 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.880
 to say it has felt it controls the middle 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.710
 ready on this side all right the agent 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.420
 what he's going to do is take them out of the house 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.970
 in case you want to get into the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.950
 houses and the furtive coastal is the one 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.180
 is there in case you stay in the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.399
 back of the respawn then 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.560
 taking it out of the respawn is pretty 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.970
 pretty easy to understand if you're going to 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.410
 choose the streak you will always choose 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.240
 some reason when it's like for example 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.830
 what orbital the bird and the entities because 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.140
 I do not want to kill much but only 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.640
 with the weapon and the sentinel I use it 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.280
 so they can not escape me is 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.289
 basically that's why it's good advice 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.850
 it's quite useful it 's good speaking the 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.380
 more also of what will happen to the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.959
 end of the game because only 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.610
 three minutes pass and I 40 low 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.690
 that could perfectly have been a 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.450
 departure of more than 100 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.640
 110 casualties was that people started to 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.890
 leave people get out of these games 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.960
 and the funny thing is that if they can see in 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.910
 some time the players who has the 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.770
 another team were people who were 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.030
 in a clan that already have a high level and 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.740
 those who stay are people who do not 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.840
 they have a pretty high level then 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.280
 gives us to understand one thing means that 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.450
 every time you advance in a prestige 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.070
 every time you advance in level you have 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.660
 obligatorily that leave the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.730
 games to keep your radio your 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.040
 proportion or whatever it seems to me the most 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.540
 pathetic that I think seems stupid 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.340
 I'm just giving you these 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.620
 tips use these gusts use 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.720
 these weapons use this game mode and 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.120
 always think that things have to 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.010
 be united and interconnected more 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.210
 or less with each other so that we say 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.930
 that the game works pretty well 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.130
 ready 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.360
 many thanks to the new 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.980
 subscribers that are in the channel 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.390
 I appreciate truth to the old 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.040
 obviously also and they are very 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.390
 I recommend the channel like and 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.960
 favorites and until next time 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.960
 goodbye
