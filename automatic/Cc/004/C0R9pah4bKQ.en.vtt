and<00:00:47.670> pieces<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.120> pretty<00:00:48.690> tricky<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.559> at

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and pieces so pretty tricky to see at

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.350 
and pieces so pretty tricky to see at
the<00:00:49.739> moment<00:00:49.860> but<00:00:50.489> I'll<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.789> everything<00:00:51.000> out

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the moment but I'll get everything out

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
the moment but I'll get everything out
and<00:00:51.570> we'll<00:00:52.289> get<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.950> table

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and we'll get it on the table

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.910 
and we'll get it on the table
and<00:00:53.489> take<00:00:53.700> a<00:00:53.730> closer<00:00:54.090> look<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:55.530> looking<00:00:55.800> at

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and take a closer look so looking at

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.760 
and take a closer look so looking at
everything<00:00:56.190> laid<00:00:57.149> out<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:58.260> easy<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
everything laid out here it's easy to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.220 
everything laid out here it's easy to
see<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.190> concept<00:00:59.610> behind<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.180> great<00:01:00.780> plane

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
see the concept behind this great plane

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.920 
see the concept behind this great plane
or<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:02.039> fact<00:01:02.250> great<00:01:02.910> three<00:01:03.329> planes<00:01:03.660> because

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
or in fact great three planes because

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630 
or in fact great three planes because
essentially<00:01:04.710> that's<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.129> we've<00:01:05.309> got<00:01:05.489> we've

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
essentially that's what we've got we've

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.820 
essentially that's what we've got we've
got<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.970> yellow<00:01:06.149> Cessna<00:01:06.869> which<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
got the yellow Cessna which is the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.399 
got the yellow Cessna which is the
beginner<00:01:08.460> level<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> three<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:10.290> we've

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
beginner level of the three then we've

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.340 
beginner level of the three then we've
got<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> sr22<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.600> we've<00:01:12.780> got<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
got the sr22 and then we've got to the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.859 
got the sr22 and then we've got to the
Red<00:01:13.830> Bull<00:01:14.040> stunt<00:01:14.340> plane<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.600> three

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.139 
facility in the handset and this is how
you<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.049> charge<00:02:04.439> into<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.759> batteries

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
you get the charge into the batteries

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.969 
you get the charge into the batteries
before<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.630> plane<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.200> there's<00:02:07.380> no<00:02:07.590> separate

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
before the plane so there's no separate

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.190 
before the plane so there's no separate
charges<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.640> what-have-you<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.570> really

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
charges and what-have-you so really

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.160 
charges and what-have-you so really
quite<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> nifty<00:02:10.920> little<00:02:11.190> feature<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.170> also

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
quite a nifty little feature that I also

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.589 
quite a nifty little feature that I also
included<00:02:13.739> er3<00:02:15.170> replacement<00:02:16.170> propellers

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
included er3 replacement propellers

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.729 
included er3 replacement propellers
and<00:02:17.840> also<00:02:18.709> we've<00:02:19.249> got<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.790> couple<00:02:20.719> of<00:02:21.019> propeller

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
and also we've got a couple of propeller

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.699 
and also we've got a couple of propeller
shafts<00:02:22.400> included<00:02:23.239> there<00:02:23.510> just<00:02:24.079> in<00:02:24.230> case<00:02:24.469> you

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
shafts included there just in case you

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.580 
shafts included there just in case you
do<00:02:24.889> happen<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.310> have<00:02:25.670> an<00:02:25.969> accident<00:02:26.450> which<00:02:27.049> is

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
do happen to have an accident which is

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.009 
do happen to have an accident which is
taken<00:02:28.340> with<00:02:29.030> full<00:02:29.209> force<00:02:29.420> on<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.749> front<00:02:29.840> of

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
taken with full force on the front of

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.699 
taken with full force on the front of
the<00:02:30.109> plane<00:02:30.319> and<00:02:30.999> nicely<00:02:31.999> edition<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.629> this<00:02:32.840> bit

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
the plane and nicely edition of this bit

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.819 
the plane and nicely edition of this bit
of<00:02:33.739> glue<00:02:34.129> for<00:02:34.730> those<00:02:34.969> ongoing<00:02:35.599> repairs<00:02:36.200> if<00:02:36.620> you

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
of glue for those ongoing repairs if you

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.890 
of glue for those ongoing repairs if you
need<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.219> make<00:02:37.400> them<00:02:37.639> so<00:02:38.150> as<00:02:38.420> an<00:02:38.569> overall

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
need to make them so as an overall

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.629 
need to make them so as an overall
package<00:02:39.230> everything<00:02:40.189> that<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.459> could

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
package everything that you could

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.569 
package everything that you could
possibly<00:02:41.090> need<00:02:41.359> to<00:02:42.290> get<00:02:42.469> up<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.769> flying<00:02:43.189> and

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
possibly need to get up and flying and

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.069 
possibly need to get up and flying and
learning<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.120> building<00:02:44.510> your<00:02:44.599> confidence

and<00:02:45.230> having<00:02:45.409> fun<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.999> included<00:02:46.999> so<00:02:47.900> let's

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
and having fun is included so let's

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.229 
and having fun is included so let's
start<00:02:48.379> with<00:02:48.560> our<00:02:48.620> Cessna<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.609> how<00:02:49.879> you<00:02:49.939> would

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
start with our Cessna and how you would

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.089 
start with our Cessna and how you would
get<00:02:50.480> up<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:50.870> running<00:02:51.049> with<00:02:51.139> it<00:02:51.349> now<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:52.040> is

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
get up and running with it now this is

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.039 
get up and running with it now this is
the<00:02:52.370> obviously<00:02:52.669> the<00:02:52.819> fuselage<00:02:53.329> you<00:02:53.599> can<00:02:53.810> see

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
the obviously the fuselage you can see

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.809 
the obviously the fuselage you can see
and<00:02:54.290> you'll<00:02:54.739> be<00:02:54.889> able<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.250> make<00:02:55.430> out<00:02:55.639> we've<00:02:55.790> got

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
and you'll be able to make out we've got

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.939 
and you'll be able to make out we've got
a<00:02:56.030> number<00:02:56.389> of<00:02:56.629> different<00:02:57.230> magnets<00:02:57.590> which<00:02:57.769> are

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:57.949 
a number of different magnets which are

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.149 
a number of different magnets which are
already<00:02:58.639> installed<00:02:59.510> here<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.799> they

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
already installed here and they

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.899 
already installed here and they
correspond<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:02.199> the<00:03:03.199> magnets<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.189> are<00:03:04.609> in

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
correspond to the magnets that are in

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.509 
correspond to the magnets that are in
the<00:03:05.719> lower<00:03:06.019> fuselage<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.859> we've<00:03:06.980> got<00:03:07.129> magnets

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
the lower fuselage so we've got magnets

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.479 
the lower fuselage so we've got magnets
here<00:03:07.730> now<00:03:08.449> we<00:03:08.840> also<00:03:08.989> have<00:03:09.409> these<00:03:09.620> servos<00:03:10.129> with

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
here now we also have these servos with

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.720 
here now we also have these servos with
these<00:03:10.699> as<00:03:11.230> linkages<00:03:12.230> as<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.769> white<00:03:13.250> one<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.549> a

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
these as linkages as a white one and a

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.819 
these as linkages as a white one and a
red<00:03:13.760> one<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.299> these<00:03:14.449> are<00:03:14.659> also<00:03:14.840> magnetic<00:03:15.409> I

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
red one and these are also magnetic I

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.830 
red one and these are also magnetic I
thought<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.549> would<00:03:16.699> be<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:17.180> bit<00:03:17.659> of<00:03:17.750> a

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
thought this would be a bit of a

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.199 
thought this would be a bit of a
nightmare<00:03:18.079> to<00:03:18.469> assemble<00:03:18.980> but<00:03:19.489> actually<00:03:20.030> as

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
nightmare to assemble but actually as

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.559 
nightmare to assemble but actually as
you<00:03:20.480> put<00:03:20.689> them<00:03:20.870> together<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:22.150> may<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.419> be

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
you put them together you may just be

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.879 
you put them together you may just be
able<00:03:23.659> to<00:03:23.900> make<00:03:24.109> out<00:03:24.379> that<00:03:24.409> both<00:03:25.370> linkages<00:03:26.889> just

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
able to make out that both linkages just

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.089 
able to make out that both linkages just
find<00:03:28.340> each<00:03:28.699> other<00:03:29.259> there<00:03:30.259> you<00:03:30.500> can<00:03:30.680> see<00:03:30.889> that

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
find each other there you can see that

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.280 
find each other there you can see that
they've<00:03:31.489> connected<00:03:31.759> and<00:03:32.359> then<00:03:32.599> just<00:03:32.959> lower

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
they've connected and then just lower

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.439 
they've connected and then just lower
this<00:03:34.129> into<00:03:34.430> place<00:03:34.639> and<00:03:34.939> there's<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.150> really

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
this into place and there's a really

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.240 
this into place and there's a really
secure<00:03:35.810> fitting<00:03:36.319> so<00:03:36.739> there<00:03:36.949> we<00:03:37.069> go

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
secure fitting so there we go

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.849 
secure fitting so there we go
we've<00:03:37.459> got<00:03:37.669> our<00:03:37.840> aeroplane<00:03:38.840> all<00:03:39.379> we<00:03:39.590> need<00:03:39.739> to

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
we've got our aeroplane all we need to

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.770 
we've got our aeroplane all we need to
do<00:03:40.009> now<00:03:40.189> is<00:03:40.400> get<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.699> battery<00:03:41.090> in<00:03:41.269> and<00:03:41.509> we're

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
do now is get the battery in and we're

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.289 
do now is get the battery in and we're
away<00:03:42.169> and<00:03:42.439> running<00:03:42.790> now<00:03:43.790> connecting<00:03:44.209> that

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
away and running now connecting that

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.610 
away and running now connecting that
battery<00:03:44.659> couldn't<00:03:44.870> be<00:03:45.019> easier

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
battery couldn't be easier

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.309 
battery couldn't be easier
also<00:03:46.129> I've<00:03:46.669> just<00:03:46.970> removed<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.509> cover<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.259> you

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
also I've just removed the cover and you

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.770 
also I've just removed the cover and you
can<00:03:48.409> see<00:03:48.590> there<00:03:48.919> are<00:03:49.040> two<00:03:49.250> prongs<00:03:49.639> in<00:03:50.569> the

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
can see there are two prongs in the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.050 
can see there are two prongs in the
lower<00:03:51.019> fuselage<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:51.979> our<00:03:52.340> battery<00:03:52.759> can<00:03:52.909> only

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
lower fuselage and our battery can only

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.319 
lower fuselage and our battery can only
really<00:03:53.449> fit<00:03:53.659> in<00:03:53.840> one<00:03:54.290> way<00:03:54.590> so<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.849> literally

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
really fit in one way so it literally

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.240 
really fit in one way so it literally
just<00:03:56.509> presses<00:03:57.349> into<00:03:57.500> position<00:03:58.129> and<00:03:58.989> then

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
just presses into position and then

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.280 
just presses into position and then
connect<00:04:01.250> or<00:04:01.549> put<00:04:01.939> the<00:04:02.090> battery<00:04:02.719> cover<00:04:02.930> running

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
connect or put the battery cover running

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.949 
connect or put the battery cover running
I<00:04:03.439> really<00:04:03.829> like<00:04:04.009> the<00:04:04.189> idea<00:04:04.609> that<00:04:04.909> we've<00:04:05.810> got

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
I really like the idea that we've got

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.039 
I really like the idea that we've got
this<00:04:06.049> vented<00:04:06.909> fuselage<00:04:07.909> cover<00:04:08.419> here<00:04:08.689> so<00:04:08.719> the

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
this vented fuselage cover here so the

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.110 
this vented fuselage cover here so the
battery<00:04:09.439> yoke<00:04:09.709> stays<00:04:10.129> nice<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.400> ventilated

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
battery yoke stays nice and ventilated

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.420 
battery yoke stays nice and ventilated
and<00:04:11.269> cool<00:04:11.569> in<00:04:11.840> operation<00:04:12.439> and<00:04:12.889> that's<00:04:13.219> pretty

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
and cool in operation and that's pretty

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.819 
and cool in operation and that's pretty
much<00:04:13.609> it<00:04:13.909> now<00:04:14.719> before<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:15.049> get<00:04:15.259> up<00:04:15.439> and<00:04:15.620> running

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
much it now before we get up and running

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.770 
much it now before we get up and running
for<00:04:16.009> the<00:04:16.070> first<00:04:16.459> time<00:04:16.789> with<00:04:16.969> our<00:04:17.120> Cessna<00:04:17.599> and

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
for the first time with our Cessna and

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.050 
for the first time with our Cessna and
take<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.620> skies<00:04:18.919> there's<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.669> couple<00:04:19.880> of

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
take to the skies there's a couple of

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.510 
take to the skies there's a couple of
preflight<00:04:20.509> checks<00:04:20.780> we<00:04:20.930> need<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.229> do<00:04:21.520> firstly

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
preflight checks we need to do firstly

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.270 
preflight checks we need to do firstly
we<00:04:22.849> need<00:04:22.880> this<00:04:23.240> servo<00:04:24.169> switch<00:04:24.590> on<00:04:24.860> our<00:04:24.919> radio

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
we need this servo switch on our radio

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.700 
we need this servo switch on our radio
throwing<00:04:26.060> over<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:26.539> the<00:04:26.659> right<00:04:26.870> just

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
throwing over to the right just

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.540 
throwing over to the right just
to<00:04:28.009> you<00:04:28.160> here<00:04:29.350> okay<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.560> basically<00:04:30.800> the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
to you here okay and basically the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.580 
to you here okay and basically the
reason<00:04:31.729> that<00:04:32.360> we've<00:04:32.539> got<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.900> most<00:04:33.169> of<00:04:33.319> that<00:04:33.440> is

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
reason that we've got to most of that is

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.920 
reason that we've got to most of that is
because<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:34.580> different<00:04:34.970> aircraft<00:04:35.180> here<00:04:35.630> have

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
because the different aircraft here have

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.360 
because the different aircraft here have
different<00:04:36.440> characteristics

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
different characteristics

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.300 
different characteristics
the<00:04:37.669> Cessna<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.660> beginner<00:04:39.020> of<00:04:39.259> the<00:04:39.410> three<00:04:39.740> has

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
the Cessna the beginner of the three has

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.040 
the Cessna the beginner of the three has
the<00:04:40.490> controls<00:04:40.940> feature<00:04:41.389> that<00:04:41.660> around<00:04:41.930> the

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
the controls feature that around the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.610 
the controls feature that around the
tail<00:04:42.259> as<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.500> can<00:04:42.740> see<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:44.270> other<00:04:44.509> two<00:04:44.630> have

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
tail as you can see the other two have

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.800 
tail as you can see the other two have
them<00:04:45.830> on<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.310> control<00:04:47.120> features<00:04:47.419> on<00:04:47.599> the

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
them on the control features on the

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.279 
them on the control features on the
wings<00:04:48.289> and<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:49.370> tail<00:04:49.400> and<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:50.449> requires<00:04:51.169> a

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
wings and the tail and that requires a

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.379 
wings and the tail and that requires a
servos<00:04:51.800> to<00:04:52.039> operate<00:04:52.460> slightly<00:04:52.940> differently

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
servos to operate slightly differently

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.290 
servos to operate slightly differently
so<00:04:53.690> for<00:04:54.560> the<00:04:54.620> Cessna<00:04:55.099> we<00:04:55.400> need<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.639> be<00:04:55.789> over<00:04:56.150> to

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
so for the Cessna we need to be over to

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.420 
so for the Cessna we need to be over to
the<00:04:56.389> right<00:04:56.650> now<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.710> last<00:04:57.949> thing<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:58.190> we

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
the right now the last thing that we

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.010 
the right now the last thing that we
need<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.610> do<00:04:58.819> before<00:04:59.000> we<00:04:59.300> take<00:04:59.509> to<00:04:59.660> the<00:04:59.780> skies

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
need to do before we take to the skies

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.520 
need to do before we take to the skies
are<00:05:00.680> trim<00:05:01.580> our<00:05:01.910> controls<00:05:02.570> now<00:05:03.110> it's<00:05:03.259> very<00:05:03.470> very

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
are trim our controls now it's very very

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.760 
are trim our controls now it's very very
simple<00:05:03.979> this<00:05:04.340> buttons<00:05:05.120> on<00:05:05.419> our<00:05:05.720> radio<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.530> the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
simple this buttons on our radio and the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.800 
simple this buttons on our radio and the
size<00:05:07.009> of<00:05:07.130> the<00:05:07.280> controls<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.210> we<00:05:08.389> just<00:05:08.630> need<00:05:08.780> to

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
size of the controls and we just need to

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.469 
size of the controls and we just need to
make<00:05:09.110> sure<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.680> our<00:05:09.860> control<00:05:10.490> surfaces<00:05:11.150> have

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
make sure that our control surfaces have

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.420 
make sure that our control surfaces have
been<00:05:11.690> trimmed<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.139> it's<00:05:12.320> explained<00:05:13.160> very

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
been trimmed and it's explained very

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.100 
been trimmed and it's explained very
well<00:05:13.550> in<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.150> manual<00:05:14.509> so<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.690> don't<00:05:14.900> have<00:05:14.990> to

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
well in the manual so you don't have to

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.719 
well in the manual so you don't have to
worry<00:05:15.320> about<00:05:15.440> it<00:05:15.770> and<00:05:16.099> basically<00:05:16.490> it<00:05:16.699> just

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
worry about it and basically it just

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.540 
worry about it and basically it just
means<00:05:17.090> that<00:05:17.270> you'll<00:05:17.419> end<00:05:17.539> up<00:05:17.660> having<00:05:17.810> to<00:05:18.550> press

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
means that you'll end up having to press

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.930 
means that you'll end up having to press
these<00:05:19.729> buttons<00:05:20.169> needs<00:05:21.169> bleep<00:05:21.500> all<00:05:21.770> adjust<00:05:22.310> the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
these buttons needs bleep all adjust the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.570 
these buttons needs bleep all adjust the
star<00:05:23.509> or<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.590> starting<00:05:25.130> position<00:05:25.490> of

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
star or the the starting position of

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.460 
star or the the starting position of
each<00:05:25.729> servo<00:05:26.240> so<00:05:26.449> that<00:05:26.659> you<00:05:26.750> get<00:05:26.870> it<00:05:26.930> perfectly

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
each servo so that you get it perfectly

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.559 
each servo so that you get it perfectly
right<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:27.860> you<00:05:28.069> need<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.340> do<00:05:28.580> that<00:05:28.789> every<00:05:29.539> time

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
right and you need to do that every time

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.950 
right and you need to do that every time
you<00:05:29.960> disconnect<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.889> lower<00:05:31.639> fuselage<00:05:32.330> just

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
you disconnect the lower fuselage just

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.439 
you disconnect the lower fuselage just
to<00:05:33.080> make<00:05:33.259> sure<00:05:33.530> that<00:05:33.860> your<00:05:34.190> controls<00:05:34.639> are<00:05:34.909> in

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
to make sure that your controls are in

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.629 
to make sure that your controls are in
the<00:05:35.630> neutral<00:05:35.840> position<00:05:36.080> when<00:05:36.979> you<00:05:37.130> get<00:05:37.310> flying

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
the neutral position when you get flying

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.430 
the neutral position when you get flying
and<00:05:38.000> that's<00:05:38.270> going<00:05:38.449> to<00:05:38.509> give<00:05:38.659> you<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:39.080> best

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440

pre-flight checks make sure that the

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.580 
pre-flight checks make sure that the
controls<00:05:48.889> are<00:05:49.070> working<00:05:49.900> there<00:05:50.900> we<00:05:51.080> are<00:05:51.199> on<00:05:51.469> the

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
controls are working there we are on the
