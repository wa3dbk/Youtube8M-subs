00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.269
 I had a good water condition 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.209

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.010

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.660
 of food is given the necessary food 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.790
 do not believe that if you give full food all 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.210
 days 3 4 times a day and I go to 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.690

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.300
 as you watching 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.860

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.290
 quietly there is no problem to 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.349
 the young do not have to feed them 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.069
 that eat the necessary two or three clear 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.210
 times a day 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.640
