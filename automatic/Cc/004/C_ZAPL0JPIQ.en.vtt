00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.300
 Veronika is here to welcome you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.980
 this video 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.649
 In this video I'll show you one 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.510
 Nice squad alternative that is 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.830
 now good for the po, this exercise is the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.549
 I just want to do just great 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.560
 Of course, also great for the legs 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.869
 These exercises are needed for that though 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.119
 not this normal barbell up 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.539
 your pc but we do that with the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 cable that is a really mine 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.750
 favorite exercises just also I lifted 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.279
 Show yourself you have to, of course 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.929
 my knees are just as concerned about that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.329
 normal squats at the normal 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.960
 spots just look like it does not 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.960
 just do it 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.830
 So pay attention to it during the execution 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.310
 that knee over a football too 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.550
 stay 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:21.820
 just like normal squats 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:26.370
 rausstrecken and a university 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.370
 very broad stand too 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.760
 so you can then go down nicely 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.430
 so i just notice this exercise 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.799

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.940
