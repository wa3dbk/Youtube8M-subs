this Bell combination the strategy is

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.589 
this Bell combination the strategy is
that<00:00:24.830> if<00:00:24.919> you<00:00:25.009> can<00:00:25.130> find<00:00:25.310> two<00:00:25.669> air<00:00:26.000> defenses

that are close enough to each can

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.220 
that are close enough to each can
actually<00:00:28.580> eliminate<00:00:28.730> both<00:00:29.240> of<00:00:29.539> them<00:00:29.689> just

defense kind of needed to be within

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.980 
defense kind of needed to be within
about<00:00:37.430> three<00:00:37.790> spaces<00:00:38.150> of<00:00:38.420> each<00:00:38.540> other<00:00:38.750> for

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
about three spaces of each other for

about three spaces of each other for
this<00:00:39.080> to<00:00:39.140> work

this to work

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.810 
this to work
this<00:00:41.000> obviously<00:00:41.390> limit<00:00:41.750> is<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:41.930> number<00:00:42.200> basis

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
this obviously limit is the number basis

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.040 
this obviously limit is the number basis
effective<00:00:43.820> strategy<00:00:44.239> for<00:00:44.270> but<00:00:44.720> if<00:00:44.809> you<00:00:44.900> can

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
effective strategy for but if you can

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.229 
effective strategy for but if you can
find<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.470> base<00:00:45.650> where<00:00:45.860> this<00:00:46.010> works<00:00:46.309> the

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
find a base where this works the

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.520 
find a base where this works the
strategy<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.750> very<00:00:48.079> powerful

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
strategy is very powerful

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
strategy is very powerful
the<00:00:49.860> idea<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.520> place<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.149> lightning

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
the idea is to place the lightning

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.029 
the idea is to place the lightning
spells<00:00:51.719> directly<00:00:52.140> between<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.739> two<00:00:52.890> air

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
spells directly between the two air

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.430 
spells directly between the two air
defense<00:00:53.449> battle<00:00:54.449> caused<00:00:54.600> damage<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.019> both<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
defense battle caused damage to both of

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.750 
defense battle caused damage to both of
them<00:00:55.530> leaving<00:00:55.739> them<00:00:55.980> both<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
them leaving them both with just a

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060 
them leaving them both with just a
sliver<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.120> health<00:00:57.390> roomie<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.649> use<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
sliver of health roomie then use the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.880 
sliver of health roomie then use the
earthquake<00:00:59.489> spell<00:00:59.790> to<00:00:59.969> finish<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.360> off

we<00:02:26.349> think<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.650> needed<00:02:26.950> though<00:02:27.310> we'd<00:02:28.150> like<00:02:28.239> to

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
we think is needed though we'd like to

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.089 
we think is needed though we'd like to
analyze<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.900> best<00:02:29.140> applications

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
analyze the best applications

analyze the best applications
specifically<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.209> best<00:02:31.420> locations<00:02:32.049> for

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
specifically the best locations for

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.440 
specifically the best locations for
dropping<00:02:32.890> those<00:02:32.980> lightning<00:02:33.250> spells<00:02:33.730> because

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
dropping those lightning spells because

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.000 
dropping those lightning spells because
they<00:02:34.659> do<00:02:34.720> cause<00:02:35.140> damage<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.530> different<00:02:35.859> places

and depending on the locations of the
air<00:02:37.780> defenses<00:02:38.319> we<00:02:39.069> could<00:02:39.250> do<00:02:39.459> more<00:02:39.909> damage<00:02:39.939> by

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
air defenses we could do more damage by

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
air defenses we could do more damage by
dropping<00:02:40.840> them<00:02:40.959> in<00:02:41.049> slightly<00:02:41.379> different

locations between the two air defenses

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.199 
locations between the two air defenses
we'd<00:02:44.650> also<00:02:44.799> like<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.040> look<00:02:45.250> into<00:02:45.430> which<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:46.060> the

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
we'd also like to look into which of the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.210 
we'd also like to look into which of the
four<00:02:46.450> spells<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.260> best<00:02:47.530> used<00:02:47.889> as<00:02:48.069> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
four spells is best used as the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.800 
four spells is best used as the
earthquake<00:02:48.639> because<00:02:48.939> the<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.239> patter<00:02:49.510> does

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
earthquake because the that patter does

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.110 
earthquake because the that patter does
change<00:02:50.260> based<00:02:51.189> on<00:02:51.370> how<00:02:51.519> many<00:02:51.579> spells<00:02:52.000> have

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
change based on how many spells have

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.750 
change based on how many spells have
already<00:02:52.359> been<00:02:52.510> used<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.650> might<00:02:53.950> be<00:02:54.159> optimal<00:02:54.609> to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
already been used it might be optimal to

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.369 
already been used it might be optimal to
use<00:02:54.909> the<00:02:55.030> earthquake<00:02:55.419> as<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.689> second<00:02:56.109> spell

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
use the earthquake as the second spell

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.479 
use the earthquake as the second spell
thus<00:02:57.189> using<00:02:57.430> spells<00:02:58.359> 1<00:02:58.689> 3<00:02:59.230> &amp;<00:02:59.379> 4<00:02:59.709> as<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.250> zap

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
thus using spells 1 3 &amp; 4 as the zap

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.899 
thus using spells 1 3 &amp; 4 as the zap
spell<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:03.250> also<00:03:03.400> like<00:03:03.579> to<00:03:03.609> look<00:03:03.790> at

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
spell we also like to look at

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.629 
spell we also like to look at
implications<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.629> diagonal<00:03:05.439> aeds<00:03:05.980> diagonally

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
implications of diagonal aeds diagonally

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.030 
implications of diagonal aeds diagonally
located<00:03:07.060> IDs<00:03:07.389> and<00:03:07.659> if<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.379> causes<00:03:08.859> any

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
located IDs and if that causes any

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.220 
located IDs and if that causes any
change<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.579> Zap<00:03:09.849> pattern<00:03:10.230> effectiveness

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
change in the Zap pattern effectiveness

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.670 
change in the Zap pattern effectiveness
and<00:03:11.489> finally<00:03:12.489> we<00:03:12.790> still<00:03:13.239> think<00:03:13.480> there<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:13.900> some

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
and finally we still think there is some

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.250 
and finally we still think there is some
utility<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.549> this<00:03:15.699> strategy<00:03:16.239> in<00:03:16.780> town<00:03:17.019> hall<00:03:17.229> 9
