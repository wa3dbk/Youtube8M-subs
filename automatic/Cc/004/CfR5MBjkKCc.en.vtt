00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.920
 physicists are very players 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.130
 good ones 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.390
 this tactical point of view their relationship 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.640
 technician forgive his relationship with the ball 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.279
 It's very good from the point of view 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.650
 tactical there are some aspects that could 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.039
 improve especially those related 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.489
 with perfection comparing with the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.499
 first time notice a difference or some 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:34.290
 another type of cover from a point of 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.660
 Attitudinal view there is no 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.390
 difference in Japanese players 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.340
 they are exceptional from a point of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.310
 tactical view I notice that there are players 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.460
 who have participated more times in 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.650
 situations like real in more games 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.910
 global and are more accustomed to 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.910
 this type of training 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.490
 through these campuses what is the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.920
 main objective that you would like to teach 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.650
 to the boys the main goal of 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.480
 these fields is to show a way of 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.480
 train even that serve sense 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.670
 we try to train fundamentally 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.830
 using forms of training 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.710
 global not only analytical but 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.040
 above all global what we try is 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.990
 children young players 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.610
 introduce in a way a 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.990
 training methodology 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.570
 when you lead a football team 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.400
 base is the most important thing in football and 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.220
 the most important thing when the players 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.610
 they are young it is first of all that they 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.610
 have fun 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.110
 if we do not meet this goal it does not 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.210
 we still need to keep thinking about other objectives 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.310
 the second objective is that children 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.620
 they learn new concepts that go 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.350
 incorporating new skills to your 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.300
 game and thirdly that are each 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.790
 more competitive times but these three 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.790
 objectives have to be respected in this 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.679
 we have seen that they ask many questions to 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.750
 the guys in the training what would be the 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.360
 objective of this style of handling the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.229
 I train, we train 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.849
 fundamentally asking questions in 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.310
 the testers because we want players 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.360
 smart during the game the 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.489
 player has to be all the time 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.040
 thinking and therefore we 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.290
 we train players to think 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.980
 during training we do 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.920
 questions 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.420
 in this way we guide the player towards 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.610
 the correct answers in the game 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.980
 but without giving them he has to 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.569
 discover for yourself in that way the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.420
 player is finally a player 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.760
 intelligent capable of giving solutions in 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.160
 the game 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.560
 as it would be a good player but 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.940
 a great player an intelligent people 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.220
 from the point of view of that that a 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.920
 service is the player has to be a 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.510
 full player has to be a good 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.569
 player from the technical point of view 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.360
 he has to have an excellent attitude 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.550
 always workouts and games but 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.959
 for us the most important thing is that 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.470
 the soccer player is a player 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.900
 intelligent that knows how to give solutions to 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.700
 open problems in the game because the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.930
 soccer is a sport especially 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.519
 open 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.480
 to the children who have participated in the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.329
 campus whose homework would leave you what objective 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.680
 would you leave him after the campuses I would 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.629
 what would you say to the children who participate 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.209
 on campus it is first of all that 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.219
 enjoy a lot with football to 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.980
 that when they are older they still want 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.569
 participate in this sport and in second 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.730
 I would tell them to pay attention to their 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.439
 coaches who try to learn what 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.629
 maximum of your coaches and what if 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.650
 may apply some of the concepts 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.650
 that we are training these days
