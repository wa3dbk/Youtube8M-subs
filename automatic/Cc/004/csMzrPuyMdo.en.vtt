game maker how to add gravity okay right

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.060 
game maker how to add gravity okay right
now<00:00:10.230> I've<00:00:10.530> already<00:00:11.040> made<00:00:11.429> some<00:00:12.830> persons<00:00:13.830> right

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
now I've already made some persons right

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.750 
now I've already made some persons right
and<00:00:14.630> I've<00:00:15.630> also<00:00:15.839> made<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.320> bricks<00:00:16.650> right<00:00:16.760> for

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and I've also made a bricks right for

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.660 
and I've also made a bricks right for
the<00:00:17.850> ground<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.390> walls<00:00:19.070> okay<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.520> need

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
the ground and walls okay what you need

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.240 
the ground and walls okay what you need
to<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:21.180> create<00:00:22.170> an<00:00:22.260> object<00:00:22.350> make<00:00:23.100> it

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
to do first create an object make it

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.500 
to do first create an object make it
your<00:00:23.400> character<00:00:23.880> add<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.380> vent<00:00:27.349> press<00:00:28.349> key<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
your character add a vent press key a

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.139 
your character add a vent press key a
lot<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.630> Springs<00:00:30.869> down<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.380> press<00:00:31.890> key

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
lot of Springs down for you press key

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
left at event kreski right okay now

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.520 
left at event kreski right okay now
instead<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> using<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> basic<00:00:39.290> moving<00:00:40.290> Keys

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
instead of using the basic moving Keys

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.729 
instead of using the basic moving Keys
with<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.120> that<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.480> screw<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.290> physics

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
with this that will screw up the physics

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.250 
with this that will screw up the physics
when<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.610> safe<00:00:45.180> you're<00:00:45.450> falling<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
when you are safe you're falling if you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.709 
when you are safe you're falling if you
wanted<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.620> move<00:00:46.739> left<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.340> right<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.300> would

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
wanted to move left to right it would

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.189 
wanted to move left to right it would
make<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.289> move<00:00:49.829> left<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:51.079> screw<00:00:52.079> up

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
make you move left to right and screw up

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.959 
make you move left to right and screw up
the<00:00:52.469> movie<00:00:52.739> physics<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.250> now<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:53.850> going

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the movie physics so now what I'm going

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.959 
the movie physics so now what I'm going
to<00:00:54.059> use<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.629> speed<00:00:55.289> horizontal<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
to use is speed horizontal can out to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.020 
to use is speed horizontal can out to
make<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.360> right<00:00:58.670> do<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> way<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
make it go right do it the way that

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.479 
make it go right do it the way that
their<00:01:00.390> arrows<00:01:00.780> pointing<00:01:01.350> I'm<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> make

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
their arrows pointing I'm going to make

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.200 
their arrows pointing I'm going to make
it<00:01:02.609> five<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.979> four<00:01:04.979> left<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.090> make

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it five and four left I'm going to make

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.000 
it five and four left I'm going to make
it<00:01:06.390> minus<00:01:07.229> five<00:01:08.780> okay<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.950> have

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it minus five okay so there you have

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.140 
it minus five okay so there you have
your<00:01:11.159> basic<00:01:11.460> movement<00:01:12.240> movement<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.990> it

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
your basic movement movement for it

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
your basic movement movement for it
almost<00:01:15.150> done<00:01:15.330> ok<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.159> need<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> go

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
almost done ok so now now we need to go

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.560 
almost done ok so now now we need to go
create<00:01:18.950> sense<00:01:19.950> gravity<00:01:20.460> okay<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> can

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
create sense gravity okay now you can

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.210 
create sense gravity okay now you can
either<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.020> two<00:01:22.229> ways<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.740> either<00:01:22.979> do

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
either do it two ways you can either do

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.450 
either do it two ways you can either do
it<00:01:23.250> 180<00:01:24.090> degrees<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.869> nu<00:01:25.080> minus<00:01:25.320> 90<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.310> is

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
it 180 degrees with nu minus 90 which is

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850 
it 180 degrees with nu minus 90 which is
the<00:01:26.580> one<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.880> prefer<00:01:27.350> make<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> gravity

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the one that I prefer make the gravity

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.289 
the one that I prefer make the gravity
roundabout<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:31.820> there<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
roundabout one and there you have the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.840 
roundabout one and there you have the
gravity<00:01:33.840> set<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.590> moving<00:01:34.920> forward<00:01:35.280> now

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
gravity set and the moving forward now

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
gravity set and the moving forward now
what<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.060> need<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.450> make<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.750> do<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.409> want

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
what you need to make it do if you want

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
what you need to make it do if you want
to<00:01:37.680> make<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:38.009> work<00:01:39.000> properly<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> thing

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
to make it work properly with the thing

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.370 
to make it work properly with the thing
with<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> block<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.880> need<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.229> create<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
with a block you need to create the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
with a block you need to create the
block<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:44.390> as<00:01:45.390> vinyl<00:01:45.780> make<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.649> solid<00:01:47.600> make<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
block now as vinyl make it solid make it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.039 
block now as vinyl make it solid make it
solid<00:01:49.409> okay<00:01:49.740> otherwise<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.250> will<00:01:50.310> not<00:01:50.369> work<00:01:51.049> ok

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
solid okay otherwise it will not work ok

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.990 
solid okay otherwise it will not work ok
go<00:01:52.290> back<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.560> your<00:01:52.649> person<00:01:54.530> advent<00:01:56.000> collision

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
go back to your person advent collision

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.499 
go back to your person advent collision
with<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> block<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.880> don't<00:01:59.880> like<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.000> name<00:02:00.299> mine

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
with a block I don't like to name mine

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.649 
with a block I don't like to name mine
but<00:02:00.689> whatever<00:02:01.909> set<00:02:02.909> vertical<00:02:03.420> Direction<00:02:03.899> 0

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
but whatever set vertical Direction 0

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.059 
but whatever set vertical Direction 0
just<00:02:06.659> go<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> my<00:02:07.110> room<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.860> already

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
just go to my room that I have already

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.530 
just go to my room that I have already
made<00:02:08.869> plop<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.110> there

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.450 

and<00:02:13.540> I'll<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.080> test<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.440> out<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.590> see<00:02:14.830> if

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
and I'll just test it out and see if

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.740 
and I'll just test it out and see if
this<00:02:15.700> works<00:02:20.610> there<00:02:21.610> we<00:02:21.760> have<00:02:21.790> our<00:02:22.150> basic

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
this works there we have our basic

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.490 
this works there we have our basic
movements<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.890> can<00:02:24.040> fall<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.260> can't

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
movements and you can fall if you can't

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.750 
movements and you can fall if you can't
get<00:02:26.620> back<00:02:26.740> up<00:02:26.850> okay<00:02:27.850> now<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.630> add<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.900> jumping

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
get back up okay now to add the jumping

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.590 
get back up okay now to add the jumping
actually<00:02:30.760> first<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.270> shall<00:02:33.090> make<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.450> that

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
actually first I shall make it so that

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.510 
actually first I shall make it so that
when<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.930> move<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.170> stop<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
when you move you stop so you do the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.840 
when you move you stop so you do the
exact<00:02:36.790> same<00:02:36.820> thing<00:02:37.270> left<00:02:37.830> vertical<00:02:38.850> direction

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
exact same thing left vertical direction

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:49.970 
exact same thing left vertical direction
zero<00:02:40.570> no<00:02:40.990> horizontal<00:02:41.470> yeah<00:02:41.940> 0<00:02:43.980> right<00:02:44.980> 0<00:02:48.750> next

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
zero no horizontal yeah 0 right 0 next

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.840 
zero no horizontal yeah 0 right 0 next
press<00:02:50.980> key<00:02:51.280> up<00:02:52.530> okay<00:02:53.530> now<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.940> do<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:56.850> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
press key up okay now if you do this the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.650 
press key up okay now if you do this the
whole<00:02:58.060> vertical<00:02:58.959> direction<00:02:59.440> negative<00:03:00.310> say<00:03:00.790> 10

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.410 

this<00:03:04.660> will<00:03:04.930> make<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.140> jump<00:03:05.560> but<00:03:06.430> what<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.330> are

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
this will make it jump but what you are

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.520 
this will make it jump but what you are
able<00:03:07.600> to<00:03:07.900> do<00:03:08.050> when<00:03:08.440> you<00:03:08.560> play<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:13.380> instead<00:03:14.380> of

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
able to do when you play is instead of

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.570 
able to do when you play is instead of
just<00:03:14.680> wanting<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.130> go<00:03:15.340> bounce<00:03:16.269> once<00:03:17.580> you

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
just wanting it to go bounce once you

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.240 
just wanting it to go bounce once you
can<00:03:18.730> go<00:03:18.989> keep<00:03:19.989> pressing<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.470> now<00:03:20.980> I'm<00:03:21.070> going<00:03:21.190> to

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
can go keep pressing it now I'm going to

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.880 
can go keep pressing it now I'm going to
show<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.400> how<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.550> pick<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:21.940> up<00:03:23.910> okay<00:03:24.910> now

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
show you how to pick that up okay now

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.770 
show you how to pick that up okay now
open<00:03:26.890> up<00:03:27.130> your<00:03:27.190> object<00:03:27.610> again<00:03:27.880> now<00:03:28.540> when<00:03:28.690> you

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
open up your object again now when you

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.979 
open up your object again now when you
press<00:03:29.019> up<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:31.120> need<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.510> go<00:03:31.690> into<00:03:33.600> control<00:03:34.600> if

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
press up you need to go into control if

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.410 
press up you need to go into control if
there<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:36.720> collision<00:03:37.720> at<00:03:37.900> position<00:03:38.500> I'm<00:03:39.420> just

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
there is collision at position I'm just

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.090 
there is collision at position I'm just
say<00:03:40.630> make<00:03:40.840> it<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.110> middle<00:03:41.350> of<00:03:41.470> your<00:03:41.650> sprite

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
say make it in the middle of your sprite

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.430 
say make it in the middle of your sprite
or<00:03:42.430> down<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.180> bottom<00:03:43.480> doesn't<00:03:43.930> really<00:03:44.230> matter

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
or down the bottom doesn't really matter

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:53.430 
or down the bottom doesn't really matter
but<00:03:45.239> 16<00:03:46.530> 16<00:03:49.049> relative<00:03:51.959> set<00:03:52.959> vertical

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
but 16 16 relative set vertical

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.140 
but 16 16 relative set vertical
direction<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.549> vital<00:03:58.000> because

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
direction that and this is vital because

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.479 
direction that and this is vital because
if<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.870> does<00:03:59.049> not<00:03:59.080> work<00:03:59.260> it'll<00:03:59.860> just<00:03:59.890> screw<00:04:00.400> up

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
if it does not work it'll just screw up

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.350 
if it does not work it'll just screw up
the<00:04:00.670> aim<00:04:00.850> so<00:04:01.120> you<00:04:01.180> need<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:01.480> go<00:04:01.630> else<00:04:03.360> set

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
the aim so you need to go else set

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.300 
the aim so you need to go else set
vertical<00:04:04.870> direction<00:04:05.260> at<00:04:05.380> 0<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:07.920> then<00:04:08.920> we

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
vertical direction at 0 and then we

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.840 
vertical direction at 0 and then we
should<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.700> able<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.600> jump<00:04:11.400> only<00:04:12.400> once<00:04:12.610> in

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
should be able to jump only once in

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.850 
should be able to jump only once in
midair

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.150 

yep<00:04:16.609> maybe<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.180> can't<00:04:17.810> jump<00:04:18.019> twice<00:04:18.230> Kim

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
yep maybe I can't jump twice Kim

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.000 
yep maybe I can't jump twice Kim
pressing<00:04:19.459> up<00:04:19.609> key<00:04:19.820> nothing's<00:04:20.329> happening<00:04:21.010> okay

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
pressing up key nothing's happening okay

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.450 
pressing up key nothing's happening okay
so<00:04:22.070> there<00:04:22.400> you<00:04:22.550> have<00:04:22.580> your<00:04:22.760> basic<00:04:23.120> physics<00:04:23.780> for

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
so there you have your basic physics for

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.650 
so there you have your basic physics for
moving<00:04:25.480> Forbes<00:04:26.480> and<00:04:26.690> gravity<00:04:28.480> don't<00:04:29.480> forget

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
moving Forbes and gravity don't forget

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.440 
moving Forbes and gravity don't forget
