it if he was making a palette anyone a
t7<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.090> would<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.329> called<00:02:06.630> onslaught<00:02:07.610> which<00:02:08.610> is

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
t7 it would be called onslaught which is

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.089 
t7 it would be called onslaught which is
in<00:02:09.000> oh<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:10.080> make<00:02:10.319> sure<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.709> change<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:42.390

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
you don't really have to put legs

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.360 
you don't really have to put legs
because<00:02:45.079> you're<00:02:45.200> making<00:02:45.469> an<00:02:45.560> avatar<00:02:45.890> of

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
to make enough frame so it won't be too

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
slow and it won't be too fast so I

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.710
