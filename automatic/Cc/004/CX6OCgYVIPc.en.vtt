00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the game is just very enjoyable to look

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.620 
the game is just very enjoyable to look
at<00:02:35.650> even<00:02:36.310> though<00:02:36.400> sometimes<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.970> camera<00:02:37.330> does

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
at even though sometimes the camera does

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.660 
at even though sometimes the camera does
shy<00:02:38.110> away<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.440> bit<00:02:38.739> too<00:02:38.980> far<00:02:39.340> from<00:02:39.489> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
shy away a bit too far from the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.759 
shy away a bit too far from the
characters<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:41.019> really<00:02:41.290> hard<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.590> make

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
characters and it's really hard to make

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.860 
characters and it's really hard to make
out<00:02:41.920> what's<00:02:42.160> going<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.580> at<00:02:42.700> times<00:02:42.910> but<00:02:43.630> that's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
out what's going on at times but that's

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.390 
out what's going on at times but that's
just<00:02:44.110> one<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.410> few<00:02:44.590> shortcuts<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.250> I've

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
just one of the few shortcuts that I've

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.370 
just one of the few shortcuts that I've
found<00:02:45.549> so<00:02:45.880> far<00:02:46.060> another<00:02:46.930> thing<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.350> that

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
found so far another thing is that

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.100 
found so far another thing is that
there's<00:02:47.709> no<00:02:47.890> auto<00:02:48.160> lock<00:02:48.580> on<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.060> any<00:02:49.180> sort<00:02:49.540> I

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
there's no auto lock on of any sort I

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.470 
there's no auto lock on of any sort I
mean<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.160> bad<00:02:51.549> but<00:02:51.700> sometimes<00:02:52.180> it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
mean it's not that bad but sometimes it

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.240 
mean it's not that bad but sometimes it
can<00:02:52.660> get<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.930> bit<00:02:52.989> hard<00:02:53.440> once<00:02:53.769> again<00:02:54.010> when<00:02:54.190> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
can get a bit hard once again when the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.589 
can get a bit hard once again when the
camera<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.610> pulled<00:02:54.849> far<00:02:55.090> away<00:02:55.299> it's<00:02:55.510> you

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
camera is pulled far away it's you

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.270 
camera is pulled far away it's you
actually<00:02:56.019> be<00:02:56.500> able<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.709> tell<00:02:56.920> what<00:02:57.160> you're

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
actually be able to tell what you're

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.650 
actually be able to tell what you're
swinging<00:02:57.700> at<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.030> if<00:02:58.120> you're<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:58.599> know

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
swinging at and if you're you know

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
many problems with it I end up to the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.050 
many problems with it I end up to the
point<00:03:17.650> in<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.859> game<00:03:17.980> now<00:03:18.220> where<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.459> do<00:03:18.609> have<00:03:18.880> a

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
point in the game now where I do have a

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.430 
point in the game now where I do have a
second<00:03:19.510> character<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.079> could<00:03:20.230> switch

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
second character and I could switch

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.110 
second character and I could switch
between<00:03:20.620> them<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.459> believe<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.850> can<00:03:21.970> have

between them and I believe you can have
up<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.269> 4<00:03:22.630> characters<00:03:23.200> later<00:03:23.500> on
