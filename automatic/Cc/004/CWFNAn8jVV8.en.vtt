are<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.629> seeing<00:00:07.020> how<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.200> projector<00:00:07.770> behaves

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
are in seeing how the projector behaves

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.570 
are in seeing how the projector behaves
of<00:00:08.550> course<00:00:09.179> we<00:00:09.900> are<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.710> room<00:00:10.920> full<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.280> light

in front of us the projector is 15 lumen

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.590 
in front of us the projector is 15 lumen
it<00:00:22.080> shows<00:00:22.500> everything<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:23.789> on<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.210> 4-inch

screen of the Samsung Galaxy Beam

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.419 
screen of the Samsung Galaxy Beam
there's<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> dedicated<00:00:27.269> app<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.830> manages<00:00:29.400> the

unit it's not hooked up to the pico

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.740 
unit it's not hooked up to the pico
projector<00:00:34.559> itself<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> cannot<00:00:35.640> set<00:00:36.570> up

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
projector itself so you cannot set up

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.280 
projector itself so you cannot set up
the<00:00:36.930> focus<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> brightness<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:39.200> mean<00:00:40.200> you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the focus or the brightness I mean you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.459 
the focus or the brightness I mean you
can<00:00:40.530> set<00:00:40.800> them<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.460> nothing<00:00:42.420> happens<00:00:42.809> as

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
can set them up but nothing happens as

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.930 
can set them up but nothing happens as
you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> brightness<00:00:44.430> doesn't

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you can see the brightness doesn't

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.990 
you can see the brightness doesn't
change<00:00:45.180> or<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> focus<00:00:45.840> itself<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:47.000> that's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
change or the focus itself but that's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.790 
change or the focus itself but that's
gonna<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.329> rectified<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> final<00:00:49.440> unit<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
gonna be rectified in the final unit of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920 
gonna be rectified in the final unit of
course<00:00:50.300> there<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> couple<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.690> additional

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
course there are a couple of additional

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.500 
course there are a couple of additional
functions<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.820> software<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> manages

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
functions in the software that manages

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.869 
functions in the software that manages
the<00:00:54.840> pico<00:00:55.170> projector<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.010> example<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> quick

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the pico projector for example the quick

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.080 
the pico projector for example the quick
pad<00:00:57.120> which<00:00:58.109> allows<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> draw<00:00:59.460> directly<00:00:59.730> on

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
pad which allows you to draw directly on

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
pad which allows you to draw directly on
the<00:01:00.210> screen<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.800> choose<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.039> color<00:01:02.309> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the screen you can choose the color you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.469 
the screen you can choose the color you
will<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.180> drawing<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.660> let's<00:01:04.619> pick

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
will be drawing with let's pick

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.149 
will be drawing with let's pick
something<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:08.299> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.510> basically<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:10.159> do

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
something and you can basically just do

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
something and you can basically just do
though<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.880> phone<00:01:12.060> screen<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.540> your

finger and with it will appear on the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.170 
finger and with it will appear on the
projected<00:01:15.060> image<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:16.110> course<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.490> erase

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
projected image of course you can erase

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.380 
projected image of course you can erase
it<00:01:18.360> afterwards<00:01:18.930> again<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.040> your<00:01:20.189> finger<00:01:20.580> if
