00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 in the last tutorial we have the 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.819
 of the plan 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.740
 We also already saw how 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.170
 you look like you are blind 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.380
 Text zusammenbastelt today it's about 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.730
 general topic text of the topic bryans 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.440
 and text we will be outside this time 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.539
 leave family already at last tory 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 have now had a correct text 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 There is the above to produce 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.369
 possibility to click from mogilev and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.080
 then moore text will appear below 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.330
 this text is already available 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.390
 a volume not how blind you are so 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.969
 saves you can already see the here 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 body can now edit the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.809
 Here in the overview on Mondays 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.250
 click and then you can get in here 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.809
 field enter any text 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:53.370
 please insert text here 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.079
 for example, so of course you can too 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.379
 a paragraph with the man 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.660
 just the next line you write 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.850
 can also do that in the middle central 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.449
 one clicks where on the left and clicks 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.100
 then middle 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.580
 now the whole thing is more 0 at zero point 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 so to speak, you may oriented the now 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.549
 also give a texture as well 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.979
 an object you can also use it in the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.880
 Edit size by clicking here 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.229
 this field pushes if you now 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.939
 However, you can already see edited 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.170
 that everything will be all proportional 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.900
 bigger to enlarge only one side 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.420
 would you know the convert and then to 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.140
 example on the timeline the whole 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.030
 enlarge 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.650
 but we look at ourselves first is elsewhere 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.070
 here still goes to the can home here 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.119
 change the font 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.189
 directly below you can for example 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.810
 say that it should be italic 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.079
 we also know each other once 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.549
 Font may change something 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.549
 beautiful would not have been so formal 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.860
 well that may not be nicer 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:06.140
 but not quite so formal so are 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.690
 As you can see only in bold and standards 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.850
 there is simply no italic you can 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.590
 now increase the distance 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.060
 between each letter 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.120
 The letters will not be sizes 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.030
 changed and of course you can too 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.660
 still the distance between the lines 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.660
 change 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.090
 there is now everything here 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.480
 possible at others 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.670
 Settings options how can you 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.700
 from the beginning on, the basis is on 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.600
 interesting is for example the name 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.190
 changed for example just to 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.200
 an example of that is simply that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.720
 but it needs and as long as you do not with 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.060
 many texts are edited by the editor 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.860
 if you turn that off, it disappears 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.400
 but if you save that, it is 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.110
 back there 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.670
 that's just helpful if that 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.770
 You can do it all slowly 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.850
 expand when and finished with this 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.290
 object then you can not see it anymore 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.260
 may still other objects 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.880
 take care of it later in the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.500
 off still save it were to 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.810
 coordinate she explains already saying 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.920
 is simply the position of the object 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.590
 object we were just there you can just 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.050
 set any possible dek planes it 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.550
 also uninteresting for now 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.510
 Everything for later when you get one 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.390
 a little bit more in this program 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.640
 maybe what else has been incorporated 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.630
 it is interesting to be smooth 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.769
 here the edges look a bit smoother 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.850
 you here now absolutely not 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.850
 fires in the editor 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.420
 you can see that only at the final 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.420
 result goes up to 180 degrees 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.780
 and otherwise that's nothing 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:45.870
 easily lose the orientation so that 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.939
 it was also first with text that can 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.140
 you can just say instead of is 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.090
 Of course you can do that again 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:57.170
 you can link effects so you can 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.170
 also let text melt for example 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.909
 Of course you can do that again here 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.560
 have to move the effect and such 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.290
 Of course you can also be very nice 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.760
 animate with text 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.109
 You can do it all the time otherwise 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.670
 Otherwise just look at the 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.310
 watch previous tutorials 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.959
 effects and textures bringing the text 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.620
 can shape and then until the next 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.620
 tutorial
