that<00:00:49.170> will<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.590> your<00:00:49.739> basic<00:00:49.950> pipe<00:00:51.020> we're<00:00:52.020> going

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that will be your basic pipe we're going

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.270 
that will be your basic pipe we're going
to<00:00:52.230> rasterize<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> leave<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
to rasterize out and to leave the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.650 
to rasterize out and to leave the
background<00:00:54.050> now<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.260> our<00:00:55.379> basic<00:00:55.649> type

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
background now we have our basic type

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.880 
background now we have our basic type
I'm<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> crop<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.680> because

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I'm just going to crop this down because

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.149 
I'm just going to crop this down because
I<00:00:59.160> made<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> far<00:00:59.730> too<00:00:59.760> big<00:01:01.070> family<00:01:02.070> Compton

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.410 

we<00:01:05.759> just<00:01:05.969> have<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> about

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.109 

next<00:01:10.110> thing<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.290> need<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:11.030> there's<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
next thing you need to do there's a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
next thing you need to do there's a
slight<00:01:12.360> stroke<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:14.210> okay<00:01:15.210> about<00:01:16.970> free

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.740 

put<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.880> black

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
put it in black

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.870 
put it in black
now<00:01:23.320> we<00:01:23.380> need<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.770> get<00:01:23.890> this<00:01:24.040> tool<00:01:24.370> called<00:01:24.730> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
now we need to get this tool called the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.380 
now we need to get this tool called the
dodgeball<00:01:25.450> but<00:01:26.440> you<00:01:26.620> don't<00:01:26.770> tend<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.640> use<00:01:27.940> very

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
dodgeball but you don't tend to use very

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.330 
dodgeball but you don't tend to use very
much<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:28.960> photo<00:01:29.290> shop<00:01:29.380> unless<00:01:30.130> you're<00:01:30.160> doing

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
much in photo shop unless you're doing

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.810 
much in photo shop unless you're doing
things<00:01:30.670> like<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.950> need<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.250> set<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
things like this so you need to set the

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.010 
things like this so you need to set the
size<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:35.040> quite<00:01:36.040> small<00:01:36.430> so<00:01:36.760> it<00:01:37.660> goes<00:01:37.810> through

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
size to quite small so it goes through

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.310 
size to quite small so it goes through
the<00:01:38.110> middle<00:01:38.380> hold<00:01:39.130> shift<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.720> drag<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:41.229> across

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
the middle hold shift and drag it across

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.920 
the middle hold shift and drag it across
so<00:01:41.800> it<00:01:41.890> goes<00:01:42.010> in<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.250> straight<00:01:42.310> line<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:43.630> need<00:01:43.810> to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
so it goes in a straight line we need to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.070 
so it goes in a straight line we need to
go<00:01:44.050> back<00:01:44.080> again<00:01:46.650> and<00:01:47.650> again<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:49.450> not<00:01:49.840> want<00:01:50.020> a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
go back again and again it's not want a

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.370 
go back again and again it's not want a
bit<00:01:50.200> too<00:01:50.350> wide<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.540> again

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
bit too wide and again

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.380 
bit too wide and again
we'll<00:01:54.950> do<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:55.070> one<00:01:55.310> more<00:01:55.369> time

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.140 

and<00:01:59.930> that's<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.380> simplest<00:02:00.920> way<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.190> do<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.640> now

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
and that's the simplest way to do it now

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.210 
and that's the simplest way to do it now
just<00:02:02.420> added<00:02:02.900> shadow<00:02:03.350> onto<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.800> bottom<00:02:03.950> this

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
just added shadow onto the bottom this

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.090 
just added shadow onto the bottom this
is<00:02:04.280> Mexico<00:02:05.680> cool<00:02:06.680> as<00:02:06.860> well<00:02:08.590> make<00:02:09.590> sure<00:02:09.619> when

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
is Mexico cool as well make sure when

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.080 
is Mexico cool as well make sure when
you're<00:02:10.190> doing<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.580> you've<00:02:10.789> got<00:02:10.819> your

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
you're doing this you've got your

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.180 
you're doing this you've got your
exposure<00:02:11.420> up<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.840> hundred<00:02:12.020> as<00:02:12.410> well<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:13.010> got

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
exposure up to a hundred as well you got

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.559 
exposure up to a hundred as well you got
the<00:02:13.220> right<00:02:13.840> type<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:16.150> doctrine

we<00:02:21.200> have<00:02:21.530> at<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.799> basic<00:02:22.129> pack<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:23.090> can<00:02:23.269> you've

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
we have at the basic pack you can you've

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.709 
we have at the basic pack you can you've
probably<00:02:23.959> seen<00:02:24.230> these<00:02:24.439> used<00:02:24.769> on<00:02:25.719> youtubes

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:26.719
