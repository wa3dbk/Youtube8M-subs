00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.530
 growth of population and per capita income has 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.010
 increased demand for food 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.800
 the agricultural sector has been struggling to meet this demand by offering 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.269
 products in quantity and quality 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.269
 compatible with the purchasing power of the majority of the population 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.900
 for this, it is necessary to permanently modernize the systems 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.140
 production 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.120
 through the adoption of efficient techniques that increase the income of the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.090
 producer and which meet the consumer 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.420
 irrigation, for example, is a technique often indispensable in 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.890
 agricultural production process 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.530
 productivity and product quality, not to mention 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.510
 reduction of production losses caused by 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.100
 drought 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 irrigation must be conducted efficiently 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.210
 many times the producer thinks that it is enough to acquire the irrigation system to 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.020
 achieve high levels of productivity 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.470
 forgetting that it is necessary to adopt techniques that will enable the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.960
 water at the right moment and the required amount of plants 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.090
 the need for water by the plants varies according to the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 development and local climatic conditions 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.320
 Young plants consume less water than fully grown adult plants. 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.890
 development 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.750
 In addition, plants grown in a hot and dry climate need 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.670
 of water when compared to those grown in 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.670
 humid and mild temperatures 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.779
 irrigation management consists of periodically monitoring and quantifying 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.879
 the water consumption by the plants, making it possible to determine the time 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.790
 necessary to apply the water depth to each irrigation 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:29.129
 your donation could bring benefits such as water and energy savings 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.459
 khomeini time using water resources while preserving the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.830
 reduce water use conflicts and increase water 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.289
 producer 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:44.479
 however in brazil this technique although simple is still little diffused 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.759
 in irrigated agriculture 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:47.710
 thus 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.400
 with the objective of presenting the main techniques of water management 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.770
 in irrigated areas 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.070
 in the certainty that it is contributing to the development of agriculture
