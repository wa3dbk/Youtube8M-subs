 I have here beautiful written writings 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.710

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.960
 first of four books and history 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.180
 we get there so web and is a guy 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.970
 who is very, very bored of his 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.710
 people because they feel that there is nothing 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.450
 interesting there and he spends it counting 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.759
 the days to be able to leave his town 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.399
 but everything changes when the town arrives 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.480
 they read the niece of the most feared man 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.870
 of the people the thing here is that 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.820
 Elena is not new to and such is the girl 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 of your dreams or your nightmares 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.920
 but apart from the relationship between gypsy 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.670
 and Lena goes further has the story of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.950
 the castellers and elena is worried 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.829
 because there is a curse in his family 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.690
 It is waiting for the day's birthday 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.940
 he's really not waiting because he does not 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.230
 wants that day arrives and when she 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.480
 he is 16 years old 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.519
 that day they will call you, see if you are going to 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.519
 go to light or you will see darkness 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.380
 if they want to know where it's worth 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.880
 Well, you have to read the book 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.700
 I read this book for the first time 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.530
 February 2013 or a year ago and what 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.970
 I read more than anything because of the movie because 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.920
 I saw the trailer of the movie and said 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.780
 I have to read the book before good the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.939
 movie is very different from the book 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.530
 totally changed many things 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.479
 in fact right now I 'm living all 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.569
 the saga had to read again more 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.909
 scriptures because I was a bit 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.579
 confused with the movie for example 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.390
 the end of the movie is not the same 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.909
 that the book then was a bit like that 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.830
 that as I needed to clarify that I had to 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.670
 read it again and right now I'm reading 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.670
 beautiful darkness 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.229
 the first time I read the book I 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.350
 loved it was how I really liked that 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.360
 was written by the guy and not by 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.100
 the ax goes as they are commonly 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.479
 written most of the books but 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.549
 later I remembered that there is also 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.020
 percy jackson I really liked all the 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.299
 world that offers us to walk if there 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.989
 margaret stohl unfortunately in this 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.330
 I took a lot of time to 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.190
 finish it I do not know if it was because as I already 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.910
 I knew what was going to happen was 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.470
 like there was not that anxiety to follow 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.970
 reading because you already knew what it is that 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.080
 I still liked the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.780
 characters I think it's very funny the 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.560
 true that as everyone as we all know 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.290
 In a village there are always all kinds of 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.610
 people not eh and in beautiful creatures not 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.590
 is the exception let's say it is not 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.810
 writing is a romance novel 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.239
 paranormal to me it makes me a very good 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.150
 plot liked how everything unfolded and 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.760
 that end is although it's a bit 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.470
 it's fine because it 's the first book and 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.569
 it has to be introductory that they have 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.180
 have to explain all things because 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.310
 example one how you edit is a bit on 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.040
 white says wait for me they're home 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.590
 are these that are other because good 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.540
 That's when you 're new to something. 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.209
 I really like how much fun it is and so and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.329
 so it's super witty funny I do not know 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.049
 I really like and I detail 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:17.299
 loved it was that her mom even though she's not 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.830
 your mom in this story but and so you 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.440
 talk a lot about her 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.210
 I loved the detail that mom 's 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.890
 lita did not use anything like 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.960
 book separator many are 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.700
 will ask why and so fall in love with 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.190
 Helena, well , falls in love with Helena 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.200
 because it is very beautiful the truth is 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.660
 pretty the girl and it's a little 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.460
 mysterious and it's totally different to 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.870
 everything there and well I hope that 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.850
 give you a chance beautiful creatures 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.560
 and already read it I would like quite 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.060
 know what they think of him because of that 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.590
 I love them very much and then we 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.590
