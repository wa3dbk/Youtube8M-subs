I didn't build this from scratch I did
take<00:03:40.780> an<00:03:40.930> older<00:03:41.230> saw<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.820> fix<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:43.060> up<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.510> add

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
take an older saw and fix it up and add

take an older saw and fix it up and add
the<00:03:44.109> parts<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.950> to<00:03:45.670> make<00:03:45.910> it<00:03:46.180> into<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.630> much

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
the parts to it to make it into a much

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.009 
the parts to it to make it into a much
better<00:03:47.680> machine<00:03:48.310> overall<00:03:49.209> there<00:03:49.660> isn't<00:03:49.959> a

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
better machine overall there isn't a

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.740 
better machine overall there isn't a
project<00:03:50.560> or<00:03:50.769> cast<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.489> do<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:52.239> doesn't

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
project or cast that I do that doesn't

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.680 
project or cast that I do that doesn't
involve<00:03:52.989> this<00:03:53.320> saw<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.980> use<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.549> every<00:03:55.030> time<00:03:55.269> I'm
