00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.880
 but from there we started a descent 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.950
 interesting please let's go to another 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.860
 in the water more than a dozen in water that 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.110
 they are at 20 thousand pesos per deer but 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.580
 after those you do not want to go 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.869
 Cristian Carlos what happens is that they are 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.240
 ranches that have a lot of infrastructure 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.940
 they are our who give you a lot they give you 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.350
 cases with great comfort but after 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.920
 of them I have about 12 ranches that 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.110
 they walk at 16 thousand pesos per deer there 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.310

 that know the ranches I think it is 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.760
 good time because still the deer 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.880
 easily a month or possibly a little 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.190
 more than a month they will bring their antlers I think 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.549
 it's time for you to evaluate that 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.590
 values as is the mount is very 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.139
 green even though we are in a 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.999
 winter and that tight at the end had 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.249
 ice cream but the world still has 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:24.050
 a lot of food that's important that the 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:27.879
 values ​​that you see under what conditions 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.229
 they finish the season of house 2013 14 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:33.620
 we are sure the people we are in 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.710
 this fauna management that this year 14 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.930
 will have a high birth rate equal 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.560
 will have a high survival rate of 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.639
 fawns and I think this will match 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.639
 with me many of you 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.820
 in this season that ended the 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.250
 2013-2014 many deer were seen 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.770
 juveniles or abundance of deer 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.470
 juveniles and absences of mature deer 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.070
 strongly agree believed then that 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:06.030
 these juvenile deer that are in the 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:09.240
 winter 13 14 and they are going to start the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.990
 2014-2015 hunting season for 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.330
 months of December of this year 14 for 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.980
 January 15 would be good trophies 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.020
 because there is a lot of food there is a lot of water 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.570
 They are animals that are not are not 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.110

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:31.170
 bad are coming out with a high 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.570
 percentage of pasture with the line of 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.980
 ramona or saturated food there is good 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.390
 coefficient of the calves the ranches 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.510
 They have a very high load capacity 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.300

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.340
