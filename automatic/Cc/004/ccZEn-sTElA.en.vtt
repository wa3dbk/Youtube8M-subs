00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.910 
of Duty games have been leaked in the
past<00:01:33.090> several<00:01:33.570> days<00:01:33.869> before<00:01:34.259> their<00:01:34.380> release<00:01:34.439> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
past several days before their release I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920 
past several days before their release I
believe<00:01:35.400> call<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> duty<00:01:35.970> ghosts<00:01:36.240> was<00:01:36.720> leaked

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
believe call of duty ghosts was leaked

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.510 
believe call of duty ghosts was leaked
about<00:01:37.079> five<00:01:37.470> days<00:01:37.740> before<00:01:37.770> its<00:01:38.189> initial

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
about five days before its initial

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.850 
about five days before its initial
release<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.000> black<00:01:39.570> ops<00:01:39.780> 2<00:01:40.020> was<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:40.439> seven

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
release and black ops 2 was about seven

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.770 
release and black ops 2 was about seven
days<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.759> imagine<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.150> Activision

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
days so you can imagine that Activision

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510 
days so you can imagine that Activision
and<00:01:42.990> sledgehammer<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.829> trying<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.310> their

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and sledgehammer are trying to do their

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.310 
and sledgehammer are trying to do their
best<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:45.000> try<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.479> prevent<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.869> possible

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
best to try and prevent the possible

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.380 
best to try and prevent the possible
league<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.649> advanced<00:01:47.009> warfare<00:01:47.579> however<00:01:48.180> they

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
league of advanced warfare however they

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.480

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
reason that I say this is that because a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.840 
reason that I say this is that because a
