measures the second four measures in the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.220 
measures the second four measures in the
third<00:00:23.789> four<00:00:24.029> measures<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.660> three<00:00:24.930> different

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
third four measures are three different

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.620 
third four measures are three different
pieces<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.859> blues<00:00:26.189> puzzle<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:27.269> first

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
pieces of this blues puzzle the first

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.980 
pieces of this blues puzzle the first
part<00:00:28.250> is<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> one<00:00:30.359> chord<00:00:30.660> four

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
part is going to be the one chord four

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.849 
part is going to be the one chord four
times<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.470> row

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
times in a row

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.470 
times in a row
okay<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.030> aaaa<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.380> instance<00:00:35.030> the<00:00:36.030> second

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
okay so aaaa for instance the second

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.299 
okay so aaaa for instance the second
part<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.500> introduce<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.100> four

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
part is going to introduce the four

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.069 
part is going to introduce the four
chord<00:00:38.610> which<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> go<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.510> four<00:00:39.780> one

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
chord which is going to go for four one

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.319 
chord which is going to go for four one
one<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.129> case<00:00:41.340> would<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.640> D<00:00:41.850> da<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
one which in this case would be D da a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.139 
one which in this case would be D da a
and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> last<00:00:44.040> section<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.640> last<00:00:44.910> four

and then the last section the last four

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.369 
and then the last section the last four
measures<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:45.840> refer<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
measures are what we refer to as the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.500 
measures are what we refer to as the
turnaround<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.190> part<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> go<00:00:48.149> five

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
turnaround that part is going to go five

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.720 
turnaround that part is going to go five
four<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.469> five<00:00:50.660> five<00:00:51.660> four<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.170> five<00:00:52.530> okay<00:00:52.949> so

the last part introduces the five chord
and<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> way<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> sound

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.510 

second<00:01:00.870> measure<00:01:02.600> third<00:01:03.600> measure

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
core progression is going to be and so

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.630 
core progression is going to be and so

is<00:02:00.819> I'm<00:02:00.969> going<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.119> take<00:02:01.329> a<00:02:01.390> progression<00:02:01.810> here

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
is I'm going to take a progression here

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.440 
is I'm going to take a progression here
this<00:02:02.619> one's<00:02:02.859> actually<00:02:03.159> in<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:03.579> key<00:02:03.789> of<00:02:04.060> G<00:02:04.420> I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
this one's actually in the key of G I

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.979 
this one's actually in the key of G I
believe<00:02:04.899> so<00:02:05.649> I'm<00:02:06.039> going<00:02:06.219> to<00:02:06.250> just<00:02:06.520> very<00:02:07.450> basic

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
believe so I'm going to just very basic

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.150 
believe so I'm going to just very basic
I'm<00:02:08.079> going<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.259> let<00:02:08.379> you<00:02:08.470> listen<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.769> me<00:02:08.950> play

I'm going to let you listen to me play

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:20.180 
I'm going to let you listen to me play
over<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.429> top<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.759> this

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.470 

so<00:02:20.580> here's<00:02:20.850> my<00:02:21.000> one

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:34.040 

now<00:02:24.110> here<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.319> was<00:02:24.410> my<00:02:24.500> 4<00:02:27.040> back<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.190> my<00:02:28.280> wand

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.450 

there's<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.140> one<00:02:35.350> right<00:02:35.530> there<00:02:35.710> -<00:02:35.890> here<00:02:36.310> comes

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
there's a one right there - here comes

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.280 
there's a one right there - here comes
my<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:36.850> now

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.930 

because<00:02:44.290> my<00:02:44.470> wand

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.619 

here's<00:02:52.940> my<00:02:53.150> five

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.570 

here's<00:02:58.200> four<00:02:59.810> back<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.049> one

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.220 

to<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.700> four<00:03:04.970> core<00:03:05.210> or<00:03:05.690> excuse<00:03:05.900> me<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.990> five

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
to the four core or excuse me the five

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.040 
to the four core or excuse me the five
four<00:03:06.470> tier<00:03:06.650> comes

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
four tier comes

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.730 
four tier comes
nice<00:03:08.800> turn<00:03:09.040> longer

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.850 

there's<00:03:14.950> my<00:03:15.040> four<00:03:15.310> core<00:03:18.150> 1c<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:19.660> again<00:03:19.900> that's

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
there's my four core 1c so again that's

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.260 
there's my four core 1c so again that's
enough<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.370> but<00:03:21.520> but<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.880> gives<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.150> the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
enough of that but but it gives you the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.100 
enough of that but but it gives you the
idea<00:03:22.300> so<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:23.140> start<00:03:24.130> having<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.610> purpose<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.960> my

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
idea so I start having a purpose to my

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.680 
idea so I start having a purpose to my
visualization<00:03:27.010> I'm<00:03:27.460> visualizing<00:03:28.000> G<00:03:28.450> minor

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
visualization I'm visualizing G minor

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.680 
visualization I'm visualizing G minor
pentatonic<00:03:29.730> but<00:03:30.730> now<00:03:30.880> all<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.180> sudden<00:03:31.210> I'm

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
pentatonic but now all of a sudden I'm

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.510 
pentatonic but now all of a sudden I'm
listening<00:03:32.560> for<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.860> first<00:03:33.130> time<00:03:33.340> I'm

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
listening for the first time I'm

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.190 
listening for the first time I'm
listening<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.300> chord<00:03:34.570> progression<00:03:34.630> and

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
listening to that chord progression and

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.640 
listening to that chord progression and
I'm<00:03:35.890> responding<00:03:36.750> still<00:03:37.750> with<00:03:37.900> logic<00:03:38.350> I'm<00:03:38.500> not

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
I'm responding still with logic I'm not

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.290 
I'm responding still with logic I'm not
I'm<00:03:38.890> not<00:03:38.950> just<00:03:39.280> going<00:03:39.430> totally<00:03:39.880> inward<00:03:40.120> yet

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300

I'm not just going totally inward yet
but<00:03:40.450> I'm<00:03:40.570> responding<00:03:41.080> with<00:03:41.290> logic<00:03:41.710> over<00:03:41.890> that

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
but I'm responding with logic over that

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.220 
but I'm responding with logic over that
one<00:03:42.760> chord<00:03:43.060> I'm<00:03:43.240> going<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.510> look<00:03:43.630> for<00:03:43.780> some<00:03:43.900> G's

the chord progression that you're

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.110 
the chord progression that you're
playing<00:04:03.220> over<00:04:03.460> whether<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:03.910> blues

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
playing over whether it's a blues

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.670 
playing over whether it's a blues
progression<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.690> poplar<00:04:05.170> ish<00:04:05.290> and<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.500> rock

the reason why we start there all the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.920 
the reason why we start there all the
time<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.680> because<00:04:11.710> when<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.280> say<00:04:12.580> blues<00:04:12.940> the

it<00:04:34.630> just<00:04:34.870> might<00:04:35.020> be<00:04:35.050> in<00:04:35.320> b-flat<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.070> next

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
it just might be in b-flat and the next

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.740 
it just might be in b-flat and the next
one<00:04:36.430> might<00:04:36.580> be<00:04:36.610> in<00:04:36.730> G<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.330> next<00:04:37.480> one<00:04:37.600> might

in<00:04:40.000> different<00:04:40.270> keys<00:04:40.450> but<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:41.170> progression

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
in different keys but the progression

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.860 
in different keys but the progression
itself<00:04:41.980> is<00:04:42.130> pretty<00:04:42.280> much<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.700> same<00:04:42.910> so<00:04:43.600> blues

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
itself is pretty much the same so blues

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.410 
itself is pretty much the same so blues
is<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.140> great<00:04:44.610> introduction<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:46.030> learning<00:04:46.180> how

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
is a great introduction to learning how

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.740 
is a great introduction to learning how
to<00:04:46.720> solo<00:04:47.200> um<00:04:48.000> because<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.330> can<00:04:49.510> anticipate

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
to solo um because you can anticipate

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.110 
to solo um because you can anticipate
the<00:04:50.140> changes<00:04:50.170> easier<00:04:50.830> or<00:04:51.340> when<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.520> say<00:04:51.760> solo

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
the changes easier or when I say solo

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.600 
the changes easier or when I say solo

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
pentatonic okay and now we've started

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.200 
pentatonic okay and now we've started
adding<00:05:13.630> in<00:05:13.960> chords<00:05:14.740> we<00:05:15.220> can<00:05:15.430> see<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.910> six

essential chords on this on the guitar

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.970 
essential chords on this on the guitar
in<00:05:18.460> whatever<00:05:18.940> key<00:05:19.240> we're<00:05:19.360> going<00:05:19.390> to<00:05:19.510> be<00:05:19.690> in

we keep going but I don't have to go to

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.620 
we keep going but I don't have to go to
the<00:05:32.560> root<00:05:32.740> on<00:05:32.920> the<00:05:32.950> beat<00:05:33.280> one<00:05:33.520> I<00:05:33.850> don't<00:05:34.450> know

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
the root on the beat one I don't know

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.630 
the root on the beat one I don't know
what<00:05:34.900> I<00:05:34.930> have<00:05:35.170> to<00:05:35.200> go<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.560> root<00:05:35.740> do<00:05:36.340> I<00:05:36.400> have

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
what I have to go to the root do I have

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.450 
what I have to go to the root do I have
to<00:05:36.820> follow<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.210> roots<00:05:37.420> every<00:05:37.810> time<00:05:38.080> no<00:05:38.950> I<00:05:38.980> mean

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
to follow the roots every time no I mean

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.130 
to follow the roots every time no I mean
sometimes<00:05:39.730> I<00:05:40.030> might<00:05:40.210> just<00:05:40.390> be<00:05:40.510> playing<00:05:40.810> and<00:05:41.110> I

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
sometimes I might just be playing and I

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.320 
sometimes I might just be playing and I
go<00:05:41.320> into<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.590> lick<00:05:42.190> or<00:05:42.400> an<00:05:42.520> idea<00:05:42.850> and<00:05:42.940> maybe<00:05:43.210> I

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
go into a lick or an idea and maybe I

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.090 
go into a lick or an idea and maybe I
keep<00:05:43.570> repeating<00:05:43.750> something<00:05:44.260> watch<00:05:44.860> this

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
keep repeating something watch this

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.920 
keep repeating something watch this
let's<00:05:45.400> say<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.550> kept<00:05:45.820> going<00:05:45.940> here<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.630> I<00:05:46.720> would

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
let's say I kept going here and I would

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.480 
let's say I kept going here and I would
instead<00:05:47.440> of<00:05:47.560> following<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.860> chords<00:05:48.190> I<00:05:48.280> start

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
instead of following the chords I start

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.530 
instead of following the chords I start
doing<00:05:48.550> this

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:04.590 

you

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.580 

something<00:06:05.600> whatever<00:06:05.810> right<00:06:06.110> I'm<00:06:06.259> just<00:06:06.380> kind

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
something whatever right I'm just kind

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.300 
something whatever right I'm just kind
of<00:06:06.650> freaking<00:06:07.280> out<00:06:07.370> there<00:06:08.440> all<00:06:09.440> of<00:06:09.979> a<00:06:10.039> sudden

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
of freaking out there all of a sudden

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.510 
of freaking out there all of a sudden
I'm<00:06:10.750> avoiding<00:06:11.750> the<00:06:12.080> roots<00:06:12.319> because<00:06:13.190> I'm<00:06:13.340> in<00:06:13.490> a

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
I'm avoiding the roots because I'm in a

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.370 
I'm avoiding the roots because I'm in a
moment<00:06:13.970> and<00:06:14.090> I'm<00:06:14.210> doing<00:06:14.539> something<00:06:14.990> right

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
moment and I'm doing something right

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.930 
moment and I'm doing something right
right<00:06:15.800> there<00:06:15.979> I'm<00:06:16.069> using<00:06:16.220> licks<00:06:16.669> and<00:06:16.849> I'm

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
right there I'm using licks and I'm

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.059 
right there I'm using licks and I'm
using<00:06:17.120> patterns<00:06:17.720> to<00:06:18.139> create<00:06:18.470> some<00:06:18.770> tension

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:19.069 
using patterns to create some tension

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:21.790 
using patterns to create some tension
and<00:06:19.460> some<00:06:20.120> aggression<00:06:20.539> but<00:06:21.349> when<00:06:21.470> I<00:06:21.500> come<00:06:21.770> out

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
and some aggression but when I come out

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.140 
and some aggression but when I come out
of<00:06:22.069> that<00:06:22.190> again<00:06:22.460> I'm<00:06:22.639> going<00:06:22.729> to<00:06:22.789> want<00:06:23.000> to<00:06:23.060> go

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
of that again I'm going to want to go

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.839 
of that again I'm going to want to go
back<00:06:23.180> into<00:06:23.630> something<00:06:23.990> that<00:06:24.370> is<00:06:25.370> musical

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
back into something that is musical

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.680 
back into something that is musical
again<00:06:26.229> okay<00:06:27.259> so<00:06:27.800> completely<00:06:28.250> negating<00:06:28.940> the

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
again okay so completely negating the

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.029 
again okay so completely negating the
fact<00:06:29.960> that<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.229> chords<00:06:30.530> are<00:06:30.620> changing

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
fact that the chords are changing

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.350 
fact that the chords are changing
underneath<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.580> and<00:06:31.819> not<00:06:32.000> paying<00:06:32.270> attention

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
underneath you and not paying attention

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.689 
underneath you and not paying attention
to<00:06:32.780> those<00:06:32.900> chords<00:06:33.380> is<00:06:33.530> the<00:06:34.280> worst<00:06:34.490> thing<00:06:34.669> that

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
to those chords is the worst thing that

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.180 
to those chords is the worst thing that
you<00:06:34.820> could<00:06:35.000> possibly<00:06:35.030> do<00:06:35.690> that<00:06:36.530> doesn't<00:06:37.070> mean

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
you could possibly do that doesn't mean

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.010 
you could possibly do that doesn't mean
you<00:06:37.340> have<00:06:37.490> to<00:06:37.639> do<00:06:37.729> it<00:06:37.880> all<00:06:37.970> the<00:06:38.120> time<00:06:38.150> that's

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
you have to do it all the time that's

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.990 
you have to do it all the time that's
the<00:06:39.259> trick<00:06:39.590> is<00:06:39.800> learning<00:06:39.979> how<00:06:40.220> to<00:06:40.250> master<00:06:40.789> when

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
the trick is learning how to master when

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.580 
the trick is learning how to master when
to<00:06:41.150> move<00:06:41.270> in<00:06:41.509> and<00:06:41.660> out<00:06:41.750> of<00:06:41.960> these<00:06:42.080> layers<00:06:42.380> that

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
to move in and out of these layers that

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.740 
to move in and out of these layers that
I<00:06:42.650> just<00:06:42.889> spoke<00:06:43.070> of<00:06:43.280> all<00:06:43.849> of<00:06:44.330> these<00:06:44.449> different

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
I just spoke of all of these different

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.670 
I just spoke of all of these different
things<00:06:44.780> you're<00:06:45.020> going<00:06:45.139> to<00:06:45.199> start<00:06:45.380> learning

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
things you're going to start learning

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.529 
things you're going to start learning
about<00:06:45.740> when<00:06:46.310> do<00:06:46.430> I<00:06:46.490> do<00:06:46.580> this<00:06:46.849> and<00:06:46.910> when<00:06:47.389> should

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539 
about when do I do this and when should

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:49.629 
about when do I do this and when should
I<00:06:47.599> go<00:06:47.750> here<00:06:48.050> and<00:06:48.110> how<00:06:48.320> do<00:06:48.380> I<00:06:48.470> go<00:06:48.680> here<00:06:49.009> but<00:06:49.520> the

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
I go here and how do I go here but the

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.060 
I go here and how do I go here but the
first<00:06:49.880> thing<00:06:50.030> is<00:06:50.090> to<00:06:50.330> identify<00:06:50.449> them<00:06:51.050> and<00:06:51.169> know

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070 
first thing is to identify them and know

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.040 
first thing is to identify them and know
that<00:06:52.250> they<00:06:52.340> exist<00:06:52.789> if<00:06:53.090> you<00:06:53.690> don't<00:06:53.840> know<00:06:53.930> they

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
that they exist if you don't know they

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.999 
that they exist if you don't know they
exist<00:06:54.080> you're<00:06:54.470> not<00:06:54.590> going<00:06:54.710> to<00:06:54.800> use<00:06:54.889> them

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 
exist you're not going to use them

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.210 
exist you're not going to use them
anyway<00:06:55.340> right<00:06:55.580> so<00:06:56.409> let's<00:06:57.409> keep<00:06:57.560> going<00:06:57.860> here<00:06:58.070> I

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
anyway right so let's keep going here I

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.710 
anyway right so let's keep going here I
know<00:06:58.520> it's<00:06:58.820> a<00:06:58.880> lot<00:06:59.000> to<00:06:59.060> think<00:06:59.270> about<00:06:59.419> it<00:06:59.599> we're

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
know it's a lot to think about it we're

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.909 
know it's a lot to think about it we're
going<00:06:59.840> to<00:06:59.900> keep<00:07:00.050> going<00:07:00.289> you<00:07:00.590> can<00:07:00.620> ask

going to keep going you can ask

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.610 
going to keep going you can ask
questions<00:07:01.039> we<00:07:01.580> got<00:07:01.729> we<00:07:01.909> have<00:07:02.030> lots<00:07:02.330> of<00:07:02.620> stuff
