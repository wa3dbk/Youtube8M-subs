00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
to try to train it to fold in a

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.480 
to try to train it to fold in a
different<00:03:03.230> position<00:03:03.350> but<00:03:04.510> as<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.840> right<00:03:05.870> now

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
different position but as of right now
