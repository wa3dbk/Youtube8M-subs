00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hello, welcome in California to test the new 911

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It’s not that green model 911 S from 1970

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We’ll test that new model type 991 with that lime metallic color 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and carbon ceramic brakes

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and the 3.8 l 400 PS flat six with 7 speeds PDK gearbox

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Go inboard

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We have leather on dashboard and everywhere but it’s an option

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
here the PDK 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
In onboard compteur we have a GPS screen

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and a lot of informations like tire pression 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
chronometer and G force indicator 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
here we are on highway

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
in 7 speed at 2000 rpm for 80 mph 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
When I stop to push accelerator  I’m riding in freewheels 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
we have a lot of energy saving systems like stop and start and freewheels mode

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and that new model is 40 kg lighter although wider front way and longer wheelbase  

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and more equipments  

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Now I’m using sport exhaust  and sport gearbox

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
good music ! 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.300
how fast cornering !

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.300
ABS is perfect we can brake like pigs

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
we can accelerate early without understeering

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.300
easier but always attractive

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
brakes are biting and tough just amazing

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.300
no other sportcar has better brakes

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.300
PDK gearbox is very fast

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
now power steering is electric 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
even if we keep a good feeling it’s lighter and not as good as before 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the 3.8 flat six is singing it is unique

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
suspensions make very good job   
super springs super engine super gearbox super brakes  

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
absolute pleasure

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
if we drive slow we need 9,2 liters per 100 km

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and if we you go fast like that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
15,8 liters it’s not so high in fact
