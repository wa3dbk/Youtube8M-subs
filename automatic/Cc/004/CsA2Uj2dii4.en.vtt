is<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.240> such<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> kind<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
is because it's just such a kind of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.640 
is because it's just such a kind of
unusual<00:01:20.479> soup<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> first<00:01:22.200> had<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
unusual soup when I first had it I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
unusual soup when I first had it I
thought<00:01:22.799> there<00:01:22.979> might<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.130> cream<00:01:23.490> or

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
thought there might be cream or

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.800 
thought there might be cream or
something<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
something in it because of the the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.170 
something in it because of the the
almonds<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:26.520> blended<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
almonds just when blended with the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
almonds just when blended with the
garlic<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.380> bread<00:01:28.590> crumbs<00:01:28.890> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
garlic and with the bread crumbs that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560 
garlic and with the bread crumbs that
we're<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> introduce<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.939> minute<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
we're going to introduce in a minute it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.590 
we're going to introduce in a minute it
just<00:01:30.630> has<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.500> creamy<00:01:32.600> texture

and because it's a chilled soup it's
really<00:01:40.900> great<00:01:41.110> for<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.440> summer<00:01:42.330> especially

cider vinegar which is just adds a

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.399 
cider vinegar which is just adds a
little<00:01:54.970> bit<00:01:55.210> of<00:01:55.300> acidity<00:01:55.540> which<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.110> really

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
little bit of acidity which is really

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.660 
little bit of acidity which is really
nice<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.590> cut<00:01:56.920> through<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:57.159> creaminess<00:02:01.560> and

bread<00:02:05.020> crumbs<00:02:05.320> which<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.190> just<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:07.149> inside<00:02:07.600> of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
bread crumbs which is just the inside of

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.590 
bread crumbs which is just the inside of
some<00:02:08.050> sourdough<00:02:08.289> that's<00:02:08.679> got<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.039> bit<00:02:09.250> stale

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.430 

obviously<00:02:13.600> if<00:02:13.720> you're<00:02:13.870> making<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.410> a

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
obviously if you're making this on a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.870 
obviously if you're making this on a
bigger<00:02:14.650> scale<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.130> might<00:02:15.280> want<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.610> use<00:02:15.850> a

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
bigger scale you might want to use a

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.100 
bigger scale you might want to use a
bigger<00:02:16.120> blender<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:22.420> that's<00:02:22.600> basically<00:02:23.019> it

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
bigger blender and that's basically it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.199 
bigger blender and that's basically it
for<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.560> base<00:02:23.709> ingredients<00:02:24.459> now<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.730> only

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
for the base ingredients now the only

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.770 
for the base ingredients now the only
thing<00:02:25.390> we<00:02:25.480> need<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.660> add<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:26.019> water<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.760> if<00:02:28.630> you

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
thing we need to add is water so if you

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.150 
thing we need to add is water so if you
just<00:02:28.959> get<00:02:29.140> your<00:02:29.290> water<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.890> add<00:02:30.550> in<00:02:31.300> enough<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
just get your water and add in enough to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.729 
just get your water and add in enough to
moisten<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.269> then<00:02:35.200> give<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.590> blend

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
moisten it and then give it a blend

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.800 
moisten it and then give it a blend
there's<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.830> lot<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.040> blending<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.550> recipe

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.060 

right<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:43.840> think<00:02:44.019> that's<00:02:44.290> ready<00:02:44.470> so<00:02:44.709> it's<00:02:44.890> time

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
right I think that's ready so it's time

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.680 
right I think that's ready so it's time
to<00:02:45.250> get<00:02:45.370> some<00:02:45.549> bowls<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.090> chill<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.360> down<00:02:46.420> in

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
to get some bowls and chill it down in

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.890 
to get some bowls and chill it down in
the<00:02:46.750> fridge<00:02:48.030> okay<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.090> while<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.510> soups<00:02:49.720> are

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
the fridge okay so while the soups are

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.940 
the fridge okay so while the soups are
chilling<00:02:50.170> we're<00:02:50.290> going<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.560> get<00:02:50.650> on<00:02:50.769> with<00:02:50.799> the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
chilling we're going to get on with the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.650 
chilling we're going to get on with the
next<00:02:51.190> stage<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.610> recipe<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.269> add<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.420> bit<00:02:52.600> of

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
next stage of the recipe so add a bit of

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.140 
next stage of the recipe so add a bit of
texture<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.440> crunch<00:02:53.799> I'm<00:02:54.280> going<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.820> fry<00:02:55.120> some

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
texture and crunch I'm going to fry some

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.770 
texture and crunch I'm going to fry some
more<00:02:55.870> Chia<00:02:56.170> which<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.970> Spanish<00:02:57.970> blood<00:02:58.180> sausage

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780

more Chia which is Spanish blood sausage
okay<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.470> I'm<00:02:59.680> just<00:02:59.890> gonna<00:03:00.040> slice<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:00.489> up

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.370 
okay so I'm just gonna slice this up
quite<00:03:01.000> fine<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:03.900> think<00:03:04.900> that's<00:03:05.140> probably

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
quite fine I think that's probably

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.150 
quite fine I think that's probably
enough<00:03:07.019> I'm<00:03:08.019> just<00:03:08.200> gonna<00:03:08.290> peel<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.769> skin<00:03:09.040> off

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
enough I'm just gonna peel the skin off

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.340 
enough I'm just gonna peel the skin off
the<00:03:09.190> outside<00:03:09.430> as<00:03:09.910> well<00:03:10.230> traditionally<00:03:11.230> it's

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
the outside as well traditionally it's

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.280 
the outside as well traditionally it's
served<00:03:11.380> with<00:03:11.680> grapes<00:03:12.120> which<00:03:13.120> works<00:03:14.049> really

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
served with grapes which works really

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.960 
served with grapes which works really
well<00:03:14.500> or<00:03:14.799> you<00:03:15.070> could<00:03:15.220> do<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.370> with<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.549> sliced<00:03:15.820> up

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970
