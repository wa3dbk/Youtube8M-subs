 this is a video tutorial to start 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.570
 to play the 2012 simulator bus worth 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.520
 so 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.270
 let's start once there is the game of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.120
 video my channel is worth 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.310
 good in three you usually give a star 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.900
 game and it will load and the whole story 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:35.050
 it will leave you this is worth mainly 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.050
 to whom you put the name you want 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.550
 I'm not going to put my manolo 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:49.290
 You put if you want to be a girl or an uncle 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.290
 of an uncle here on the day of birth 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.780
 and you give it to continue now this is what 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.170
 most important of the game 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.769
 these numbers is the driver's number 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.520
 of the many that there are then you take a 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:10.150
 normal paper and you write down the numbers 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.150
 for now 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.650
 Okay, he took the paper and the notebook 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:30.620
 then you write down the numbers worth 53 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:32.990
 86 25 16 and you give to continue here 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.360
 choose the difficulty I'm going to do in 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.360
 Menezine is a beginner 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.110
 we choose the day 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.480
 today I better say 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.870
 so now if we give it to f 3 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.230
 we can choose the time 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.470
 it's worth the sun itself and now we're going 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:02.220
 the door to run the shift 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.300
 left to the doubles and so I went 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.010
 left 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.610
 vice here and you put in front 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.330
 of the device and you give a click is worth and 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.330
 open the doors 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.320
 we go here fast bus we tighten to the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.870
 ac to enter the bus now we continue 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.550
 the steps to the left of the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.550
 screen we press to the p 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.730
 we started everything we squeezed at once and 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.730
 here with the f 6 we can zoom in 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.709
 when leaving the view to f 8 to leave it 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.690

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.980
 and then to lower 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.000
 so it's worth to zoom in if 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:09.510
 millimetrically mind and up and you give the f 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.269
 12 to be saved is worth then 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:17.450

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.400
 when we have given the p and you see 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.590
 that the engine starts now with the 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.690
 numbers 1 and 2 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.270
 we close the door on 1 is to make 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.120

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.260
 OK 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.720
 we close it 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:22.010
 okay now tell us 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:25.180
 that to begin with we have the 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.180
 intermittent posts 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.760
 I do not care 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.340
 that to begin with we have to give the 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.840
 brake that is the down arrow now you 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.840
 we give the rival 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:44.090
 ok and change the march 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.710
 this the re page is worth what you have that 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.530
 have all of you on the nail and 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.510
 up or in the middle you have to 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.200
 give down arrow 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:58.250
 that sees and a key that puts re peace and we 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.370
 change the march or if there is no peace and we 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.080
 changes we change the way the ere 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.540
 what is it for to change forward 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.460
 and the ub the bird for what it is to change 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.400
 backwards it's worth we leave it in the 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.370
 okay now 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.139
 remove the parking brake is to tighten the 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.370
 arrow down and your brakes 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:24.759
 press the delete key and the 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:27.460
 I insert the insert and you see what it says 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.350
 parking break release means that 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.800
 we have removed the hand brake and you see 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.900
 as we start to go, it's worth then 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.300
 to put the hand brake as we do 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:41.039
 by the same movement down arrow 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.039
 brake delete key 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.830
 sorry to arrow down insert 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.699
 Y 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:55.729
 we would have the throne after the brake 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:59.750
 of hand since it would be down arrow 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:02.210
 insert and it would be the parking break that 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.300
 is the hand brake put to remove it 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.520
 so it's ok to accelerate by the arrow 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.460
 up and to rotate through the 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.940
 arrows are worth it now let's make a 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.900
 type of route worth we will continue the route 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.900
 you have to go here 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.970
 here 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.550
 now this 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.950
 and now you have to follow the red line 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.980
 fuck our key 

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.500
 have to follow the red line 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.460
 until you see good follow the red line and 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:44.280
 follow without seeing the line and on the map 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.260
 will put an h that is the stop there 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:50.900
 Okay, well you're friends and this is 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.900
 we're all going to do one thing before 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.750
 Y 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.510
 good as you see 

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.900
 It has not happened 

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:07.210
