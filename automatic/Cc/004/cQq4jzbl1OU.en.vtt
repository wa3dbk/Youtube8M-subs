hamsters are nocturnal so you probably

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.980 
hamsters are nocturnal so you probably
won't<00:00:20.580> be<00:00:20.760> seeing<00:00:21.060> much<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.300> him<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.840> this

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.810 
won't be seeing much of him in this
video<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.529> yes<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.310> his<00:00:23.490> cage<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:25.820> first

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.870 
video but yes this is his cage and first
of<00:00:27.029> all<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.830> hamster<00:00:28.830> should<00:00:29.039> always<00:00:29.640> always

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
of all a hamster should always always

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.950 
of all a hamster should always always
always<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.900> access<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:32.070> fresh<00:00:32.219> water<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
always have access to fresh water I

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.380 
always have access to fresh water I
don't<00:00:33.960> recommend<00:00:34.320> giving<00:00:34.680> water<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.969> an

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
don't recommend giving water in an

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.959 
don't recommend giving water in an
open-topped<00:00:37.140> dish<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.700> lot<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
open-topped dish because a lot of

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.530 
open-topped dish because a lot of
bacteria<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.960> start<00:00:40.260> growing<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.770> there<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
bacteria can start growing in there and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.030 
bacteria can start growing in there and
the<00:00:42.540> water<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.110> really<00:00:43.260> polluted<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the water can get really polluted I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.670 
the water can get really polluted I
guess<00:00:44.399> you'd<00:00:44.610> call<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.500> very

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
guess you'd call it so that's not very

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440 
guess you'd call it so that's not very
good<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.160> recommend<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.789> provide<00:00:48.180> water

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
good I recommend that you provide water

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.650 
good I recommend that you provide water
in<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.870> drinking<00:00:49.410> bottle<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.629> with<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
in a drinking bottle like that with a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.380 
in a drinking bottle like that with a
little<00:00:52.910> something<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:53.940> looks<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.329> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
little something that looks like that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.290 
little something that looks like that
and<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:56.370> changed<00:00:57.090> my<00:00:57.690> water<00:00:58.020> every<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.949> days<00:00:59.300> so

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and I changed my water every two days so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
and I changed my water every two days so
remember<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.079> hamsters<00:01:01.620> are<00:01:01.859> generally

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
remember that hamsters are generally

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.960 
remember that hamsters are generally
very<00:01:02.520> small<00:01:03.920> for<00:01:04.920> dwarf<00:01:05.129> hamsters<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.700> even

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
very small for dwarf hamsters are even

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580 
very small for dwarf hamsters are even
smaller<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.689> can't<00:01:06.900> drink<00:01:07.140> too<00:01:07.409> much

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
smaller so they can't drink too much

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.250 
smaller so they can't drink too much
water<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> day<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.600> since<00:01:10.049> I'll

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
water in a day so what I do since I'll

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.109 
water in a day so what I do since I'll
be<00:01:10.290> needing<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> change<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> water

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
be needing to change out the water

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.770 
be needing to change out the water
really<00:01:12.869> frequently<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:14.090> don't<00:01:15.090> fill<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.659> all

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
really frequently I don't fill it all

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.810 
really frequently I don't fill it all
the<00:01:15.869> way<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.890> top<00:01:16.920> every<00:01:17.400> time<00:01:17.610> because

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the way to the top every time because

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.460 
the way to the top every time because
then<00:01:18.119> I'll<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.630> wasting<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.110> lot<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.229> water

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
then I'll just be wasting a lot of water

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.070 
then I'll just be wasting a lot of water
I<00:01:19.740> probably<00:01:20.280> only<00:01:20.670> failure<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.210> halfway<00:01:21.479> or

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
I probably only failure like halfway or

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.550 
I probably only failure like halfway or
14<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.390> much<00:01:25.290> as<00:01:25.439> my

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
14 like up to there as much as my

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.120 
14 like up to there as much as my
hamster<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.130> drink<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.640> day<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:28.130> then

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
hamster can drink in a day and then

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.460 
hamster can drink in a day and then
that's<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.880> water<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> then<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.570> also<00:01:30.810> need

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.880 

a<00:01:33.530> food<00:01:34.070> bowl<00:01:34.370> like<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.730> and<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:36.200> don't

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
a food bowl like that and I don't

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.480 
a food bowl like that and I don't
recommend<00:01:37.280> making<00:01:37.790> your<00:01:38.180> own<00:01:38.210> hamster<00:01:39.080> mix

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
recommend making your own hamster mix

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.240 
recommend making your own hamster mix
because<00:01:41.020> you're<00:01:42.020> probably<00:01:42.170> not<00:01:42.710> going<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.070> get

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
because you're probably not going to get

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.150 
because you're probably not going to get
all<00:01:43.400> of<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.670> right<00:01:43.850> nutrition<00:01:44.660> and

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
all of the right nutrition and

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.380 
all of the right nutrition and
ingredients<00:01:46.160> for<00:01:46.370> hamster<00:01:46.820> that's<00:01:47.000> actually

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
ingredients for hamster that's actually

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.140 
ingredients for hamster that's actually
healthy<00:01:47.750> for<00:01:47.780> them<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:48.830> recommend<00:01:49.160> buying<00:01:49.790> a

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
healthy for them so I recommend buying a

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.100 
healthy for them so I recommend buying a
processed<00:01:51.100> dried<00:01:52.100> hamster<00:01:53.000> food<00:01:53.210> mix<00:01:53.540> from

your local pet store I think that's the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.540 
your local pet store I think that's the
