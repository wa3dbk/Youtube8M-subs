and in the 17th century and while I've
done<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> lot<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> study<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:06.090> archival<00:01:06.630> sources

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
craftsmen and what the workshop would

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.560 
craftsmen and what the workshop would
have<00:01:11.610> been<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.850> there's<00:01:12.240> no<00:01:12.360> way<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
have been like there's no way to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.929 
have been like there's no way to
transport<00:01:13.080> ourselves<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.890> time<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
transport ourselves back in time and to

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.940 
transport ourselves back in time and to
see<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.330> ourselves<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> closest

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
see it for ourselves so the closest

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
see it for ourselves so the closest
thing<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.189> would<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.570> know

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
thing we have would be you know

18th century they're much more creative
today<00:01:29.100> they<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> lot<00:01:29.820> more<00:01:30.140> ideas

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159

about<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:42.080> really<00:02:43.080> enjoyed<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.590> building

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
about and I really enjoyed the building

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.800 
about and I really enjoyed the building
and<00:02:46.130> woodturning<00:02:47.130> came<00:02:47.550> from<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:49.340> it's

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
and woodturning came from that it's

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:59.240 
and woodturning came from that it's
fairly<00:02:51.890> labor-intensive<00:02:58.010> it's<00:02:59.010> very

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
fairly labor-intensive it's very

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.040 
fairly labor-intensive it's very
constructed<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:01.670> I'm<00:03:02.670> kind<00:03:03.210> of<00:03:03.300> envious<00:03:03.540> about

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
constructed I I'm kind of envious about

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.860 
constructed I I'm kind of envious about
Turner's<00:03:04.710> work<00:03:05.070> who's<00:03:05.460> you<00:03:06.120> know<00:03:06.150> they<00:03:06.510> they

turn it all in one afternoon and it's
done<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.360> comes<00:03:09.570> off<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.810> lathe<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.560> there<00:03:10.770> it

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
done it comes off the lathe and there it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.820 
done it comes off the lathe and there it
is<00:03:11.040> it's<00:03:11.310> ready<00:03:11.550> it's<00:03:11.820> ready<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.900> carved<00:03:13.170> or

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
is it's ready it's ready to be carved or

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.090 
is it's ready it's ready to be carved or
or<00:03:14.280> some<00:03:15.210> other<00:03:15.360> enhancement<00:03:16.050> put<00:03:16.200> on<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.530> but

my<00:03:17.280> mind<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.880> little<00:03:18.090> different<00:03:18.570> because<00:03:19.140> of

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
my mind is a little different because of

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.050 
my mind is a little different because of
the<00:03:19.560> epoxy<00:03:20.130> I'm<00:03:20.250> also<00:03:22.100> waiting<00:03:23.100> for<00:03:23.580> for<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the epoxy I'm also waiting for for the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.000 
the epoxy I'm also waiting for for the
epoxy<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.660> set<00:03:24.930> up<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.410> there's<00:03:25.560> various

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
epoxy to set up and there's various

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.520 
epoxy to set up and there's various
procedures<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.880> I'm<00:03:27.030> using<00:03:27.300> that<00:03:27.630> just<00:03:28.050> take

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
procedures that I'm using that just take

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.860 
procedures that I'm using that just take
up<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.770> lot<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.950> time<00:03:29.280> there's<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.360> turning

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
up a lot of time there's the turning

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.410 
up a lot of time there's the turning
there's<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.680> there's<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.250> inlay<00:03:32.760> part<00:03:33.120> so

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
there's the there's the inlay part so

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.140 
there's the there's the inlay part so
before<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.440> piece<00:03:34.770> is<00:03:34.950> actually<00:03:35.490> turned<00:03:35.790> it's

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
before the piece is actually turned it's

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.840 
before the piece is actually turned it's
worked<00:03:36.420> quite<00:03:37.380> extensively<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.550> put<00:03:38.730> the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
worked quite extensively to put the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.600 
worked quite extensively to put the
epoxy<00:03:39.180> into<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.080> then<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.739> do<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.040> turning

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
epoxy into it and then I do the turning

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.540 
epoxy into it and then I do the turning
and<00:03:42.170> before<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.320> turning<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.830> completed<00:03:44.430> i

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
and before the turning is completed i

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.070 
and before the turning is completed i
put<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.300> overlay<00:03:45.900> on<00:03:46.670> turn<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.850> overlay<00:03:48.390> pop

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
put the overlay on turn the overlay pop

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.040 
put the overlay on turn the overlay pop
it<00:03:49.350> off<00:03:49.500> finish<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.550> inside<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.600> turning

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
it off finish the inside of the turning

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.400 
it off finish the inside of the turning
and<00:03:52.260> then<00:03:53.100> work<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.730> epoxy<00:03:55.700> piercing<00:03:56.700> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
and then work the epoxy piercing and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.520 
and then work the epoxy piercing and
texturing<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.610> then<00:03:59.610> painting<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.500> then<00:04:01.500> I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
texturing and then painting and then I

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.210 
texturing and then painting and then I
work<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.070> overlay<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:03.200> cut<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.590> shape<00:04:04.860> and

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
work the overlay and cut it to shape and

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.210 
work the overlay and cut it to shape and
pierce<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.910> texture<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.540> then<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.709> gets

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
pierce and texture it then it gets

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.400 
pierce and texture it then it gets
painted<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:09.000> put<00:04:09.150> back<00:04:09.390> on<00:04:09.690> then<00:04:10.140> there's<00:04:10.320> a

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
painted and put back on then there's a

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.220 
painted and put back on then there's a
frame<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.770> be<00:04:11.130> made<00:04:11.370> for<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.030> once<00:04:13.020> the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
frame to be made for it and once the

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.650 
frame to be made for it and once the
vessel<00:04:13.590> itself<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:14.250> finished<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:15.030> still<00:04:15.510> have

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
vessel itself is finished I still have

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.969 
vessel itself is finished I still have
the<00:04:15.780> stand<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.380> do<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:17.520> yeah<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.480> if<00:04:19.080> I<00:04:19.709> rush
