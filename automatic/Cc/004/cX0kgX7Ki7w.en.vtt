of very very few primate projects that
actually<00:02:19.910> has<00:02:20.120> this<00:02:20.390> kind<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.720> database<00:02:21.020> to

actually has this kind of database to
look<00:02:21.380> on<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:22.250> don't<00:02:22.400> know<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.420> much<00:02:23.600> about

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
look on we don't know that much about

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.650 
look on we don't know that much about
the<00:02:24.710> lifespan<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.850> white-faced<00:02:26.210> Capuchin

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the lifespan of a white-faced Capuchin

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.080 
the lifespan of a white-faced Capuchin
for<00:02:27.050> example<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:28.280> are<00:02:28.370> one<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.700> very<00:02:28.730> very

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
for example and we are one of very very

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.200 
for example and we are one of very very
few<00:02:29.390> projects<00:02:29.960> that<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:31.310> has<00:02:31.670> done<00:02:31.970> a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
few projects that have has done a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.480 
few projects that have has done a
long-term<00:02:32.810> study<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.950> reason<00:02:34.220> why<00:02:34.340> I'm

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
long-term study the reason why I'm

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.400 
long-term study the reason why I'm
actually<00:02:34.670> kind<00:02:35.300> of<00:02:35.360> running<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.810> separate

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
actually kind of running a separate

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.350 
actually kind of running a separate
project<00:02:36.560> from<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.040> broader<00:02:37.400> monkey<00:02:37.970> project

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
project from the broader monkey project

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.110 
project from the broader monkey project
is<00:02:38.510> because<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:38.960> have<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.110> very<00:02:39.530> different

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
is because we have a very different

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.750 
is because we have a very different
method<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.210> collecting<00:02:41.330> data<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:43.160> we<00:02:43.310> do<00:02:43.520> all

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
method of collecting data so we do all

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.000 
method of collecting data so we do all
day<00:02:44.030> follows<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:44.960> actually<00:02:45.530> follow<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.830> same

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
day follows we actually follow the same

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.100 
day follows we actually follow the same
individual<00:02:46.490> for<00:02:46.640> several<00:02:46.970> days<00:02:47.150> because

individual for several days because

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.170 
individual for several days because
really<00:02:48.410> are<00:02:48.680> we<00:02:49.190> really<00:02:49.280> interested<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.790> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
really are we really interested in the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.970 
really are we really interested in the
sequence<00:02:50.570> of<00:02:50.690> events<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:51.350> happen<00:02:51.740> in<00:02:51.860> their

lives because we want to know basically

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.980 
lives because we want to know basically
what<00:02:55.520> kind<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.760> stressors<00:02:56.270> they<00:02:56.450> experience

what kind of stressors they experience

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.140 
what kind of stressors they experience
and<00:02:57.320> how<00:02:57.830> they<00:02:58.040> deal<00:02:58.280> with<00:02:58.310> those<00:02:58.670> stressors

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
and how they deal with those stressors

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.930 
and how they deal with those stressors
and<00:02:59.360> follow<00:02:59.990> them<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.440> did<00:03:00.710> up<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.310> down<00:03:01.490> east

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
and follow them we did up and down east

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.880 
and follow them we did up and down east
and<00:03:02.240> west<00:03:02.510> north<00:03:02.990> to<00:03:03.230> south<00:03:03.440> heading

to be a very brave group they have a
tendency<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:51.800> turn<00:03:52.010> tail<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.370> run<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:54.950> blame

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
tendency to turn tail and run we blame

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.520 
tendency to turn tail and run we blame
it<00:03:55.340> on<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.550> alpha<00:03:55.850> male<00:03:56.030> but<00:03:56.360> it<00:03:57.080> could<00:03:57.350> be<00:03:57.440> the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
it on the alpha male but it could be the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.100 
it on the alpha male but it could be the
entire<00:03:57.770> group<00:03:58.300> but<00:03:59.300> today<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.660> guess<00:03:59.989> they

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
entire group but today I guess they

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.690 
entire group but today I guess they
decided<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.590> fig<00:04:00.800> was<00:04:00.950> worth<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.250> fight<00:04:01.489> and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
decided the fig was worth a fight and

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.330 
decided the fig was worth a fight and
they<00:04:02.239> turned<00:04:02.630> around<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.739> alpha<00:04:04.160> female

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
they turned around and the alpha female

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.630 
they turned around and the alpha female
and<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.300> alpha<00:04:05.600> male<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.989> beta<00:04:06.170> male

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
and the alpha male and the beta male

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.520 
and the alpha male and the beta male
charged<00:04:07.640> back<00:04:07.850> at<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.450> two<00:04:08.750> males<00:04:08.930> from<00:04:09.170> solos

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
charged back at the two males from solos

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.009 
charged back at the two males from solos
group<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:10.120> chased<00:04:11.120> them<00:04:11.300> off<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:11.690> we<00:04:11.780> kind<00:04:11.959> of

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
group and chased them off and we kind of

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.210 
group and chased them off and we kind of
went<00:04:12.170> back<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.530> forth<00:04:12.739> for<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:13.010> while<00:04:13.040> that

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
went back and forth for a while that

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.300 
went back and forth for a while that
went<00:04:13.670> there<00:04:14.570> a<00:04:14.600> fairly<00:04:15.140> evenly<00:04:15.680> matched<00:04:15.890> group

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
went there a fairly evenly matched group

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.729 
went there a fairly evenly matched group
i<00:04:16.489> guess<00:04:16.669> but<00:04:17.660> eventually<00:04:18.080> they<00:04:18.410> seemed<00:04:18.620> to

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
i guess but eventually they seemed to

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.480 
i guess but eventually they seemed to
come<00:04:18.890> to<00:04:19.100> some<00:04:19.609> sort<00:04:19.640> of<00:04:20.770> peaceable<00:04:21.770> situation

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
come to some sort of peaceable situation

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.940 
come to some sort of peaceable situation
because<00:04:22.910> Abby's<00:04:23.810> beard<00:04:24.110> off<00:04:24.260> towards<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.680> fig

because Abby's beard off towards the fig
and<00:04:25.250> solos<00:04:26.000> group

back<00:04:27.129> up<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.759> stream<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.270> we<00:04:28.389> were

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
back up the stream that we were

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.020 
back up the stream that we were
following<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:30.449> they're<00:04:31.449> pretty<00:04:31.629> alert<00:04:32.410> still

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
following and they're pretty alert still

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.610 
following and they're pretty alert still
they<00:04:34.030> seem<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.300> be<00:04:34.419> worried<00:04:34.690> about<00:04:34.810> a<00:04:35.229> return

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
they seem to be worried about a return

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.760 
they seem to be worried about a return
but<00:04:36.400> I've<00:04:37.090> seen<00:04:37.300> two<00:04:37.419> one<00:04:37.629> enough<00:04:38.560> for<00:04:38.740> now

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
but I've seen two one enough for now

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.270 
but I've seen two one enough for now
mainly<00:04:39.699> it's<00:04:40.060> it's<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.080> biology<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.159> the

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
mainly it's it's the the biology and the

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.670 
mainly it's it's the the biology and the
social<00:04:42.639> development<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.569> monkeys<00:04:43.990> but

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
social development of the monkeys but

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.730 
social development of the monkeys but
also<00:04:44.889> in<00:04:45.490> an<00:04:45.909> evolutional<00:04:46.479> aspect<00:04:46.960> you<00:04:47.470> can

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
also in an evolutional aspect you can

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.469 
also in an evolutional aspect you can
learn<00:04:48.009> a<00:04:48.039> little<00:04:48.310> bit<00:04:48.430> more<00:04:48.610> about<00:04:48.669> humans<00:04:49.330> I

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
learn a little bit more about humans I

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.020 
learn a little bit more about humans I
mean<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.169> span<00:04:50.379> between<00:04:51.030> white-faced

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
mean that the span between white-faced

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.839 
mean that the span between white-faced
Capuchin<00:04:52.509> and<00:04:52.659> humans<00:04:53.280> from<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.370> terms<00:04:54.759> of

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
Capuchin and humans from a terms of

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.670 
Capuchin and humans from a terms of
evolution<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.389> very<00:04:55.629> large<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:55.990> we<00:04:56.229> cut<00:04:56.409> you

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
evolution is very large so we cut you

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.320 
evolution is very large so we cut you
can't<00:04:56.949> watch<00:04:57.159> a<00:04:57.250> Capuchin<00:04:57.699> for<00:04:57.849> an<00:04:57.940> hour<00:04:58.060> and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
can't watch a Capuchin for an hour and

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.390 
can't watch a Capuchin for an hour and
say<00:04:58.840> I<00:04:58.870> know<00:04:59.020> something<00:04:59.680> about<00:04:59.740> humans<00:05:00.190> now

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
say I know something about humans now

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.309 
say I know something about humans now
and<00:05:00.669> they're<00:05:00.909> certainly<00:05:01.270> certain<00:05:01.840> basics

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
and they're certainly certain basics

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.939 
and they're certainly certain basics
that<00:05:02.590> are<00:05:03.099> the<00:05:03.340> same<00:05:03.520> throughout<00:05:03.940> or<00:05:04.150> species

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
that are the same throughout or species

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.439 
that are the same throughout or species
certain<00:05:05.949> drive<00:05:06.190> certain<00:05:06.520> motivations<00:05:07.210> the

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
certain drive certain motivations the

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.969 
certain drive certain motivations the
need<00:05:07.599> to<00:05:07.750> sleep<00:05:07.930> they<00:05:08.169> need<00:05:08.199> to<00:05:08.440> eat<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.830> need

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
need to sleep they need to eat the need

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.540 
need to sleep they need to eat the need
to<00:05:09.159> feed<00:05:09.430> that<00:05:09.729> need<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.349> reproduce<00:05:11.550> and

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
to feed that need to reproduce and

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.159 
to feed that need to reproduce and
protect<00:05:12.880> your<00:05:12.970> territory<00:05:13.120> as<00:05:13.569> we<00:05:13.720> science<00:05:14.050> we

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
protect your territory as we science we

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.540 
protect your territory as we science we
travel<00:05:14.470> back<00:05:14.560> it's<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:14.919> same<00:05:15.130> it's<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.490> same

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
travel back it's the same it's the same

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.629 
travel back it's the same it's the same
in<00:05:15.729> all<00:05:15.970> species<00:05:16.240> so<00:05:17.039> yeah<00:05:18.039> you<00:05:18.159> can<00:05:18.400> learn<00:05:18.580> a

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
in all species so yeah you can learn a

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.830 
in all species so yeah you can learn a
little<00:05:18.849> bit<00:05:18.940> more<00:05:19.120> about<00:05:19.240> yourself<00:05:19.300> but<00:05:19.750> you

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
little bit more about yourself but you

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.050 
little bit more about yourself but you
can't<00:05:20.050> like<00:05:20.289> make<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.919> direct<00:05:21.370> line<00:05:21.639> of<00:05:21.669> like

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
can't like make a direct line of like

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.839 
can't like make a direct line of like
okay<00:05:22.479> we<00:05:23.080> have<00:05:23.289> 20<00:05:23.830> years<00:05:23.979> of<00:05:24.039> Capuchin

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
okay we have 20 years of Capuchin

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.180 
okay we have 20 years of Capuchin
research<00:05:25.180> so<00:05:25.500> humans<00:05:26.500> are<00:05:26.620> like<00:05:26.770> this<00:05:26.919> they

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
research so humans are like this they

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.369 
research so humans are like this they
can't<00:05:27.400> do<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:27.699> it's<00:05:28.360> only<00:05:28.599> seven<00:05:28.990> thirty<00:05:29.259> in

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 
can't do that it's only seven thirty in

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.230 
can't do that it's only seven thirty in
the<00:05:29.500> morning<00:05:29.560> we've<00:05:30.009> been<00:05:30.159> hiking<00:05:30.340> since<00:05:30.789> five
