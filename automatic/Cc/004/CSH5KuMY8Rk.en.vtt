happening<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> our<00:00:33.690> friends<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.110> island

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
happening to our friends on the island

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
happening to our friends on the island
right<00:00:34.649> now<00:00:34.680> turns<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.610> they're<00:00:35.880> traveling

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
right now turns out they're traveling

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.720 
right now turns out they're traveling
through<00:00:36.540> time<00:00:36.800> every<00:00:37.800> time<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.250> bright<00:00:38.460> light

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
through time every time the bright light

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.549 
through time every time the bright light
flashes<00:00:39.270> BAM<00:00:39.629> they're<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.110> different<00:00:40.140> time

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
flashes BAM they're in a different time

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.470 
flashes BAM they're in a different time
yeah<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.340> what's<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.030> well

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
yeah I know what's up with that well

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
yeah I know what's up with that well
maybe<00:00:42.780> lock<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.320> help<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.920> travel<00:00:44.460> isn't

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
maybe lock can help time travel isn't

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.110 
maybe lock can help time travel isn't
confusing<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:46.230> our<00:00:46.500> destiny<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.820> it's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
confusing it's our destiny and it's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170 
confusing it's our destiny and it's
calling<00:00:49.050> us<00:00:49.379> no<00:00:49.770> Abel<00:00:50.219> we're<00:00:50.579> clearly<00:00:50.910> moving

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
calling us no Abel we're clearly moving

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.970 
calling us no Abel we're clearly moving
through<00:00:51.390> time<00:00:51.420> when<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> sky<00:00:52.050> fires<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.680> it's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
through time when the sky fires up it's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
through time when the sky fires up it's
been<00:00:53.100> happening<00:00:53.309> since<00:00:53.520> Alan<00:00:54.090> disappeared<00:00:54.600> in

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
been happening since Alan disappeared in

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.760 
been happening since Alan disappeared in
the<00:00:54.750> last<00:00:54.899> year's<00:00:55.379> finale<00:00:57.230> well<00:00:58.230> uh<00:00:58.260> this

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
the last year's finale well uh this

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.860 
the last year's finale well uh this
isn't<00:00:58.980> rocket<00:00:59.430> science<00:00:59.699> or<00:00:59.969> maybe<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> well

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
isn't rocket science or maybe it is well

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.090 
isn't rocket science or maybe it is well
let's<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.320> islands<00:01:01.649> resident

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
let's see if the islands resident

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.920 
let's see if the islands resident
physicist<00:01:02.609> Daniel<00:01:03.000> Faraday<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.750> clear

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
physicist Daniel Faraday can clear

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.609 
physicist Daniel Faraday can clear
things<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.700> we<00:01:05.700> an<00:01:06.060> island<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.930> slipping

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
things up we an island are slipping

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.190 
things up we an island are slipping
through<00:01:07.770> time<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> record<00:01:09.720> skipping

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
through time it's like a record skipping

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
through time it's like a record skipping
do<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> record<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.490> doesn't

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
do you know the record is it doesn't

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
do you know the record is it doesn't
matter<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.540> island<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> moving<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> time

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
matter the island is moving to a time

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.850 
matter the island is moving to a time
and<00:01:15.049> we<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.409> moving<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:18.380> Erika<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.680> does

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and we are moving with it Erika it does

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
and we are moving with it Erika it does
take<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> rocket<00:01:20.310> scientist<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> explain<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
take a rocket scientist to explain it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.690 
take a rocket scientist to explain it
who<00:01:21.540> knew<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.350> why<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.100> might<00:01:23.250> ask<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.549> all

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
who knew so why you might ask is all

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
who knew so why you might ask is all
this<00:01:23.820> happening<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.930> happening

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
this happening this is all happening

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.819 
this happening this is all happening
because<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:26.310> left<00:01:27.090> oh<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.259> then

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
because they left oh and because then

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.380 
because they left oh and because then
turn<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> giant<00:01:30.180> wield<00:01:30.740> lit<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> sky<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.180> how

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
turn a giant wield lit up the sky so how

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.560 
turn a giant wield lit up the sky so how
do<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> stop<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.579> bring<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.240> six

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
do you stop it we have to bring the six

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.620 
do you stop it we have to bring the six
who<00:01:36.990> were<00:01:37.200> rescued<00:01:37.829> back<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.240> island

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
who were rescued back to the island

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.090 
who were rescued back to the island
that's<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.829> plan<00:01:41.240> destiny<00:01:42.240> man<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:43.409> must<00:01:43.740> go

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that's the plan destiny man we must go

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.090 
that's the plan destiny man we must go
to<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.759> orchid<00:01:45.240> station<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.290> place<00:01:46.590> where<00:01:47.070> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
to the orchid station the place where it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700 
to the orchid station the place where it
all<00:01:47.340> started<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.570> after<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.170> clean<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.500> this

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
all started right after I clean up this

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.910 
all started right after I clean up this
bloody<00:01:50.070> nose
