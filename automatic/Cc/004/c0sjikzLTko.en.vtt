just<00:00:09.120> some<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.630> chainmail<00:00:09.960> bracelets

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
just some of the chainmail bracelets

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.990 
just some of the chainmail bracelets
that<00:00:10.620> I've<00:00:10.710> made<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.040> various<00:00:11.400> weaves<00:00:11.670> and

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
that I've made in various weaves and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.850 
that I've made in various weaves and
this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> weave<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.469> was<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
this is the weave that I was in the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.890 
this is the weave that I was in the
middle<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> learning<00:00:14.460> how<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.759> make<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.299> got<00:00:15.750> it

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
middle of learning how to make I got it

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.779 
middle of learning how to make I got it
as<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> kit<00:00:16.320> from<00:00:16.500> uncommon<00:00:16.920> gift<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> didn't

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
as a kit from uncommon gift and I didn't

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.460 
as a kit from uncommon gift and I didn't
have<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> tutorial<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.779> or<00:00:18.900> anything<00:00:19.109> but

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
have a tutorial for it or anything but

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.710 
have a tutorial for it or anything but
it<00:00:19.859> was<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.980> lot<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.250> fun<00:00:20.550> although<00:00:20.820> complicated

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
it was a lot of fun although complicated

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.880 
it was a lot of fun although complicated
and<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> finished<00:00:22.680> product

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and this is what the finished product

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.210 
and this is what the finished product
looks<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.359> now<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.779> video<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.470> not<00:00:25.920> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
looks like now this video is not a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.040 
looks like now this video is not a
tutorial<00:00:26.300> but<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.390> does<00:00:27.539> give<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> bit<00:00:28.019> of

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
tutorial but it does give you a bit of

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.679 
tutorial but it does give you a bit of
insight<00:00:28.529> into<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.070> process<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.090> maybe<00:00:30.390> for

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
insight into the process and maybe for

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.450 
insight into the process and maybe for
experience<00:00:31.349> chainmail<00:00:31.800> artists<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.250> could<00:00:32.369> be

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
experience chainmail artists it could be

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.760 
experience chainmail artists it could be
helpful<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.510> these<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.350> jump

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
helpful so these are the little jump

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.319 
helpful so these are the little jump

18<00:00:48.600> gauge<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.469> opening<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.070> purple<00:00:50.399> one

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
18 gauge so I'm opening up a purple one

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.779 
18 gauge so I'm opening up a purple one
and<00:00:50.700> sliding<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.329> two<00:00:51.780> aluminum<00:00:52.410> ones<00:00:52.730> this<00:00:53.730> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and sliding on two aluminum ones this is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.209 
and sliding on two aluminum ones this is
going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> become<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.989> basic<00:00:55.530> link<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.070> a2

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
going to become the basic link for a2

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.630 
going to become the basic link for a2
and<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.820> chain<00:00:57.180> maille<00:00:57.329> weave<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and to chain maille weave so there's the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.160 
and to chain maille weave so there's the
other<00:00:59.789> purple<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.719> where<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> get

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
other purple one this is where you get

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
other purple one this is where you get
the<00:01:01.260> two<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> two<00:01:01.739> there's<00:01:02.070> two<00:01:02.129> purples<00:01:02.820> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the two and two there's two purples and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.920 
the two and two there's two purples and
two<00:01:03.239> silvers<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.979> I'll<00:01:05.339> open<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:05.930> so

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
two silvers and then I'll open it up so

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
two silvers and then I'll open it up so
you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.650> voila

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you can see voila

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.810 
you can see voila
that<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> individual<00:01:11.310> links<00:01:11.670> on

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that is one of the individual links on

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.030 
that is one of the individual links on
this<00:01:12.210> weave<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.409> believe<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> called

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
this weave which I believe is called

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.910 
this weave which I believe is called
Celtic<00:01:14.970> spike<00:01:15.840> or<00:01:16.080> something<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.560> basically

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
Celtic spike or something it's basically

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
Celtic spike or something it's basically
a<00:01:17.040> variation<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> barrel<00:01:18.509> weave<00:01:18.720> I'm

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
a variation on the barrel weave I'm

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.649 
a variation on the barrel weave I'm
opening<00:01:19.920> two<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.850> little<00:01:21.119> purple<00:01:21.270> rings

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
opening two of the little purple rings

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.950 
opening two of the little purple rings
and<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.310> sliding<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and then sliding as you can see here a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.980 
and then sliding as you can see here a
little<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.729> sliding<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.030> two<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:27.630> link

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
little bit sliding the two and two link

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.350 
little bit sliding the two and two link
in<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> middle<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.670> chain<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.060> I'm<00:01:30.210> in

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
in the middle of the chain that I'm in

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
in the middle of the chain that I'm in
that<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> process<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.070> making<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that I was in the process of making and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.060 
that I was in the process of making and
sandwich<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.890> is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
sandwich in it so you can see this is

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.999 
sandwich in it so you can see this is
creating<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.820> barrel<00:01:36.360> weave<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:37.860> going

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
creating a barrel weave then I'm going

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.319 
creating a barrel weave then I'm going
to<00:01:38.070> fast<00:01:38.340> forward<00:01:38.460> through<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> bit<00:01:39.119> where<00:01:39.299> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
to fast forward through the bit where I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.690 
to fast forward through the bit where I
repeatedly<00:01:39.930> drop<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.470> jump<00:01:40.680> rings<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.159> hard

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
repeatedly drop the jump rings it's hard

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
repeatedly drop the jump rings it's hard
to<00:01:41.939> hold<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.920> getting<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> better

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
to hold all of this getting a better

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.280
