00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
Planet Earth is attacked by horrible huge monster with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.220
he's throwing chairs, smashing crockery,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.220
And, long story short, other stuff like that.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.480
Who will help us stop that insanity?!

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.040
SUPER SOSIAL RANGERS

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.360
SAVE THOSE WHO ARE IN DANGER

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.020
THEY WILL SAVE THE PLANET

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.420
WHILE YOU SURFING THE NET

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.480
Yo, we need to stop this alien bastard

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.440
if we will reach three hundred reposts here, we will win!

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.800
I created official page of this beast

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.000
and if it accumulates more likes, we'll tear him in peaces!

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.000
Hey you, cosmic bastard!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.900
I'm going to snap you, filter and post with hashtag "#corpse"!

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.800
Since when food takes photos of a food eater?!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.800
Ahh, no!

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.300
Damn alien, ate our friend and taking happy selfies here.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.800
You will never get "A+" assessment on your pictures, catch "F"!

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.240
I don't not need your assessments, I'm quite self-sufficient!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.400
He is chasing us, guys! It's just a trick to "gain classes"!

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.200
I do not understand why our methods fail?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.040
I have already accumulated five thousand likes, but the monster is still raging, as if nothing had happened.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.160
I'm marking it as spam as hard as I can but it does not help.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.920
We need to join forces and become one!

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.600
I have a better idea, we will join our forces and become one!

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.200
Uh, come on, stop copying me!

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.300
JOIN FORCES!

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.480
Hey, don't forget about me!

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.100
Who is that idiot?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.700
I am "My World Mail.Ru"!

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.280
Hahaha, how have you even got into the army?

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.620
I am "My World, Mail.Ru"!

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.500
Yes, we have already realized that you are "My world",...(untranslatable russian joke)..., haha!

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.140
Do you find it funny, huh ?!I appeared earlier than any of you and I'll make  you all squirm yet!

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.600
Oh, you are so funny! I just can't stop laughing, haha!

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.100
Oh!

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.360
Monster has stumbled
and died immediately!

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.400
WHAT AN ENDING!!!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Don't drink and drive

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.960
and be careful on a crosswalk

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.500
Excellent! Monster has been defeated

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.700
All because we united! I think, we learned some good leassons from this case .

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.600
Yes! We are the best! Come here guys, let's hug!

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.500
Uh, morons ...

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.200
And then, Mail.Ru bought VKontakte's stocks and gradually spread his influence all over the world.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.100
He washed and washed, and  brainwashed people ...

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.100
Facebook retired and began to raise his startups ...

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.440
And Odnoklassniki ...

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.700
Well ... I do not want to talk about it ...

00:02:24.760 --> 00:03:17.980
