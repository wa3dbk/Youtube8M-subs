00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
then it's become a steady steady part of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.709

first<00:00:39.719> thing<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.930> want<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.379> sit<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.710> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
first thing you want to do is sit on it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.110 
first thing you want to do is sit on it
get<00:00:41.010> stable<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.550> you're<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> fall

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
get stable so you're not going to fall

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.150 
get stable so you're not going to fall
off<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.140> then<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.559> walk<00:00:43.770> your<00:00:43.980> feet

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
off and then you just walk your feet

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.959 
off and then you just walk your feet
forward<00:00:44.219> roll<00:00:45.210> your<00:00:45.390> hips<00:00:45.600> forward<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.850> you're

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
forward roll your hips forward so you're

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.450 
forward roll your hips forward so you're
going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> keep<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.420> hips<00:00:48.600> low<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.370> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
going to keep your hips low and one of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.310 
going to keep your hips low and one of
the<00:00:50.520> big<00:00:50.730> reasons<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:51.989> here

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
the big reasons we like to do this here

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.910 
the big reasons we like to do this here
is<00:00:53.840> because<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.289> opens<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
is because it really opens up the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
is because it really opens up the
abdominals<00:00:56.579> more<00:00:57.420> than<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> traditional

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
abdominals more than a traditional

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.770 
abdominals more than a traditional
abduch<00:00:58.500> ABS<00:00:58.770> sit-up<00:00:59.550> would<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> keep

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
abduch ABS sit-up would do so you keep

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.319 
abduch ABS sit-up would do so you keep
your<00:01:00.960> hips<00:01:01.109> low<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:02.489> open<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:02.969> your<00:01:03.120> hips

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
your hips low you open up your hips

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.060 
your hips low you open up your hips
watch<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:04.290> chest<00:01:04.559> wide

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
watch your chest wide

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.760 
watch your chest wide
so<00:01:05.610> your<00:01:05.760> abs<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.330> stretching<00:01:06.840> more

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so your abs are really stretching more

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.679 
so your abs are really stretching more
than<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> full<00:01:08.220> inch<00:01:08.430> crunch<00:01:09.119> or<00:01:09.299> sit-up<00:01:09.330> would

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
than a full inch crunch or sit-up would

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.520 
than a full inch crunch or sit-up would
do<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.729> come<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.119> exhale<00:01:12.500> you're<00:01:13.500> going

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
do and then come up exhale you're going

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.770 
do and then come up exhale you're going
to<00:01:13.680> squeeze<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> top<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:20.390> again<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.570> like

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
to squeeze the top out again I like

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.300 
to squeeze the top out again I like
getting<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.380> good<00:01:22.619> stretch<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.130> this

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
getting a really good stretch on this

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.359 
getting a really good stretch on this
because<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.630> works<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.409> more<00:01:26.189> than

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
because it just works it in a more than

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.370 
because it just works it in a more than
a<00:01:26.400> full<00:01:26.700> range<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.420> great<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> it's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
a full range so it's great and it's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.450 
a full range so it's great and it's
great<00:01:28.590> great<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> back<00:01:29.460> too<00:01:31.159> that's<00:01:32.159> one

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
great great for the back too that's one

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.370 
great great for the back too that's one
of<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> reasons<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.299> become<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.810> popular<00:01:33.840> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
of the reasons it's become so popular is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.219 
of the reasons it's become so popular is
because<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.939> safety<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> back<00:01:36.930> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
because of the safety for the back and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.440 
because of the safety for the back and
it<00:01:37.799> takes<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.100> lot<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.250> pressure<00:01:38.549> off<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
it takes a lot of pressure off and it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.060 
it takes a lot of pressure off and it
really<00:01:39.659> stretches<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.290> app

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.870 

traditionally<00:01:44.070> you're<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.399> want<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> do
