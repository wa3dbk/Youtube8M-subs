00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.190
 hello friends of the alcatel community 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.209
 has 5 this time we bring you the 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.939
 review of the rom v 4 all this rom was 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.619
 thanks to the tak standing team that had 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.630
 extensive work on performance and 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.990
 sap to phoenix that was in the 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.659
 kitchen fix and contributed to the c5 and the staff 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.820
 by the beta test very well as we can 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.339
 observe the rom has a total 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.920
 appearance to kitkat including what is 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.090
 slide from the left side to the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.860
 right side we will have what it is 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.870
 options for widgets in this case I have 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.120
 added one for whatsapp and if 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.530
 we slide to the left side 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.060
 we will have what is an access to 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.270
 camera which will unlock us the 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.670
 device and it will redirect us to the camera 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.370
 as you can see the camera works 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.840
 well it has all the functions and even 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.840
 the front camera works 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.360
 in this rum there are no problems for the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.070
 flash and it even has what is a 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.320
 small approach before taking a 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.540
 Photography 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.000
 as we can see has what is the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.860
 nova launcher that gives a touch of kit 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.750
 kat and equally brings all the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.850
 pre-installed kitkat applications 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.910
 including play music as our 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.550
 default player as we can 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.130
 observe in settings has what it is in 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.830
 the interface part a full range 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.840
 for customization 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.460
 in which is a good detail since 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.000
 this rom is designed so much for 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.850
 personalization for gaming and networks 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.479
 social as we can see what it is in 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.479
 Applications 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.430
 we can notice that they have left us or we 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.680
 have allowed applications to move 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.900
 directly to our microsd card 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.390
 in this case as you can see 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.340
 I have one of 16 I have space in half 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.320
 but still I can move all the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.630
 applications without problems 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.909
 going to what is the branch this rom 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.360
 it has a very good ram cleaning 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.220
 you can see I have 228 free megabytes 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.590
 works very well with social networks 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.400
 as you can see when starting to 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.110
 after turning on the phone and they are the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.120
 processes that start together with the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.370
 phone which is very optimized 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.110
 for the moment of wanting to do something of 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.840
 gaming 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.020
 happening to what the system is still 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.670
 we have our system 4.2.2 but 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.190
 in this case it brings what is the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.080
 Kitkat animations to give you a 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.080
 total appearance to this system 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.940
 happening what is ram memory has 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.620
 what is your memory that has 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.330
 three hundred and sixty nine that the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.500
 truth is very good to have better 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.500
 performance in games 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.190
 based on the applications brings what 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.500
 are all the stock as before 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.470
 mentioned of kitkat as in what is 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.080
 google calendar and part 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.420
 of the default browser brings us what 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.580
 that is a browser that the truth is very 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.080
 fluid when navigating this 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.450
 I thought it was a good detail that brings 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.580
 for full-screen navigation and 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.690
 even a night mode for those times 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.690
 that we sail in the night 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.290
 based on performance in social networks 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.150
 that all services are very fluid 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.739
 without any problem and even what is 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.930
 in gaming I 've tried it with the need 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.909
 for speed most wanted and gives a 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.790
 very good game experience the 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.400
 true fluent inlac and then the truth 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.230
 it's worth trying this rom 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.790
 well that was everything if you liked to give 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.799
 like and share to help the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.519
 alcatel community says goodbye to his friend 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.519
 it will be 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.720
 and I 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.310
 dv 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.270
 good
