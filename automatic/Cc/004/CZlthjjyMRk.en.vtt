00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.240 
what you call him the commentating style
I<00:00:52.829> guess<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.129> would<00:00:53.219> say<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:54.530> felt<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.620> my

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
I guess you would say I felt that my

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250 
I guess you would say I felt that my
commentary<00:00:57.030> style<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
commentary style as it was was not that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
commentary style as it was was not that
great<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> decided<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.399> up<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.699> ante<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
great and so I decided to up the ante a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.209 
great and so I decided to up the ante a
bit<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.050> would<00:01:01.320> call<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> wager<00:01:01.980> match

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
bit as you would call in a wager match

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.410 
bit as you would call in a wager match
and<00:01:02.870> come<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.170> different<00:01:04.589> styles<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:06.150> I'm
