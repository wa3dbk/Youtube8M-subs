came<00:03:18.030> unraveled<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.560> mainly<00:03:20.370> because<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
they lose 26 25 but it was certainly a

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.060 
they lose 26 25 but it was certainly a
tale<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.820> two<00:03:26.850> halves<00:03:27.209> well<00:03:27.930> Jamal<00:03:28.560> small<00:03:28.890> the
