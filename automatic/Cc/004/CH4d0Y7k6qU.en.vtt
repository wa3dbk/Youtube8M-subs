guided tour of the controls and some
other<00:00:26.640> features<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.330> instrument<00:00:29.300> so

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
other features of the instrument so

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.999 
other features of the instrument so
right<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:30.689> we've<00:00:30.840> got<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> set<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.470> nice<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
right now we've got it set up nice and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.940 
right now we've got it set up nice and
flat<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.690> there<00:00:33.690> are<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.469> everything's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
flat on there are up and everything's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.290 
flat on there are up and everything's
pretty<00:00:35.130> much<00:00:35.250> nominal<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> controls<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
pretty much nominal on the controls and

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.290 
pretty much nominal on the controls and
because<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.329> its<00:00:39.660> extended<00:00:40.579> 35<00:00:41.579> inch<00:00:41.790> scale<00:00:42.030> on

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
because of its extended 35 inch scale on

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.709 
because of its extended 35 inch scale on
the<00:00:42.450> low<00:00:42.629> B<00:00:42.870> string<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.590> pretty<00:00:43.890> good

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
the low B string we have a pretty good

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.650 
the low B string we have a pretty good
sustain<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.620> particular<00:00:47.370> end<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
sustain on that particular end of the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.439 
sustain on that particular end of the
range<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.039> had<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> low<00:00:51.000> pitch<00:00:51.210> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
range so if we had a low pitch you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:00.380 
range so if we had a low pitch you
drinking<00:00:51.780> for<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.230> bit

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.139 

it's<00:01:00.690> pretty<00:01:00.960> tight<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:07.310> is<00:01:08.310> well-defined

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
it's pretty tight and is well-defined

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.960 
it's pretty tight and is well-defined
nice<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.080> clean

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:26.420 

and<00:01:16.850> similarly<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.510> know<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:26.160> do<00:01:26.280> have

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
and similarly the you know so we do have

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
and similarly the you know so we do have
a<00:01:26.490> lot<00:01:26.760> of<00:01:26.790> nice<00:01:27.630> tension<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> lower

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
a lot of nice tension on the lower

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.280 
a lot of nice tension on the lower
strings<00:01:29.010> so<00:01:29.340> they<00:01:29.520> kind<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> feel<00:01:30.290> evenly

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
strings so they kind of feel evenly

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.780 
strings so they kind of feel evenly
tension<00:01:31.770> from<00:01:31.980> the<00:01:32.040> sea<00:01:33.030> down<00:01:33.300> to<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:34.020> low<00:01:34.200> B

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
tension from the sea down to the low B

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
tension from the sea down to the low B
what<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.910> have<00:01:36.120> in<00:01:36.390> controls<00:01:36.870> is<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.860> button

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
what we have in controls is this button

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.960 
what we have in controls is this button
set<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.970> master<00:01:39.500> volume<00:01:40.820> we<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:41.940> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
set up as a master volume we have a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.770 
set up as a master volume we have a
blend<00:01:42.330> control<00:01:42.870> between<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> two<00:01:43.410> pickups

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
blend control between the two pickups

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.260 
blend control between the two pickups
here's<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.900> high<00:01:46.170> mid<00:01:46.470> low<00:01:46.950> mid<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
here's a high mid low mid and this is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.260 
here's a high mid low mid and this is
treble<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.230> bass<00:01:50.030> our<00:01:51.030> two<00:01:51.240> switches<00:01:51.540> here

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
treble and bass our two switches here

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.900 
treble and bass our two switches here
are<00:01:54.470> control<00:01:55.470> each<00:01:55.650> pickup<00:01:56.100> independently

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
are control each pickup independently

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.820 
are control each pickup independently
and<00:01:57.600> each<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.550> switch<00:01:59.850> from<00:02:00.830> parallel

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
and each one can switch from parallel

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.370 
and each one can switch from parallel
single<00:02:02.490> coil<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.060> series<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:04.020> mix<00:02:04.229> it

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
single coil to series so you can mix it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.710 
single coil to series so you can mix it
much<00:02:04.620> these<00:02:05.280> guys<00:02:05.520> also<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.270> with<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:09.630> know

South American wood with a lot of maple

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.570 
South American wood with a lot of maple
the<00:02:27.480> fretboard<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:28.170> Asian<00:02:28.470> ebony<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.280> inlay

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
the fretboard is Asian ebony the inlay

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.729 
the fretboard is Asian ebony the inlay
is<00:02:29.790> still<00:02:30.150> snail<00:02:30.810> shell<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> couple

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
is still snail shell and I have a couple

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.010 
is still snail shell and I have a couple
of<00:02:34.890> locations<00:02:35.250> for<00:02:35.640> stop<00:02:35.910> buttons<00:02:36.360> gives<00:02:36.930> you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
of locations for stop buttons gives you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.290 
of locations for stop buttons gives you
different<00:02:37.370> balance<00:02:38.370> there's<00:02:38.640> one<00:02:38.820> right<00:02:39.000> here

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
different balance there's one right here

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.479 
different balance there's one right here
in<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.420> center<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.500> there's<00:02:40.709> one<00:02:40.890> further<00:02:41.160> up

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
in the center and there's one further up

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.850 
in the center and there's one further up
so<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:42.000> player<00:02:42.600> has<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> choice<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.410> switching

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
so we player has a choice of switching

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.199 
so we player has a choice of switching
from<00:02:43.890> one<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.370> other<00:02:44.459> depending<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:45.030> what

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
from one to the other depending on what

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.990 
from one to the other depending on what
works<00:02:45.420> fast<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:47.160> strings<00:02:47.459> are<00:02:47.610> retained

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
works fast the strings are retained

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.400 
works fast the strings are retained
really<00:02:48.360> easily<00:02:48.660> at<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.800> end<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:51.110> set<00:02:52.110> screw

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
really easily at this end with set screw
