gonna be talking about morphtronics

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.889 
gonna be talking about morphtronics
we're<00:00:32.940> trying<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.239> spell<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.480> favorite<00:00:33.750> art

types<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.290> course<00:00:34.469> from<00:00:34.649> 5ds<00:00:35.130> they're

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
types of course from 5ds they're

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.400 
types of course from 5ds they're
basically<00:00:36.120> transformers<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> always

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
basically transformers and I always

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.450 
basically transformers and I always
thought<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:37.770> really<00:00:37.920> awesome<00:00:38.070> how<00:00:38.340> they

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
thought that was really awesome how they

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.889 
thought that was really awesome how they
come<00:00:38.730> ahead<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.360> know<00:00:39.450> they<00:00:39.570> were<00:00:39.629> really

come ahead you know they were really

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.530 
come ahead you know they were really
similar<00:00:40.079> transformers<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.460> yeah<00:00:42.120> let's<00:00:42.450> get

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
similar transformers and yeah let's get

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.010 
similar transformers and yeah let's get
started

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
started

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
started
first<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.040> two<00:00:44.579> morphtronic

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
first off we have two morphtronic

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.850 
first off we have two morphtronic
slinging<00:00:45.690> he<00:00:45.989> has<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> little<00:00:46.350> bit<00:00:46.410> destruction

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
slinging he has a little bit destruction

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.080 
slinging he has a little bit destruction
effect<00:00:47.160> which<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:47.640> nice<00:00:47.789> being<00:00:48.000> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
effect which is really nice being a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.209 
effect which is really nice being a
little<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.170> most<00:00:49.440> morphtronics<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
little for to like most morphtronics it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.459 
little for to like most morphtronics it
really<00:00:50.700> does<00:00:50.850> work<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.180> well<00:00:51.329> too<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.570> XE

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
really does work out well too for XE

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.650 
really does work out well too for XE
summons<00:00:52.820> that's<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.059> great<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.539> think

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
summons that's what was great I think

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.930 
summons that's what was great I think
about<00:00:54.989> exceed<00:00:55.590> monsters<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> does

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
about exceed monsters is that it does

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
about exceed monsters is that it does
help<00:00:57.239> out<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> lot<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.840> her<00:00:57.930> necks<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> like

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
help out a lot of her necks and like

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
help out a lot of her necks and like
synchros<00:00:59.160> where<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.399> how<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> run<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> Tuner

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
synchros where you how to run a Tuner

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.110 
synchros where you how to run a Tuner
monster<00:01:00.500> XC<00:01:01.500> summoning<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.579> any<00:01:02.850> deck

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
monster XC summoning you can any deck

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.149 
monster XC summoning you can any deck
just<00:01:03.270> about<00:01:03.480> commutes<00:01:03.809> them<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
just about commutes them so I think that

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.289 
just about commutes them so I think that
you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:05.909> crystal<00:01:06.210> beasts

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
you know just like with crystal beasts

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.149 
you know just like with crystal beasts
it<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.720> powered<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.530> really<00:01:07.770> helps<00:01:07.950> out
