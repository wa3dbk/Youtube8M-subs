00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 new mondeo also qualcomm saw on 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.710
 Fiesta this new calender a bit astonish 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.200
 martin style 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.049
 beautiful the headlights with the led line 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.420
 such as daylight and the chickens headlight and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.570
 solidarity for low beams 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.630
 here we have the hybrid version then 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.570
 heat engine and electric motor then 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.920
 we will enter a normal version then 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.430
 the interiors we will see his version 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.830
 normal 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.390
 I will show you the difference in the trunk 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.610
 between the hybrid version and the version 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.280
 standard here live from that maintains 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.110
 however a good volume of the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.630
 trunk instead see now the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:46.290
 standard version always sedan where the 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.800
 trunk really has a capacity of 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.640
 considerable load can also be achieved 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.300
 knock down the seats two thirds in iii but 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.300
 we enter to see this worldly 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:09.320
 finishes that look good 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.320
 of the most famous 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.220
 we are talking about the infotainment system and here 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 we have to talk for a few minutes 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.010
 because system is the sync powered by 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.110
 microsoft in collaboration with ford e 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.940
 it really has a lot of features to it 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.460
 the whole plank we see is practically 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.100
 flat with keys are not touch-sensitive 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.650
 you have to take them a little to give the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.660
 command but still they are all like 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.070
 see the controls here for what 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.560
 regards the temperature that wheel 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.130
 others we only lower the volume on 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.840
 display is divided into four zones 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.400
 resistive touchscreen so you need to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.780
 crush a little higher up a 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.150
 right there are no navigation here 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.100
 inside the maps here the phone can be 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.560
 obviously connect via bluetooth here 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.229
 climate control shows us one 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.080
 overview of how the is set up 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.270
 air conditioning while on the left 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.890
 we have all the various audio sources and 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 video that we can connect because 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.920
 all the classic analog rc jacks then 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.940
 the sd ball bluetooth streaming card 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.930
 usb cd and radio but where are they 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.850
 all these commands are housed here 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.239
 in the cockpit where we even have 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:26.160
 two usb sd and analogue inputs 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.049
 below a well for the bottles 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.000
 as you can see it goes down and now it's yours 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.730
 automatically closing we talk a 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.680
 moment of flying steering wheel equipped with 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.019
 all commands related to the limiter 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.980
 speed to fair cruise control 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.660
 right the phone and voice commands 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.660
 this car has a gearbox 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.390
 manual e 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.780
 motorizations that even start 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.570
 from the 1000 3-cylinder ecoboost and this one 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.780
 the great news of mondeo this engine 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.880
 very important for ford 1000's 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.840
 three- cylinder displacement is mounted in 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.830
 125 horsepower version also on the mondeo 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.050
 very low emissions and very low 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.540
 consumption we will see if he can do 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.080
 to move a machine of 4 meters and 90 of 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.080
 length
