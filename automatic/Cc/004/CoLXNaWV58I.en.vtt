00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
next layer and patience because if you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.290 
next layer and patience because if you
lose<00:01:49.830> your<00:01:50.040> patience<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.760> screw<00:01:50.970> up<00:01:51.060> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
then you have to start again and now

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.760 
then you have to start again and now
that's<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.010> worried
