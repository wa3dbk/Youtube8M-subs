00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.350
 Talk to me, all or take back. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.150
 bringing a little water to you 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.179
 and a very important pet happens now 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.280
 on Tuesday where it has a preview goes 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.990
 a preview of what the player will be 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.059
 versus player player versus player there 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.350
 in the 3 rock dialogue 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.050
 let's take a look here how 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.330
 You do not have a direct menu to enter. 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.760
 for pvp here you need to enter the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.510
 game and will give a start stop with the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.880
 Website branding is c2 Brazil so people 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.090
 will give only a preview than pvp the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.059
 mark is already a level of excellence and 92 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.500
 or I will be massacred by him 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.149
 without any pity and pity and gift the bid 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.059
 going to be how it is to enter the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.989
 ppt simply get here in the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.059
 corner 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.719
 The pope arrives here, talk to this guy. 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.500
 here is the brother and enter the pvp trainee 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.090
 rounds 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.850
 so you go to the center of 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.820
 Training pvp there where you will have 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.399
 here at the plate school or you come and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.320
 this area here is already pvp what it is 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.080
 interesting is that it blocks line 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.880
 vision too so you, for example, I 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.100
 I will not see if I 'm here in case 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.799
 I 'm not going to see a guy who's here. 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.869
 because it has no line of sight then 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.860
 Let's see if the marking is already in the search. 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:26.540
 the mark here he has already entered the mark 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.540
 level 92 every dollar and the cabal in him 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:36.390
 You can use whatever you 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.490
 have our slaughter 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.770
 and from there I can accept the resurrection or 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.359
 live at the last check points and I can 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.869
 simply accept resurrection will 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.600
 be there then I will prefer not to do 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.369
 this I 'll just use here 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.560
 I'll try our quietly a shot 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.840
 that you have a 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.579
 level of excellence very very violent 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:05.280
 and it does not give neither grace nor grace 1 to 1 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.200
 92 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.209
 But anyway, this is it. 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.000
 pvp you can enter up to four 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.400
 everyone enters the same area and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.660
 You can still argue for 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.000
 while it does not have the level of it does not yet have 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.709
 no type of level between players 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.819
 he does not have any kind of payment 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.730
 between players then it is much more 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.470
 complex there you find a galley 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.950
 so it's cool you come in with your 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.620
 friends always the level more or less 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.440
 next to you guys can fight rock 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.120
 so remembering has not added any friends yet. 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.709
 kind of payment this is just a 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.660
 training itself 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.200
 Today I 'm the one in the marking process. 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.690
 then massacre just as you are 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.420
 enter the gallery more or less of the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.130
 same level and you can kill yourself and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.829
 to train when the breeze of 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.889
 launch a real pvp so a pvp 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.519
 who will have the payment will have leagues 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.139
 etc 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.720
 the important thing now is just a little gallery 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.970
 train and play games ok 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.910
 thanking Marcao where entered 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.590
 exactly to show me in truth 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.019
 He came in to hit me on mine. 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.700
 face in public but anyway 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.290
 I picked up the public is not so bad 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.630
 Marcao and for helping the team want 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.790
 I like you both when you want 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.819
 Come in and play and you can 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.430
 access this area of direct pvp through the nec 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.660
 I am using brouwer 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.639
 English to Spanish, so I do not know 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.010
 exactly as it will be in Portuguese but 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.700
 finally in that first city this little face 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.580
 and the fighter and and the whole city environment 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.850
 here in the city of Act 2 in 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:56.260
 of act 3 and also in the castle in the castle 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.600
 to three out of four you can join 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.420
 to enter these arenas remember rock 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.730
 always basin to balance the book 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.280
 book is great always remember to balance 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.170
 the level because after all it does not 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.130
 It's funny if you take a shot of 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.500
 everyone 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.050
 then logically you will want to have 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.750
 here below too, which are 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.060
 cool to the hockey pvp then this is it 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.200
 Hey people, I had a big hug, I see.
