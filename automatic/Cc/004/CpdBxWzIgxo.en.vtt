hello<00:00:01.949> I'm<00:00:02.310> Keith<00:00:02.580> from<00:00:02.700> K&amp;M<00:00:03.270> acoustics<00:00:03.870> I

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
hello I'm Keith from K&amp;M acoustics I

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.869 
hello I'm Keith from K&amp;M acoustics I
just<00:00:04.319> want<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.560> show<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.950> little<00:00:05.160> project

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
just want to show you a little project

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.519 
just want to show you a little project
that<00:00:05.940> we've<00:00:06.210> done<00:00:06.359> recently<00:00:06.420> on<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.170> bulb

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
that we've done recently on this bulb

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.400 
that we've done recently on this bulb
barkas<00:00:08.069> as<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.880> can<00:00:09.090> see<00:00:09.330> inside<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.170> car

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
barkas as you can see inside the car

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.370 
barkas as you can see inside the car
there<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.190> standard<00:00:11.820> stereo<00:00:12.120> system<00:00:12.900> which

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
there is a standard stereo system which

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.169 
there is a standard stereo system which
there's<00:00:13.679> no<00:00:13.830> way<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.309> somebody<00:00:14.580> would<00:00:14.910> in

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
there's no way that somebody would in

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.300 
there's no way that somebody would in
the<00:00:15.360> right<00:00:15.509> man<00:00:15.750> remove<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.320> system<00:00:16.859> because

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the right man remove that system because

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.609 
the right man remove that system because
it<00:00:17.430> does<00:00:17.580> all<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.880> parking<00:00:18.359> control<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.140> it's

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
it does all the parking control and it's

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.040 
it does all the parking control and it's
hands-free<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.820> obviously<00:00:21.240> even<00:00:21.810> though<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
hands-free so obviously even though it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.080 
hands-free so obviously even though it
is<00:00:22.170> possible<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.710> swap<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.189> area<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.970> not

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
is possible to swap this area it's not

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.259 
is possible to swap this area it's not
really<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> practical<00:00:24.750> thing<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.670> in<00:00:26.670> actual

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
really a practical thing to do in actual

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.349 
really a practical thing to do in actual
standard<00:00:27.779> positions<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.949> car<00:00:29.310> we've<00:00:30.029> put

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
standard positions in this car we've put

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.170 
standard positions in this car we've put
the<00:00:30.599> oldest<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.560> watch<00:00:31.830> air<00:00:32.130> tweeters<00:00:33.000> and

the oldest and watch air tweeters and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.110 
the oldest and watch air tweeters and
mids<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.380> component<00:00:34.829> kit<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> matched

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
mids it's a component kit with a matched

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.840 
mids it's a component kit with a matched
crossover<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.649> actually<00:00:38.010> sound<00:00:38.190> superb

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
crossover and they actually sound superb

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.090 
crossover and they actually sound superb
as<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.079> car<00:00:40.290> looks<00:00:40.559> completely

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
as you can see the car looks completely

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.990 
as you can see the car looks completely
standard<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:43.620> secret<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.520> system

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
standard now the secret to this system

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.930 
standard now the secret to this system
working<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.570> well<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.770> processor<00:00:47.460> down

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
working so well is this processor down

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.860 
working so well is this processor down
in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> kick<00:00:48.510> panel<00:00:49.039> if<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.219> look<00:00:50.460> carefully

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
in the kick panel if you look carefully

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.709 
in the kick panel if you look carefully
we<00:00:51.870> move<00:00:52.620> some<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> polystyrene<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.539> make

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
we move some of the polystyrene to make

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.439 
we move some of the polystyrene to make
it<00:00:54.899> fit<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.530> nice<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.800> tidy<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.239> what

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
it fit in there nice and tidy and what

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.420 
it fit in there nice and tidy and what
that's<00:00:57.690> doing<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.590> taking<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.280> input

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that's doing is it's taking the input

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.630 
that's doing is it's taking the input
from<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> standard<00:01:00.780> stereo<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.980> giving<00:01:02.520> us

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
from the standard stereo and giving us

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.149 
from the standard stereo and giving us
some<00:01:02.670> high<00:01:03.090> quality<00:01:03.170> outputs<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.530> allow<00:01:04.799> us<00:01:04.949> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
some high quality outputs to allow us to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.390 
some high quality outputs to allow us to
connect<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.670> amplifier<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.229> obviously<00:01:07.770> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
connect an amplifier and obviously that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.390 
connect an amplifier and obviously that
is<00:01:08.580> worth<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.970> sound<00:01:09.090> quality<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.780> come<00:01:09.990> from

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
is worth of sound quality then come from

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.100 
is worth of sound quality then come from
quickly<00:01:11.400> show<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> amplifier<00:01:12.510> which<00:01:12.960> is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
quickly show you the amplifier which is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.550 
quickly show you the amplifier which is
in<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> booth

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
in the booth

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.810 
in the booth
you<00:01:15.159> can<00:01:15.369> see<00:01:15.579> it's<00:01:16.030> neat<00:01:16.329> on<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.780> backseat

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you can see it's neat on the backseat

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.270 
you can see it's neat on the backseat
all<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:19.060> cables<00:01:19.509> took<00:01:19.780> away<00:01:20.110> neatly<00:01:20.710> down

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
all the cables took away neatly down

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.160 
all the cables took away neatly down
there<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:22.799> once<00:01:24.149> that<00:01:25.149> was<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.479> set<00:01:25.840> that

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
there and once that was the set that

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.340 
there and once that was the set that
never<00:01:26.409> needs<00:01:26.649> to<00:01:26.799> be<00:01:26.920> touched<00:01:27.159> anywhere

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
never needs to be touched anywhere

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.990 
never needs to be touched anywhere
there's<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.409> small<00:01:29.740> subwoofer<00:01:30.039> in<00:01:30.490> this<00:01:30.670> car

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
there's a small subwoofer in this car

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.149 
there's a small subwoofer in this car
the<00:01:31.509> subwoofer<00:01:32.080> obviously<00:01:32.710> plays<00:01:32.950> the

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
the subwoofer obviously plays the

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.859 
the subwoofer obviously plays the
low-end<00:01:33.520> bass<00:01:33.789> and<00:01:34.090> makes<00:01:34.270> everything<00:01:34.539> so

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
low-end bass and makes everything so

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.100 
low-end bass and makes everything so
superb<00:01:35.789> now<00:01:36.789> the<00:01:36.850> really<00:01:37.270> clever<00:01:37.450> feature

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
superb now the really clever feature

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.230 
superb now the really clever feature
with<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.829> processor<00:01:39.579> that's<00:01:39.759> in<00:01:39.970> the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
with the processor that's in the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.870 
with the processor that's in the
footwell<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:41.320> that's<00:01:41.530> called<00:01:41.829> a<00:01:41.950> bit<00:01:42.220> tent

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
footwell is that's called a bit tent

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.810 
footwell is that's called a bit tent
it's<00:01:43.000> an<00:01:43.119> artisan<00:01:43.689> bit<00:01:43.960> tent<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.310> very

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
it's an artisan bit tent it's a very

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.289 
it's an artisan bit tent it's a very
simple<00:01:46.090> process<00:01:46.509> but<00:01:47.049> what<00:01:47.799> it<00:01:48.039> can<00:01:48.369> do<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:49.149> it

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
simple process but what it can do is it

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.010 
simple process but what it can do is it
can<00:01:49.330> be<00:01:49.600> linked<00:01:49.959> into<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.709> laptop<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.940> it<00:01:52.929> has

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
can be linked into a laptop and it has

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.249 
can be linked into a laptop and it has
its<00:01:53.200> own<00:01:53.409> program<00:01:53.860> which<00:01:54.819> allows<00:01:55.270> time

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
its own program which allows time

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.380 
its own program which allows time
correction<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:57.700> we<00:01:57.789> can<00:01:57.909> actually<00:01:58.000> set<00:01:58.360> the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
correction so we can actually set the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.199 
correction so we can actually set the
delays<00:01:58.929> of<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.259> speakers<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.280> car<00:02:00.549> so

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
delays of the speakers in the car so

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.419 
delays of the speakers in the car so
that<00:02:01.509> all<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.899> speakers<00:02:02.289> hit<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.709> driver<00:02:03.039> at

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
that all the speakers hit the driver at

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.850 
that all the speakers hit the driver at
the<00:02:03.580> correct<00:02:03.970> time<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:05.590> has<00:02:05.890> 31<00:02:06.700> bands<00:02:07.209> of

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the correct time and it has 31 bands of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.520 
the correct time and it has 31 bands of
Equalization<00:02:08.860> per<00:02:09.610> output<00:02:10.269> so<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.140> means

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
Equalization per output so that means

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.420 
Equalization per output so that means
you<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:11.980> actually<00:02:12.269> equalize<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:14.230> from<00:02:15.040> black

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
you can actually equalize the from black

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.509 
you can actually equalize the from black
speakers<00:02:16.799> independently<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.250> front

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
speakers independently to the front

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.569 
speakers independently to the front
right<00:02:18.790> speakers<00:02:19.859> independently<00:02:20.859> to<00:02:21.040> any<00:02:21.250> rear

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
right speakers independently to any rear

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.520 
right speakers independently to any rear
speakers<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.299> subwoofers<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.109> are<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
speakers and subwoofers that are in the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.370 
speakers and subwoofers that are in the
car<00:02:23.769> and<00:02:24.070> everything<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.359> be<00:02:25.390> saved<00:02:25.750> on<00:02:26.079> there

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
car and everything can be saved on there

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.430 
car and everything can be saved on there
so<00:02:26.859> if<00:02:27.370> ever<00:02:27.579> it<00:02:27.760> needs<00:02:27.790> adjusting<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:29.079> can<00:02:29.320> be

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
so if ever it needs adjusting it can be

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.270 
so if ever it needs adjusting it can be
very<00:02:29.650> easily<00:02:29.920> done<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.239> future<00:02:31.690> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
very easily done in the future and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.670 
very easily done in the future and
without<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.880> device<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.500> very

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
without this device here it is a very

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.910 
without this device here it is a very
difficult<00:02:35.950> setup<00:02:36.940> check<00:02:37.239> our<00:02:37.480> because<00:02:38.410> this

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
difficult setup check our because this

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.370 
difficult setup check our because this
is<00:02:39.040> actually<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> spectrum<00:02:39.730> analyzer<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:41.140> what

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
is actually a spectrum analyzer and what

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.129 
is actually a spectrum analyzer and what
that's<00:02:41.590> doing<00:02:41.890> is<00:02:42.609> it's<00:02:42.790> measuring<00:02:43.510> each

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
that's doing is it's measuring each

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.410 
that's doing is it's measuring each
frequency<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.220> car<00:02:45.430> individually<00:02:46.180> as<00:02:46.359> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
frequency in the car individually as a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.759 
frequency in the car individually as a
dot<00:02:47.100> now<00:02:48.100> on<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:49.030> computer<00:02:49.630> we<00:02:50.200> have<00:02:50.440> one

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
dot now on the computer we have one

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.509 
dot now on the computer we have one
slider<00:02:51.250> for<00:02:52.239> every<00:02:52.750> single<00:02:53.170> dot<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.340> if<00:02:54.400> we

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
slider for every single dot so if we

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.599 
slider for every single dot so if we
wanted<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.000> we<00:02:55.480> could<00:02:55.750> actually<00:02:55.810> make<00:02:56.549> this<00:02:57.549> a

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
wanted to we could actually make this a

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.849 
wanted to we could actually make this a
flat<00:02:58.000> line<00:02:58.329> which<00:02:58.750> would<00:02:58.900> sound<00:02:59.139> awful<00:02:59.680> but

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
flat line which would sound awful but

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.280 
flat line which would sound awful but
what<00:03:00.370> we're<00:03:00.549> trying<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:01.000> do<00:03:01.150> generally<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:02.019> to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
what we're trying to do generally is to

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.620 
what we're trying to do generally is to
smooth<00:03:02.650> things<00:03:02.980> out<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.519> get<00:03:04.090> rid<00:03:04.239> of<00:03:04.299> some<00:03:04.600> of

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
smooth things out so get rid of some of

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.780 
smooth things out so get rid of some of
the<00:03:04.810> peaks<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.680> pull<00:03:05.920> up<00:03:06.069> some<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.549> dips

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
the peaks and pull up some of the dips

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.180 
the peaks and pull up some of the dips
and<00:03:07.269> that<00:03:07.420> gives<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.750> much<00:03:07.930> more<00:03:08.200> equal<00:03:08.380> sound<00:03:08.889> I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
and that gives a much more equal sound I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.940 
and that gives a much more equal sound I
hope<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.880> found<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.389> interesting<00:03:11.200> if
