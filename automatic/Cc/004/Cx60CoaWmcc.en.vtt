00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.960
 good another day here with you look 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.270
 Today I want to show you that we are seeing 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.900
 something I imagine in the title and that one 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.300
 braid is like root is root but 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
 we can do it let's say inwards 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.070
 which is how they did not make them to me 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.140
 as a child or outside that we have left 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.210
 the drawing out and good 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.189
 just now first let's do 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.800
 the one that is left out 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 I show it to you and then it went away 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.170
 photos so you can see the different 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.110
 ways also to decorate it if it's for 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.110
 the communion or any vega ceremony 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 Well look today as you see has 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.489
 warned the hair 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.180
 to make it good as easier 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.670
 press we take first the part of 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:06.549
 up we divide it 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.770
 the 3 and we are going to put underneath this is 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.189
 As I already showed you in a braid 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:18.780
 what we did as a good crown 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.780
 tucked down and we started to catch 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.760
 we take 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.850
 and below 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.380
 novais going to see like that a little bit more 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.250
 there 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.790
 we take 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.790
 and by 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.130
 that looks more or less let's see now 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.930
 how to wait a moment that has been 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.890
 gone how it's going 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.160
 with this other lock we take and go back 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.160
 to put in 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.740
 under 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.060
 and well we would continue until the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.040
 final what happens with the keels 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.100
 on top he has hair so long that it's a 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.330
 little as eternal but good you do 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.000
 an idea of ​​how this is true 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.970
 would serve us well I would say that almost 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.490
 even to go to school and then if 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.770
 we decorate a little bit and so on 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.920
 also for any celebration or 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.310
 any little thing 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.420
 birthday they want from the monas and 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 these little things look 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.730
 I hope you appreciate it well in the video 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.120
 I think so anyway now 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.120
 I'll look 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:44.889
 As you can see, it's super simple because 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.889
 has nothing really 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.879
 this of course we can also 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.790
 do with straight hair what happens is 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.980
 Good thing I already warned you and I'm going to 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.620
 also take advantage today to record more 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.680
 videos because as she wants it to have 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.349
 So long, good, you have to take care of yourself 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.930
 quite and of course nothing to be 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.930
 ironing today tomorrow has passed 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.560
 today we are going to make more videos true 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.879
 well look , we would finish it and now 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.269
 I want to show you what we can do with 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.579
 her good at the moment or leave it so 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.090
 they are very good we can put it to 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.090
 side 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.230
 or we can make it a kind of 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.930
 collected from all that training for not 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.209
 make the video very long what I do is 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.909
 that then I put different things 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.370
 different little things to decorate it and I 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.829
 I leave in some photos that I think 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.590
 rather more than not good to remove it 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.060
 put it off, put it on and if it does 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.640
 eternal 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.880
 we would do so with a rubber band to be possible 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.190
 to see as little as possible and 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.490
 we can put a rack and take what 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.330
 let's imagine 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.490
 do not avenge himself in white 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.330
 imagine 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.330
 for example 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:22.170
 and it looks very good 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.630
 and now I want to make you 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:29.080
 A) Yes 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:33.430
 how can we put it to make a 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.640
 picked up let's go as one is a picked 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:42.110
 If we feel like it, we can leave it like this 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.620
 it would be simply with two hairpins of 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.060
 monkey 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.060
 or we put it 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.790
 pick up even more normally with one 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.190
 It would be enough that it happens that you already have it so 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.630
 long then maybe it would be more cute 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.870
 well picked up 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.790
 then to decorate it we can put them 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.220
 the hairpins that I have already taught you 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.050
 a lot of my videos those of the 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:16.080
 haberdashery 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.080
 and we could decorate it for example 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.980
 you see more or less but now look 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.980
 decorated and I'm telling you I'll leave it 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.100
 in some pictures or with these others that you 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.849
 teach how good I loved 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.560
 who are like us 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.580
 rollán thus imagine 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.860
 also what monkey is left 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.860
 and well then let's say goodbye 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.220
 Oh 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:50.070
 we say goodbye and now I leave you some 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.070
 photos you'll see what monkey is left
