00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.329 

this<00:00:01.640> is<00:00:01.759> my<00:00:01.910> synthesis<00:00:02.480> of<00:00:02.600> nitric<00:00:02.929> acid

00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:03.339 
this is my synthesis of nitric acid

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:06.670 
this is my synthesis of nitric acid
nitric<00:00:04.339> acid<00:00:04.640> is<00:00:04.759> a<00:00:04.790> very<00:00:05.060> useful<00:00:05.589> chemical<00:00:06.589> in

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
nitric acid is a very useful chemical in

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.799 
nitric acid is a very useful chemical in
the<00:00:06.740> lab<00:00:06.919> however<00:00:07.220> it's<00:00:07.520> very<00:00:08.360> hard<00:00:08.630> to<00:00:08.719> get

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
the lab however it's very hard to get

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.200 
the lab however it's very hard to get
ahold<00:00:08.990> of<00:00:09.080> especially<00:00:09.410> in<00:00:09.650> the<00:00:09.740> US<00:00:10.009> so<00:00:10.309> today

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
ahold of especially in the US so today

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.759 
ahold of especially in the US so today
I'm<00:00:11.300> going<00:00:11.540> to<00:00:11.630> show<00:00:11.840> a<00:00:12.139> way<00:00:12.469> of<00:00:12.590> synthesizing

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
I'm going to show a way of synthesizing

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.339 
I'm going to show a way of synthesizing
it<00:00:13.280> by<00:00:13.610> fractional<00:00:14.509> distillation<00:00:14.599> of

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
it by fractional distillation of

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.140 
it by fractional distillation of
concentrated<00:00:16.280> sulfuric<00:00:16.370> acid<00:00:16.940> with<00:00:17.120> sodium

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
concentrated sulfuric acid with sodium

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.420 
concentrated sulfuric acid with sodium
nitrate<00:00:18.130> so<00:00:19.130> here's<00:00:19.970> my<00:00:20.150> distillation<00:00:20.540> setup

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
nitrate so here's my distillation setup

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.040 
nitrate so here's my distillation setup
we<00:00:22.430> have<00:00:22.580> a<00:00:22.610> propane<00:00:23.210> torch<00:00:23.630> that's<00:00:23.810> going<00:00:23.990> to

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
we have a propane torch that's going to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.220 
we have a propane torch that's going to
be<00:00:24.140> heating<00:00:24.440> a<00:00:24.560> hot<00:00:25.490> oil<00:00:25.790> bath<00:00:25.960> which<00:00:26.960> will<00:00:27.110> be

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
be heating a hot oil bath which will be

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.500 
be heating a hot oil bath which will be
boiling<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.770> mixture<00:00:28.010> in<00:00:28.280> there<00:00:28.460> it's<00:00:29.390> gonna

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
boiling the mixture in there it's gonna

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.060 
boiling the mixture in there it's gonna
be<00:00:29.600> going<00:00:29.840> up<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.170> steel<00:00:30.380> head<00:00:30.530> I<00:00:30.560> attached<00:00:30.920> a

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
be going up the steel head I attached a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.910 
be going up the steel head I attached a
thermometer<00:00:31.370> using<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:32.450> bushing<00:00:32.720> adapter<00:00:33.140> and

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
thermometer using a bushing adapter and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.150 
thermometer using a bushing adapter and
go<00:00:34.700> down<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.560> condense<00:00:36.560> in<00:00:36.800> my<00:00:36.920> grams

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
go down and condense in my grams

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.700 
go down and condense in my grams
condenser<00:00:37.700> I'm<00:00:38.420> using<00:00:38.690> a<00:00:38.900> vacuum<00:00:39.140> take-off

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
condenser I'm using a vacuum take-off

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.190 
condenser I'm using a vacuum take-off
adapter<00:00:40.160> to<00:00:40.340> vent<00:00:40.490> any<00:00:40.960> extra<00:00:41.960> nitrogen

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
adapter to vent any extra nitrogen

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.170 
adapter to vent any extra nitrogen
dioxide<00:00:42.890> into<00:00:43.220> a<00:00:43.250> sodium<00:00:43.640> carbonate<00:00:44.030> solution

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
dioxide into a sodium carbonate solution

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.480 
dioxide into a sodium carbonate solution
I'm<00:00:45.079> doing<00:00:45.560> this<00:00:45.680> because<00:00:48.070> lection<00:00:49.070> dioxide

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
I'm doing this because lection dioxide

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.280 
I'm doing this because lection dioxide
is<00:00:49.640> a<00:00:49.670> very<00:00:50.240> nasty<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.690> inhale<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.170> it's

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
is a very nasty to inhale and it's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.620 
is a very nasty to inhale and it's
acidic<00:00:51.620> anhydride<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.400> sodium<00:00:53.180> carbonate

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
acidic anhydride so the sodium carbonate

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.850 
acidic anhydride so the sodium carbonate
solution<00:00:53.840> will<00:00:54.140> capture<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:54.530> neutralize<00:00:54.829> it

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
solution will capture and neutralize it

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.520 
solution will capture and neutralize it
and<00:00:55.070> that<00:00:55.730> is<00:00:55.820> going<00:00:56.090> into<00:00:56.210> an<00:00:56.570> iodine<00:00:57.200> flask

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
and that is going into an iodine flask

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.470 
and that is going into an iodine flask
where<00:00:57.710> I'm<00:00:57.770> collecting<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:58.280> back<00:00:59.239> there<00:00:59.450> I

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
where I'm collecting it back there I

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.479 
where I'm collecting it back there I
have<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.720> homemade<00:01:00.500> condenser<00:01:01.010> pump<00:01:01.220> out<00:01:01.340> of<00:01:01.430> a

little bit of mention dioxide in there

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.700 
little bit of mention dioxide in there
also<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.619> can<00:01:39.860> see<00:01:40.130> down<00:01:40.790> here<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:41.710> there

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
also you can see down here that there

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.460 
also you can see down here that there
are<00:01:42.860> bubbles<00:01:43.070> coming<00:01:43.490> out<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.350> tube<00:01:45.350> that

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
are bubbles coming out of the tube that

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.719 
are bubbles coming out of the tube that
I'm<00:01:45.590> using<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.890> equalize<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.250> pressure<00:01:46.369> this

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
I'm using to equalize the pressure this

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:47.770 
I'm using to equalize the pressure this
means<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.090> gases<00:01:47.420> in<00:01:47.540> there<00:01:47.659> are

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
means that the gases in there are

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.200 
means that the gases in there are
expanding<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.590> we<00:01:49.580> will<00:01:49.670> get<00:01:49.790> back<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.119> as

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
expanding and we will get back to you as

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.050 
expanding and we will get back to you as
soon<00:01:50.360> as<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:50.630> see<00:01:50.869> condensation<00:01:51.880> at<00:01:52.880> the

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
soon as we see condensation at the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.880 

answer<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.840> see<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.050> drip<00:02:13.230> back<00:02:13.409> into<00:02:13.769> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
answer to see it drip back into the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.670 
answer to see it drip back into the
solution<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.870> working<00:02:16.170> its<00:02:16.290> way<00:02:16.379> over<00:02:16.530> there

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
solution it's working its way over there

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.309 
solution it's working its way over there
though<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.510> pretty<00:02:18.510> soon<00:02:18.720> we'll<00:02:18.900> see<00:02:18.930> a

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
though and pretty soon we'll see a

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.440 
though and pretty soon we'll see a
steady<00:02:20.310> stream<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.549> nitric<00:02:20.879> acid<00:02:21.180> flowing

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
steady stream of nitric acid flowing

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.149 
steady stream of nitric acid flowing
down<00:02:21.599> from<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.780> condenser<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:25.140> now<00:02:25.769> we<00:02:25.830> can

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
down from the condenser and now we can

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.949 
down from the condenser and now we can
see<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.610> nitric<00:02:26.909> acid<00:02:28.250> coming<00:02:29.250> down<00:02:29.549> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
see the nitric acid coming down the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:40.400 
see the nitric acid coming down the
condenser<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.640> there<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.930> there's<00:02:40.290> our

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
condenser so there it is and there's our

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.180 
condenser so there it is and there's our
first<00:02:40.620> drop<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:40.890> nitric<00:02:41.220> acid

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
first drop of nitric acid

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.170 
first drop of nitric acid
alright<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.280> distillation<00:02:44.670> has<00:02:44.879> now<00:02:45.000> reached

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
alright the distillation has now reached

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.900 
alright the distillation has now reached
a<00:02:45.360> stable<00:02:45.780> point<00:02:46.709> which<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.670> can<00:02:47.790> see

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
a stable point which you can see

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.089 
a stable point which you can see
condensation<00:02:48.120> running<00:02:48.750> down<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.170> boiling

condenser into the iodine flask and see

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.520 
condenser into the iodine flask and see
it<00:03:00.810> drips<00:03:01.079> every<00:03:01.379> about<00:03:02.010> every<00:03:02.069> second<00:03:03.530> anyway

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
it drips every about every second anyway

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.400 
it drips every about every second anyway
this<00:03:04.650> will<00:03:04.829> run<00:03:05.129> for<00:03:05.400> about<00:03:05.700> an<00:03:05.910> hour<00:03:05.970> until

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
this will run for about an hour until

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
this will run for about an hour until
it's<00:03:07.410> done<00:03:07.680> you'll<00:03:07.920> know<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.160> done<00:03:08.280> because

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
it's done you'll know it's done because

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.869 
it's done you'll know it's done because
it'll<00:03:08.879> stop<00:03:09.720> boiling<00:03:10.109> in<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.260> boiling<00:03:10.410> flask

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
it'll stop boiling in the boiling flask

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:17.330 
it'll stop boiling in the boiling flask
so<00:03:13.670> keep<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.730> posted<00:03:15.829> we're<00:03:16.829> about<00:03:17.010> ready<00:03:17.250> to

so keep you posted we're about ready to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.370 
so keep you posted we're about ready to
call<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.730> done<00:03:17.940> now<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.630> stopped<00:03:18.930> bubbling

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
call it done now and it stopped bubbling

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.309 
call it done now and it stopped bubbling
in<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.560> reaction<00:03:20.040> vessel<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.870> temperature

is starting to rise up to about ninety
degrees<00:03:25.799> Celsius<00:03:28.940> go<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.829> still<00:03:32.549> see

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
degrees Celsius go you can still see

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.550 
degrees Celsius go you can still see
conversation<00:03:33.419> still<00:03:33.930> dripping<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:34.470> we're

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
conversation still dripping so we're

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.900 
conversation still dripping so we're
gonna<00:03:34.650> let<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:34.889> run<00:03:35.099> for<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> few<00:03:35.639> minutes

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
gonna let it run for a few minutes

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.270 
gonna let it run for a few minutes
before<00:03:36.630> we<00:03:36.989> stop<00:03:38.180> distillation<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.480> now<00:03:39.660> done

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
before we stop distillation is now done

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.770 
before we stop distillation is now done
as<00:03:41.280> evidenced<00:03:41.669> by<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.849> stopping<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.750> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
the reaction goes slow at first because

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.140 
the reaction goes slow at first because
nitric<00:04:27.620> acid<00:04:27.919> actually<00:04:28.190> forms<00:04:28.669> a<00:04:28.729> protective

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
nitric acid actually forms a protective

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.960 
nitric acid actually forms a protective
layer<00:04:29.180> because<00:04:30.050> it's<00:04:30.169> so<00:04:30.289> concentrated<00:04:30.970> this

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
layer because it's so concentrated this

effect<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.389> known<00:04:32.509> as<00:04:32.569> passivation<00:04:34.090> upon<00:04:35.090> the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
effect is known as passivation upon the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.850 
effect is known as passivation upon the
addition<00:04:35.569> of<00:04:35.629> a<00:04:35.720> small<00:04:35.840> amount<00:04:36.110> of<00:04:36.199> water<00:04:36.379> to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
addition of a small amount of water to

addition of a small amount of water to
dilute<00:04:36.979> it<00:04:38.710> we<00:04:39.710> can<00:04:39.860> see<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.009> reaction

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
dilute it we can see the reaction

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.760 
dilute it we can see the reaction
proceeds<00:04:40.759> vigorously<00:04:44.289> the<00:04:45.289> products<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.680> the
