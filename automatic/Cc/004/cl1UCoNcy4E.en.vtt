names<00:01:20.940> I'm<00:01:21.940> just<00:01:22.210> about<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.450> set<00:01:22.810> up<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.110> main

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
names I'm just about to set up the main

river<00:01:23.950> flows<00:01:24.310> as<00:01:24.550> well<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.630> get<00:01:25.810> that<00:01:25.960> going

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
river flows as well and get that going

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.420 
river flows as well and get that going
down<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.740> drain<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:28.180> wind<00:01:28.420> is<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.890> my<00:01:30.100> favor

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
down the drain the wind is in my favor

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.460 
down the drain the wind is in my favor
I'll<00:01:30.730> think<00:01:30.760> it's<00:01:31.330> ever<00:01:31.510> so<00:01:31.600> slightly<00:01:32.020> coming

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
I'll think it's ever so slightly coming

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.370 
I'll think it's ever so slightly coming
into<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:32.920> bank<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.720> I'm<00:01:34.930> gonna<00:01:35.080> have<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.260> get

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
into the bank but I'm gonna have to get

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.640 
into the bank but I'm gonna have to get
laid<00:01:35.680> out<00:01:35.950> just<00:01:36.130> see<00:01:36.460> how<00:01:37.270> it<00:01:37.300> performs<00:01:37.780> I'm

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
laid out just see how it performs I'm

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.380 
laid out just see how it performs I'm
going<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:38.920> set<00:01:39.070> that<00:01:39.100> up<00:01:39.280> Nancy's<00:01:39.850> sure<00:01:40.180> there

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
going to set that up Nancy's sure there

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:51.480 
going to set that up Nancy's sure there
are<00:01:46.020> here's<00:01:47.020> my<00:01:47.200> drift<00:01:47.620> of<00:01:47.740> light<00:01:47.920> set<00:01:48.220> up<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
are here's my drift of light set up the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.410 
are here's my drift of light set up the
drifter<00:01:51.820> float<00:01:52.030> itself<00:01:52.540> here<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.710> above<00:01:54.070> that

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
drifter float itself here and above that

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.300 
drifter float itself here and above that
to<00:01:55.420> determine<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:56.080> deck<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:56.530> like<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:56.890> use<00:01:57.160> one

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
to determine the deck I like to use one

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.210 
to determine the deck I like to use one
of<00:01:57.340> these<00:01:57.460> Fox<00:01:57.850> sinkers<00:01:58.660> because<00:01:59.619> they<00:01:59.770> slide

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
of these Fox sinkers because they slide

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.980 
of these Fox sinkers because they slide
up<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.430> down<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.729> Bradys<00:02:01.150> lean<00:02:01.390> down<00:02:01.600> damage

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
up and down the Bradys lean down damage

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.400 
up and down the Bradys lean down damage
it<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.580> floats<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.210> are<00:02:04.330> coming<00:02:04.960> down<00:02:05.140> to

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
it so the floats that are coming down to

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.280 
it so the floats that are coming down to
another<00:02:05.910> raise<00:02:08.310> float<00:02:09.310> ledges<00:02:09.729> stem<00:02:10.030> here<00:02:10.330> and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
another raise float ledges stem here and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.250 
another raise float ledges stem here and
down<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
down to the

this<00:02:46.710> one<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.010> three<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.370> half<00:02:47.400> pound<00:02:47.790> test

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
this one is three and a half pound test

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.600 
this one is three and a half pound test
curve<00:02:48.300> which<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.050> also<00:02:49.320> very<00:02:49.920> very<00:02:50.070> good<00:02:50.400> for

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
curve which is also very very good for

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.740 
curve which is also very very good for
the<00:02:50.670> style<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.030> fishing<00:02:51.180> because<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.600> need

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
the style of fishing because you need

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.780 
the style of fishing because you need
the<00:02:51.870> longer<00:02:52.200> rod<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.190> able<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.640> keep

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
the longer rod to be able to keep

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.720 
the longer rod to be able to keep
control<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.630> line<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.020> mend<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.730> also

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
control of the line and mend it and also

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.760 
control of the line and mend it and also
longer<00:02:57.270> distances<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.990> longer<00:02:58.290> rod<00:02:58.440> helps

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
longer distances the longer rod helps

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.040 
longer distances the longer rod helps
