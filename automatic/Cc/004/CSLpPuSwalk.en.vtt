00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.349 

another<00:03:59.129> cool<00:03:59.280> faster<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.760> fall<00:03:59.909> of<00:04:00.000> duty<00:04:00.180> 4

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
dying you have the ability to call in a

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.670 
dying you have the ability to call in a
UAV<00:04:08.459> drone<00:04:09.150> which<00:04:09.390> is<00:04:09.510> like<00:04:09.659> a<00:04:09.689> radar<00:04:10.170> sweep

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
the enemies and you're kind of taking

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.010 
the enemies and you're kind of taking
them<00:05:08.880> out<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.150> stuff<00:05:09.360> they're<00:05:09.539> falling<00:05:09.930> all

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
sound appropriately devastating you feel

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.570 
sound appropriately devastating you feel
like<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:21.870> are<00:05:21.900> doing<00:05:22.169> bad<00:05:22.680> things<00:05:22.710> to<00:05:23.430> other

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
like you are doing bad things to other

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.430 
like you are doing bad things to other
human<00:05:23.970> beings<00:05:24.360> when<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.750> when<00:05:25.020> you<00:05:25.050> let<00:05:25.320> these

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
human beings when you when you let these

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:49.790 
human beings when you when you let these

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.050 

so<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.890> one<00:05:51.040> major<00:05:51.190> knock<00:05:51.490> against<00:05:51.760> call<00:05:51.970> of

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
so the one major knock against call of

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.310 
so the one major knock against call of
duty<00:05:52.240> 4<00:05:52.270> is<00:05:52.540> that<00:05:52.690> it's<00:05:52.810> single<00:05:53.110> player

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
duty 4 is that it's single player

duty 4 is that it's single player
campaign<00:05:53.890> is<00:05:54.070> a<00:05:54.100> really<00:05:54.580> quite<00:05:54.850> short<00:05:55.240> maybe

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
campaign is a really quite short maybe

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.150 
campaign is a really quite short maybe
about<00:05:55.810> half<00:05:55.870> as<00:05:56.260> long<00:05:56.440> as<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.800> average

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
about half as long as the average

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.340 
about half as long as the average
shooter<00:05:57.460> hit<00:05:57.760> the<00:05:57.820> market<00:05:58.120> today<00:05:58.240> but<00:05:59.110> a<00:05:59.140> lot

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
shooter hit the market today but a lot

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.720 
shooter hit the market today but a lot
of<00:05:59.380> that<00:05:59.560> is<00:05:59.680> mitigated<00:06:00.220> by<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.370> fact<00:06:00.460> that

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
of that is mitigated by the fact that

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.220 
of that is mitigated by the fact that
the<00:06:00.910> quality<00:06:01.300> of<00:06:01.570> that<00:06:01.780> single<00:06:01.960> player

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.230 
the quality of that single player

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.080 
the quality of that single player
campaign<00:06:02.590> is<00:06:02.740> really<00:06:03.310> really<00:06:03.580> over<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:04.060> top

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
campaign is really really over the top
