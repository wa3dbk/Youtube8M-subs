00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
emulator which is really big downside

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.120 
emulator which is really big downside
one<00:05:38.540> way<00:05:38.690> that<00:05:38.810> I<00:05:38.870> do<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.320> as<00:05:39.680> long<00:05:39.740> as<00:05:40.070> you

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
one way that I do it as long as you

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.910 
minimizes it and when you bring it back
up<00:05:50.420> it<00:05:50.660> actually<00:05:50.810> presumes<00:05:51.380> from<00:05:51.590> the<00:05:51.680> last

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
up it actually presumes from the last

place<00:05:52.220> where<00:05:52.460> you<00:05:52.580> played<00:05:52.820> so<00:05:53.060> it's<00:05:53.240> pretty

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
place where you played so it's pretty

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.140 
place where you played so it's pretty
much<00:05:53.480> like<00:05:53.660> saving<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.500> game<00:05:54.820> yes<00:05:55.820> it<00:05:56.000> is<00:05:56.030> a

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
much like saving the game yes it is a

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.110 
much like saving the game yes it is a
downside<00:05:56.450> but<00:05:57.020> it<00:05:57.290> still<00:05:57.620> is<00:05:58.070> still<00:05:58.430> better

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
downside but it still is still better

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.080 
downside but it still is still better
