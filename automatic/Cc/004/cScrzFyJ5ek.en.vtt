00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
helmet and we're going to review the

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.429 
helmet and we're going to review the
next<00:00:25.060> line<00:00:25.270> down<00:00:25.510> for<00:00:25.779> them<00:00:25.900> which<00:00:26.080> is<00:00:26.109> called

the<00:00:26.619> f2<00:00:27.250> helmet<00:00:28.080> let<00:00:29.080> me<00:00:29.199> go<00:00:29.320> over<00:00:29.529> some<00:00:29.710> of<00:00:29.740> the

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
the f2 helmet let me go over some of the

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.710 
the f2 helmet let me go over some of the
features<00:00:30.519> that<00:00:31.510> they<00:00:31.810> do<00:00:31.869> share<00:00:32.379> in<00:00:32.619> common

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
features that they do share in common

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.950 
features that they do share in common

less firm coming in towards your head

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.340 
less firm coming in towards your head
which<00:00:54.580> provides<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.150> more<00:00:55.299> progressive<00:00:55.570> shock

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
which provides a more progressive shock

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
helmets and this helmet has both these

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.550 
helmets and this helmet has both these
helmets<00:01:26.230> of<00:01:26.500> eleven<00:01:27.130> intake<00:01:27.760> vents<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:29.290> in

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
helmets of eleven intake vents all in

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.220 
helmets of eleven intake vents all in
the<00:01:29.650> front<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.130> four<00:01:30.610> exhaust<00:01:31.180> vents<00:01:31.660> on<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
the front and four exhaust vents on the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.010 
the front and four exhaust vents on the
back<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.820> lower<00:01:34.150> ones<00:01:34.450> down<00:01:34.690> here<00:01:34.720> at<00:01:34.960> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
back to lower ones down here at the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.990 
back to lower ones down here at the
bottom<00:01:35.080> are<00:01:35.560> smaller<00:01:35.980> than<00:01:36.220> these<00:01:36.370> two<00:01:36.670> big

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
bottom are smaller than these two big

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.050 
bottom are smaller than these two big
ones<00:01:37.150> on<00:01:37.390> top<00:01:37.600> are<00:01:37.870> pretty<00:01:38.110> big<00:01:38.290> so<00:01:38.730> 11<00:01:39.730> intake

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
ones on top are pretty big so 11 intake

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.560 
ones on top are pretty big so 11 intake
for<00:01:40.330> exhaust<00:01:40.690> on<00:01:41.050> both<00:01:41.409> of<00:01:41.440> these<00:01:41.680> helmets

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
for exhaust on both of these helmets

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.790 
for exhaust on both of these helmets
when<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:43.600> first<00:01:43.780> got<00:01:43.930> these<00:01:44.110> helmets<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:44.590> did

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
when I first got these helmets I did

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.000 
when I first got these helmets I did
kind<00:01:45.040> of<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.540> unscientific<00:01:46.540> test<00:01:46.810> at<00:01:47.470> night<00:01:47.770> I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
kind of a unscientific test at night I

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.370 
kind of a unscientific test at night I
pulled<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.370> liner<00:01:48.580> out<00:01:48.700> went<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.720> on<00:01:49.900> my<00:01:50.080> porch

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
pulled the liner out went on on my porch

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.230 
pulled the liner out went on on my porch
and<00:01:50.680> look<00:01:50.920> through<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.640> inside<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.030> the

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
and look through the inside of the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.590 
and look through the inside of the
helmet<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.900> look<00:01:53.170> through<00:01:53.470> these<00:01:53.680> four

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
helmet and I look through these four

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.360 
helmet and I look through these four
front<00:01:55.620> vents<00:01:56.620> and<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:56.830> could<00:01:57.040> see<00:01:57.310> straight

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
front vents and I could see straight

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.780 
front vents and I could see straight
through<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.390> helmet<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.050> those<00:02:00.040> go<00:02:00.250> straight

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
through the helmet so those go straight

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.600 
through the helmet so those go straight
to<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.180> outside<00:02:01.690> here<00:02:02.050> so<00:02:03.040> I<00:02:03.070> know<00:02:03.159> those

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
to the outside here so I know those

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.240 
to the outside here so I know those
events<00:02:03.940> work<00:02:04.180> very<00:02:04.479> well<00:02:04.830> during<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.950> summer

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
events work very well during the summer

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.620 
events work very well during the summer
at<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.700> end<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.940> summer<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.180> did<00:02:07.390> another

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
at the end of the summer I did another

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.050 
at the end of the summer I did another
soda<00:02:08.289> iron<00:02:08.590> scientific<00:02:09.369> tests<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:09.909> would

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
soda iron scientific tests and I would

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.780 
soda iron scientific tests and I would
