00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.920
 so exchanged there usually it's my 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.679

 then my shotgun classes right there 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.090
 it was a subscriber challenge that I 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.410
 never ever successful but usually 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.850
 those guys that front shotgun 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.680
 it was with that one but here I have the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.859

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.159
 use alas my class is afraid so 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.810
 I was not classy big machine guns 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.000
 because I never play with but that's it 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.979
 that's pretty much everything we'll go back on 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.220
 its what you want to see a little bit of everything 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.939
 tac tac tac tac tac tac tac that's all 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.710
 the world then the barracks a lot of 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.470
 people I think on a plot by his no 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 when score i have a lot i have 16 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.490

 vic 3000 defeat g7000 hackers raged 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.659
 and connections that's the reason 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.470
 good equality that we do not care series of 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.540
 victories 39 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.100
 damn that's hot I think that's 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.280
 I do them during my challenge because 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.619
 that I see it must be that because 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.659
 I was in team but never 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.380
 I was like 25.4 like that but on a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.320
 cent then an elimination at 281 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.280
 7000 and 87 thousand dead I have almost two 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.899
 ratios the a19 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.799
 then it's in the head I made 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.500
 fifteen thousand ten precision 18.60 10.60 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.179
 it's not huge huge it's not the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.280
 all good helper bandeau 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.860
 many we do not care and nations these 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.330
 record animations 6 52 personally 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.330

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.250
 34 days of play it's a lot 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.170
 a lot a lot 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.319
 then the challenges we do not care facts 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.860
 I do not know where I do not know 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:36.800
 if there is something interesting 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:39.629
 weekly ranking 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.099
 here I am 3130 I was pretty much like 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.530
 there is a moment during my 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:47.910
 challenge but otherwise it's dominating 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.760
 that I show you and I am 6320 in 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:56.760
 anyway what I was playing only here and there 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.590
 weekly I'm 958 wasabi whore 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.730
 juice all the time and it's a trick of 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.950
 the ouch and 6 assists that look at this 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.709
 video is in any case 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.569
 dedication and then here after there are the 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.370
 configs so this is for the video I 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.780
 that I make you master hamburg 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.390
 say because for live stream it's 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.069
 simpler brightness all that's it 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.180
 audio here's commands 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.340
 after that, there are a lot of people who have 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.099
 asked it so it is moved control 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.120
 could pause to watch I 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.940
 can you explain why I use 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.049
 all this and everything after me is my 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.549
 preferably you do not have to 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.140
 to use that is at least view that 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.610
 I started like this at last I 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.159
 started like this as you go 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.470
 it was like that action it's that too 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:39.659
 you can pause to know then 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.280
 seen here is my sensitivity it's pretty much 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.319
 and then that's all this after I do not 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.390
 do not know the video stuff at all 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.739
 advanced options it's just that I get there 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.239
 do not know I never touched if I 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.799
 removed the shadows and bullet impacts 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.470
 so that's for the anti shield 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.970
 riot then here I am I put my 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.159
 maximum resolution because I prefer 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.360
 but after each his preferences 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.310
 especially good I hope it will have you 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.140
 liked this video on your way the fables to 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.750
 captious this is my last video of 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.670
 again the 3 normally I think even 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.260
 bubble but three so for now 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.370
 until black ops become 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.930
 boring and maybe I would come 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.930
 all three but in any case penis
