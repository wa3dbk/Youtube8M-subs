sizes okay there we go now with three

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.319 
sizes okay there we go now with three
targets<00:00:53.539> convert<00:00:54.539> them<00:00:54.719> all<00:00:54.930> into<00:00:55.079> symbols

target too and they're doing movie clips

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.749 
target too and they're doing movie clips
my<00:01:12.180> buttons<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.760> then<00:01:14.760> target<00:01:15.360> three<00:01:18.200> okay<00:01:19.700> now

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.580 

now<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:24.180> each<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.110> um<00:01:26.659> let's<00:01:27.659> make<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.020> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
now in each one this um let's make it so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.880 
now in each one this um let's make it so
this<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.850> code<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.470> frame<00:01:31.680> let's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
this in this code up in this frame let's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.749 
this in this code up in this frame let's
make<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.630> stop<00:01:33.630> action<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.799> now<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.340> press

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
make it the stop action and now is press

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.499 
make it the stop action and now is press
f7<00:01:36.229> actually<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.350> six<00:01:37.680> sorry<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.509> now

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
f7 actually have six sorry and now

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.230 
f7 actually have six sorry and now
basically<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.549> animation

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
basically this will be the animation

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.889 
basically this will be the animation
that<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:43.020> click<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.540> okay<00:01:45.540> let's<00:01:45.780> make

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
that when we click on it okay let's make

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.490 
that when we click on it okay let's make
it<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.290> first<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:46.920> fine<00:01:47.570> then<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.869> goes<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
it the first one is fine then it goes a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:05.390 
it the first one is fine then it goes a
little<00:01:49.649> torn<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:52.549> little<00:01:53.549> torn<00:01:53.880> out

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.150 

and<00:02:06.400> then<00:02:07.320> completely<00:02:08.320> torn<00:02:08.770> out<00:02:08.950> by

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and then completely torn out by

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:21.870 
and then completely torn out by
completely<00:02:12.750> separated<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:20.250> then<00:02:21.250> eventually

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
completely separated and then eventually

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.360 
completely separated and then eventually
f7<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.230> can<00:02:23.670> bike<00:02:24.670> frame<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.560> we<00:02:27.280> don't

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
f7 it so you can bike frame and we don't

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.130 
f7 it so you can bike frame and we don't
want<00:02:27.460> us<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.880> come<00:02:28.060> back<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.300> we'll<00:02:28.600> press<00:02:28.870> f9

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
want us to come back so we'll press f9

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.480 
want us to come back so we'll press f9
and<00:02:29.500> stop<00:02:29.800> in<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:34.410> now<00:02:35.410> there's<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.890> code<00:02:36.130> inside

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
and stop in it now there's a code inside

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.780 
and stop in it now there's a code inside
what<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.880> plan<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.890> will<00:02:39.520> be<00:02:39.640> in<00:02:39.730> the

then<00:03:36.959> then<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:38.319> structure<00:03:42.540> yeah<00:03:44.340> and

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
then then a structure yeah and

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.440 
then then a structure yeah and
eventually<00:03:48.099> ends<00:03:48.639> up<00:03:48.700> with<00:03:48.909> that<00:03:49.150> ok<00:03:49.450> f<00:03:49.689> my<00:03:49.719> net
