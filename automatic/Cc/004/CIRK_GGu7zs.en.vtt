00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:11.940
 Desalination is also in this area. 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.940
 The appearance that it is desalted through relatively clean stainless steel 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:21.580
 What is the base of Europe 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.330
 Another map Oh to see the device Tok afforestation 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.370
 Ah ah ah 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:34.050
 We decided to check the state of the water stored in the tank. 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:38.810
 By the way, the expressions of the storage tanks look quite me 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.810
 It's okay, Citizen . 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:46.560
 not too 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.560
 There is a certain degree of material Rusty concrete furniture pictures do ah 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.470
 A tank that has not been maintained for a long time. It is filled with dirty particles inside. 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.470
 There is 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.110
 Oo 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.110
 So to say where to store food unconscious coming here 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.150
 By the way, I can see the floating nostalgia inside the tank . 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.480
 U 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:23.350
 I checked to see if there was too much of a hand on the edge of the tank . 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.649
 5 For a long time in the water, now you can see the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.649
 There is 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.990
 This is where we should normally do it. 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.650
 I can do good. 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:43.210
 You've been a manager long . 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:44.110
 Oh yes, if you own a horse as this is ignoring the mess we eat in the state 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.250
 Is to be 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:53.810
 Moose cic oh oh 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.600
 The biggest problem with hardened manufacturing environments is the use of concrete channels 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.680
 Will 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.720
 Copper tests how concrete tanks can affect food 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.130
 I tried it. 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.840
 First , prepare a container made of stainless steel you're concrete. 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:20.610
 I put water here, and I watched the foreign matter that happened over time. 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:20.610
 Wrc 5 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:31.910
 As a result of the test , concrete was sent from a mine 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.910
 Dementia was also go to the mineral content higher than twice 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:41.570
 In the water that was in the system 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:45.560
 There was not much of that kind of milk stuff, but in concrete 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.050
 The same government that can push the concrete to digest a lot of people classified material 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.740
 I was able to know that there 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:56.000
 When you've seen are collectively when those things come into the body through a radish 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:03:00.320
 Because humans do not have that network to digest and buy 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.060
 There are some materials that can act as an element for any water in the stomach 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.060
 I think that 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.060
 you
