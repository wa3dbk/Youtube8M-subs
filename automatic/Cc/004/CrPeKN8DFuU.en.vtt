00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.720
 here we can also connect the mountains to the discourse of speed 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.900
 and in any case fundamental because 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.329
 as you can see 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:27.509
 also 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.009
 in the early afternoons they always pose heaps 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.480
 us therefore it is the humidity that rises could bring web 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.310
 of bad weather 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.310
 therefore the combination of speed 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
 it means little also and safety 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.880
 if you have seen 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.060
 you also take the time to take a picture of a lot. and anyway the memories 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.180
 but the images remain in my mind, I can assemble you to live those 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.180
 moments that are very important 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.030
 now it was love or friendship 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.020
 alighieri lance 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.510
 published very suffered for 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.950
 conditions in high snow that 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.950
 who introduced us to the mountain 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.380
 I believe that when we arrived here our party was already 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.760
 white metal 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.920
 cook 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 our legs had not yet reached the top 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.010
 it's important 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.180
 always having the head, that is to say, later never stop at a good one in that 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.780
 moment physically 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.630
 will be able to go further will be able to think of what awaits you after doing 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.750
 that allows you to always be very focused eeeh expense for 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.750
 face what you will find in front of you 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.889
 all this was one of the 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.709
 the moments after arriving at the top of Novara were more 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.180
 the solemn of the king of the day and in any case another 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.649
 great difficulty is another 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:41.649
 a piece of the Rome ride was behind us 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.519
 but now rightly as Matthew said 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.290
 in front of us we have another in the points 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.249
 more delicate 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:55.799
 I believe that by connecting to the discourse of security I believe that people 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.219
 these images are very significant 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:04.819
 in that two people are very close to each other 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.639
 none that remain of the kind are much more secure 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.709
 in the sense that if one of the two where he slips the speaker making them from 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.029
 counterweight now 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.559
 absolutely nothing happens 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:20.579
 images 10 a person to play with a wire on top 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.229
 how do tightrope walkers if you make a mistake at home 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:55.299
 we arrive at the top of the third tip of the street scales 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.699
 in the middle of fog banks 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.549
 from here we go down. about 4 dowry up to the computer and 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.919
 and then the climb up the long begins 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.319
 culoarea clicks 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.319
 dumai you are taking the term 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.599
 the conditions less bad 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.849
 Milan. 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.520
 by now our term was still the 800 meters that 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.520
 that cd I still have with my head in the mountains 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:36.110
 and then finally even the comfortable rooms 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.110
 white head the head was already never person 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.919
 key, it's nice to find two companions 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:44.900
 two friends 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.909
 waiting for us here with me 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.219
 in the thermos of hot tea 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.710
 ps but they all those who gave us a hand 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.700

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.680
 companions of courmayeur see cervinia 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.720
 even I got to the top of white love each other it 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.969
 here we celebrated with them 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.449
 150 years anniversary 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.449
 in the activity of the company of convenience 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.449
 I was never when we reach the top of the white mountain 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.449
 it's a quarter past eight in the evening 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.680
 beautiful lights with a truly unforgettable sunset 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.620
 I order their businesses 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.430
 3 I saw not only children 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.119
 30 to 40 years ago but companies 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:11.729
 of their grown-ups 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.710
 anticipators of the great courmayeur guides who made history 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.759
 the Italian alchemist not only the history of Buddhism by courmayeur 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.770
