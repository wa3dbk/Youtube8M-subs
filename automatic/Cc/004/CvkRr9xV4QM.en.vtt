00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
necessarily fit on the other shelf but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.890 
necessarily fit on the other shelf but
mostly<00:02:30.060> they<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.380> same<00:02:31.620> size<00:02:32.420> boxes<00:02:33.420> but

mostly they have the same size boxes but

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.590 
mostly they have the same size boxes but
then<00:02:34.080> we<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.500> my<00:02:35.040> wall<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.790> wonder<00:02:36.240> these<00:02:36.450> are

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
then we have my wall of wonder these are

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.910 
then we have my wall of wonder these are
were<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.230> where<00:02:37.380> most<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> games

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
were we this is where most of the games

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.490 
were we this is where most of the games
we<00:02:38.070> play<00:02:38.280> comes<00:02:38.550> from<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.150> because<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.080> boxes

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
we play comes from and because the boxes

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.170 
we play comes from and because the boxes
are<00:02:40.680> fairly<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.070> same<00:02:41.190> size<00:02:41.670> they're<00:02:42.030> very

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
are fairly the same size they're very

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.150 
are fairly the same size they're very
easy<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.570> fit<00:02:42.750> on<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> shelf<00:02:43.200> especially

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
easy to fit on the shelf especially

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.710 
easy to fit on the shelf especially
these<00:02:44.280> games<00:02:44.700> here<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.420> my<00:02:45.510> favorite

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
boxes just stack so neatly some games I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.490 
boxes just stack so neatly some games I
place<00:02:56.160> up<00:02:56.400> on<00:02:56.610> their<00:02:57.090> side<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:58.440> I'm

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
place up on their side like that but I'm

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.840 
place up on their side like that but I'm
not<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.650> real<00:02:58.800> big<00:02:59.010> fan<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.250> doing<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.790> way

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
not a real big fan of doing it that way

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.570 
not a real big fan of doing it that way
if<00:03:00.090> only<00:03:00.330> because<00:03:00.660> yeah<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:02.010> don't<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.400> how

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
if only because yeah I don't like how

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.160 
if only because yeah I don't like how
the<00:03:02.640> pieces<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.180> fall<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.720> one<00:03:03.870> end<00:03:04.080> of

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
the pieces all fall to the one end of

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.750 
the pieces all fall to the one end of
the<00:03:04.230> box<00:03:04.470> even<00:03:04.800> if<00:03:04.890> they're<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.100> plastic<00:03:05.550> bags

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the box even if they're in plastic bags

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.550 
the box even if they're in plastic bags
but<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.690> makes<00:03:06.870> them<00:03:06.990> fit<00:03:07.140> better<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
but it makes them fit better on the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.500 
but it makes them fit better on the
shelf<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:07.890> that's<00:03:08.160> why<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:08.850> do<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.150> for<00:03:09.300> some<00:03:09.480> of

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
shelf so that's why I do it for some of

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.890 
shelf so that's why I do it for some of
the<00:03:09.660> games<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.460> see<00:03:11.670> all<00:03:12.240> kinds

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the games and so you can see all kinds

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.630 
the games and so you can see all kinds
of<00:03:12.960> games<00:03:13.110> here<00:03:13.560> here's<00:03:13.890> my<00:03:14.070> Carcassonne

basically it my game room I know that
there's<00:05:44.460> collections<00:05:45.030> all<00:05:45.539> over<00:05:46.139> the<00:05:46.260> world
