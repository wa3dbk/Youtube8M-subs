00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
betting on this first match where we're

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.740 
betting on this first match where we're
tight<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.489> his<00:02:57.580> home<00:02:57.790> whereas<00:02:58.360> in<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.540> second

match<00:02:58.840> epsilon<00:02:59.470> his<00:02:59.590> home<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.160> realistically

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
match epsilon his home so realistically

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.880 
match epsilon his home so realistically
Titan<00:03:01.510> will<00:03:01.630> probably<00:03:01.989> win<00:03:02.140> both<00:03:02.380> matches<00:03:02.770> but

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.030 
like I just said I don't really want to
go<00:03:17.170> through<00:03:17.380> all<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.800> odds<00:03:17.920> for

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
go through all that but the odds for

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.340 
go through all that but the odds for
this<00:03:18.160> one<00:03:18.280> are<00:03:18.370> 63<00:03:18.790> 237<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.450> csgo<00:03:19.780> lunch<00:03:19.960> and<00:03:20.170> my

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
this one are 63 237 on csgo lunch and my

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.260 
this one are 63 237 on csgo lunch and my
parcel<00:03:20.590> odds<00:03:20.680> are<00:03:20.830> 6040<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.550> gave<00:03:21.910> them<00:03:22.030> lower

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
parcel odds are 6040 I gave them lower

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.700 
parcel odds are 6040 I gave them lower
odds<00:03:22.420> because<00:03:22.660> epsilon<00:03:22.990> is<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.350> home<00:03:23.500> team

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
odds because epsilon is the home team

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.410 
odds because epsilon is the home team
now<00:03:23.860> right<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.610> my<00:03:24.700> recommendation<00:03:24.850> here<00:03:25.330> is

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
now right so my recommendation here is

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.000 
now right so my recommendation here is
skip<00:03:25.600> this<00:03:25.750> as<00:03:25.930> if<00:03:26.290> there<00:03:26.470> was<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> chance<00:03:26.770> for

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
skip this as if there was a chance for

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.350 
skip this as if there was a chance for
epsilon<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.400> throw<00:03:27.580> it's<00:03:27.790> definitely<00:03:28.240> when

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
epsilon to throw it's definitely when

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.750 
epsilon to throw it's definitely when
they're<00:03:28.450> at<00:03:28.570> home<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.650> what<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.430> home<00:03:30.550> team

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
they're at home and what the home team

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.190 
they're at home and what the home team
means<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.210> they<00:03:31.300> get<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.510> pick<00:03:31.660> side<00:03:31.870> first

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
means is they get to pick side first

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.900 
means is they get to pick side first
which<00:03:32.500> can<00:03:32.680> be<00:03:32.770> pretty<00:03:33.010> devastating<00:03:33.220> on<00:03:33.670> dust2

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
which can be pretty devastating on dust2

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.660 
which can be pretty devastating on dust2
if<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.180> get<00:03:34.330> like<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.930> 10-5<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:35.920> 1140<00:03:36.460> side

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
if you get like a 10-5 and 1140 side

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.920 
if you get like a 10-5 and 1140 side
then<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.120> kind<00:03:37.210> of<00:03:37.330> just<00:03:37.390> fall<00:03:37.690> back<00:03:37.870> and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
then you can kind of just fall back and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.770 
then you can kind of just fall back and
have<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.890> really<00:03:39.250> really<00:03:39.370> safe<00:03:39.670> CT<00:03:40.000> side<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.420> be

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
have a really really safe CT side and be

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.990 
have a really really safe CT side and be
able<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.050> win<00:03:41.170> pretty<00:03:41.410> easily<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.920> would<00:03:42.850> wait

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
able to win pretty easily I would wait

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.310 
able to win pretty easily I would wait
to<00:03:43.090> see<00:03:43.240> if<00:03:43.450> you're<00:03:43.660> going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.990> like<00:03:44.110> if<00:03:44.230> you

let's just go lounge I would wait to see

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.450 
let's just go lounge I would wait to see
how<00:03:46.780> game<00:03:46.990> one<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.410> if<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:47.800> stomp<00:03:48.040> bet<00:03:48.280> for

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
how game one is if it's a stomp bet for

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.000 
how game one is if it's a stomp bet for
what<00:03:48.580> other<00:03:48.730> side<00:03:48.910> stomps<00:03:49.830> because<00:03:50.830> most

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
what other side stomps because most

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.010 
what other side stomps because most
likely<00:03:51.310> like<00:03:51.520> if<00:03:51.700> Titans<00:03:52.330> home<00:03:52.480> in<00:03:52.660> epsilon

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020

number three they're kind of risky bets

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.420 
number three they're kind of risky bets
especially<00:04:05.620> when<00:04:05.680> epsilons<00:04:06.010> at<00:04:06.100> home<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.370> I'd
