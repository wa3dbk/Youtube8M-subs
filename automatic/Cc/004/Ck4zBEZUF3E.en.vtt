well<00:00:18.869> without<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.410> question<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.310> think<00:00:20.340> that

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
well without a question and I think that

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.310 
well without a question and I think that
he<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:20.910> showed<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.390> other<00:00:21.449> night<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
he really showed the other night you

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.439 
he really showed the other night you
know<00:00:22.350> forty<00:00:22.949> nine<00:00:23.100> saves<00:00:23.490> first<00:00:23.880> second

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
know forty nine saves first second

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.900 
know forty nine saves first second
consecutive<00:00:24.750> shutout<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:26.430> thought<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
consecutive shutout and I just thought a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.279 
consecutive shutout and I just thought a
couple<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> times<00:00:27.480> during<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.810> hockey<00:00:28.019> game

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
couple of times during the hockey game

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.560 
couple of times during the hockey game
they<00:00:28.439> showed<00:00:28.710> his<00:00:28.920> eyes<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.210> me<00:00:30.359> that's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
they showed his eyes and to me that's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.450 
they showed his eyes and to me that's
the<00:00:30.779> big<00:00:30.929> key<00:00:31.170> hit<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> focus<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.099> he's<00:00:32.250> in

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the big key hit the focus that he's in

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.389 
the big key hit the focus that he's in
right<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:32.989> he's<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.230> tremendous<00:00:34.530> spot<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
right now he's in a tremendous spot and

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.220 
right now he's in a tremendous spot and
I<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.149> when<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.540> look<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:36.960> he<00:00:37.079> did

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I think that when you look what he did

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.680 
I think that when you look what he did
during<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> all-star<00:00:37.800> break<00:00:38.280> by<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.480> back

guy<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.130> speedy<00:01:26.520> guy<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.000> Bozak<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.750> think

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
guy in a speedy guy like Bozak I think

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.330 
guy in a speedy guy like Bozak I think
the<00:01:28.170> three<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:28.860> started<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the three of them have really started to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.649 
the three of them have really started to
complement<00:01:29.790> each<00:01:29.850> other<00:01:30.090> even<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.479> much

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
complement each other even that much

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.319 
complement each other even that much
more<00:01:30.720> it's<00:01:31.020> been<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> Phil<00:01:32.340> Kessel<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.060> Joffrey

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
more it's been a Phil Kessel and Joffrey

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.060 
more it's been a Phil Kessel and Joffrey
Lupul<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> most<00:01:34.290> part<00:01:34.500> throughout<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
Lupul for the most part throughout the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.920 
Lupul for the most part throughout the
course<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> whole<00:01:35.640> season<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
course of the whole season and now that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.480 
course of the whole season and now that
third<00:01:37.170> person<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> line<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.159> really

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
third person on the line is really

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
third person on the line is really
taking<00:01:39.090> charge<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.869> think<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.229> only

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
taking charge and I think that's only

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
taking charge and I think that's only
spells<00:01:41.009> good<00:01:41.250> things<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> Toronto<00:01:41.939> Maple

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
in a while and I think that confidence

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.400 
in a while and I think that confidence
in<00:02:12.780> their<00:02:12.959> game

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
in their game

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.260 
in their game
is<00:02:13.500> really<00:02:13.920> started<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.340> come<00:02:14.520> out<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.940> I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
together here and let's hope that it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.060 
together here and let's hope that it
continues<00:02:18.960> here<00:02:19.320> because<00:02:19.740> it's<00:02:19.890> been<00:02:20.010> a

that Luke Schenn confidence in his game
one<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.710> best<00:03:01.890> games<00:03:01.980> i've<00:03:02.280> seen<00:03:02.310> him<00:03:02.550> play

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
one of the best games i've seen him play

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.790 
one of the best games i've seen him play
over<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.450> last<00:03:03.660> three<00:03:03.930> or<00:03:04.020> four<00:03:04.080> hockey<00:03:04.470> games

over the last three or four hockey games
he's<00:03:05.010> been<00:03:05.160> outstanding<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:05.970> think<00:03:06.150> that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
he's been outstanding and I think that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.590 
he's been outstanding and I think that
pressure<00:03:06.840> from<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.710> outside<00:03:08.190> as<00:03:08.460> far<00:03:08.700> as<00:03:08.940> you

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
pressure from the outside as far as you

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.290 
pressure from the outside as far as you
know<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:10.680> know<00:03:10.770> there's<00:03:11.280> gonna<00:03:11.910> be<00:03:12.120> somebody

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
that he's taken that and really took his

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.210 
that he's taken that and really took his
game<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.320> next<00:03:16.470> level<00:03:16.620> because<00:03:17.010> he

game to the next level because he

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.350
