00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
with these data east boards now the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.779 
with these data east boards now the
first<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:26.039> one<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.400> one<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.699> I've

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
first one here this one is one that I've

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.150 
first one here this one is one that I've
had<00:00:26.970> for<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.180> long<00:00:27.240> time<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.619> gate<00:00:29.010> of

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
had for a long time and that is gate of

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.429 
had for a long time and that is gate of
doom<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.730> as<00:00:30.269> one<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.929> cannot<00:00:31.170> seem

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
doom and as one that I just cannot seem

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.410 
doom and as one that I just cannot seem
to<00:00:31.470> figure<00:00:31.710> out<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> problem<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.520> all<00:00:32.759> three

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
to figure out the problem with all three

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.240 
to figure out the problem with all three
of<00:00:33.450> these<00:00:33.600> boards<00:00:34.020> have<00:00:34.230> some<00:00:34.469> sort<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> issues

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of these boards have some sort of issues

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.400 
of these boards have some sort of issues
to<00:00:35.280> them<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.989> know<00:00:37.110> trying<00:00:37.350> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
to them and I think you know trying to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
to them and I think you know trying to
work<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:38.040> whatever<00:00:38.489> problems<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.180> have

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
work out whatever problems they have

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.389 
work out whatever problems they have
trying<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.770> figure<00:00:40.920> out<00:00:41.040> what's

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
trying to see if I can figure out what's

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.459 
trying to see if I can figure out what's
going<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:41.730> them<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.390> had<00:00:42.629> absolutely<00:00:43.230> no

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
going on with them but had absolutely no

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.080 
going on with them but had absolutely no
luck<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> seems<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> data<00:00:44.910> east

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
luck and it seems to be the data east

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.850 
luck and it seems to be the data east
ones<00:00:45.360> which<00:00:45.600> had<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.780> worst<00:00:46.050> now<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> first

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
ones which had the worst now the first

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.799 
ones which had the worst now the first
one<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.370> sent<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.000> off<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.480> try<00:00:48.660> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
one here I sent this one off to try and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.580 
one here I sent this one off to try and
get<00:00:48.930> repaired<00:00:49.379> once<00:00:49.829> before<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:51.320> when<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.350> set

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
get repaired once before and when I set

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.889 
get repaired once before and when I set
it<00:00:52.680> off<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.039> had<00:00:53.190> sound<00:00:53.460> when<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.239> came<00:00:54.449> back<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it off it had sound when it came back it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
it off it had sound when it came back it
had<00:00:55.020> no<00:00:55.230> sound<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.520> biggest<00:00:56.850> problem<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
had no sound but the biggest problem is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
had no sound but the biggest problem is
that<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.590> see<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.100> game<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.460> playing

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
that you can see this game is playing

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.189 
that you can see this game is playing

character sprites in here you can see

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.270 
character sprites in here you can see
some<00:01:05.700> line<00:01:06.090> settle<00:01:06.450> flash<00:01:06.659> from<00:01:06.840> time<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.170> time

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
some line settle flash from time to time

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.370 
some line settle flash from time to time
which<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.430> thought<00:01:08.640> might<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:09.060> been<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
which I thought might have been the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.520 
which I thought might have been the
character<00:01:11.150> roms<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.960> went<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.229> tried<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
character roms and I went I tried to

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.020 
character roms and I went I tried to
burn<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> couple<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.130> those<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.369> put<00:01:14.760> them<00:01:14.880> in

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
burn a couple of those and put them in

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
burn a couple of those and put them in
but<00:01:15.270> wasn't<00:01:15.810> able<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.140> fix<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.770> problem<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
but wasn't able to fix that problem and

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.429 
but wasn't able to fix that problem and
I'm<00:01:17.939> not<00:01:18.090> sure<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.689> ram<00:01:18.990> related

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
I'm not sure if this is a ram related

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
I'm not sure if this is a ram related

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
check out the board and see what I can

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.130 
check out the board and see what I can
do<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.670> for<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> very<00:01:24.270> long<00:01:24.570> time<00:01:24.630> and

really rough situation with this one too
let's<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.610> can

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
let's see if I can

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.990 
let's see if I can
this<00:02:09.600> on<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:12.319> so<00:02:13.430> plug<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.819> and

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
this on here so plug this one in and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.120 
this on here so plug this one in and
give<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.780> one<00:02:15.990> a<00:02:16.020> shot<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:25.620> can<00:02:25.800> turn<00:02:25.980> this

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
give this one a shot we can turn this

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.210 
give this one a shot we can turn this
one<00:02:26.190> down<00:02:26.370> here<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.760> little<00:02:26.820> bit<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:29.070> you

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
one down here a little bit but as you

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.760 
one down here a little bit but as you
can<00:02:29.340> see<00:02:29.580> there's<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.270> nice<00:02:30.660> line<00:02:31.080> through<00:02:31.440> here

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
can see there's a nice line through here

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.470 
can see there's a nice line through here
and<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:33.750> top<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.830> all<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.150> character

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
and on top of that all of the character

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.500 
and on top of that all of the character
sprites<00:02:36.630> are<00:02:36.870> completely<00:02:37.350> gone<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:38.510> it's

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
sprites are completely gone so it's

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.790 
sprites are completely gone so it's
something<00:02:39.750> where<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.080> went<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.410> took<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.770> look

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800

something where I went and took a look
at<00:02:41.130> some<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> these<00:02:41.520> eproms<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.600> were<00:02:42.690> over

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
at some of these eproms that were over

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.870 
at some of these eproms that were over
here<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.620> took<00:02:43.680> out<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.250> original<00:02:44.760> knee

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
here and I took out the original knee

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.610 
here and I took out the original knee
problems<00:02:45.270> i<00:02:45.330> also<00:02:45.480> put<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.840> different<00:02:46.050> eproms

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
problems i also put in different eproms

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.030 
problems i also put in different eproms
and<00:02:47.660> they<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.110> not<00:02:49.140> come<00:02:49.560> back<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:51.920> as<00:02:52.920> you

and they just do not come back so as you

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.630 
and they just do not come back so as you
can<00:02:53.160> see<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.890> one's<00:02:56.130> playing<00:02:56.430> with

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
can see here this one's playing with

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.100 
can see here this one's playing with
music<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:58.370> no<00:02:59.370> characters<00:03:01.820> so<00:03:02.820> this<00:03:03.690> one<00:03:03.930> is

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
music but no characters so this one is

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.920 
music but no characters so this one is
gotten<00:03:04.860> much<00:03:05.130> worse<00:03:05.450> since<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.540> first<00:03:06.750> time<00:03:06.870> I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
gotten much worse since the first time I

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.140 
gotten much worse since the first time I
picked<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.320> up<00:03:07.380> here<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.730> absolutely

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
picked it up here and I have absolutely

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.580 
picked it up here and I have absolutely
no<00:03:09.239> clue<00:03:09.480> what<00:03:09.690> is<00:03:09.780> going<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:10.080> with<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.290> one

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590
