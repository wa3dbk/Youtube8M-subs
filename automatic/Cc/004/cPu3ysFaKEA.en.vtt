00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.059
 hello welcome to the board now let's see 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.650
 the circulatory system of arthropods 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.680
 What is this system like? 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.830
 good personal lute arthropods system 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.980
 circulatory system is still open and what 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.850
 means the same means that the 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.430
 the circulating liquid leaves the vessels 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.369
 the circulatory system is that system 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.949
 which makes transport and substances for 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.199
 all regions of the body and to 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.280
 understand when it is the system of 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.860
 arthropods 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.640
 we will see here the circulatory system of 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.660
 1 113 nor our good river 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.510
 the arthropods presents a heart 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.540
 this heart is located in the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.030
 dorsal region of the animal's body 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.629
 but what are the regions of this body 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.390
 remembering then the head region is the 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.210
 anterior region 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.880
 this region where we find the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:13.130
 years is the posterior region above 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.280
 more or less in the region of the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.310
 animal we have the dorsal region that is 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.530
 where the heart is and below the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.610
 Central region 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.810
 but what does this heart make good the heart 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.429
 pumps the circulating liquid first 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.289
 this liquid will go out in the heart for a 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.890
 artery then we have here 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.590
 represented the artery 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.280
 this liquid will be pumped and when 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.190
 it arrives that it falls into a cavity and 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.860
 What is the name of this cavity? 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:56.000
 personal capacity is called from and in the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.780
 it is here that this liquid goes into 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.360
 direct contact with the cells already down 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.340
 here is a cell of yellow and this 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.539
 liquid circulating in the system 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.679
 circulatory system is called the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.829
 clean 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.719
 then's there bubble will contact 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:17.760
 with the cells 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:20.250
 it carries nutrients 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.450
 that will be absorbed by this cello and 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.790
 on the other hand receives scraps that also 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.640
 will be transported and driven to 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.970
 the excretory system that we will see in 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.780
 next class but a lot of attention people 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.530
 it is worth remembering here that the insects and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.870
 bolivia does not transport gas 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.329
 gas exchange takes place in the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.120
 tracheae as we have seen in the last 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.760
 soul in other arthropods as per 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.370
 example crustaceans shellfish already there 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.670
 presents services that are able to 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.220
 of transporting oxygen 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.180
 after this link circulated it 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.790
 back to the heart through the vein 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.470
 so here is hemolymph and returning 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.079
 to the heart 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.230
 and it is interesting that the hearts of 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.079
 arthropods is divided internally into 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.290
 cameras and on these cameras 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:22.349
 There are great but what 's this? 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.859
 good staff members are a kind of 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.870
 valves and why they are important 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:32.040
 well they are very important for 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:36.449
 maintain the direction of movement always 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.449
 posterior region to the anterior region 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:42.919
 then shred despite this system 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:46.410
 circulatory system will open the hemolymph 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.160
 circulates in a single direction and only to 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.169
 close 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.310
 I also want to show that some 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.639
 species may have hearts 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.579
 advisors 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:00.209
 but what these hearts the stage 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.909
 accessory hearts help pump the 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.329
 hemolymph to the most distant regions 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:09.690
 of the body such as for the wings 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:13.109
 with these hearts the hemolymph can 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.690
 get there at the end of the wing 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:18.510
 we ended up here with the system 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.099
 next time we'll talk 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.870
 about the writer 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.870
 I'll wait you there, see you later
