00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.640
 Let's go. Use of inner product Here we have the knowledge of the vector we have learned so far 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:14.450
 Yeah Hey using 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:18.170
 I am doing in the 94 number of problems and let's solve the like a marmot application problem 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:24.200
 That the Tteyuu lottery theorem wonder if the number i the number of Yeah 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:29.509
 Out not It is tan is that it tries to prove by using a vector Ya that Nema good song 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:33.800
 It's an overly applied problem. I try to do various things using the knowledge I learned so far. 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.470
 It is this 3 Tsunan but not a higher good I problem always saying that as the Well Tips 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.350
 Figure # 2 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:45.720
 I well and trying to do also all be able to look at the always think about it when and keyword tips 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.990
 Most of the people who can that application problems Once a problem anymore not a little You know something familiar 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.340
 Not'm so I'm become to smoking do not know anymore 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.460
 It's there is a possibility to open the road And then a try for the time being all that came up 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.230
 Let's try it all 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.710
 Hmm 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.450
 The third one is already a pattern more than anything as I always say 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.989
 It's determined little pattern every time singing also application problem to the center test level 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.950
 Ne 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.620
 So when would the other familiar and real will be able to 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.960
 There is 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:21.750
 Although this problem is a problem that can not be seen, such is in so much pattern specific to this figure and specific examples 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:28.650
 If you're thinking about doing everything you can write, it's actually not that hard. 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.340
 The triangle abc say whether the problem Neto drawn very of bc from Oite vertex a 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.560
 lottery 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:39.220
 That is, the midpoint of bc 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:47.010
 Because lottery theorem when this sounds lottery to do it and am drawn a line towards the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:50.970
 Speaking after not you What lottery defined as I hold this squared + This 2 tablets 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:57.980
 2 square +9 It is twice as I of Article 2 of here 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:02.500
 I'd say even a different issue areas squared + in place and I will go off ash to the square of this 25+ of this 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:06.370
 Hey, this is a sound that will prove to me using Narita 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:12.750
 The Hey am vector a vector bm vector lobby a District Toro 4 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:16.590
 The proof is that it is said that the members we proved are after all 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.440
 ab squared + ac squared 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:26.930
 It is a square of double Aim + square of bm 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:31.830
 'Cause or say if I as learned in as soon as the equality of proof to this proof is first in this Sahei 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:35.520
 The left side looks like this 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.660
 Will be the same for wind 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.890
 The left-hand side Airship edited by 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:48.310
 There was a heavy flow of 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:52.180
 Sound management this is now also a'll become How about this this and is together very it in the vector 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:56.299
 It's such should be you and And then together Arawaso at the corner Lou vector 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:01.159
 Consider the square of the square + a 4 of ab in the fact that 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.569
 In the square magnitude of the Nde length vector of this side it Tteyuu image for sperm respectively to shrimp 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.829
 It is equal to 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.940
 Equal circumstances magnitude of the vector when the words c Tadase to the size of the ab vector 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:14.340
 With father in size of vector 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.140
 Well then you might think of what aba's size 2 ride and what ain't you aba 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.280
 I wonder if I could be given something 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:24.450
 But the 8-day ab vector is amd a smb vector 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.540
 So aba m + em b means a vector-b 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.650
 Is it not 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.310
 Reverse mba Kokkara one added that bm is that b is negative b 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.530
 is not it 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.100
 If you know the schedule - b 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:40.800
 Ac vectra am similarly mc out 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:46.870
 m You might think that you do not want to know Mr. Mc but of course pm and pm 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:51.480
 Because they are on a straight line and equal in size, they are equal, so they are the same as the b vector 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:55.650
 And become a + day mc issuing ac vector im by say 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:58.000
 Well 2 riding I mean that the size of the square and the static vector of the magnitude of the ab vector 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:04.270
 It'll be on a formula that say: 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:09.190
 It is this sorry is not a little sorry I is missing the notation of the magnitude of this vector 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.170
 In this way but I think that there was full anywhere in the calculation of the inner product of another vector 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.250
 You can expand it like 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:20.810
 People who do not know the development here is more than this problem is difficult 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:26.240
 And please refer to the there ne because vector no kk's suspicious to Come reference 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:32.060
 Door I would be very size of the Tokoro + Nibeku this to the size of the calculated person effect 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.689
 That means that the square and only of b to the square + a 4 2 ride I mean the brother of ab 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.580
 It'll become you Deko to 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:43.550
 This completes the process until the left side = next stage 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:46.139
 Next to it is the right side = bookstore, that is, the double of the aim Ame dm squared 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.280
 If you calculate what happens 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.939
 Am that at first am up to bm 3 even if you calculate it, it is OK if you relive at the end 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.030
 Right 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:58.050
 We calculate the square + pm 2 square am at that 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:02.520
 In the same way am 2 of the ride is the effect bm given at the beginning 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.110
 2 aboard the I mean is squared + b the end of the day a day because it is a vector that is given at the beginning 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.190
 It will be squared 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.569
 Of course, this will be convenient when there is no help for people on the second floor of the 4 stores 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:16.580
 In other words, the right side was also piggybacked on private 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:19.879
 The left side is also the end of the war in the mini jet ie 12 good children 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.939
 It can be said that it holds true here 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:29.740
 You may think 6 by costume 4 problem though 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:29.740
 I think it was a problem that I could do without difficulty if I tried to do all the knowledge I could learn until now
