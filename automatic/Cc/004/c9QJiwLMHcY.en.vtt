they call Jill and that technology is a

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.839 
they call Jill and that technology is a
thicker<00:02:18.750> ink<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.440> high<00:02:19.650> viscosity<00:02:19.950> and

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
thicker ink it's a high viscosity and

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.180 
thicker ink it's a high viscosity and
that<00:02:21.480> allows<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.080> be<00:02:22.319> highly<00:02:22.680> efficient

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
that allows it to be highly efficient

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.210 
that allows it to be highly efficient
for<00:02:23.790> instance<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.840> my<00:02:25.080> calculations<00:02:25.890> one

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
for instance to my calculations one

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.930 
for instance to my calculations one
milliliter<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:27.379> the<00:02:28.379> gel<00:02:28.709> ink<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
milliliter of the gel ink is the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.509 
milliliter of the gel ink is the
equivalent<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.629> three<00:02:30.900> milliliters<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.860> the

equivalent of three milliliters of the
kind<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.819> ink<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.210> would<00:02:33.360> run<00:02:33.569> through<00:02:33.780> an

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
kind of ink that would run through an

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.610 
kind of ink that would run through an
so<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.820> very<00:02:36.060> efficient<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:37.470> that

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
so it's very efficient and what that

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.460 
so it's very efficient and what that
means<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.670> low<00:02:38.970> cost<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:40.110> great

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
means to you is low cost so great

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.650 
means to you is low cost so great

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
buying the printer which you know you'll

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.170 
buying the printer which you know you'll
get<00:03:15.930> all<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.350> with<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.650> printer<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:18.030> can

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
get all this with the printer you can

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.660 
get all this with the printer you can
also<00:03:18.390> buy<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> few<00:03:19.260> optional<00:03:20.010> accessories

there<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> bypass<00:03:22.140> tray<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:23.010> think<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
there is a bypass tray and I think the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.980 
there is a bypass tray and I think the
bypass<00:03:23.790> tray<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.270> very<00:03:24.540> helpful<00:03:24.900> for<00:03:25.850> printing

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
bypass tray is very helpful for printing

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.170 
bypass tray is very helpful for printing
longer<00:03:27.990> things<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.710> with<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> bypass<00:03:29.400> tray<00:03:29.730> we

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
longer things so with the bypass tray we

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.660 
longer things so with the bypass tray we
can't<00:03:30.420> do<00:03:30.600> wider<00:03:30.930> we're<00:03:31.410> still<00:03:31.650> limited<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.520> an

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
can't do wider we're still limited to an

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.880 
can't do wider we're still limited to an
8<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.000> 1/2<00:03:33.060> inch<00:03:33.510> width<00:03:33.810> but<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.590> can<00:03:34.740> do

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
8 and 1/2 inch width but we can do

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.730 
8 and 1/2 inch width but we can do
longer<00:03:35.460> things<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:35.910> I've<00:03:36.030> cut<00:03:36.360> paper<00:03:36.630> that's<00:03:37.470> 8

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
longer things so I've cut paper that's 8

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.000 
longer things so I've cut paper that's 8
and<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> half<00:03:37.950> by<00:03:38.100> 21<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.810> allow<00:03:40.080> an<00:03:40.470> entry<00:03:40.830> level

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
and a half by 21 to allow an entry level

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.150 
and a half by 21 to allow an entry level
system<00:03:41.670> for<00:03:42.120> socks<00:03:42.740> it's<00:03:43.740> a<00:03:43.830> little<00:03:44.040> bit

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
system for socks it's a little bit

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.800 
system for socks it's a little bit
challenging<00:03:44.370> because<00:03:44.880> normally<00:03:45.540> with<00:03:45.660> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
challenging because normally with the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.900 
challenging because normally with the
big<00:03:45.959> printers<00:03:46.380> we<00:03:46.590> can<00:03:46.770> do<00:03:46.920> two<00:03:47.190> socks<00:03:47.520> at<00:03:47.820> the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
big printers we can do two socks at the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.350 
big printers we can do two socks at the
same<00:03:48.120> time<00:03:48.390> so<00:03:49.170> it's<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.340> little<00:03:50.550> bit<00:03:50.820> pushing

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
same time so it's a little bit pushing

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.780 
same time so it's a little bit pushing
pushing<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.990> limit<00:03:52.320> but<00:03:52.830> at<00:03:53.100> conde<00:03:53.580> that's

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
pushing the limit but at conde that's

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.580 
pushing the limit but at conde that's
what<00:03:54.030> we<00:03:54.150> do<00:03:54.360> that's<00:03:54.660> how<00:03:54.900> we<00:03:54.959> grow<00:03:55.350> and

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
what we do that's how we grow and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.850 
what we do that's how we grow and
prosper<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.459> help<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.390> push<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:58.440> so
