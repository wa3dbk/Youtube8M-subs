00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.049
 good evening people and welcome 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 three of my olympia special sochi 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.509
 2014 and yes as already announced take 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.880
 Let's do the sport tonight 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.550
 ice hockey before so have ice hockey 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.250
 we once the women and once the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.990
 mens as a match and yes the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.230
 male gentlemen have unfortunately 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.500
 not qualified for olympia the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.210
 Women are qualified but for gold 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.059
 it will certainly not be enough though 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.710
 there is a bronze medal, the one will 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.450
 then see 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.540
 but the chances of gold are very high 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 very low because the two ice hockey 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.879
 nations already have it there 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.730
 both the best chances so the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.399
 Canadians and Americans so we have 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.879
 with the men we have the following 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.010
 So the overall model is the first one 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.800
 nine of the current world ranking directly 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.100
 qualify olympia and the three 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 more will be over 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.130
 qualification tournaments then into 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.939
 main field taken by the men 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.070
 There are a total of three groups with 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.930
 four teams each 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.090
 teams so the groups the first 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 the best three teams in the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.689
 World rankings are the group heads 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.850
 then, after that, almost every group gets 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.500
 from the teams of the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.390
 world ranking four to six then one 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.650
 seven to nine and ten to twelve 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.320
 so that the groups then possible 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.150
 are balanced with a strong then 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.890
 a medium middle and a middle 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.439
 easy opponent as it usually does 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.240
 everywhere with seedlists is made in 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.299
 Everyone fought the first round too 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.689
 against everyone within the group and in the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.920
 then these groups will be connected 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.570
 broken down after placement in the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.329
 group after the points of the goal difference 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.939
 and the gates the three groups first 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.950
 and the best group-wide is then 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.630
 directly in the quarterfinals and the 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.149
 remaining eight teams play 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.909
 then the other four places for 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.159
 quarterfinals off then comes off 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.869
 this list is the fifth against the 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.670
 twelfth the sixth against the eleventh 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.440
 the 70 against the tenth and the eighth 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.390
 against the 9th 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.410
 then it will be completely normal in the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.650
 ko-round of the 4th 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.420
 played in the final and the semi-final 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.870
 and then the losers play 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.320
 in the match for third place and bronze 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.580
 and the winners in the final round about gold altogether 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.010
 normal also three times 20 minutes so 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.290
 three thirds each with 20 minutes 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.720
 the time will of course be stopped if 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.340
 the doll from the game is at 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.820
 a draw is there an overtime 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.490
 and commuted completely normal and at 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.210
 We have women's competition on the very 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.100
 First of all, the first six 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.200
 the world ranking in the tournament 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.330
 and about qualifying tournaments two 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.540
 further here we have four teams 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.410
 less so only two groups and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.870
 it's all a bit like this here 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.540
 easier in the groups then too 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.760
 again a set list by draw 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.500
 or may not be drawn but 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.330
 they are then simply in the groups 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.170
 depending on how they are used in the 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.460
 world ranking and the two 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.080
 bad worst teams in 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.090
 the respective groups after each 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.790
 against everyone has landed 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.209
 almost at the placement games 5 bis 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.520
 8th 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.140
 and the groups first and second 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.390
 then play cross over the semifinals 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.459
 that is, the first group a plays 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.470
 against the second group b and the 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.730
 second in group a plays against the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.310
 first in group b 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.080
 there it goes once in a row semi-final 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.420
 then then also quite normal play around 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.630
 third place and the final overall 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.110
 we see that in ice hockey from the 8 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.230
 february is played until the 23 february 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.390
 it is also the longest running one 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.050
 So the longest running sport 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.340
 every day , almost every day 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.970
 is either a qualifier 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.560
 or decision game and it will be 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.720
 but only two gold medals 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.870
 then given once for the men 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.770
 and once for the ladies here we see 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.410
 then again in 2010, the canadian have the 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.239
 Americans defeated in their own country 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.980
 Canada and America is ice hockey 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.760
 Of course, a completely different Schnack than 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.090
 in Germany 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.300
 So there it is with the sport number 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.010
 one here it is then the football and 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.650
 ice hockey handball 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.300
 have rather a smaller one 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.640
 assessment will become so favorite then 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.500
 of course with the men as well as with 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.360
 the ladies then the canadian and the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.640
 Americans see here then we see 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.870
 again from the ladies the program of 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.210
 8 to the 20th 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.990
 february the final will take place 2010 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.050
 here also the canadian ladies have 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.820
 almost brought home the gold medal 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.450
 and in the favoritenkreis are next to the 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.920
 Canadians also americans 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.880
 will be held 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.520
 qualifiers all in the disc 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.460
 eis-arena scheiber is the russian that 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.900
 Russian word for the puck before 7000 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.520
 so watch out for the two 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.350
 final matches or up to the four 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.670
 final games 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.400
 There is still a game for third place 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.830
 find all the qualifiers in the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.890
 slice ice arena instead of and in the 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.440
 bolschoi act in the building ice palace there 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.180
 it's the final one, that's because 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.440
 the bayarena because even one time 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.660
 that's a bit bigger here 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.230
 12,000 people place that's the right one 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.720
 arena and the left arena can 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.120
 by the way, after the games again 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.830
 be dismantled and in another place 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.800
 to be rebuilt that is here 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.420
 There are some arenas at the Olympics 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.340
 simply be dismantled again 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.320
 if olympia is over why should 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.030
 which also in a relatively small city 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.910
 where actually the room is 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.190
 winter sports are not the biggest 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.140
 In any case, it has value 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.910
 possible this arena again completely 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.740
 dismantle and in another place 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.260
 rebuild 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.560
 yes the German ladies as said the 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.750
 have already medal chances but for 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.180
 gold it certainly will not be enough because 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.150
 be sure the canadians or 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.350
 americans beat the men 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.310
 Unfortunately there is no German team on 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.690
 start the namely have the 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:23.850
 Unfortunately, unfortunately missed qualification and 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.430
 also your america or canada 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.200
 we will definitely see 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.350
 nice that you have been there again 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.230

 this sport will be alpine skiing 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.150
 people then you the 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.490
