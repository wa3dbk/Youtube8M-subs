on<00:00:08.220> my<00:00:08.490> UV<00:00:09.150> sterilizer<00:00:12.320> this<00:00:13.320> thing<00:00:13.559> right

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
on my UV sterilizer this thing right

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.099 
on my UV sterilizer this thing right
here<00:00:14.089> it's<00:00:15.109> 9<00:00:16.109> watts<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:17.369> has<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> built-in<00:00:18.690> pump

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
here it's 9 watts it has a built-in pump

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.060 
here it's 9 watts it has a built-in pump
and<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:21.449> water<00:00:21.480> comes<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.199> really<00:00:22.470> slowly<00:00:22.830> it

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and the water comes out really slowly it

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.750 
and the water comes out really slowly it
doesn't<00:00:23.340> flow<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> um<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:25.369> a<00:00:26.369> filter

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
doesn't flow out like a um like a filter

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.759 
doesn't flow out like a um like a filter
or<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> power<00:00:27.119> head<00:00:27.390> or<00:00:27.900> anything<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.650> does

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
or a power head or anything but it does

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.650 
or a power head or anything but it does
have<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> power<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:30.500> so<00:00:31.820> after<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.270> two

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
have a power in it so after I think two

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.370 
have a power in it so after I think two
weeks<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.559> think<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:36.420> not<00:00:36.750> running<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.260> at

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
weeks I think and not running it at

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.990 
weeks I think and not running it at
night<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.410> see<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> take<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.250> doing

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
night you can see that the take is doing

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.810 
night you can see that the take is doing
pretty<00:00:42.149> dang<00:00:42.480> well<00:00:42.710> it's<00:00:43.710> definitely<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.610> lot

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
pretty dang well it's definitely a lot

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.490 
pretty dang well it's definitely a lot
clearer<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.289> much<00:00:46.950> better<00:00:47.160> improvement

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
clearer and a much better improvement

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.049 
clearer and a much better improvement
from<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.680> last<00:00:49.920> time<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.789> looked<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
from the last time that we looked at it

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.580 
from the last time that we looked at it
you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.360> see<00:00:54.539> all<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> way<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.379> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
you can actually see all the way back to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.380 
you can actually see all the way back to
the<00:00:55.739> back<00:00:56.219> glass<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.000> no

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the back glass and it's just like no

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.889 
the back glass and it's just like no
more<00:01:00.600> hazing<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.840> just

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
more hazing and it's just it's just

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.750 
more hazing and it's just it's just
doing<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:05.750> overall<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.400> would<00:01:08.400> give

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
doing really well overall I would give

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.710 
doing really well overall I would give
it<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:10.820> maybe<00:01:12.920> I'd<00:01:13.920> give<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> probably<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:15.060> 9<00:01:15.509> out

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it a maybe I'd give it probably a 9 out

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.200 
it a maybe I'd give it probably a 9 out
of<00:01:15.750> 10<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.400> reason<00:01:17.670> why<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> would<00:01:17.970> give<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
of 10 and the reason why I would give it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.679 
of 10 and the reason why I would give it
a<00:01:18.270> 9<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:21.020> it's<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.110> little<00:01:22.229> bit<00:01:22.409> loud

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
a 9 is because it's a little bit loud

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.330 
a 9 is because it's a little bit loud
and<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.380> show<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> that

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and I don't know if I can show you that

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:36.590 
and I don't know if I can show you that
but<00:01:26.610> we'll<00:01:27.180> try

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.240 

so<00:01:37.140> I'm<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.350> sure<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.620> can<00:01:37.740> hear<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.100> or

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
so I'm not sure if you can hear that or

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.860 
so I'm not sure if you can hear that or
not<00:01:38.400> I'll<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.670> quiet<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.120> another<00:01:39.300> second<00:01:39.810> so

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
not I'll be quiet for another second so

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.710 
not I'll be quiet for another second so
you<00:01:40.050> can<00:01:40.200> try<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.830> distinguish<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:44.720> so

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
you can try to distinguish it so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.390 
you can try to distinguish it so
hopefully<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.080> hear<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:47.010> is<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
hopefully you can hear that this is the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.860 
hopefully you can hear that this is the
control<00:01:47.880> box<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:50.340> might<00:01:51.000> control<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:51.660> this

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
control box that might control like this

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.470 
control box that might control like this
light<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.410> LED<00:01:52.860> right<00:01:53.010> here<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:54.000> tells<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
light this LED right here it tells you

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.310 
light this LED right here it tells you
if<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.380> UV<00:01:55.979> bulb<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.360> good<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.140> should

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
if the UV bulb is so good and it should

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.600 
if the UV bulb is so good and it should
be<00:01:58.440> good<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:58.740> three<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.190> six<00:01:59.370> months

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
be good for three to six months

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.210 
be good for three to six months
depending<00:01:59.729> on<00:02:00.060> how<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.110> use<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.650> turn

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
depending on how much you use it I turn

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.250 
depending on how much you use it I turn
mine<00:02:02.430> off<00:02:02.460> every<00:02:03.060> night<00:02:03.270> because<00:02:03.870> it's<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
mine off every night because it's a

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.680 
mine off every night because it's a
little<00:02:04.470> loud<00:02:04.620> and<00:02:04.830> it's<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.160> my<00:02:05.490> my<00:02:06.090> tank<00:02:06.330> is

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
little loud and it's just my my tank is

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.180 
little loud and it's just my my tank is
right<00:02:07.410> next<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.830> bed

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
right next to my bed

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.590 
right next to my bed
so<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.270> usually<00:02:09.450> turn<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.990> off<00:02:11.330> quick<00:02:12.330> side

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
so I usually turn that off quick side

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.700 
so I usually turn that off quick side
shot<00:02:12.900> here

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.550 

so<00:02:20.180> yeah<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.390> give<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.720> 9<00:02:21.900> out<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.080> 10<00:02:22.320> for

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
so yeah so I give it a 9 out of 10 for

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.950 
so yeah so I give it a 9 out of 10 for
that<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.010> also<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.670> control<00:02:24.480> box<00:02:24.630> doesn't

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
that and also that control box doesn't

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.770 
that and also that control box doesn't
really<00:02:25.260> stick<00:02:25.710> on<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.040> side<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.520> glass

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
really stick on to the side of the glass

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.700 
really stick on to the side of the glass
very<00:02:27.780> well<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.460> don't<00:02:30.230> that's<00:02:31.230> another<00:02:31.500> reason

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
very well I don't that's another reason

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.140 
very well I don't that's another reason
why<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.490> deny<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.910> attempt<00:02:34.730> update<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:35.850> not

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
why I do deny that attempt update on not
