00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.050
 a tutorial a minecraft tutorial 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.450
 how to make an obsidian generator 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.800
 good and to not be the longest we go to 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.119
 explain how this and the internet 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.980
 found on youtube better said 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.600
 found several videos of generators and 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.490
 stubborn but I realized that 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.310
 general of option to ask you many 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:36.010
 resources a lot also something from 6 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:39.040
 the name there are dispensers and more things 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.800
 like cubes with the base is lame lava 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.660
 and this is great and I did not like it 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.340
 complete I preferred for example for me 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.260
 I prefer to make a hole in 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.270
 against going to get my own assistant 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.150
