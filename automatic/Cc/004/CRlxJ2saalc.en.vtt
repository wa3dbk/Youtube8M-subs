00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
another thing I could have built the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.280 
another thing I could have built the
supply<00:02:26.490> depot<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:27.000> or<00:02:27.240> at<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:27.840> place<00:02:28.110> the

supply depot here or at this place the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.690 
supply depot here or at this place the
reason<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.590> opted<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.920> build<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.490> is

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
reason I opted to build it here is

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.490 
reason I opted to build it here is
because<00:02:29.970> any<00:02:30.420> units<00:02:30.840> coming<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.320> ramp

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
because any units coming up this ramp

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.430 
because any units coming up this ramp
and<00:02:31.770> scouting<00:02:32.220> into<00:02:32.400> my<00:02:32.490> base<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:34.110> supply

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
and scouting into my base that supply

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.920 
and scouting into my base that supply
depot<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.040> going<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.460> act<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.330> hindrance<00:02:36.630> I

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
depot is going to act as a hindrance I

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.660 
depot is going to act as a hindrance I
mean<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.380> not<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.560> huge<00:02:37.620> deal<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.340> could<00:02:38.580> have

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
mean it's not a huge deal I could have

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.860 
mean it's not a huge deal I could have
built<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.880> here<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.420> wouldn't<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.720> made

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
built it here and it wouldn't have made

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.510 
built it here and it wouldn't have made
much<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.200> difference<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:41.130> it's<00:02:41.340> just

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
much of a difference but it's just

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.250 
much of a difference but it's just
making<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.970> way<00:02:42.210> for<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.540> enemy<00:02:42.840> units<00:02:43.110> that

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
making the way for the enemy units that

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.200 
making the way for the enemy units that
little<00:02:43.620> bit<00:02:43.770> longer<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.400> walk<00:02:44.610> around<00:02:44.820> what

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
little bit longer to walk around what

you should be able to hit back deaky and

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.300 
you should be able to hit back deaky and
build<00:05:12.449> your<00:05:12.780> orbital<00:05:13.229> command<00:05:16.099> now<00:05:17.099> you're

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310

because I just built out marine so threw
it<00:05:28.080> on<00:05:28.169> the<00:05:28.320> supply<00:05:28.590> depot<00:05:28.740> there<00:05:29.810> from<00:05:30.810> here

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
it on the supply depot there from here

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.040 
it on the supply depot there from here
on<00:05:31.169> it's<00:05:31.650> pretty<00:05:32.010> much<00:05:32.340> up<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.599> what<00:05:34.020> you

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
on it's pretty much up to you what you

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.010 
on it's pretty much up to you what you
do<00:05:35.120> there<00:05:36.120> are<00:05:36.240> lots<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.419> different<00:05:36.690> builds

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
do there are lots of different builds

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.760 
do there are lots of different builds
one<00:05:37.560> thing<00:05:37.740> here<00:05:37.979> is<00:05:39.199> as<00:05:40.199> soon<00:05:40.260> as<00:05:40.560> your

one thing here is as soon as your

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.320 
one thing here is as soon as your
orbital<00:05:41.159> builds<00:05:41.550> you<00:05:41.760> should<00:05:41.909> throw<00:05:42.090> it<00:05:42.210> on

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
orbital builds you should throw it on

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.520 
orbital builds you should throw it on
your<00:05:42.479> mule<00:05:42.690> you<00:05:42.900> can<00:05:43.020> see<00:05:43.110> I'm<00:05:43.199> a<00:05:43.260> little<00:05:43.440> bit

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
your mule you can see I'm a little bit

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.529 
your mule you can see I'm a little bit
slow<00:05:43.710> here<00:05:44.190> actually<00:05:44.520> we're<00:05:44.789> faster<00:05:45.180> as<00:05:45.330> soon

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
slow here actually we're faster as soon

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.659 
slow here actually we're faster as soon
as<00:05:45.690> that's<00:05:45.780> done<00:05:45.900> you<00:05:46.650> want<00:05:46.830> to<00:05:46.889> build<00:05:47.099> in<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.340> CV

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
as that's done you want to build in a CV

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.060 
as that's done you want to build in a CV
throw<00:05:48.449> down<00:05:48.659> that<00:05:48.690> mule<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:49.740> get<00:05:49.979> things

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
throw down that mule and get things

basic opener guys so I'm gonna write
down<00:05:55.650> in<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.009> comments<00:05:56.310> below<00:05:56.340> you<00:05:56.639> know<00:05:56.880> the

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
down in the comments below you know the

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.210 
down in the comments below you know the
general<00:05:57.960> steps<00:05:58.169> of<00:05:58.440> how<00:05:58.590> you<00:05:58.650> go<00:05:58.830> through<00:05:58.860> it

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
general steps of how you go through it

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.860 
general steps of how you go through it
so<00:05:59.430> I<00:05:59.639> know<00:05:59.789> I've<00:06:00.030> gone<00:06:00.180> over<00:06:00.240> a<00:06:00.479> lot<00:06:00.509> in<00:06:00.780> a

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
so I know I've gone over a lot in a

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.240 
so I know I've gone over a lot in a
really<00:06:01.020> short<00:06:01.229> amount<00:06:01.349> of<00:06:01.560> time<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:01.860> it<00:06:02.130> might

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
really short amount of time and it might

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.990 
really short amount of time and it might
be<00:06:02.280> a<00:06:02.370> lot<00:06:02.490> to<00:06:02.550> take<00:06:02.759> in

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
be a lot to take in

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.990 
be a lot to take in
but<00:06:03.690> I'll<00:06:03.930> put<00:06:04.110> down<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:04.560> supply<00:06:04.949> at<00:06:05.250> work<00:06:05.550> you

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
but I'll put down the supply at work you

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.749 
but I'll put down the supply at work you
build<00:06:06.270> things<00:06:06.509> as<00:06:07.229> you<00:06:08.009> can<00:06:08.039> see<00:06:08.310> I'm<00:06:08.520> up<00:06:08.639> to

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
build things as you can see I'm up to

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.969 
build things as you can see I'm up to
the<00:06:08.849> throw<00:06:09.090> down<00:06:09.270> a<00:06:09.449> factory<00:06:09.840> you<00:06:10.560> can<00:06:10.710> do<00:06:10.830> that

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
the throw down a factory you can do that

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.100 
the throw down a factory you can do that
if<00:06:11.070> you<00:06:11.099> like<00:06:11.310> you'll<00:06:11.940> probably<00:06:12.570> find<00:06:12.900> that

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
if you like you'll probably find that

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.310 
if you like you'll probably find that
you've<00:06:13.320> I<00:06:13.590> must<00:06:14.159> around<00:06:14.580> 100<00:06:15.090> gas<00:06:15.330> and<00:06:15.750> you'll

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
you've I must around 100 gas and you'll

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.499 
you've I must around 100 gas and you'll
have<00:06:16.530> 150<00:06:17.250> spare<00:06:17.490> minerals<00:06:17.880> maybe<00:06:18.120> even<00:06:18.330> 200

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
have 150 spare minerals maybe even 200

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.050 
have 150 spare minerals maybe even 200
when<00:06:19.440> you<00:06:19.560> finish<00:06:19.889> your<00:06:20.099> orbital<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:20.759> you've

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
when you finish your orbital and you've

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.089 
when you finish your orbital and you've
got<00:06:21.240> the<00:06:21.330> second<00:06:21.659> supply<00:06:21.930> depot<00:06:22.229> going<00:06:22.500> so<00:06:23.039> you

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
got the second supply depot going so you

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.969 
got the second supply depot going so you
cannot<00:06:23.550> throw<00:06:23.909> down<00:06:24.090> a<00:06:24.389> refinery<00:06:24.960> you<00:06:25.560> can<00:06:25.770> go

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
cannot throw down a refinery you can go

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.770 
cannot throw down a refinery you can go
for<00:06:26.340> a<00:06:26.520> second<00:06:26.880> barracks<00:06:27.180> you<00:06:27.419> can<00:06:27.539> go<00:06:27.630> for

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
for a second barracks you can go for

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.159 
for a second barracks you can go for
three<00:06:28.020> barracks<00:06:28.349> you<00:06:29.190> can<00:06:29.460> save<00:06:30.449> up<00:06:30.630> even<00:06:30.960> more

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
three barracks you can save up even more

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.379 
three barracks you can save up even more
minerals<00:06:31.620> and<00:06:32.310> you<00:06:32.580> can<00:06:32.729> go<00:06:32.909> for<00:06:33.120> command

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:33.389 
minerals and you can go for command

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.240 
minerals and you can go for command
center<00:06:33.779> and<00:06:33.990> in<00:06:34.440> fact<00:06:34.590> you<00:06:34.710> see<00:06:34.740> here<00:06:35.070> he's

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
center and in fact you see here he's

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.410 
center and in fact you see here he's
thrown<00:06:35.490> down

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
thrown down

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.180 
thrown down
a<00:06:36.450> difference<00:06:36.870> in<00:06:37.020> block<00:06:37.290> actually<00:06:37.860> out<00:06:38.010> his

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
a difference in block actually out his

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.590 
a difference in block actually out his
natural<00:06:38.760> and<00:06:38.970> he's<00:06:39.120> got<00:06:39.300> four<00:06:39.510> hundred

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
natural and he's got four hundred

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.480 
natural and he's got four hundred
minerals<00:06:40.050> so<00:06:40.260> it<00:06:40.410> might<00:06:40.650> well<00:06:40.830> be<00:06:40.890> that<00:06:41.250> he's

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
minerals so it might well be that he's

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.960 
minerals so it might well be that he's
gonna<00:06:41.640> go<00:06:41.910> for<00:06:42.420> a<00:06:42.720> fast<00:06:43.500> expand<00:06:43.950> at<00:06:44.580> this<00:06:44.730> point

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
gonna go for a fast expand at this point

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.580 
gonna go for a fast expand at this point
I<00:06:45.120> thought<00:06:45.300> he<00:06:45.450> was<00:06:45.570> pulley<00:06:45.810> trying<00:06:46.110> to<00:06:46.380> rush

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
I thought he was pulley trying to rush

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.950 
I thought he was pulley trying to rush
me<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:47.040> he<00:06:47.400> was<00:06:47.520> going<00:06:47.730> a<00:06:47.790> to<00:06:47.940> rocks<00:06:48.180> play<00:06:48.420> and
