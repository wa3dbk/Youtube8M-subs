it<00:05:41.280> sticks<00:05:41.520> out<00:05:41.730> halfway<00:05:42.090> then<00:05:43.080> you<00:05:43.230> gotta

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
it sticks out halfway then you gotta

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.800 
it sticks out halfway then you gotta
apply<00:05:43.650> some<00:05:43.980> real<00:05:44.280> manpower<00:05:45.030> and<00:05:45.360> pull<00:05:45.660> the
