the mo u 7x7 okay this is a little bit

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.990 
the mo u 7x7 okay this is a little bit
harder<00:00:06.660> than<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.319> V<00:00:07.529> Cube<00:00:07.950> or<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.429> shank<00:00:08.730> now

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
harder than the V Cube or the shank now

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.560 
harder than the V Cube or the shank now
so<00:00:09.450> um<00:00:09.830> let's<00:00:10.830> get<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:12.360> want<00:00:12.509> to

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
pull these out and it might be a little

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.340 
pull these out and it might be a little
bit<00:00:14.639> tight<00:00:14.910> for<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.630> if<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.900> need<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.080> you

bit tight for you so if you need to you

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.840 
bit tight for you so if you need to you
can<00:00:16.470> adjust<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.949> tensions<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
can adjust the tensions here on the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.210 
can adjust the tensions here on the
senate-house<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.690> off<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.230> that's<00:00:19.980> true

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
senate-house to get off and that's true

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.500 
senate-house to get off and that's true
in<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.850> another<00:00:21.090> way<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> get<00:00:21.420> it

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
in that what is another way to get it

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.870 
in that what is another way to get it
apart<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.189> want<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.640> don't<00:00:23.699> wanna

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
apart or if you want if you don't wanna

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.519 
apart or if you want if you don't wanna
uh<00:00:24.000> through<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.539> take<00:00:24.960> apart<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.320> one

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529

uh through it just take apart this one
so<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.890> take<00:00:26.220> those<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:26.580> then<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.599> start

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
so you take those out then you start

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.960 
so you take those out then you start
taking<00:00:28.109> them<00:00:28.439> out<00:00:28.980> all<00:00:29.279> these<00:00:29.460> other<00:00:29.519> pieces

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
taking them out all these other pieces

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.569 
taking them out all these other pieces
here

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
here

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:39.530

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.940 
get these out you basically want to get
apart<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> whole<00:00:40.020> whole<00:00:40.320> corner<00:00:40.710> section

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
apart the whole whole corner section

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.170 
apart the whole whole corner section
first<00:00:47.149> okay<00:00:48.149> got<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> corner<00:00:48.989> out

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
first okay got the corner out

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.340 
first okay got the corner out
okay<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.390> pretty<00:00:51.750> much<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:51.899> turn

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
pieces you know get to set down then the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
pieces you know get to set down then the
whole<00:00:54.989> thing<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.829> turn<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
whole thing you can just turn it in the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:06.730 
whole thing you can just turn it in the
whole<00:00:56.820> thing<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.030> come<00:00:57.210> apart

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.830 

okay<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.640> done<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.630> gotta

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
okay now we got that done now we gotta

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.780 
okay now we got that done now we gotta
read<00:01:10.020> some<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:10.890> right<00:01:11.100> core<00:01:11.400> looks<00:01:11.580> like

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
read some what all right core looks like

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.230 
read some what all right core looks like
this<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.950> stage<00:01:14.160> you<00:01:14.370> can<00:01:14.400> lubricate<00:01:14.880> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
this and this stage you can lubricate it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330 
this and this stage you can lubricate it
if<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.630> want<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.230> know<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.860> that's<00:01:17.040> not

you don't have to do that okay I want

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.610 
you don't have to do that okay I want
you<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> sort<00:01:23.130> out<00:01:23.280> these<00:01:23.570> largest<00:01:24.570> edges<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
you to sort out these largest edges and

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.590 
you to sort out these largest edges and
these<00:01:26.070> corners<00:01:26.640> okay<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.360> should<00:01:27.510> have

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
these corners okay so you should have

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.930 
these corners okay so you should have
twelve<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.110> these<00:01:28.230> and<00:01:28.590> eight<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.130> these<00:01:29.310> okay

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
twelve of these and eight of these okay

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.270 
twelve of these and eight of these okay
so<00:01:30.660> you<00:01:30.750> want<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> go<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.070> um

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so you want to go in here and just um

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.070 
so you want to go in here and just um
store<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.760> all<00:01:32.910> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.120> mouth<00:01:33.300> because<00:01:33.540> on

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
store it all in the mouth because on

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.410 
store it all in the mouth because on
these<00:01:34.680> will<00:01:34.950> need<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.160> be<00:01:35.280> solved<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.180> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
these will need to be solved when you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.780 
these will need to be solved when you
reassemble<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.260> otherwise<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.460> there's<00:01:38.730> a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
reassemble it otherwise on there's a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.690 
reassemble it otherwise on there's a
chance<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.270> could<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.720> parody<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.620> okay

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
chance you could get parody on it okay

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.310 
chance you could get parody on it okay
and<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.210> chance<00:01:42.480> that<00:01:42.750> everything<00:01:43.050> will<00:01:43.290> be

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
and the chance that everything will be

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.500 
and the chance that everything will be
solved<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.580> you'll<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.970> able<00:01:45.120> to<00:01:45.180> solve<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
solved that you'll be able to solve the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.530 
solved that you'll be able to solve the
whole<00:01:45.660> thing<00:01:45.930> um<00:01:46.230> is<00:01:46.710> unlikely<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:48.270> put

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
whole thing um is unlikely so just put

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.330 
whole thing um is unlikely so just put
it<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:48.750> back<00:01:48.960> together<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.920> these<00:01:50.040> solved

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it all back together with these solved

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.480 
it all back together with these solved
everything<00:01:50.850> else<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.390> be<00:01:51.720> random<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.710> as

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
everything else can be random but as

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.790 
everything else can be random but as
long<00:01:53.760> as<00:01:53.940> these<00:01:54.060> things<00:01:54.390> yourself<00:01:54.690> you<00:01:55.620> will

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
long as these things yourself you will

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.850 
long as these things yourself you will
be<00:01:55.980> able<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.280> solve<00:01:56.550> it<00:01:56.760> um<00:01:57.000> later<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.170> let

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
be able to solve it um later on so let

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.010 
be able to solve it um later on so let
me<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.100> sort<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.150> rest<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> these<00:02:00.570> out<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
me go sort the rest of these out and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.250 
me go sort the rest of these out and

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
so take one of these edges here any

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.850 
so take one of these edges here any
color<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.760> this<00:02:08.910> step<00:02:09.240> here<00:02:09.649> okay<00:02:10.649> we're

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
color for this step here okay we're

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.160 
color for this step here okay we're
gonna<00:02:10.950> need<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.370> then<00:02:11.580> get<00:02:12.000> two<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.480> these<00:02:12.810> type

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
gonna need it then get two of these type

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.910 
gonna need it then get two of these type
of<00:02:13.200> pieces<00:02:13.530> here<00:02:14.280> we've<00:02:14.550> got<00:02:14.700> another<00:02:14.850> one<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
of pieces here we've got another one and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.530 
of pieces here we've got another one and
two<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.070> these<00:02:17.280> um<00:02:17.640> pieces<00:02:18.090> here<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.450> they

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
two of these um pieces here and they

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.350 
two of these um pieces here and they
both<00:02:18.720> fit<00:02:19.080> together<00:02:19.640> okay<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.940> want<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.209> put

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
both fit together okay so we want to put

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.070 
both fit together okay so we want to put
one<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.510> them<00:02:21.660> together<00:02:21.810> here<00:02:23.750> all<00:02:24.750> right<00:02:24.840> like

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
one of them together here all right like

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.100 
one of them together here all right like
this<00:02:25.290> then<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.980> want<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.250> stick<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:27.110> may

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
this then you want to stick this in may

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.660 
this then you want to stick this in may
be<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.260> little<00:02:28.410> bit<00:02:28.530> hard<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.920> do<00:02:29.130> without<00:02:29.340> these

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
be a little bit hard to do without these

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.460 
be a little bit hard to do without these
slipping<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:33.060> another<00:02:33.959> thing<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.170> can<00:02:34.350> also

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
slipping so another thing you can also

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.280 
slipping so another thing you can also
do<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:34.980> also<00:02:35.220> use<00:02:35.550> tape<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.480> hold<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
do is you can also use tape to hold the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.840 
do is you can also use tape to hold the
pieces<00:02:37.410> together<00:02:37.890> while<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.430> get<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.670> rest

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
pieces together while you get the rest

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.060 
pieces together while you get the rest
of<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.060> assembled<00:02:40.459> but<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.910> um<00:02:43.070> optional

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
of it assembled but that is um optional

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.770 
of it assembled but that is um optional
if<00:02:44.580> you're<00:02:44.790> really<00:02:45.030> having<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.300> hard<00:02:45.420> time<00:02:45.540> you

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
if you're really having a hard time you

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.110 
if you're really having a hard time you
know<00:02:46.050> it's<00:02:46.890> optional<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.489> we<00:02:47.640> put<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.000> other

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
know it's optional so we put the other

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.850 
know it's optional so we put the other
one<00:02:48.330> here<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.840> we're<00:02:48.930> going<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.170> slip<00:02:49.440> down<00:02:49.500> in

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
one here and we're going to slip down in

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.979 
one here and we're going to slip down in
there<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> little<00:02:52.560> bit<00:02:52.650> harder<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.040> do

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
there this is a little bit harder to do

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.840 
there this is a little bit harder to do
and<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.080> want<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.380> take<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.739> larger<00:02:56.610> piece

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and I want to take this larger piece

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.479 
and I want to take this larger piece
loop<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.780> then<00:02:58.500> slip<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.100> smaller

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
loop it in then slip in this smaller

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.820 
loop it in then slip in this smaller
piece<00:02:59.760> that<00:03:00.000> should<00:03:00.269> go<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.870> there<00:03:01.050> go<00:03:01.560> clean

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
piece that should go in there go clean

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.520 
piece that should go in there go clean
it<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.340> too<00:03:02.580> much<00:03:02.730> trouble<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:04.110> pull<00:03:04.380> these

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
it up too much trouble and pull these

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.900 
it up too much trouble and pull these
down<00:03:04.590> make<00:03:05.040> sure<00:03:05.070> there's<00:03:05.340> enough<00:03:05.580> room<00:03:05.700> for

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
down make sure there's enough room for

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.670 
down make sure there's enough room for
this<00:03:06.180> thing<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.450> get<00:03:06.570> in<00:03:09.890> okay<00:03:10.890> come<00:03:11.130> on

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.399 

all<00:03:14.680> right<00:03:14.830> there<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.129> go<00:03:16.079> okay<00:03:17.079> now<00:03:17.110> you're

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
all right there we go okay now you're

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:18.750 
all right there we go okay now you're
gonna<00:03:17.530> want<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.739> find<00:03:17.920> an<00:03:18.069> edge<00:03:18.220> that's<00:03:18.519> right

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
gonna want to find an edge that's right

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.130 
gonna want to find an edge that's right
adjacent<00:03:18.879> to<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.569> again<00:03:19.629> you<00:03:19.780> gotta<00:03:19.989> make

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
adjacent to it and again you gotta make

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.619 
adjacent to it and again you gotta make
sure<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.319> solved<00:03:20.829> right<00:03:21.010> here<00:03:21.540> okay<00:03:22.540> and

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
sure it's solved right here okay and

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.179 
sure it's solved right here okay and
you're<00:03:22.720> going<00:03:22.870> do<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.290> exact<00:03:23.739> same<00:03:24.129> thing

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
you're going do this exact same thing

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.509 
you're going do this exact same thing
right<00:03:24.579> here<00:03:25.120> okay<00:03:25.810> all<00:03:26.680> right<00:03:26.829> just<00:03:26.860> like<00:03:27.220> this

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
right here okay all right just like this

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.910 
right here okay all right just like this
okay<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.000> um<00:03:28.780> that's<00:03:29.290> pretty<00:03:29.590> much<00:03:29.739> the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
okay so um that's pretty much the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.850 
okay so um that's pretty much the
hardest<00:03:30.250> part<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.640> I'm<00:03:30.760> assembling<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:31.860> okay

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
hardest part of I'm assembling this okay

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.559 
hardest part of I'm assembling this okay
now<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.069> gotta<00:03:33.310> take<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.730> corner<00:03:34.030> section<00:03:34.269> so

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
now I gotta take the corner section so

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.990 
now I gotta take the corner section so
we<00:03:34.690> take<00:03:34.900> this<00:03:35.140> piece<00:03:35.590> here<00:03:36.010> which<00:03:36.549> goes<00:03:36.760> right

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
we take this piece here which goes right

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.759 
we take this piece here which goes right
in<00:03:37.180> there

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
in there

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.800 
in there
then<00:03:38.769> we<00:03:38.890> take<00:03:39.129> on<00:03:39.310> this<00:03:39.459> piece<00:03:39.819> here<00:03:40.329> then

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
then we take on this piece here then

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.740 
then we take on this piece here then
there<00:03:41.049> should<00:03:41.260> also<00:03:41.470> be<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.739> mirror-image

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
there should also be a mirror-image

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.920 
there should also be a mirror-image
version<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.340> right<00:03:45.340> here<00:03:45.670> we<00:03:46.359> put<00:03:46.569> that<00:03:46.720> in

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
version of it right here we put that in

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.690 
version of it right here we put that in
then<00:03:47.379> you<00:03:47.470> take<00:03:47.650> one<00:03:47.859> of<00:03:47.950> these<00:03:48.040> pieces<00:03:48.400> here

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
then you take one of these pieces here

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.339 
then you take one of these pieces here
and<00:03:48.849> you<00:03:49.000> put<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.450> in<00:03:49.840> there<00:03:50.079> okay<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:53.200> then

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
and you put that in there okay and then

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.379 
and you put that in there okay and then
you<00:03:53.440> put<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.889> two<00:03:54.099> sets<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.489> edges<00:03:54.909> so<00:03:55.180> we

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
you put the two sets of edges so we

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.229 
you put the two sets of edges so we
first<00:03:55.629> have<00:03:55.930> them<00:03:56.200> this<00:03:56.650> small<00:03:56.950> edge<00:03:57.340> then<00:03:58.150> we

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
first have them this small edge then we

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.949 
first have them this small edge then we
got<00:03:58.359> this<00:03:58.569> on<00:03:58.780> larger<00:03:59.349> one<00:03:59.560> like<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.959> okay

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
got this on larger one like that okay

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.199 
got this on larger one like that okay
now<00:04:01.989> you<00:04:02.230> gotta<00:04:02.470> take<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.859> corner<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:03.430> goes

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
now you gotta take the corner that goes

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.160 
now you gotta take the corner that goes
in<00:04:04.510> there<00:04:05.790> there<00:04:06.790> we<00:04:06.879> go<00:04:07.030> again<00:04:07.720> make<00:04:08.139> sure

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
in there there we go again make sure

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.610 
in there there we go again make sure
it's<00:04:08.379> solved<00:04:09.569> okay<00:04:10.569> now<00:04:10.870> we<00:04:10.930> take<00:04:11.230> them<00:04:11.409> one<00:04:11.590> of

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
it's solved okay now we take them one of

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.229 
it's solved okay now we take them one of
these<00:04:11.829> pieces<00:04:12.159> again<00:04:12.579> make<00:04:12.790> sure<00:04:13.000> it's<00:04:13.150> the

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
these pieces again make sure it's the

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.569 
these pieces again make sure it's the
right<00:04:13.359> one<00:04:13.599> goes<00:04:13.900> in<00:04:14.290> there<00:04:14.500> take<00:04:15.040> this<00:04:15.250> piece

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
right one goes in there take this piece

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.319 
right one goes in there take this piece
here<00:04:15.879> goes<00:04:16.750> right<00:04:16.930> there<00:04:17.169> take<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.940> piece

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
here goes right there take this piece

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.270 
here goes right there take this piece
here<00:04:19.949> which<00:04:20.949> goes<00:04:21.190> right<00:04:21.400> there<00:04:23.070> all<00:04:24.070> right

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
here which goes right there all right

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.800 
here which goes right there all right
you<00:04:24.430> gotta<00:04:24.610> find<00:04:24.849> the<00:04:24.940> other<00:04:25.060> mirror<00:04:25.360> image

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
you gotta find the other mirror image

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.400 
you gotta find the other mirror image
image<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.530> one<00:04:26.740> there<00:04:27.070> it<00:04:27.220> is<00:04:28.380> okay<00:04:29.380> so

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
image of that one there it is okay so

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.140 
image of that one there it is okay so
now<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:29.830> basically<00:04:30.039> just<00:04:30.520> do<00:04:30.729> that<00:04:30.910> whole

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
now you basically just do that whole

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:39.120 
now you basically just do that whole
thing<00:04:31.389> on<00:04:31.599> on<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.050> other<00:04:32.169> side<00:04:32.470> okay

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.930 

this

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.670 

okay<00:04:45.780> now<00:04:45.990> you're<00:04:46.110> gonna<00:04:46.230> want<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.440> put<00:04:46.500> the

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
okay now you're gonna want to put the

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.230 
okay now you're gonna want to put the
edge<00:04:46.860> in<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:47.430> we're<00:04:47.580> gonna<00:04:47.700> start<00:04:47.970> with<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
edge in so we're gonna start with the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.320 
edge in so we're gonna start with the
larger<00:04:48.630> one<00:04:49.880> it's<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.970> smaller<00:04:51.300> one<00:04:51.600> put<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.560> in

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
larger one it's a smaller one put it in

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.550 
larger one it's a smaller one put it in
okay<00:04:54.330> now<00:04:54.570> we<00:04:54.630> want<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.960> take<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.200> edge<00:04:55.320> that

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
okay now we want to take the edge that

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.100 
okay now we want to take the edge that
goes<00:04:55.710> in<00:04:56.550> between<00:04:56.670> that<00:04:57.120> there<00:04:57.720> it<00:04:57.810> is

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
goes in between that there it is

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.460 
goes in between that there it is
so<00:04:58.560> make<00:04:58.770> sure<00:04:58.800> it's<00:04:59.010> solved<00:04:59.550> put<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.270> in<00:05:00.470> now

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
so make sure it's solved put it in now

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.610 
so make sure it's solved put it in now
we're<00:05:01.620> gonna<00:05:01.710> take<00:05:01.950> these<00:05:03.020> other<00:05:04.020> dizon

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
we're gonna take these other dizon

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.730 
we're gonna take these other dizon
pieces<00:05:05.010> we<00:05:05.130> had<00:05:05.250> earlier<00:05:05.610> take<00:05:06.450> them<00:05:06.690> both<00:05:07.440> set

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
pieces we had earlier take them both set

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.790 
pieces we had earlier take them both set
both<00:05:07.920> of<00:05:08.100> them<00:05:10.460> we<00:05:11.460> go<00:05:12.440> okay<00:05:13.440> we're<00:05:13.560> gonna<00:05:13.650> want

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
sure the rest of it doesn't come apart

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.290 
sure the rest of it doesn't come apart
at<00:05:18.450> the<00:05:18.540> same<00:05:18.720> time<00:05:19.670> okay<00:05:20.670> now<00:05:20.820> we<00:05:20.880> got<00:05:21.060> a<00:05:21.090> dis

on the other side so now we got to be

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.830 
on the other side so now we got to be
very<00:05:33.090> careful<00:05:33.680> put<00:05:34.680> them<00:05:34.770> in<00:05:35.090> like<00:05:36.090> that<00:05:36.300> okay

okay so now that we got one corner

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.620 
okay so now that we got one corner
sections<00:05:42.240> solved<00:05:42.810> or<00:05:43.020> no<00:05:43.220> assembled<00:05:44.630> now

want to take the corner put it in make
sure<00:06:06.480> it's<00:06:06.780> soft<00:06:07.220> take<00:06:08.220> on<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.640> set<00:06:08.850> of<00:06:08.940> edges

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
sure it's soft take on the set of edges

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.740 
sure it's soft take on the set of edges
here<00:06:11.030> we're<00:06:12.030> gonna<00:06:12.180> want<00:06:12.330> to<00:06:12.360> put<00:06:12.600> them<00:06:12.690> right

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
here we're gonna want to put them right

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.190 
here we're gonna want to put them right
underneath<00:06:13.350> it<00:06:13.740> to<00:06:13.890> hold<00:06:14.100> it<00:06:14.280> up<00:06:14.990> sure<00:06:15.990> it<00:06:16.050> goes

um build this um corner section pretty

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.159 
um build this um corner section pretty
much<00:06:24.180> on<00:06:24.570> the<00:06:24.840> same<00:06:25.169> way<00:06:26.150> we<00:06:27.150> did<00:06:27.330> on<00:06:27.540> all<00:06:28.020> the

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
much on the same way we did on all the

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.310 
much on the same way we did on all the
other<00:06:28.380> ones<00:06:29.390> so<00:06:30.390> we're<00:06:30.600> gonna<00:06:30.690> build<00:06:30.990> it<00:06:31.140> on

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
other ones so we're gonna build it on

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:38.030 
other ones so we're gonna build it on
like<00:06:31.680> this<00:06:32.090> but<00:06:33.090> these<00:06:33.300> dredges<00:06:33.780> in

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:53.250 

okay<00:06:39.040> so<00:06:39.100> then<00:06:39.730> we'll<00:06:40.000> build<00:06:40.300> it<00:06:40.510> up<00:06:40.570> here<00:06:52.260> okay

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
okay so then we'll build it up here okay

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.400 
okay so then we'll build it up here okay
so<00:06:53.590> now<00:06:54.100> for<00:06:55.030> this<00:06:55.120> last<00:06:55.360> part<00:06:55.690> here<00:06:55.810> we're

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
so now for this last part here we're

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.340 
so now for this last part here we're
gonna<00:06:56.560> put<00:06:57.190> these<00:06:57.580> pieces<00:06:57.970> in<00:06:58.240> first<00:06:58.660> and<00:06:59.200> then

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
gonna put these pieces in first and then

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.460 
gonna put these pieces in first and then
we'll<00:06:59.560> put<00:06:59.710> the<00:06:59.830> edges<00:07:00.160> in<00:07:00.280> last<00:07:00.810> so<00:07:01.810> then

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
we'll put the edges in last so then

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.810 
we'll put the edges in last so then
you're<00:07:02.650> gonna<00:07:02.740> want<00:07:02.950> to<00:07:02.980> take<00:07:03.130> this<00:07:03.310> piece<00:07:03.550> me

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
you should put this one in before you

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.370 
you should put this one in before you
put<00:07:05.680> the<00:07:05.920> other<00:07:06.070> edge<00:07:06.310> in<00:07:07.020> just<00:07:08.020> makes<00:07:08.200> it<00:07:08.320> a

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
put the other edge in just makes it a

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.330 
put the other edge in just makes it a
little<00:07:08.500> easier<00:07:08.920> so<00:07:09.160> we<00:07:09.760> got<00:07:09.910> this<00:07:10.150> other<00:07:10.450> piece

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
little easier so we got this other piece

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.610 
little easier so we got this other piece
stick<00:07:12.340> down<00:07:12.570> okay<00:07:13.570> now<00:07:13.720> take<00:07:13.810> the<00:07:14.170> last<00:07:14.380> two

stick down okay now take the last two
corners<00:07:15.100> or<00:07:15.610> no<00:07:15.730> edges<00:07:16.150> put<00:07:17.050> them<00:07:17.170> together

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
corners or no edges put them together

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.550 
corners or no edges put them together
there<00:07:18.550> push<00:07:19.390> them<00:07:19.600> in<00:07:19.720> kind<00:07:20.020> of<00:07:20.080> like<00:07:20.230> that<00:07:20.410> you
