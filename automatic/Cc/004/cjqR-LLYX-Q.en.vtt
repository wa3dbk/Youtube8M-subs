you can see it's right there so those

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.429 
you can see it's right there so those
are<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> two<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.020> take<00:00:19.230> off

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
are the two that you have to take off

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.950 
are the two that you have to take off
but<00:00:20.340> after<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.609> take<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.090> off<00:00:21.300> works<00:00:21.630> even

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
but after you take that off works even

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.029 
but after you take that off works even
before<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:23.340> take<00:00:23.519> off<00:00:23.699> as<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:25.039> these

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
before that you can take off as a these

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.960 
before that you can take off as a these
down<00:00:26.340> here<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.410> end<00:00:28.619> out<00:00:28.710> here

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
down here this one and this end out here

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.189 
down here this one and this end out here
so<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.090> kind<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.269> hard<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.660> me<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> hold<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
so it's kind of hard for me to hold it

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.569 
so it's kind of hard for me to hold it
and<00:00:31.320> take<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.470> off<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> same<00:00:31.980> time<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.460> I'll
