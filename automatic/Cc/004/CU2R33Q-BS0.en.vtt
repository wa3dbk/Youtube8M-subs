00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
13-inch MacBook Air however they also

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.180 
13-inch MacBook Air however they also
make<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> black<00:00:15.360> version<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.680> it's

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
make a black version of this and it's

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.160 
make a black version of this and it's
also<00:00:17.369> available<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.119> 11<00:00:18.510> inch<00:00:18.660> model<00:00:19.050> of

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
also available for the 11 inch model of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.170 
also available for the 11 inch model of
the<00:00:19.289> air<00:00:19.470> as<00:00:19.650> well<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.550> will<00:00:20.789> work<00:00:20.970> with

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the air as well this will work with

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.380 
the air as well this will work with
essentially<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:22.039> MacBook<00:00:23.039> Airs<00:00:23.279> some<00:00:23.580> 2010

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
essentially all MacBook Airs some 2010

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.019 
essentially all MacBook Airs some 2010
on<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.500> think<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> 2012

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
on and I think I have like a 2012

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.939 
on and I think I have like a 2012
version<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.080> already<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> installed

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
version so I already have it installed

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.859 
version so I already have it installed
on<00:00:29.369> my<00:00:29.490> air<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.880> essentially<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> comes<00:00:30.630> in

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
on my air and essentially it comes in

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.440 
on my air and essentially it comes in
two<00:00:31.019> sections<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.740> top<00:00:32.369> piece<00:00:32.640> which<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
two sections a top piece which is just a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.979 
two sections a top piece which is just a
single<00:00:33.780> kind<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.380> clear<00:00:35.300> overlay<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.600> then

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
single kind of clear overlay and then

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.709 
single kind of clear overlay and then
the<00:00:37.530> bottom<00:00:37.950> piece<00:00:38.219> which<00:00:39.000> has<00:00:39.210> all<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the bottom piece which has all the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.510 
the bottom piece which has all the
cutouts<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> reason<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.280> works

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
cutouts on it now the reason this works

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.389 
cutouts on it now the reason this works
with<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.020> airs<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> has<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.070> extra

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
with all the airs is it has the extra

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.819 
with all the airs is it has the extra
cutouts<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> side<00:00:45.690> therefore<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.500> new

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
cutouts on the side therefore the new

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.340 
cutouts on the side therefore the new
microphone<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> Haswell<00:00:48.930> MacBook

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
microphone that's on the Haswell MacBook

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
microphone that's on the Haswell MacBook
Air<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.559> dual<00:00:49.890> mic<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> also

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
Air the dual mic but you can see it also

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.900 
Air the dual mic but you can see it also
has<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> cutout<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.920> air<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.670> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
has a cutout for the air that I have so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.779 
has a cutout for the air that I have so
let<00:00:54.059> me<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.360> box<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> way<00:00:55.789> in

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
let me get this box out of the way in

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.240 
let me get this box out of the way in
addition<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.510> getting<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.020> we'll<00:00:58.920> call<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
addition to getting the we'll call it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
addition to getting the we'll call it
the<00:00:59.489> skin<00:01:00.030> or<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.210> air<00:01:00.390> jacket<00:01:00.780> itself<00:01:01.050> they

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the skin or the air jacket itself they

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
the skin or the air jacket itself they
give<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.590> four<00:01:01.859> lis<00:01:02.039> these<00:01:02.250> rubber<00:01:02.579> feet<00:01:02.969> that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
give you four lis these rubber feet that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.240 
give you four lis these rubber feet that
if<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.439> stick<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> bottom

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
if you want you can stick to the bottom

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.070 
if you want you can stick to the bottom
of<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.900> air<00:01:07.290> jacket<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.640> case<00:01:09.510> itself<00:01:09.840> has

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
of the air jacket so the case itself has

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.870 
of the air jacket so the case itself has
these<00:01:10.290> four<00:01:10.619> discs<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.100> line<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
these four discs that line up with the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
these four discs that line up with the
four<00:01:12.030> rubber<00:01:12.210> feet<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> MacBook<00:01:13.080> Air<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
four rubber feet on the MacBook Air and

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.899 
four rubber feet on the MacBook Air and
then<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.100> want<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.580> take<00:01:14.729> these

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
then if you want you can take these

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.760 
then if you want you can take these
extra<00:01:15.240> rubber<00:01:15.720> things<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.200> place<00:01:16.439> them<00:01:16.619> on

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
extra rubber things and place them on

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.800 
extra rubber things and place them on
top<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.240> bit<00:01:18.360> slick

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
top because this is a little bit slick

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.179 
top because this is a little bit slick
so<00:01:19.049> depending<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.740> place<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.159> down

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so depending on what you place it down

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.330 
so depending on what you place it down
on<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.600> might<00:01:21.810> move<00:01:21.990> around<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
on you know it might move around and you

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.100 
on you know it might move around and you
might<00:01:23.490> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.030> said<00:01:24.090> create<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
might want to like I said create a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.300 
might want to like I said create a
little<00:01:25.200> bit<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.470> friction<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.950> these<00:01:26.130> rubber

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
little bit of friction with these rubber

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.550 
little bit of friction with these rubber
pieces<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.939> stop<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.360> from<00:01:27.479> happening<00:01:27.560> now

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
pieces to stop that from happening now

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.350 
pieces to stop that from happening now
what<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> love<00:01:29.189> about<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.790> I've<00:01:29.939> tested<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
what I love about this is I've tested a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.350 
what I love about this is I've tested a
bunch<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.770> style<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> case<00:01:32.700> for<00:01:33.000> my<00:01:33.150> air

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bunch of this style of case for my air

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.179 
bunch of this style of case for my air
and<00:01:33.630> many<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> ones<00:01:34.590> I've<00:01:34.770> tried<00:01:35.040> have

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and many of the ones I've tried have

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
and many of the ones I've tried have
been<00:01:35.310> very<00:01:35.520> bulky<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.180> haven't<00:01:36.509> liked<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
been very bulky and I haven't liked the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.469 
been very bulky and I haven't liked the
feel<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.890> only<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.460> super<00:01:38.820> thin<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.270> adds

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
feel not only is this super thin it adds

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
feel not only is this super thin it adds
like<00:01:39.720> no<00:01:40.049> bulk<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.619> that's<00:01:40.979> hard<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> show<00:01:41.520> on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670

feels like glass texture to it which
just<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.409> feels<00:01:55.890> great<00:01:56.280> when<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.729> on
