 today I will teach you to counteract the 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.690
 king of yurima like that is a change that 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.040
 It is not easy to use and it is required 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.349
 Know your mechanics and tricks for 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.269
 use it well have the advantage of 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.339
 have a great little online and if it's okay 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.140
 used can define games and about 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.939
 all in the teen fight since if it reaches 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.800
 use your ultimate well and divide the 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.199
 enemy team will offer much advantage to 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.119
 all your equipment is true that it is fragile and 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.309
 that your are weak but if you get to 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.720
 meeting with him will begin to come down more and 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.270
 more life and every time it will become more 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.730
 strong so you should start let's go over 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.440
 his skills quickly his passive him 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.420
 allows you to create a turret where another has 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.770
 been destroyed further while 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.350
 more cooling reduction have 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.390
 will increase your attack speed the q 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.090
 Send a soldier to a point causing 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.040
 damage and slowdown the w generates 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.500
 soldiers and can do it up to 5 times 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.090
 and he throws this way towards his soldiers winning 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.770
 a shield if it collides with some 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.680
 champion causing magical damage and 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.540
 pushing it daher creates a wall that 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.860
 push the enemy champions and not 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.170
 can be crossed by some 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.390
 skills this ability can define 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.650
 latin fight if you know how to use it in 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.180
 illusion I leave the link so you know 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.610
 what are the skills with which 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.770
 you can go through that last one already 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.510
 that you know the basics, let's go to the guide in 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.460
 phase lines and to make it easier 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.290
 I recommend you to use champions that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.060
 will make life impossible to say 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.640
 essentials are six because of its great 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.710
 blocking that has set with deadly support 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.960
 that he can kill quickly by taking out 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.580
 schultis and fish that can live and 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.930
 evade the skills say too 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.260
 You can choose among others that I leave you 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.940
 here 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.980
 of all the champions I do not recommend 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.720
 chop Joshua because his wall of 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.730
 wind will be useless against shift and if 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.320
 try to approach you could push or if 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.570
 you try to train your soldiers you play 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.820
 life for that and that's not a good 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.280
 peak against him now I'll show you how 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.930
 play him at level 1 so he will be forced to 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.630
 Climb up twice as much as your main skill 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.190
 then level 2 insurance will raise your CV 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.140
 and will have no way to escape from some 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.360
 attack so an early gang would be 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.130
 perfect at that time after 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.110
 level 3 so it transforms you escape or 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.820
 make your cup but it goes up has a long 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.130
 cooling so when I use it 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.310
 you must attack them something that is going to 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.380
 serve and Gerona if she knows it is her combo and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.360
 this is invoking a soldier pulling 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.700
 behind you used to fall and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.380
 study from there may vary according to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.970
 that he wants to do he will be able to launch his cv 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.920
 to lose life if you're one against 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.440
 one or if it's a blue ink and laser ti 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.480
 to separate your team in summary if 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.160
 of gea if that is positioned and enters 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.840
 to start a tim fain it tries not to 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.790
 approach him because he can flash and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.440
 use your last at that moment push to 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.630
 your team away from you and you 'll be 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.520
 dead or maybe if you move it follow the 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.320
 to be able to use your last push and that 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.680
 do not approach him remember that each 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.200
 time 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.969
 with that shield you will go down life so 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.069
 you are not foolishly beating yourself against 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.590
 that cecilia was requested and reached the law 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.000
 which will be very strong and difficult to stop 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.219
 especially if he comes to invoke his five 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.689
 soldiers and the human one is one this 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:57.000
 will already be dead in just seconds 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.799
 that's why if you're going to focus on 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.629
 do it intelligently and just see 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.879
 to this the distracted or that his 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.469
 skills are in a cooling 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.569
 has all the cessation that I can asylum and not 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.489
 you will use and another great advantage for your 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.980
 team since to say is the one that defines the 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.290
 team fights and to give a total summary 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.060
 If you were not careful, do not be near 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.950
 those soldiers if they put a tower there 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.349
 You must until you have little life 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.120
 zhouqu slows down if you see the 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.530
 opportunity will come in when I can so 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.720
 like you never and well with your team to 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.609
 eliminate it and finally kill so much 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.959
 people as you can have it right so it will go 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.939
