I'm<00:04:50.830> just<00:04:51.010> want<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.190> keep<00:04:51.340> on<00:04:51.550> using<00:04:51.760> it<00:04:52.000> you're

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
I'm just want to keep on using it you're

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.620 
I'm just want to keep on using it you're
supposed<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.930> use<00:04:53.110> it<00:04:53.410> once<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.190> week<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:55.360> first

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
supposed to use it once a week the first

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.200 
supposed to use it once a week the first
few<00:04:55.840> months<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:56.920> in<00:04:57.190> one<00:04:57.370> month's<00:04:57.670> you<00:04:57.910> use<00:04:58.030> it

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
few months so in one month's you use it

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.060 
few months so in one month's you use it
four<00:04:58.420> times<00:04:58.690> and<00:04:59.110> after<00:04:59.440> that<00:04:59.560> I<00:04:59.620> think<00:04:59.920> it

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
four times and after that I think it

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.460 
four times and after that I think it
just<00:05:00.220> goes<00:05:00.580> on<00:05:00.760> and<00:05:01.180> then<00:05:01.990> it<00:05:02.080> just<00:05:02.200> increases

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
just goes on and then it just increases

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.560 
just goes on and then it just increases
after<00:05:02.890> that<00:05:03.250> you'll<00:05:03.610> probably<00:05:03.910> do<00:05:04.090> like<00:05:04.270> twice

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
after that you'll probably do like twice

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.410 
after that you'll probably do like twice
a<00:05:04.600> month<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.380> then<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.710> just<00:05:05.950> once<00:05:06.790> a<00:05:07.060> month

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420 
a month and then to just once a month

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.830 
a month and then to just once a month
and<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:08.230> forth<00:05:08.500> what<00:05:09.430> I<00:05:09.460> used<00:05:09.940> after<00:05:10.540> my

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840
