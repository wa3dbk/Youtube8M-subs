opened us opens up your pores so when
you<00:01:01.289> put<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> mask<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.129> top<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.760> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you put the mask on top of it it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.640 
you put the mask on top of it it
actually<00:01:03.239> absorbs<00:01:03.570> better<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.290> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
actually absorbs better and the it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.920 
actually absorbs better and the it
becomes<00:01:05.010> more<00:01:05.159> effective<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.210> always<00:01:06.720> try

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
becomes more effective so I always try

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.750 
becomes more effective so I always try
to<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.320> before<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.650> apply<00:01:07.890> any<00:01:08.130> mask<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
to do that before I apply any mask and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.130 
to do that before I apply any mask and
make<00:01:09.150> sure<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.540> cleanse<00:01:09.900> exfoliate
