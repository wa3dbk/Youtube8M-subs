here's the opposite side you can see

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.540 
here's the opposite side you can see
that<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.360> flush<00:00:48.260> well<00:00:49.260> forgive<00:00:50.010> me<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.370> not

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that it's flush well forgive me it's not

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.860 
that it's flush well forgive me it's not
flush<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.840> vinyl<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.980> sticking<00:00:53.340> out<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.690> end

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
flush the vinyl is sticking out the end

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
flush the vinyl is sticking out the end
is<00:00:55.020> actually<00:00:55.170> retracted<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.100> small<00:00:56.399> amount<00:00:56.640> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
is actually retracted a small amount and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.900 
is actually retracted a small amount and
I'll<00:00:56.850> show<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> why<00:00:57.300> that's<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.719> case

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
I'll show you why that's the case

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
trim that and a little bit so the pemko

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.710 
trim that and a little bit so the pemko
sa<00:01:06.420> material<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.310> trimmed<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.570> 2

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
sa material it can be trimmed up to 2

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.880 
sa material it can be trimmed up to 2
inch<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> field<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.600> fill<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.680> two

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
inch in the field it can fill up two

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
inch in the field it can fill up two
gaps<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.369> 1/2<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.790> an<00:01:14.880> inch<00:01:16.490> does<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.670> contour

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
gaps of 1/2 of an inch does not contour

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.320 
gaps of 1/2 of an inch does not contour
against<00:01:18.930> an<00:01:19.080> uneven<00:01:20.040> floor<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.700> well<00:01:20.970> so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
against an uneven floor very well so

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.609 
against an uneven floor very well so
you'd<00:01:21.509> want<00:01:21.630> your<00:01:21.780> floor<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.229> basically

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you'd want your floor to be basically

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.910 
you'd want your floor to be basically
leveled<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> half<00:01:24.450> inch<00:01:24.689> projection<00:01:25.290> then

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
leveled as a half inch projection then

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
leveled as a half inch projection then
the<00:01:26.100> overall<00:01:26.430> height<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> housing<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the overall height of the housing is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.980 
the overall height of the housing is
inch<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.380> three<00:01:28.619> eighths<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.659> we<00:01:30.659> said<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
inch and three eighths so we said it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.870 
inch and three eighths so we said it
will<00:01:31.170> fill<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> half<00:01:31.560> inch<00:01:31.799> gap<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.640> means

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
will fill a half inch gap that means

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.510 
will fill a half inch gap that means
that<00:01:33.180> when<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.390> depress<00:01:33.979> this<00:01:34.979> part<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that when you depress this part with the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.240 
that when you depress this part with the
plastic<00:01:36.000> plug<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
plastic plug in it

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.609 
plastic plug in it
and<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.369> push<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.810> whole<00:01:39.990> bottom<00:01:40.350> drops

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and you push it the whole bottom drops

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.560 
and you push it the whole bottom drops
down<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
down like that

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.010 
down like that
if<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:45.410> have<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.740> trim<00:01:46.010> this<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:47.570> again<00:01:47.810> up<00:01:47.990> to

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
if you have to trim this and again up to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.260 
if you have to trim this and again up to
only<00:01:48.260> two<00:01:48.560> inch<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:49.040> trim<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.460> opposite<00:01:50.060> end

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
only two inch you trim the opposite end

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.650 
only two inch you trim the opposite end
you<00:01:50.600> trim<00:01:50.870> from<00:01:51.080> this<00:01:51.290> side<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.970> have<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.390> trim

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
you trim from this side you have to trim

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.560 
you trim from this side you have to trim
it<00:01:53.810> when<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.190> bottom<00:01:55.550> is<00:01:55.640> extended<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.420> what

that it's flush or the aluminum is flush

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.630 
that it's flush or the aluminum is flush
and<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:14.000> would<00:02:14.150> trim<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.540> at<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:14.840> point

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
and you would trim it at that point

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.760 
and you would trim it at that point
you'll<00:02:16.640> take<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.540> distance<00:02:17.959> when<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.590> door

the way closed and this still wants to

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.350 
the way closed and this still wants to
travel<00:03:42.830> down<00:03:43.160> further<00:03:43.459> because<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.940> housing

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
travel down further because the housing

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.590 
travel down further because the housing
needs<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.750> get<00:03:45.070> pushed<00:03:46.070> back<00:03:46.310> in<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:47.180> the

into the housing further so you'll want

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.849 
into the housing further so you'll want
