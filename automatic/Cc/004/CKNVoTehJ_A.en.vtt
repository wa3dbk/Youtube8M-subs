basic layout ah grass is invading oh
dang<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.880> totally<00:03:42.660> forgot<00:03:42.870> about<00:03:42.930> that

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.990 

um<00:03:47.409> all<00:03:48.189> right<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.620> books<00:03:50.920> everywhere<00:03:51.670> this

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
um all right so books everywhere this

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.140 
um all right so books everywhere this
will<00:03:52.150> be<00:03:52.329> two<00:03:53.290> or<00:03:53.650> three<00:03:54.129> levels<00:03:54.579> high<00:03:54.819> and

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
will be two or three levels high and

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.459 
will be two or three levels high and
then<00:03:55.359> there's<00:03:55.599> balcony<00:03:56.079> all<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.319> way<00:03:56.379> around

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:56.469 
then there's balcony all the way around

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.030 
then there's balcony all the way around
and<00:03:56.890> then<00:03:57.000> ladders<00:03:58.379> going<00:03:59.379> up<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.709> second

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
and then ladders going up to the second

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.610 
and then ladders going up to the second
level<00:04:00.069> i'm<00:04:01.000> not<00:04:01.209> sure<00:04:01.510> i<00:04:02.109> think<00:04:03.099> i<00:04:03.430> may<00:04:03.700> have

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
level i'm not sure i think i may have

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.229 
level i'm not sure i think i may have
bookcase<00:04:05.620> over<00:04:05.859> here<00:04:06.370> in<00:04:06.549> here<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:06.939> then<00:04:07.030> wood

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
bookcase over here in here and then wood

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.819 
bookcase over here in here and then wood
in<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.480> middle<00:04:07.780> so<00:04:07.989> then<00:04:08.140> it's<00:04:08.290> more

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
in the middle so then it's more

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.390 
in the middle so then it's more
bookshelf<00:04:09.430> like<00:04:09.939> rather<00:04:10.239> than<00:04:10.420> just<00:04:10.629> a

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
bookshelf like rather than just a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.590 
bookshelf like rather than just a
straight<00:04:12.400> one<00:04:13.120> by<00:04:13.599> however<00:04:14.260> long<00:04:14.439> it<00:04:14.590> is<00:04:15.600> I'd

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
straight one by however long it is I'd

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.740 
straight one by however long it is I'd
probably<00:04:16.840> look<00:04:17.049> better<00:04:17.109> but<00:04:17.709> we'll<00:04:18.519> see<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.419> I

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
probably look better but we'll see and I

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.999 
probably look better but we'll see and I
don't<00:04:19.989> know<00:04:20.109> if<00:04:20.229> I<00:04:20.320> want<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.560> make<00:04:20.739> him<00:04:20.859> go<00:04:20.889> up

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
don't know if I want to make him go up

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.820 
don't know if I want to make him go up
higher<00:04:21.400> or<00:04:21.759> just<00:04:22.060> leave<00:04:22.270> them<00:04:22.449> this<00:04:23.380> height<00:04:23.620> or

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
higher or just leave them this height or

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.240 
higher or just leave them this height or
add<00:04:24.400> more<00:04:24.970> yeah<00:04:25.599> lots<00:04:26.050> of<00:04:26.199> variables<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:27.099> need

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
add more yeah lots of variables I need

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.580 
add more yeah lots of variables I need
to<00:04:27.340> figure<00:04:27.520> out<00:04:27.669> I'll<00:04:28.419> be<00:04:28.630> having<00:04:28.750> chairs<00:04:29.229> and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
to figure out I'll be having chairs and

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.159 
to figure out I'll be having chairs and
like<00:04:30.090> it's<00:04:31.090> kind<00:04:31.270> of<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.360> Reading<00:04:31.720> area<00:04:31.840> like

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
like it's kind of a Reading area like

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.020 
like it's kind of a Reading area like
couches<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.710> chairs<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.190> lamps<00:04:33.789> and<00:04:33.940> stuff

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
couches and chairs and lamps and stuff

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.830 
couches and chairs and lamps and stuff
around<00:04:34.360> here<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:37.120> second<00:04:37.449> level<00:04:37.539> in

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
around here and the second level in

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.140 
around here and the second level in
third<00:04:38.050> level<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:38.740> then<00:04:39.039> I<00:04:39.310> think<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:39.820> may<00:04:40.120> have

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
third level and then I think I may have

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.270 
third level and then I think I may have
a<00:04:40.599> skylight<00:04:41.050> above<00:04:41.410> because<00:04:41.830> this<00:04:41.979> is<00:04:42.099> really

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
a skylight above because this is really

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.300 
a skylight above because this is really
hard<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.690> light<00:04:43.690> up<00:04:43.870> at<00:04:44.020> night<00:04:44.050> as<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.919> can<00:04:45.070> see

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
hard to light up at night as you can see

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.570 
hard to light up at night as you can see
it's<00:04:45.460> pretty<00:04:45.820> dark<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.449> need<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:47.280> figure<00:04:48.280> out

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
it's pretty dark I need to figure out

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.710 
it's pretty dark I need to figure out
what<00:04:49.570> kind<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.840> lighting<00:04:50.380> I'd<00:04:50.500> like<00:04:50.740> in<00:04:50.919> here
