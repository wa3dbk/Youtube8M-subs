00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.090 
so I actually get two completely
different<00:01:42.899> colors<00:01:43.380> out<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.040> I'll

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
different colors out of this and I'll

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
different colors out of this and I'll
show<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.119> those<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.450> two<00:01:45.630> colors<00:01:45.869> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
show you so those are two colors to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.920 
show you so those are two colors to
swatch<00:01:46.530> from<00:01:46.799> two<00:01:47.009> different<00:01:47.159> sides<00:01:47.689> of<00:01:48.689> this

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
swatch from two different sides of this

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.289 
swatch from two different sides of this
eyeshadow<00:01:49.409> which<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.130> because<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:51.060> gives

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
eyeshadow which I like because it gives

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.020 
eyeshadow which I like because it gives
you<00:01:51.479> two<00:01:51.689> choices<00:01:51.720> instead<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.820> from<00:01:53.820> one

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you two choices instead of one from one

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
you two choices instead of one from one
product<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.930> there's<00:01:55.110> those<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.680> top<00:01:55.920> two

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
product so there's those the top two

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
product so there's those the top two
from<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.570> last<00:01:57.780> eyeshadow

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
from that and then this last eyeshadow

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.870 
from that and then this last eyeshadow
is<00:01:58.439> probably<00:01:58.829> my<00:01:59.009> favorite<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> it's

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
is probably my favorite and it's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.109 
is probably my favorite and it's
winterized<00:02:00.920> which<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.130> beautiful<00:02:02.549> dark

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
winterized which is a beautiful dark

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.630 
winterized which is a beautiful dark
shade<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.960> there's<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.530> color<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.920> really

shade so there's that one on the top and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.920 
shade so there's that one on the top and
you<00:02:11.640> might<00:02:11.790> notice<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.180> these<00:02:12.510> are<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.660> little

shir<00:02:14.380> which<00:02:14.860> i<00:02:14.980> think<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.280> very

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
shir which i think is very

i didn't really expect them to be super
solid<00:02:20.260> opaque<00:02:20.710> colors<00:02:21.610> but<00:02:21.910> if<00:02:22.000> you're

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
solid opaque colors but if you're

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.670

something super opaque like a creamy
matte<00:02:26.470> these<00:02:27.430> are<00:02:27.580> definitely<00:02:28.060> going<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.270> be
