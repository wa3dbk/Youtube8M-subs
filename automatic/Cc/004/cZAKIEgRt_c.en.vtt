00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
card speakers NFC on the back there's

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.050 
card speakers NFC on the back there's
also<00:03:15.120> warranty<00:03:15.690> thing<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:17.579> there's<00:03:17.730> also<00:03:17.880> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
also warranty thing and there's also the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:35.360 
also warranty thing and there's also the
UK<00:03:18.630> charger<00:03:23.120> if<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.420> open<00:03:24.570> this<00:03:34.220> open<00:03:35.220> up

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
UK charger if I can open this open up

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.270 
UK charger if I can open this open up
and<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:36.930> quite<00:03:36.989> bulky<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.709> sticks<00:03:38.130> out

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
and so it's quite bulky it sticks out

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.729 
and so it's quite bulky it sticks out
what<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.519> lot<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:39.209> comparison<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.049> alternatives

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
what a lot in comparison to alternatives

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.670 
what a lot in comparison to alternatives
so<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.390> I<00:03:42.390> would<00:03:42.870> remember<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.350> iphone

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
so I I would remember the iphone

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.740 
so I I would remember the iphone
alternatives<00:03:44.310> I'm<00:03:44.790> upgrading<00:03:44.940> from<00:03:45.570> an

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
alternatives I'm upgrading from an

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.060 
alternatives I'm upgrading from an
iphone<00:03:45.870> 3gs<00:03:46.910> um<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.230> iphone<00:03:49.350> charger<00:03:49.920> is

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
iphone 3gs um and the iphone charger is

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.009 
iphone 3gs um and the iphone charger is
probably<00:03:50.430> about<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.730> big<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.750> doesn't

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
probably about that big so it doesn't

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.360 
probably about that big so it doesn't
stick<00:03:52.079> out<00:03:52.290> very<00:03:52.500> much<00:03:52.590> them<00:03:52.769> all<00:03:52.920> however

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
stick out very much them all however

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.069 
stick out very much them all however
this<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.670> going<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:53.940> stick<00:03:54.150> out<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.480> fair<00:03:54.870> bit

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
this is going to stick out a fair bit

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.349 
this is going to stick out a fair bit
with<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.620> USB<00:03:55.890> thing<00:03:56.190> but<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:57.120> probably

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
with that USB thing but it probably

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.780 
with that USB thing but it probably
charges<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.079> a<00:03:58.109> lot<00:03:58.260> better<00:03:58.470> kind<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.040> power

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
charges to a lot better kind of power

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.830 
charges to a lot better kind of power
hence<00:04:00.359> it's<00:04:00.630> big<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.260> bulky<00:04:01.549> and<00:04:02.840> step

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
hence it's big and bulky and step

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.550 
hence it's big and bulky and step
outside<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.410> there's<00:04:05.190> also<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:06.260> USB<00:04:07.260> charging

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
outside and there's also a USB charging

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.440 
outside and there's also a USB charging
cable<00:04:07.680> which<00:04:08.160> i<00:04:08.310> believe<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.579> micro<00:04:09.209> USB<00:04:10.489> am

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
cable which i believe is micro USB am

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.869 
cable which i believe is micro USB am
anyway<00:04:13.450> um<00:04:13.599> that's<00:04:14.200> all<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:14.439> accessories<00:04:14.879> and

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
anyway um that's all the accessories and

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.349 
anyway um that's all the accessories and
the<00:04:15.939> box<00:04:15.969> I<00:04:16.359> think<00:04:16.570> nothing<00:04:17.320> out<00:04:17.530> there<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:19.209> now

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
the box I think nothing out there so now

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.650 
the box I think nothing out there so now
on<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:19.989> Nexus<00:04:20.410> 5<00:04:20.620> yeah<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.970> instantly

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
on to the Nexus 5 yeah it instantly

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.830 
on to the Nexus 5 yeah it instantly
feels<00:04:23.020> ridiculously<00:04:24.009> light<00:04:24.449> so<00:04:25.449> compared<00:04:26.050> to

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
feels ridiculously light so compared to

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.570 
feels ridiculously light so compared to
the<00:04:28.840> iphone<00:04:28.960> 3gs<00:04:29.590> which<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:29.979> tiny<00:04:30.310> in

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
the iphone 3gs which is tiny in

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.439 
the iphone 3gs which is tiny in
comparison<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:33.490> can<00:04:33.669> you<00:04:33.880> really<00:04:34.120> can

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
comparison and you can you really can

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.310 
comparison and you can you really can
tell<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.810> huge<00:04:35.229> difference<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:37.229> think<00:04:38.229> the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
tell a huge difference I think the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.810 
tell a huge difference I think the
weights<00:04:38.500> might<00:04:38.740> be<00:04:38.889> saying<00:04:39.100> but<00:04:39.400> might<00:04:39.699> be

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
weights might be saying but might be

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.249 
weights might be saying but might be
very<00:04:39.940> similar<00:04:40.210> it's<00:04:40.479> just<00:04:40.690> because<00:04:40.930> this<00:04:41.080> is

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
very similar it's just because this is

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.210 
very similar it's just because this is
such<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.530> big<00:04:41.860> phone<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:44.470> really<00:04:44.680> does<00:04:44.919> feel

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
such a big phone and it really does feel

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.480 
such a big phone and it really does feel
very<00:04:45.280> very<00:04:45.910> light<00:04:46.229> so<00:04:47.229> it's<00:04:47.770> got<00:04:48.190> quite<00:04:48.460> a

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
very very light so it's got quite a

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.920 
very very light so it's got quite a
glossy<00:04:48.789> screen<00:04:49.210> but<00:04:49.389> that's<00:04:49.539> obviously<00:04:49.660> this

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
glossy screen but that's obviously this

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.189 
glossy screen but that's obviously this
plastic<00:04:50.320> thing<00:04:50.349> so<00:04:51.270> i'll<00:04:52.270> just<00:04:52.330> try<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:52.930> quiet

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
plastic thing so i'll just try and quiet

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.900 
plastic thing so i'll just try and quiet
down<00:04:53.530> whilst<00:04:53.860> i<00:04:54.070> remove<00:04:54.400> this<00:04:54.960> satisfying

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
down whilst i remove this satisfying

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.990 
down whilst i remove this satisfying
noise<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:59.009> it<00:05:00.009> really<00:05:00.250> does<00:05:00.520> look<00:05:00.550> quite

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
noise and it really does look quite

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.600 
noise and it really does look quite
impressive<00:05:01.570> this<00:05:01.960> is<00:05:02.139> one<00:05:02.590> of<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.800> first<00:05:03.009> very

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
impressive this is one of the first very

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.120 
impressive this is one of the first very
high-end<00:05:04.120> phones<00:05:04.599> I've<00:05:04.930> ever<00:05:05.110> bought<00:05:05.770> for

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
high-end phones I've ever bought for

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.499 
high-end phones I've ever bought for

myself I inherited the 3gs my dad and so

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.589 
myself I inherited the 3gs my dad and so

I've never really kind of had a like

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.680 
I've never really kind of had a like
phone<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.139> myself<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:15.160> also<00:05:15.400> on<00:05:15.820> this<00:05:16.360> back

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
phone to myself and also on this back

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.420 
phone to myself and also on this back
camera<00:05:19.199> there's<00:05:20.199> also<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.470> little<00:05:20.919> kind<00:05:21.099> of<00:05:21.190> tab

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430

for that as well it's all mixed up and I

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.939 

I'm<00:05:39.360> just<00:05:39.479> trying<00:05:39.659> to<00:05:39.899> remove<00:05:40.110> this<00:05:40.379> yes<00:05:40.739> it

does come off you go panicked for a
moment<00:05:44.520> then<00:05:44.759> thinking<00:05:45.179> I<00:05:45.239> just<00:05:45.479> ruined<00:05:45.869> the

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020

the sim tray with the like removal whole

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.790 
the sim tray with the like removal whole
the<00:06:25.529> top<00:06:25.769> of<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:25.979> phone<00:06:26.189> there<00:06:27.059> is<00:06:27.559> this<00:06:28.559> small

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
the top of the phone there is this small

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.919 
the top of the phone there is this small
hole<00:06:29.009> which<00:06:29.189> I<00:06:29.309> believe<00:06:29.519> is<00:06:29.579> a<00:06:30.119> one<00:06:30.689> of<00:06:30.839> the

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:30.929 
hole which I believe is a one of the

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:33.439 
hole which I believe is a one of the
ambient<00:06:31.439> microphones<00:06:31.949> I<00:06:32.129> think<00:06:32.339> so<00:06:33.269> it'll

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
ambient microphones I think so it'll

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.290 
ambient microphones I think so it'll
it'll<00:06:33.749> detect<00:06:34.110> noise<00:06:34.979> around<00:06:35.279> you<00:06:35.639> and<00:06:35.819> then

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
it'll detect noise around you and then

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.799 
it'll detect noise around you and then
use<00:06:37.110> that<00:06:37.139> to<00:06:37.349> cancel<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:38.219> kind<00:06:38.399> of<00:06:38.429> sound

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:38.809 
use that to cancel the kind of sound

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:40.729 
use that to cancel the kind of sound
it's<00:06:39.809> also<00:06:39.929> got<00:06:40.110> three<00:06:40.379> and<00:06:40.499> a<00:06:40.529> half<00:06:40.559> a

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:40.739 
it's also got three and a half a

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:44.359

00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:44.369 
millimeter headphone jack on this side

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:48.739

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:48.749 
you've got the volume rocker on the

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:51.019
