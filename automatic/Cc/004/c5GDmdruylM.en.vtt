of<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.680> now<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> reason<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.130> didn't<00:01:08.520> go<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
of it now the reason I didn't go for it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.820 
of it now the reason I didn't go for it
before<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:09.990> everyone<00:01:10.409> says<00:01:10.440> it<00:01:10.799> gives

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
before because everyone says it gives

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.219 
before because everyone says it gives
really<00:01:11.190> good<00:01:11.280> coverage<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.690> didn't<00:01:13.020> think

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
really good coverage and I didn't think

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.740 
really good coverage and I didn't think
that<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.560> needed<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.190> much<00:01:14.670> coverage<00:01:15.090> but

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that I needed that much coverage but

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.120 
that I needed that much coverage but
recently<00:01:16.110> I've<00:01:16.260> been<00:01:16.440> noticing<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
recently I've been noticing and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.130 
recently I've been noticing and
photographs<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.880> stuff<00:01:18.120> that<00:01:18.390> looks<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
photographs and stuff that looks that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.080 
photographs and stuff that looks that
looks<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.190> need<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.460> bit<00:01:20.700> more<00:01:20.729> coverage

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
looks like I need a bit more coverage

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.080 
looks like I need a bit more coverage
than<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:23.940> see

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
than I think I do so you can see

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.789 
than I think I do so you can see
discoloration<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.930> everything<00:01:25.409> arrived<00:01:25.650> my

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799

eyes and in the corners of my nose and
I'm<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.890> going<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.070> take<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.250> little<00:03:25.400> bit<00:03:25.640> more

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
I'm just going to take a little bit more

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:38.230 
I'm just going to take a little bit more
for<00:03:27.880> my<00:03:28.880> forehead

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.670 

and<00:03:39.240> just<00:03:39.480> remember<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.900> apply<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.410> in

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and just remember to apply it in

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.660 
and just remember to apply it in
downward<00:03:41.520> strokes<00:03:42.560> as<00:03:43.560> much<00:03:44.280> as<00:03:44.490> possible

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
downward strokes as much as possible

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.790 
downward strokes as much as possible
because<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.390> hairs<00:03:45.570> on<00:03:45.750> your<00:03:45.780> face<00:03:46.110> tend<00:03:46.680> to

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
because the hairs on your face tend to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.080 
because the hairs on your face tend to
grow<00:03:46.950> down<00:03:47.250> dime<00:03:48.000> words<00:03:48.240> so<00:03:48.930> if<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.170> play<00:03:49.380> it

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
grow down dime words so if you play it

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.010 
grow down dime words so if you play it
upwards<00:03:51.090> it's<00:03:51.420> gonna<00:03:51.830> not<00:03:52.830> look<00:03:52.980> natural<00:03:54.020> you

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
upwards it's gonna not look natural you

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.200 
upwards it's gonna not look natural you
can<00:03:55.140> see<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.350> have<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.830> thing<00:03:56.550> going<00:03:56.580> on<00:03:56.970> my
