00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
worn it in the summertime so it is a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.420 
worn it in the summertime so it is a
racerback<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:55.829> tank<00:01:56.070> dress

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
racerback just like little tank dress

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.260 
racerback just like little tank dress
and<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.119> decided<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.930> pair<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:59.270> little

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and I decided to pair it with a little

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.789 
and I decided to pair it with a little
gray<00:02:00.479> sweater<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> reason<00:02:01.500> why<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> did

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
gray sweater so the reason why I did

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.469 
gray sweater so the reason why I did
grow<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.130> because<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> underneath<00:02:02.939> layer<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
grow is because the underneath layer of

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.240 
grow is because the underneath layer of
this<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> silk<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.130> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
this the silk and it's kind of in that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.880 
this the silk and it's kind of in that
gray<00:02:05.460> color<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.869> white<00:02:07.079> lace<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
gray color and the white lace is just a

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.770 
gray color and the white lace is just a
lace<00:02:08.069> overlay<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.300> pieces<00:02:09.629> like
