hey<00:00:44.789> guys<00:00:45.000> great<00:00:45.329> near<00:00:45.570> reports<00:00:45.989> right<00:00:46.170> now

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
hey guys great near reports right now

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.729 
hey guys great near reports right now
what<00:00:47.430> does<00:00:47.760> why<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> spectrum

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
what does why do I not see a spectrum

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.069 
what does why do I not see a spectrum
right<00:00:49.950> now<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.399> each<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.640> these<00:00:53.899> right<00:00:54.899> now

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
right now for each of these right now

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
right now for each of these right now
the<00:00:55.140> colors<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:55.980> blended<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.180> what

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the colors are blended right so what

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.680 
the colors are blended right so what
would<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.230> spectrum<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.690> would

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
would I see with the spectrum I would

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.250 
would I see with the spectrum I would
see<00:01:00.870> different<00:01:01.230> colors<00:01:01.559> right<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:03.260> what

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
see different colors right and what

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.560 
see different colors right and what
would<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> colors<00:01:04.799> represent<00:01:08.570> somebody

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
would the colors represent somebody

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.969 
would the colors represent somebody
explained<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.470> somebody<00:01:10.799> raised<00:01:10.950> their

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
explained like somebody raised their

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.500 
explained like somebody raised their
hand<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.580> see<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.790> good<00:01:11.939> enough

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
hand here I can see you good enough

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390 
hand here I can see you good enough
what<00:01:12.900> would<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> colors<00:01:13.530> represent<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
what would the colors represent in a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.039 
what would the colors represent in a
spectrum<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.880> would<00:01:21.060> represent<00:01:21.210> he<00:01:21.780> said

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
spectrum so it would represent he said

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.740 
spectrum so it would represent he said
the<00:01:22.290> energy<00:01:22.740> going<00:01:23.040> down<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.909> electrons<00:01:24.420> jump

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the energy going down as electrons jump

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.359 
the energy going down as electrons jump
down<00:01:24.960> energy<00:01:25.350> levels<00:01:25.650> why<00:01:25.920> would<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.250> be

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
down energy levels why would they be

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.819 
down energy levels why would they be
jumping<00:01:26.759> down<00:01:30.020> cuz<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.170> increased<00:01:31.680> their

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
jumping down cuz I just increased their

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.100 
jumping down cuz I just increased their
energy<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.340> right<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:39.960> be

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
energy right here right so this would be

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.069 
energy right here right so this would be
a<00:01:40.140> lot<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.829> fire<00:01:41.009> blog<00:01:41.310> right<00:01:42.079> where

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
a lot like the fire blog right where

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.179 
a lot like the fire blog right where
they<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.320> apparently<00:01:43.649> there's<00:01:44.070> some

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
they have apparently there's some

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.100 
they have apparently there's some
colorful<00:01:44.640> fire<00:01:44.850> alarm<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.630> guys<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
colorful fire alarm you guys see the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.690 
colorful fire alarm you guys see the
violet<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.040> pretty<00:01:47.220> good<00:01:47.460> right

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
violet and that one pretty good right

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.280 
violet and that one pretty good right
now<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.880> one's<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.270> some<00:01:51.299> violet<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> can

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
now this one's got some violet in it can

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.340 
now this one's got some violet in it can
you<00:01:52.320> guys<00:01:52.500> tell<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:52.950> yeah<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:54.960> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you guys tell there yeah I think that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.429 
you guys tell there yeah I think that
one<00:01:55.530> actually<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> pure<00:01:56.250> methanol<00:01:57.409> yeah<00:01:58.409> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
one actually is a pure methanol yeah I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.840 
one actually is a pure methanol yeah I
think<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.070> didn't<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> salt<00:01:59.729> in

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
think that one I didn't have a salt in

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.920 
think that one I didn't have a salt in
that<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.210> axe<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.990> looks<00:02:01.200> really<00:02:01.350> neat

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.140 

because<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:05.710> just<00:02:05.920> squirt<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.580> think<00:02:06.760> I<00:02:06.820> started

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
because I just squirt I think I started

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.180 
because I just squirt I think I started
there<00:02:07.330> it's<00:02:07.480> weird<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.750> lot<00:02:07.870> in<00:02:08.050> there<00:02:08.259> blue

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
there it's weird a lot in there blue

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.120 
there it's weird a lot in there blue
flame<00:02:09.430> that's<00:02:09.640> cool<00:02:09.820> so<00:02:10.810> anyway<00:02:11.410> guys<00:02:11.590> this<00:02:11.920> is

just a kind of a review a lot of you

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.200 
just a kind of a review a lot of you
didn't<00:02:14.380> explain<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:15.400> when<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.790> put<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
didn't explain that when I put the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.970 
didn't explain that when I put the
cobalt<00:02:16.690> lens<00:02:16.990> up<00:02:17.260> what<00:02:17.500> does<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.800> cobalt<00:02:18.250> do

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
cobalt lens up what does the cobalt do

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.640 
cobalt lens up what does the cobalt do
what<00:02:22.110> what<00:02:23.110> light<00:02:23.350> does<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.680> filter<00:02:23.980> out<00:02:24.190> oh

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
what what light does it filter out oh

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.490 
what what light does it filter out oh
what<00:02:26.880> believing<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.940> go<00:02:28.090> violent<00:02:28.540> right<00:02:29.140> so

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
what believing to go violent right so

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.350 
what believing to go violent right so
what<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.890> was<00:02:30.010> supposed<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.460> do<00:02:30.670> if<00:02:30.910> there's

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
what it was supposed to do if there's

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.710 
what it was supposed to do if there's
blue<00:02:31.660> indigo<00:02:32.230> or<00:02:32.530> violent<00:02:33.100> in<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.460> one<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
blue indigo or violent in that one the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.450 
blue indigo or violent in that one the
only<00:02:34.960> way<00:02:35.080> I'm<00:02:35.260> going<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.500> see<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:35.860> over<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
only way I'm going to see it over the

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.790 
only way I'm going to see it over the
yellow<00:02:36.640> that's<00:02:37.030> kind<00:02:37.300> of<00:02:37.390> masking<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.080> as<00:02:38.500> if<00:02:38.680> I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
yellow that's kind of masking it as if I

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.860 
yellow that's kind of masking it as if I
look<00:02:39.040> through<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> cobalt<00:02:39.910> glass<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.690> then

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
look through the cobalt glass and then

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.930 
look through the cobalt glass and then
covers<00:02:41.350> up<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.010> yellow<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.459> doesn't<00:02:42.700> allow<00:02:42.910> it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
covers up the yellow it doesn't allow it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.640 
covers up the yellow it doesn't allow it
to<00:02:43.090> pass<00:02:43.330> through<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.720> lens<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.350> then<00:02:44.500> your

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
to pass through the lens and then your

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.440 
to pass through the lens and then your
eyes<00:02:44.680> we're<00:02:45.070> supposed<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.370> pick<00:02:45.610> up<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
eyes we're supposed to pick up the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.690 
eyes we're supposed to pick up the
violets<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:46.959> were<00:02:47.170> there<00:02:47.350> okay<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.370> few

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
violets that were there okay so a few

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.010 
violets that were there okay so a few
people<00:02:48.730> missed<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.330> but<00:02:49.480> otherwise<00:02:49.690> you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
people missed that but otherwise you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.240 
people missed that but otherwise you
guys<00:02:50.170> did<00:02:50.320> pretty<00:02:50.350> good<00:02:50.590> on<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.860> report

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
guys did pretty good on the report

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.970 
guys did pretty good on the report
that's<00:02:51.790> it
