00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.210
 this dish that teaches is Christian karnas 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.210

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.730
 Hi, people today and I and the crisis again. 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.990
 we are here to show one more 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.060
 recipe for you 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.769
 and that child you have today is the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 onion that onion 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.429
 breaded and fried seasoning is one of the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.890
 Ingredients 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:38.219
 You'll need a big onion. 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:43.980
 500 grams of four - fold flour 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:49.739
 eggs a cup of milk flour flour 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:54.320
 thread with seasoning to taste Water 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.489
 boiling water and ice and oil to stay 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.960
 with the first step for us to do 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.149
 an Australian onion 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.040
 The first step is to preach is to take the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:10.670
 onion and draw a cross 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.670
 leaving one centimeter of the queen 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.920
 and then repeating this process depends 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.300
 also the size of the onion in this case 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:29.520
 I think I'll get two more. 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:32.250
 times and on this second of this size 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.560
 to do two three times right 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.770
 Then we're going to take her to the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.619
 put it in boiling water for more or 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.800
 less than ten minutes after having 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.820
 let the onion in the hot water, right? 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.490
 boiling 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:57.149
 you can see that it opens a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:00.350
 A little there of the hot water she goes to 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.350
 the ice water 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.520
 now criticizes the next step after 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.130
 we left more or less a couple of 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:20.100
 three minutes in the cold water we go 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:24.959
 pick her up and gently we'll go 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.440
 try to open the petals okay and let 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.440
 drain well 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.820
 or say 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.640
 Anthony, there we go now. 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.840
 in the temperings I chose here some 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.909
 herbs is parsley with one eye salt 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.010
 Pepper you can put what you want 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:55.569
 you want what you give your preference 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.569
 seasoning to taste yes 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.870
 James 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:24.610
 let's not mix the wheat flour 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:27.670
 with the eggs and then we'll put 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.120
 the milk is also to fool onions and 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.120
 that 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.790
 oh look there 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.150
 the mixture for odd cream ready she goes 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.780
 stay 6 liquid where the onion will pass 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:54.130
 inside it 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.620
 oh there's her tempered past 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.840
 in wheat flour with the saw with milk 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.930
 people will embody it in the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.930
 screw thread 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.300
 After tying, we're going to swim. 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.300
 fry 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.210
 our onion is ready and now grows 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.490
 how you will do to serve can 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.700
 prepare a sauce, I've prepared a 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.290
 rosÃ© sauce and is served with an eye on 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.680
 eye that you prefer 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.680
