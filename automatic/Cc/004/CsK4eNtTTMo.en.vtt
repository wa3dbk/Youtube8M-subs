00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.110

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.979
 for what we take ao 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.990
 ya look Chinese the first one brings it to us 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.579
 atomic 02 which is the one in front the red 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.579
 that for some reason he was saved from 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.350
 brussels pendeja of the world and now look 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.659
 let's see it again here it's saved by 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.429
 some kind of strange witchcraft but the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.360
 another also saves himself and ends up dying 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.579
 even our little friend is a double robbery 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.890
 the feil of the two is really worth 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.780
 as two we go to the next name of 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.630
 tarado floods the ncaa and be an imbecile 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.920
 what he leaves his ordinance leaves and what 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.580
 I had 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.580
 lic 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.640
 and the truth is that the map does not end 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.010
 and this whole edition returns to 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.750
 clear battlefield please come back and the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.050
 following 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.050
 Jonathan 117 meters 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.940
 we were with him 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.220
 that same was what they said the shit 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.080
 the whole game I'm already an artist and he left 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.489
 down with the enemy better not 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.290
 he killed no one the two layers are saved 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.780
 I could not kill there but good and we're going to 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.570
 see now the last clip that brings it 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.820
 our friend xl gabo 7 xl which is the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.930
 best ninja in the world the ninja the 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.340
 railing and why and I thought that in 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.430
 Truthfully, nobody was following him 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.959
 if they are chasing him to be the ninja 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.400
 but if you realize, let's analyze 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.769
 a little 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.530
 the clip he wants to make the ninja but to 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.200
 the time he stuck a lot to the brother this and 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.079
 ends up crashing with pop and goes by 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.269
 the side or the push is given by the 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.430
 leg like the one that puts an arm and 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.959
 ends up making a ninja to the railing 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.870
 and the other one stays like fuck 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.670
 because if you want to be a ninja and you 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.109
 you have to pull back is impossible 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.569
 that you have both for the left or 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.000
 well clear impossible 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.879
 well you saw our fails of this 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.590
 week and if you want to send us 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.480
 fails in the description as you already 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.540
 we said this link so that you 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.180
 can this know how to send some clips 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.129
 from its files or some of those things and 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.900
 it's also here in the video itself a 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.970
 annotation that they click and it takes 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.470
 that video can not be easier and if 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.730
 they want the way we 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.730
 we go to your house, telling you more 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.380
 low throughout the entire web 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.120

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.530
