and<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:48.320> cool<00:03:48.650> fact<00:03:49.070> about<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.910> front<00:03:50.180> camera

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
and a cool fact about the front camera

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.590 
and a cool fact about the front camera
is<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.959> wide<00:03:51.140> angle<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.680> 88<00:03:52.370> degrees<00:03:52.880> that

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
is the wide angle of 88 degrees that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.160 
is the wide angle of 88 degrees that
allows<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:54.769> to<00:03:55.540> get<00:03:56.890> wider<00:03:57.890> picture<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:59.170> with

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
allows you to get wider picture and with

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.949 
allows you to get wider picture and with
the<00:04:00.290> front<00:04:00.560> camera<00:04:00.799> and<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.640> makes<00:04:02.030> easier<00:04:02.690> to

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
the front camera and it makes easier to

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.650 
the front camera and it makes easier to
include<00:04:03.320> much<00:04:03.769> more<00:04:03.799> space<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.640> course<00:04:04.970> in<00:04:05.209> the

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
include much more space of course in the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.590 
include much more space of course in the
picture<00:04:06.049> the<00:04:06.470> HTC<00:04:07.160> One<00:04:07.400> has<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.730> full<00:04:08.150> aluminum

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
picture the HTC One has a full aluminum

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.420 
picture the HTC One has a full aluminum
body<00:04:08.920> 4.7<00:04:09.920> inches<00:04:10.250> 1080p<00:04:10.580> display<00:04:11.390> with<00:04:12.430> 479

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.250 
body 4.7 inches 1080p display with 479
PPI<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.450> it's<00:04:14.739> probably<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.220> best<00:04:16.870> LCD<00:04:17.870> screen

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260
