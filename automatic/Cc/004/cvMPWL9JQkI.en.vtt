00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
set of computer center sheets I get a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.730 
set of computer center sheets I get a
lot<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.360> questions<00:00:09.780> about<00:00:09.900> these<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.530> it's

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
lot of questions about these and it's

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.910 
lot of questions about these and it's
really<00:00:11.130> easier<00:00:11.519> if<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.700> just<00:00:11.730> show<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.530> I<00:00:13.530> think

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
really easier if I just show you I think

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.120 
really easier if I just show you I think
they're<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.190> most<00:00:14.660> essential<00:00:15.660> way<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.619> use<00:00:16.980> my

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
they're the most essential way I use my

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.790 
they're the most essential way I use my
computers<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.699> my<00:00:17.760> classroom<00:00:18.240> they<00:00:19.230> do<00:00:19.289> not

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
computers in my classroom they do not

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.730 
computers in my classroom they do not
work<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:21.000> iPad<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:21.689> iPad<00:00:22.350> requires

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
work on the iPad because iPad requires

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.179 
work on the iPad because iPad requires
flash<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.490> most<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.880> these<00:00:23.970> games<00:00:24.920> use<00:00:25.920> flash

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
flash and most of these games use flash

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.519 
flash and most of these games use flash
so<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.269> were<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> make<00:00:27.660> these<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.050> ipads

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
so if I were to make these for ipads

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.560 
so if I were to make these for ipads
then<00:00:29.340> ninety<00:00:29.820> percent<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.179> them<00:00:30.330> wouldn't

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
then ninety percent of them wouldn't

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.990 
then ninety percent of them wouldn't
work<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.050> could<00:00:31.830> try<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> sell<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.759> something

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
