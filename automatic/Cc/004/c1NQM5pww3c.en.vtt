it hits the opposite side of the skull
the<00:02:24.859> the<00:02:25.129> swelling<00:02:25.609> and<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.450> bleeding

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
the the swelling and the bleeding

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.209 
the the swelling and the bleeding

happens on the other side of that that
brain<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.780> get<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.109> squeezing<00:02:30.799> pressure

from a closed head injury
this<00:02:34.879> can<00:02:35.239> cause<00:02:35.569> death<00:02:36.109> in<00:02:36.349> and<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.650> itself

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
this can cause death in and of itself

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.599 
this can cause death in and of itself
and<00:02:38.230> along<00:02:39.230> with<00:02:39.439> other<00:02:39.709> traumatic<00:02:40.099> injuries

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
and along with other traumatic injuries

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.140 
and along with other traumatic injuries
that<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:40.879> occur<00:02:41.269> maybe<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.689> broken<00:02:41.930> neck<00:02:43.150> from

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
that can occur maybe a broken neck from

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.170 
that can occur maybe a broken neck from
from<00:02:44.569> this<00:02:44.750> whiplash<00:02:45.349> effect<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:46.670> there's<00:02:46.969> so

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
from this whiplash effect so there's so

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.640 
from this whiplash effect so there's so
many<00:02:47.329> different<00:02:47.689> ways<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.049> this<00:02:48.200> can<00:02:48.409> happen

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
many different ways that this can happen

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.770 
many different ways that this can happen
the<00:02:49.489> way<00:02:49.639> that<00:02:49.790> we<00:02:49.879> would<00:02:50.030> treat<00:02:50.359> this<00:02:50.569> though

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
the way that we would treat this though

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.110 
the way that we would treat this though
if<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.049> were<00:02:51.200> responding<00:02:51.919> as<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.069> paramedic<00:02:52.549> on

if I were responding as a paramedic on

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.119 
if I were responding as a paramedic on
the<00:02:53.780> Olympic<00:02:54.109> grounds<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.950> we<00:02:55.040> would

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
the Olympic grounds is that we would

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.190 
the Olympic grounds is that we would
want<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.430> stabilize<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.419> cervical<00:02:56.900> spine

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
want to stabilize the cervical spine

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.890 
want to stabilize the cervical spine
immediately<00:02:57.889> we<00:02:58.489> would<00:02:58.639> want<00:02:58.879> to<00:02:59.000> see<00:02:59.659> if<00:02:59.780> we

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
immediately we would want to see if we

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.319 
immediately we would want to see if we
could<00:03:00.109> actually<00:03:00.319> initiate<00:03:01.060> rescue<00:03:02.060> breathing

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
could actually initiate rescue breathing

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.030 
could actually initiate rescue breathing
if<00:03:02.569> they<00:03:02.719> were<00:03:02.780> not<00:03:03.019> breathing<00:03:03.560> without

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
if they were not breathing without

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.099 
if they were not breathing without

airlift would be called for so that we

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.050 
airlift would be called for so that we
could<00:03:43.489> immediately<00:03:44.030> get<00:03:44.989> this<00:03:45.139> person<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.680> a

could immediately get this person to a

begin<00:03:49.340> brain<00:03:49.939> surgery<00:03:50.540> shunts<00:03:51.439> to<00:03:51.919> remove<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
begin brain surgery shunts to remove the

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.569 
begin brain surgery shunts to remove the
pressure<00:03:52.699> inside<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.419> head<00:03:53.709> or<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:55.459> know

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
pressure inside the head or you know

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.119 
pressure inside the head or you know
some<00:03:56.030> type<00:03:56.209> of<00:03:56.239> relief<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.709> cervical

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
some type of relief of the cervical

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.460 
some type of relief of the cervical
spine<00:03:58.189> injury<00:03:58.759> through<00:03:59.509> orthopedic<00:04:00.079> surgery

spine injury through orthopedic surgery

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.339 
spine injury through orthopedic surgery
so<00:04:01.040> this<00:04:01.310> stuff<00:04:01.549> takes<00:04:01.879> a<00:04:02.120> lot<00:04:02.780> of<00:04:02.810> time<00:04:03.139> to

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
so this stuff takes a lot of time to

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.619 
so this stuff takes a lot of time to
have<00:04:03.560> happen<00:04:04.009> and<00:04:04.189> if<00:04:04.609> it's<00:04:04.759> a<00:04:04.879> serious<00:04:05.329> injury

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
have happen and if it's a serious injury

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.809 
have happen and if it's a serious injury
we<00:04:06.349> sometimes<00:04:06.590> don't<00:04:06.949> have<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.400> time<00:04:07.609> on<00:04:07.729> our

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
we sometimes don't have that time on our

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.449 
we sometimes don't have that time on our
side<00:04:07.849> so<00:04:08.739> we<00:04:09.739> hope<00:04:09.919> that<00:04:10.040> there<00:04:10.220> are<00:04:10.310> no

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459
