00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.269
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.080
 make a video of how to reset 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.420
 his password 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.590
 using a USB key or drive had 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.320
 an aggravated cd so it's very simple 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.240
 in fact, it allows us to 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.130
 causes or that we have forgotten our word of 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.810
 pass or that there is a windows bug 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.080
 yes it can happen a windows bug 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.390
 who pays who makes us lose our word 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.149
 this happens often when 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.129
 change our pocket skin and when 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.260
 change is that sometimes the system 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.850
 do not record and we are talking about 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.739
 the password and we are not the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.050
 new united the old and it's like a 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.270
 break that is an existence and even if 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.170
 we enter nothing we still can not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.510
 access the system 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 so we have to make a green 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.070
 initialization of the windows in full this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.720
 which makes all our files lose 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.850
 it's not very 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.290
 your iphone when it happens to us 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.220
 so I was showing you precisely for 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.530

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.510
 so to start we go on the button 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.550

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.830

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:22.390
 users you are going to accounts 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.070
