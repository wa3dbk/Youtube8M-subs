00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.170 
to concede to in the last minute we only
considered<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.310> time<00:02:17.489> but<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.819> was<00:02:17.940> so

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
considered one this time but it was so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.300 
considered one this time but it was so
much<00:02:18.450> more<00:02:18.510> painful<00:02:18.930> because<00:02:19.410> i<00:02:19.530> worked<00:02:19.800> so

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
much more painful because i worked so

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.210 
much more painful because i worked so
hard<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.849> get<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.090> equalizer<00:02:21.769> so<00:02:22.769> hard<00:02:23.069> to

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
hard to get that equalizer so hard to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.620 
hard to get that equalizer so hard to
get<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.430> equalizer<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.239> then<00:02:24.330> we<00:02:24.390> end<00:02:24.540> up

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
get that equalizer and then we end up

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.900 
get that equalizer and then we end up
losing<00:02:24.900> 3-2<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:26.099> actually<00:02:26.370> came<00:02:26.849> i

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
losing 3-2 and that actually came i

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.820 
losing 3-2 and that actually came i
think<00:02:27.209> only<00:02:27.330> like<00:02:27.599> three<00:02:27.900> games<00:02:28.170> after<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.739> i

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
think only like three games after it i

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.530 
think only like three games after it i
played<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.250> these<00:02:29.459> games<00:02:29.730> from<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.390> last

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
the check list so we move one inform

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.610 
the check list so we move one inform
closer<00:04:57.760> to<00:04:58.300> getting<00:04:58.810> on<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.170> the<00:04:59.350> man<00:04:59.470> the

nearly near there or nearly there there

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.690 
nearly near there or nearly there there
that's<00:05:07.990> not<00:05:08.080> make<00:05:08.230> sense<00:05:08.380> anyway<00:05:09.040> whatever

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.630 
and I think it's Bella's quiz at the

to PSG so there you go and then we
conceive<00:05:30.490> another<00:05:30.610> goal<00:05:30.940> this<00:05:31.480> time<00:05:31.540> it<00:05:31.900> was<00:05:31.990> a

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
conceive another goal this time it was a

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.610 
conceive another goal this time it was a
quiz<00:05:32.640> not<00:05:33.640> brilliant<00:05:34.000> so<00:05:34.930> we're<00:05:35.410> not<00:05:35.500> looking

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
quiz not brilliant so we're not looking

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.770 
quiz not brilliant so we're not looking
too<00:05:35.890> strong<00:05:36.190> and<00:05:36.610> we<00:05:36.700> do<00:05:36.820> need<00:05:37.000> points<00:05:37.450> we<00:05:37.600> need

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
to take the ball off the defender there

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.170 
to take the ball off the defender there
but<00:05:52.930> after<00:05:53.080> we<00:05:53.620> sort<00:05:53.890> of<00:05:53.920> capitulated<00:05:54.700> that

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
but after we sort of capitulated that

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.000 
but after we sort of capitulated that
was<00:05:55.390> an<00:05:55.480> absolutely<00:05:55.870> insane<00:05:56.560> shot<00:05:56.860> from

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
was an absolutely insane shot from

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.740 
was an absolutely insane shot from
Micheli<00:05:57.370> he<00:05:57.520> was<00:05:57.640> basically<00:05:57.820> standing<00:05:58.450> still

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
Micheli he was basically standing still

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.090 
Micheli he was basically standing still
we<00:05:58.900> basically<00:05:59.200> took<00:05:59.410> that<00:05:59.590> like<00:05:59.740> a<00:05:59.770> free-kick

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
we basically took that like a free-kick

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.550 
we basically took that like a free-kick
and<00:06:00.610> he<00:06:01.300> absolutely<00:06:01.450> blaze<00:06:02.020> it<00:06:02.260> into<00:06:02.380> the<00:06:02.440> back

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
and he absolutely blaze it into the back

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.170 
and he absolutely blaze it into the back
and<00:06:02.680> it<00:06:02.770> usually<00:06:02.920> you<00:06:03.160> need<00:06:03.370> a<00:06:03.400> massive<00:06:03.790> run-up

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
and it usually you need a massive run-up

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.150 
and it usually you need a massive run-up
to<00:06:04.300> do<00:06:04.420> that<00:06:04.600> and<00:06:04.810> then<00:06:05.170> we<00:06:05.320> got<00:06:05.470> realated<00:06:05.980> he

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
to do that and then we got realated he

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.800 
to do that and then we got realated he
scored<00:06:06.460> in<00:06:06.580> a<00:06:06.610> fantastic<00:06:07.120> start<00:06:07.300> with<00:06:07.450> Cavani

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
scored in a fantastic start with Cavani

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.790 
scored in a fantastic start with Cavani
so<00:06:08.170> another<00:06:08.830> loss<00:06:09.130> on<00:06:09.400> the<00:06:09.820> old<00:06:10.030> account

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
so another loss on the old account

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.999 
so another loss on the old account
yeah<00:06:12.449> now<00:06:13.449> we're<00:06:13.720> in<00:06:13.870> real<00:06:14.229> trouble<00:06:14.259> because

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
yeah now we're in real trouble because

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.710 
yeah now we're in real trouble because
we<00:06:15.129> actually<00:06:15.699> need<00:06:15.879> to<00:06:15.909> get<00:06:16.120> points<00:06:16.449> from<00:06:16.599> our

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
we actually need to get points from our

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.480 
we actually need to get points from our
one<00:06:17.199> remaining<00:06:17.409> game<00:06:17.770> under<00:06:18.220> pressure

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
one remaining game under pressure
