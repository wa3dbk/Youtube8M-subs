00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
little bit more complicated than that

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.410 
little bit more complicated than that

what<00:01:25.080> makes<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.470> even<00:01:25.979> more<00:01:26.220> complicated

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
what makes this even more complicated

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.850 
what makes this even more complicated
are<00:01:27.210> some<00:01:27.450> little<00:01:27.720> kind<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.290> things<00:01:28.560> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
are some little kind of things that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.819 
are some little kind of things that
WordPress<00:01:29.340> does<00:01:29.610> under<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> hood<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:31.530> code

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
WordPress does under the hood this code

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.679 
WordPress does under the hood this code
as<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.250> stands<00:01:32.520> right<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:32.939> won't<00:01:33.329> actually

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
as it stands right here won't actually

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.920 
as it stands right here won't actually
work<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.490> well<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:35.850> we'll<00:01:35.970> need<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.509> here

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
work so well what we'll need to do here

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.569 
work so well what we'll need to do here
is<00:01:37.110> delete<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.740> last<00:01:38.570> close<00:01:39.570> object<00:01:40.200> tab<00:01:40.829> or

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.180 
into something that I'd already written
it<00:02:12.750> wouldn't<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.320> mattered<00:02:13.470> but<00:02:14.040> that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
it wouldn't have mattered but that

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.930 
it wouldn't have mattered but that
object<00:02:14.640> tag<00:02:14.850> does<00:02:15.210> need<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.600> removed<00:02:16.940> so

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
object tag does need to be removed so

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.700 
object tag does need to be removed so
let's<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.570> check<00:02:18.870> our<00:02:19.050> work<00:02:19.200> here<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.530> see

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
let's just check our work here and see

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:27.800 
let's just check our work here and see
if<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:20.040> all<00:02:20.730> worked<00:02:21.030> correctly<00:02:26.600> looks<00:02:27.600> like

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
if it all worked correctly looks like

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.020 
if it all worked correctly looks like
it's<00:02:27.959> working
