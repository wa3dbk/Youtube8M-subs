00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
in motion I know I will not be going any

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.499 
in motion I know I will not be going any
I'm<00:00:28.090> not<00:00:28.300> be<00:00:28.420> going<00:00:28.860> at<00:00:29.860> any<00:00:30.310> high<00:00:30.910> speeds<00:00:31.329> at

I'm not be going at any high speeds at
all<00:00:31.660> probably<00:00:32.230> most<00:00:32.470> likely<00:00:32.680> less<00:00:33.370> than<00:00:33.640> 10

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
all probably most likely less than 10

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.600

because<00:00:34.810> I'm<00:00:35.110> just<00:00:35.350> trotting<00:00:36.310> around<00:00:36.399> this

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
because I'm just trotting around this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.760 

but<00:00:44.870> eventually<00:00:46.030> I'll<00:00:47.030> get<00:00:47.300> some<00:00:48.110> more<00:00:48.379> better

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
don't really matter because this is just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.810

easy<00:01:01.339> maneuverability<00:01:02.170> areas<00:01:03.640> actually<00:01:04.640> just

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
easy maneuverability areas actually just

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.969 
easy maneuverability areas actually just
a<00:01:04.879> circle<00:01:05.300> or<00:01:06.050> square<00:01:06.290> or<00:01:07.210> anyway<00:01:08.210> at<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:09.369> so

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
a circle or square or anyway at it so

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.249
