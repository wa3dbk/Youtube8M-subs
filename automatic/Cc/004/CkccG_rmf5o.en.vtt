00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
let's see this I kind of like the small

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.430 
let's see this I kind of like the small
one<00:07:27.460> still<00:07:27.790> you<00:07:27.910> know<00:07:28.030> like<00:07:28.990> the<00:07:29.110> conventional

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 
one still you know like the conventional

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.290 
one still you know like the conventional
missile<00:07:30.100> it's<00:07:30.250> only<00:07:30.370> got<00:07:30.520> ten<00:07:30.700> seconds<00:07:31.150> and

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
missile it's only got ten seconds and

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.660 
missile it's only got ten seconds and
I'm<00:07:31.390> kind<00:07:31.870> of<00:07:31.960> impatient<00:07:32.470> so<00:07:33.130> I<00:07:33.160> think<00:07:33.310> we<00:07:33.520> can

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:33.670 
I'm kind of impatient so I think we can

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.980 
I'm kind of impatient so I think we can
light<00:07:33.850> it<00:07:33.880> up<00:07:34.030> fire<00:07:34.330> while<00:07:34.540> we<00:07:34.630> wait<00:07:34.780> for<00:07:34.810> that

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:34.990 
light it up fire while we wait for that

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.590 
light it up fire while we wait for that
let's<00:07:35.890> get<00:07:35.980> the<00:07:36.100> fires<00:07:36.370> going<00:07:36.670> here<00:07:37.060> involve<00:07:37.540> a

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:37.600 
let's get the fires going here involve a

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.320 
let's get the fires going here involve a
missile<00:07:37.960> coming<00:07:38.200> down<00:07:38.470> in<00:07:38.620> a<00:07:38.680> second<00:07:39.190> and<00:07:40.030> then

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.330 
missile coming down in a second and then

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.910 
missile coming down in a second and then
I<00:07:40.360> think<00:07:40.510> that's<00:07:40.630> pretty<00:07:40.810> much<00:07:40.930> it<00:07:41.020> I<00:07:41.440> want<00:07:41.830> my

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:41.920

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.270 
car my car should be able to live let's

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.630
