00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
really add a lot of hair so I kind of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.499 
really add a lot of hair so I kind of
like<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.890> case<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.369> let's<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.790> quickly

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
like this case so let's just quickly

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.990 
like this case so let's just quickly
check<00:01:54.869> how<00:01:54.990> much<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.259> actually<00:01:55.380> ways<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> let

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
check how much it actually ways so let

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.030 
check how much it actually ways so let
me<00:01:57.030> pop<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:59.299> and<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.040> weighing

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
me pop it out and get this weighing

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.900 
me pop it out and get this weighing
scale

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.120 

44<00:02:06.910> grams<00:02:07.150> not<00:02:07.600> too<00:02:07.780> heavy<00:02:07.960> so<00:02:08.920> if<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.040> guys

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
44 grams not too heavy so if you guys

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
there is a bit of elevation here so if

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.540
