really cute braid going on and it was so

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.009 
really cute braid going on and it was so
difficult<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:11.099> see<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:12.150> they<00:00:12.389> did<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.719> because

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
difficult to see how they did it because

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.240 
difficult to see how they did it because
her<00:00:13.110> hair<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.469> dark<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.889> lighting<00:00:14.219> was

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
her hair so dark and the lighting was

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.369 
her hair so dark and the lighting was
dark<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.299> shots<00:00:15.660> where<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:15.990> could<00:00:16.170> see

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
dark in the shots where you could see

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.410 
dark in the shots where you could see
her<00:00:16.590> hair<00:00:16.800> from<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> back<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> kind<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.210> made

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
her hair from the back so I kind of made

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.720 
her hair from the back so I kind of made
up<00:00:18.750> what<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.230> thought<00:00:19.470> they<00:00:19.680> possibly<00:00:20.160> did<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
up what I thought they possibly did and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
up what I thought they possibly did and
sort<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.420> came<00:00:21.539> up<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:21.660> my<00:00:21.900> own<00:00:22.109> hairstyle

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
sound easier to do as I said I have

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.560 
sound easier to do as I said I have
demonstrate<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:56.940> don't<00:00:57.360> know

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
demonstrate here so I really don't know

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.000 
demonstrate here so I really don't know
it's<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.140> curly<00:00:58.500> hair<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.800> you'd<00:00:58.920> have

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
it's like with curly hair so you'd have

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
it's like with curly hair so you'd have
to<00:00:59.129> try<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.489> out<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.699> see<00:01:00.180> how<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.420> works<00:01:00.570> for

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
to try that out and see how it works for

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200 
to try that out and see how it works for
you<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.829> separate<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.520> top<00:01:02.789> half<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.149> your

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
you so separate the top half of your

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.170 
you so separate the top half of your
hair<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.750> me<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.899> ears<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.790> separate

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
hair for me to ears up and then separate

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
hair for me to ears up and then separate
that<00:01:06.390> section<00:01:06.750> into<00:01:06.930> two<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.500> put<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> bottom

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that section into two I put the bottom

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010 
that section into two I put the bottom
section<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.820> behind<00:01:09.150> my<00:01:09.360> shoulders<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> keep

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
section just behind my shoulders to keep

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.870 
section just behind my shoulders to keep
it<00:01:10.110> separated<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.610> feel<00:01:11.790> more

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it separated if you feel more

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.399 
it separated if you feel more
comfortable<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.540> definitely<00:01:12.659> clip<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
comfortable you can definitely clip that

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
comfortable you can definitely clip that
or<00:01:13.560> cut<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> hair<00:01:13.950> elastic<00:01:14.010> around<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> make

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
or cut a hair elastic around it to make

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.609 
or cut a hair elastic around it to make
sure<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> stays<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> hair<00:01:16.439> you're

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619
