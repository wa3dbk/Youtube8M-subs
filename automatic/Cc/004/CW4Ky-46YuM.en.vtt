00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
that I came up with so basically we're

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.270 
that I came up with so basically we're
going<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.389> grab<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.960> piece<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.530> tape<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.920> we're

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
going to grab a piece of tape and we're

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.220 
going to grab a piece of tape and we're
going<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.490> tape<00:00:11.700> down<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.269> right<00:00:12.480> trigger<00:00:12.870> on

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
going to tape down the right trigger on

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.440 
going to tape down the right trigger on
our<00:00:13.440> controller<00:00:13.950> so<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.790> it's<00:00:15.059> always

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
our controller so that it's always

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.290 
our controller so that it's always
pushed<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:16.369> okay<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.400> think<00:00:17.580> that's<00:00:17.730> enough<00:00:17.880> as

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
pushed in okay I think that's enough as

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.000 
pushed in okay I think that's enough as
you<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.320> see<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> trigger<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.890> now

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
you can see the trigger is now

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.650 
you can see the trigger is now
completely<00:00:20.460> pushed<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.300> now<00:00:21.420> we're<00:00:21.539> going

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
completely pushed in and now we're going

so<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.060> no<00:01:21.150> idea<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.689> position<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.229> or

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
so I have no idea what my position is or

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.649 
so I have no idea what my position is or
what<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> timer<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:23.580> anyways<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.030> far

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
what the timer is on but anyways so far

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.999 
what the timer is on but anyways so far
we<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.869> doing<00:01:25.080> quite<00:01:25.170> good<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.590> mean<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.740> guess

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
we are doing quite good I mean I guess

we are doing quite good I mean I guess
that<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.189> could<00:01:26.310> display<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.330> one

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that I could display with you know one

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.420 
that I could display with you know one
hand<00:01:27.840> since<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.590> no<00:01:28.740> need<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:28.979> use<00:01:29.220> this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
hand since there is no need to use this

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640

go<00:02:25.620> there's<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.950> freaking<00:02:26.310> checkpoint<00:02:26.730> okay

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
go there's the freaking checkpoint okay

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.729 
go there's the freaking checkpoint okay
so<00:02:27.150> basically<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.689> only<00:02:27.780> way<00:02:28.139> for<00:02:28.319> me<00:02:28.409> to<00:02:28.439> make

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
so basically the only way for me to make

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.289 
so basically the only way for me to make
these<00:02:28.889> turns<00:02:29.189> is<00:02:29.459> for<00:02:29.730> me<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.939> like<00:02:30.060> start

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
these turns is for me to like start

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.270 
these turns is for me to like start
drifting<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.170> otherwise<00:02:31.980> there<00:02:32.219> is

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
drifting like this otherwise there is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.640 
drifting like this otherwise there is
pretty<00:02:32.430> much<00:02:32.549> no<00:02:32.790> chance<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.389> me<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.840> pulsing

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
pretty much no chance of me and pulsing

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.339 
pretty much no chance of me and pulsing
the<00:02:34.709> turn<00:02:35.180> well<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.209> have<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.629> great<00:02:36.840> time<00:02:37.049> woah

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
the turn well I have a great time woah

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.709 
the turn well I have a great time woah
holy<00:02:38.129> shit<00:02:38.609> that<00:02:38.639> was<00:02:38.819> close<00:02:38.909> he<00:02:39.299> almost<00:02:39.540> runs

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
holy shit that was close he almost runs

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.690 
holy shit that was close he almost runs
straight<00:02:40.019> into<00:02:40.379> me<00:02:40.500> okay<00:02:41.159> so<00:02:41.219> I<00:02:41.310> guess<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.609> he

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
straight into me okay so I guess that he

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.819 
straight into me okay so I guess that he
hasn't<00:02:41.819> finished<00:02:42.060> yet<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:42.659> so<00:02:43.349> far<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.799> good

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
hasn't finished yet so so far so good

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.949 
hasn't finished yet so so far so good
okay<00:02:44.639> so<00:02:44.700> someone<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.239> finished<00:02:45.599> in<00:02:45.720> first

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
okay so someone is finished in first

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.449 
okay so someone is finished in first
place<00:02:46.079> and<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.680> don't<00:02:46.739> really<00:02:46.950> think<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.340> I'm

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
place and I don't really think that I'm

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.890 
place and I don't really think that I'm
even<00:02:47.700> close<00:02:47.939> to<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.209> finish<00:02:48.450> time<00:02:48.599> at<00:02:48.780> all

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
even close to the finish time at all

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.420 
even close to the finish time at all
well<00:02:49.019> let's<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:49.799> keep<00:02:49.950> going

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
well let's just keep going

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.569 
well let's just keep going
come<00:02:50.879> on<00:02:50.970> we're<00:02:51.150> sister<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.250> we<00:02:53.250> got<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.459> be

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
come on we're sister and we got to be

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.119 
come on we're sister and we got to be
enough<00:02:53.760> okay<00:02:54.719> so<00:02:54.840> me<00:02:55.139> and<00:02:55.319> two<00:02:55.680> other<00:02:55.889> people

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
enough okay so me and two other people

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.860 
enough okay so me and two other people
got<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.489> DNS<00:02:56.819> so<00:02:57.090> at<00:02:57.209> least<00:02:57.389> I<00:02:57.480> wasn't<00:02:57.659> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
got the DNS so at least I wasn't the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.270 
got the DNS so at least I wasn't the
only<00:02:57.930> one<00:02:58.349> but<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.680> guess<00:02:58.859> let's<00:02:59.069> just<00:02:59.099> keep

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
only one but I guess let's just keep

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.470 
only one but I guess let's just keep
moving<00:02:59.579> on<00:02:59.639> to<00:02:59.849> the<00:02:59.939> next<00:03:00.060> one

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
moving on to the next one

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.059 
moving on to the next one
moving<00:03:00.780> on<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.139> next<00:03:01.260> one<00:03:01.680> moving<00:03:01.980> on

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
moving on to the next one moving on

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.800 
moving on to the next one moving on
moving<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.430> moving<00:03:02.639> on<00:03:02.849> here<00:03:03.299> we<00:03:03.419> go<00:03:03.540> we<00:03:03.780> are
