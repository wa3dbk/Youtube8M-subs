00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
the built quality now you'd think for a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.160 
the built quality now you'd think for a
pair<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.700> $34<00:03:00.950> wireless<00:03:01.950> transmitters<00:03:03.170> $34

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
that would be really bad quality they're

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.520 
that would be really bad quality they're
actually<00:03:07.260> not<00:03:10.820> they<00:03:11.820> actually<00:03:12.030> really<00:03:12.600> sturdy

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
actually not they actually really sturdy
