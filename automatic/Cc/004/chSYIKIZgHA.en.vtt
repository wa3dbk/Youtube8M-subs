will<00:04:48.270> have<00:04:48.390> a<00:04:48.450> differing<00:04:48.810> opinion<00:04:49.230> but<00:04:49.380> I

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
will have a differing opinion but I

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.159 
will have a differing opinion but I
think<00:04:49.620> it<00:04:50.220> is<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.700> secondary<00:04:51.390> tank<00:04:51.750> squad

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
think it is the secondary tank squad

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.050 
think it is the secondary tank squad
members<00:04:52.590> that<00:04:52.890> determine<00:04:53.460> whether<00:04:53.760> or<00:04:53.910> not

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
members that determine whether or not

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.180 
members that determine whether or not
most<00:04:54.360> battles<00:04:54.840> are<00:04:55.020> won<00:04:55.050> or<00:04:55.260> lost<00:04:55.410> when<00:04:55.919> it's<00:04:56.070> a

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
most battles are won or lost when it's a

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.430 
most battles are won or lost when it's a
tank<00:04:56.490> versus<00:04:56.940> another<00:04:57.120> tank<00:04:57.510> or<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.840> chopper<00:04:58.290> or

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
tank versus another tank or a chopper or

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.360 
tank versus another tank or a chopper or
whatever<00:04:59.360> yes<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:00.750> driver<00:05:01.110> is<00:05:01.290> important<00:05:01.770> he

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
whatever yes the driver is important he

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.130 
whatever yes the driver is important he
has<00:05:02.520> to<00:05:02.700> have<00:05:02.880> things<00:05:03.210> unlocked<00:05:03.630> he<00:05:03.810> has<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.020> be

has to have things unlocked he has to be

has to have things unlocked he has to be
a<00:05:04.169> decent<00:05:04.350> aim<00:05:04.710> he<00:05:05.010> has<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.220> know<00:05:05.340> when<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.550> move

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
a decent aim he has to know when to move

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.870 
a decent aim he has to know when to move
and<00:05:06.120> when<00:05:06.240> to<00:05:06.360> stay<00:05:06.540> still<00:05:06.840> but<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.280> secondary

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
and when to stay still but the secondary

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.690 
and when to stay still but the secondary
guys<00:05:09.230> can<00:05:10.230> deal<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.440> lot<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.830> extra<00:05:11.220> damage<00:05:11.400> with

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
guys can deal a lot of extra damage with

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.840 
guys can deal a lot of extra damage with
RPGs<00:05:12.360> they<00:05:13.260> control<00:05:13.710> all<00:05:13.890> of<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.430> healing

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
RPGs they control all of the healing

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.790 
RPGs they control all of the healing
it's<00:05:15.360> ridiculous<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:16.080> think<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.470> driver

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
it's ridiculous to think that the driver

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.680 
it's ridiculous to think that the driver
should<00:05:17.160> hop<00:05:17.310> out<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.610> heal<00:05:17.790> because<00:05:18.030> then<00:05:18.570> the

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
should hop out and heal because then the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.590 
should hop out and heal because then the
tank<00:05:18.930> would<00:05:19.020> be<00:05:19.080> useless

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
tank would be useless

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.000 
tank would be useless
the<00:05:21.600> secondary<00:05:21.990> guys<00:05:22.200> have<00:05:22.470> to<00:05:22.560> know<00:05:22.710> when<00:05:22.890> to

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
the secondary guys have to know when to

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.469 
the secondary guys have to know when to
hop<00:05:23.130> out<00:05:23.310> like<00:05:23.520> in<00:05:23.640> this<00:05:23.760> scenario<00:05:24.030> and<00:05:24.390> go

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
hop out like in this scenario and go

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.390 
hop out like in this scenario and go
hunt<00:05:24.660> a<00:05:24.750> guy<00:05:24.870> down<00:05:25.050> on<00:05:25.169> foot<00:05:25.500> if<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.890> main<00:05:26.100> tank

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
hunt a guy down on foot if the main tank

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.219 
hunt a guy down on foot if the main tank
guy<00:05:26.550> can't<00:05:26.850> get<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.150> him<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.780> then<00:05:28.140> the

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
guy can't get to him and then the

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.600 
guy can't get to him and then the
building<00:05:28.410> almost<00:05:28.680> came<00:05:28.860> down<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.100> barely<00:05:29.370> got

are happening so fast in this game if

are happening so fast in this game if

you're the secondary guys whether it's

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
tank squad you've got to be ready to

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.010 
tank squad you've got to be ready to
take<00:05:50.280> control<00:05:50.669> of<00:05:50.820> any<00:05:51.060> situation<00:05:51.150> you<00:05:51.810> find

take control of any situation you find

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.870 
take control of any situation you find
yourselves<00:05:52.500> in<00:05:52.710> that<00:05:53.220> is<00:05:53.400> what<00:05:53.580> is<00:05:53.669> going<00:05:53.820> to

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
yourselves in that is what is going to

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.400 
yourselves in that is what is going to
keep<00:05:54.030> your<00:05:54.210> tank<00:05:54.390> alive<00:05:54.720> it's<00:05:55.110> what's<00:05:55.320> gonna

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
keep your tank alive it's what's gonna

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.890 
keep your tank alive it's what's gonna
kill<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:55.860> enemy<00:05:56.160> vehicles<00:05:56.310> faster<00:05:57.150> it<00:05:57.720> is

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
kill the enemy vehicles faster it is

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.469 
kill the enemy vehicles faster it is
single-handedly<00:05:58.289> in<00:05:58.860> my<00:05:59.070> opinion<00:05:59.610> the<00:06:00.270> most

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
single-handedly in my opinion the most

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.710 
single-handedly in my opinion the most
important<00:06:01.020> aspect<00:06:01.500> of<00:06:01.590> any<00:06:02.100> tank<00:06:02.520> squad<00:06:03.060> now

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
important aspect of any tank squad now

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.170 
important aspect of any tank squad now
after<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.380> tank<00:06:04.770> armor<00:06:05.250> was<00:06:05.400> patched<00:06:05.789> it's

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
after the tank armor was patched it's

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.300 
after the tank armor was patched it's
easier<00:06:06.990> for<00:06:07.350> the<00:06:07.680> tanks<00:06:07.919> to<00:06:07.979> get<00:06:08.100> blown<00:06:08.250> up

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
easier for the tanks to get blown up

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.279 
easier for the tanks to get blown up
which<00:06:08.640> means<00:06:08.820> it's<00:06:09.030> even<00:06:09.150> more<00:06:09.600> important<00:06:10.140> for

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
which means it's even more important for

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.870 
which means it's even more important for
the<00:06:10.380> secondary<00:06:10.950> tank<00:06:11.190> members<00:06:11.610> to<00:06:11.729> be<00:06:11.850> on

the secondary tank members to be on
