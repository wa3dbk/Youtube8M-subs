00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:09.760

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.690

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.350
 Alleluia I am glad of that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.870
 Headphone jack is top microphone 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.000
 front camera on the side well in the middle of us 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.980
 maybe a tick better our 8 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.680
 megapixel camera with area on the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.350
 back and who does it ever 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.220
 feels very good and above all that 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.320
 is stable and light at the same time this 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.500
 plastic rubber frame around here either 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.670
 bad at the bottom of our micro-usb to 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.459
 load speaker headphones 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.840
 loudspeaker is there but what are they 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.040
 Those are the two screw who 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.560
 Now here's what I'm asking here right now 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.290
 look to build the device it has 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.269
 Of course, a built-in battery there 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.489
 I see many similarities here 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.550
 to the iphone 4 and 4s a glass back 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.380
 firmly installed battery no 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.690
 no sd cards at the micro sd 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.680
 card slot so all that for what you 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.810
 Apple wished it with 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.670
 that has driven torches through the village 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.800
 makes google two years later now 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.210
 also and funny enough, cries 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.080
 somehow not one of them about it 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.390
 well no matter 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.280
 that was s unboxing we pretty much weird 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.000

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.000
