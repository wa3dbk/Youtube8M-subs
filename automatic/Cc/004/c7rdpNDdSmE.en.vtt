00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
like one of those rhizoma mirrors from

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.170 
like one of those rhizoma mirrors from
Italy<00:00:18.289> these<00:00:19.289> mirrors<00:00:19.980> look<00:00:20.279> great<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.789> this

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180

Italy these mirrors look great on this
bike<00:00:21.500> they<00:00:22.500> look<00:00:22.740> great<00:00:23.070> on<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.279> z1000<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.510> can

bike they look great on a z1000 you can
see<00:00:24.810> from<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> website

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
see from the website

see from the website
it<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.880> makes<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.300> bike<00:00:27.619> look<00:00:28.619> sharp<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
it just makes this bike look sharp and

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.790 
it just makes this bike look sharp and
obviously<00:00:30.539> doesn't<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.170> stock<00:00:31.529> look

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
obviously doesn't have that stock look

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.010 
obviously doesn't have that stock look
I've<00:00:31.980> tried<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.489> many<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.759> them<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.809> one

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
I've tried so many of them and this one

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.100 
I've tried so many of them and this one
by<00:00:34.200> far<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.309> best<00:00:35.570> performance<00:00:36.570> wise<00:00:36.780> it's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
by far is the best performance wise it's

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.170 
by far is the best performance wise it's
very<00:00:37.200> good<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:39.809> whole<00:00:40.110> unit<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.460> very

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
very good the whole unit here is very

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.610 
very good the whole unit here is very
very<00:00:42.710> durable<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.300> you<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:46.050> see<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.350> piece

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
very durable and you can see that piece

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.850 
very durable and you can see that piece
see<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.760> hole<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.379> written

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
see that hole that is for written

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.619 
see that hole that is for written
resistance<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.789> wind<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.210> goes<00:00:51.390> right

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
resistance the wind just goes right

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.049 
resistance the wind just goes right
through<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.890> cuts<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.699> lot<00:00:53.910> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
through there so it cuts out a lot of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.110 
through there so it cuts out a lot of
vibration<00:00:54.719> there<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.079> very<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.430> none

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
vibration there is very little to none

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.860 
vibration there is very little to none
vibration<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:59.270> let's<00:01:00.270> take<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> look<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
vibration and let's take a look at the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.510 
vibration and let's take a look at the
back<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.320> mirrors<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.890> they<00:01:02.399> are

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
back of the mirrors here they are

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.290 
back of the mirrors here they are
fantastic

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
fantastic

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.810 
fantastic
it<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.500> shaded<00:01:05.369> blue<00:01:05.689> on<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> mirrors<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.430> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it is shaded blue on the mirrors so that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.120 
it is shaded blue on the mirrors so that
way<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.240> better<00:01:09.600> visibility<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.560> love

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
way you have better visibility I love

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.010 
way you have better visibility I love
the<00:01:11.280> size<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.030> look<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.450> these<00:01:12.570> mirrors

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the size the look of these mirrors

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.580 
the size the look of these mirrors
because<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.939> they<00:01:14.939> look<00:01:15.150> very<00:01:15.590> low-profile

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because they they look very low-profile

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.429 
because they they look very low-profile
as<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.100> see<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.900> mirrors<00:01:19.229> look

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
as you can see and the mirrors look

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.940 
as you can see and the mirrors look
small<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:21.060> barely<00:01:21.330> kind<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.170> notice<00:01:22.740> them

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
small you can barely kind of notice them

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.840 
small you can barely kind of notice them
especially<00:01:23.610> from<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.240> distance<00:01:24.659> from<00:01:24.810> afar<00:01:25.850> but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
especially from a distance from afar but

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.859 
especially from a distance from afar but
yet<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.439> quite<00:01:28.799> good<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
yet you can see quite good on the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.140 
yet you can see quite good on the
rearview<00:01:31.079> mirrors<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.820> far<00:01:33.030> as

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
rearview mirrors and as far as

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.310 
rearview mirrors and as far as
installation<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.810> didn't<00:01:34.020> show<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
installation I didn't show you that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.539 
installation I didn't show you that
because<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.799> didn't<00:01:35.009> want<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> bore<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.520> with

because I didn't want to bore you with
it<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.540> very<00:01:36.600> easy<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.200> take<00:01:37.530> out

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

put that allen wrench screw in there and
this<00:01:50.850> piece<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:53.159> separate<00:01:53.670> piece<00:01:53.909> as

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this piece here is a separate piece as

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.380 
this piece here is a separate piece as
you<00:01:54.990> insert<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:56.390> piece<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.829> mirrors

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
you insert this piece of the mirrors

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.850 
you insert this piece of the mirrors
then<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.570> screw<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.140> end<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
then you screw the back end of it and

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.999 
then you screw the back end of it and
you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.670> actually<00:02:02.880> adjust<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:04.020> back<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
you can actually adjust it back and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.999 
you can actually adjust it back and
forth<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> do<00:02:06.719> or<00:02:07.259> what<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.860> did

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
forth here but what I do or what I did

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.089 
forth here but what I do or what I did
with<00:02:08.340> these<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.060> kept<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.200> straight<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.950> it's

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
with these is I kept it straight so it's

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.100 
with these is I kept it straight so it's
wind<00:02:11.879> resistance

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
wind resistance

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.620 
wind resistance
you<00:02:13.320> can<00:02:13.470> actually<00:02:13.680> turn<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.420> down

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
you can actually turn this up and down
