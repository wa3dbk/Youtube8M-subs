reviewing these for a couple of months

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.459 
reviewing these for a couple of months
listening<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.270> music<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.809> videos<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.320> stuff

on<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:34.770> smartphone<00:00:35.070> use<00:00:35.489> them<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.760> playing

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969

games and all that and I found them to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.150 
games and all that and I found them to
be<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:38.280> good<00:00:38.910> alternative<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.809> Wired<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
be a really good alternative to Wired to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
be a really good alternative to Wired to
a<00:00:41.190> wired<00:00:41.520> headphone<00:00:42.059> pair<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.840> range

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
a wired headphone pair in this range

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.049 
a wired headphone pair in this range
obviously<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.250> sound<00:00:44.460> quality<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.879> not<00:00:44.910> as

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
obviously the sound quality is not as

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.430 
obviously the sound quality is not as
good<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.570> expensive<00:00:45.989> pair<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.260> wired

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
good as an expensive pair of wired

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.110 
good as an expensive pair of wired
headphones<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:47.160> they're<00:00:47.579> not<00:00:47.700> expensive

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
headphones because they're not expensive

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
headphones because they're not expensive
but<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:49.110> most<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> stuff<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> I've<00:00:49.920> done

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
but for most of the stuff that I've done

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.010 
but for most of the stuff that I've done
most<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> music<00:00:51.449> I've<00:00:51.539> listened<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> them

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
most of the music I've listened to them

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
most of the music I've listened to them
what<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.410> sounded<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.739> fine<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.460> let's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
what not it sounded just fine so let's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.420 
what not it sounded just fine so let's
go<00:00:53.730> into<00:00:53.879> some<00:00:54.059> detail<00:00:54.800> build<00:00:55.800> quality<00:00:56.070> but

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
go into some detail build quality but

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250 
go into some detail build quality but
that's<00:00:57.300> pretty<00:00:57.449> much<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.809> first<00:00:57.989> thing<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that's pretty much the first thing you

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.240 
that's pretty much the first thing you
noticed<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.739> pull<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> pair<00:00:59.160> of

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
noticed when you pull a pair of

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.520 
noticed when you pull a pair of
headphones<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> box<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.379> one<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
headphones out of the box and one of the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.170 
headphones out of the box and one of the
most<00:01:01.680> important<00:01:02.219> factors<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> consider<00:01:02.760> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
most important factors to consider it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.109 
most important factors to consider it
actually<00:01:03.870> feels<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:05.430> much<00:01:05.670> higher<00:01:05.880> end

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
actually feels like a much higher end

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.060 
actually feels like a much higher end
device<00:01:06.330> than<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.720> which<00:01:07.140> surprised<00:01:07.830> me<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
device than it is which surprised me I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.500 
device than it is which surprised me I
expected<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:08.729> feel<00:01:08.970> cheap<00:01:09.330> but

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
expected that it would feel cheap but

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.210 
expected that it would feel cheap but
the<00:01:09.600> plastics<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.380> yes<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.860> made<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the plastics and yes it's made out of

the plastics and yes it's made out of
plastic<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:12.060> plastics<00:01:12.450> actually<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:12.900> feel

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
plastic the plastics actually don't feel

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.109 
plastic the plastics actually don't feel
particularly<00:01:13.470> cheap<00:01:13.830> they<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.460> nice<00:01:14.610> I'm

small<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.630> people<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.079> super

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
small so for people that have super

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.480 
small so for people that have super
small<00:01:34.560> heads<00:01:34.799> might<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> steer<00:01:35.460> clear

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
small heads might want to steer clear

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.499 
small heads might want to steer clear
this<00:01:35.880> one<00:01:36.060> also<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.610> side

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this one also if we look at the side

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.270 
this one also if we look at the side
here<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.979> play/pause

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
here you can see we have the play/pause

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.660 
here you can see we have the play/pause
control<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.479> play<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> pause<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.560> music<00:01:43.799> we

control to play and pause your music we

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.090 
control to play and pause your music we
also<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.420> headphone<00:01:45.810> our<00:01:46.290> pardon<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
also have the headphone our pardon the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.219 
also have the headphone our pardon the
phone<00:01:47.369> controls<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.630> accept<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.020> call

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
phone controls so you can accept a call

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.770 
phone controls so you can accept a call
you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.369> make<00:01:51.000> phone<00:01:51.210> calls<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you can make phone calls like I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.109 
you can make phone calls like I
mentioned<00:01:52.110> using<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.579> microphone<00:01:53.579> down<00:01:53.880> here

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
mentioned using the microphone down here

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.780 
mentioned using the microphone down here
and<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.799> volume<00:01:56.430> controller

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and this is the volume controller

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.819 
and this is the volume controller
obviously<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.540> also<00:01:57.689> has<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> ability<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
obviously but it also has the ability to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.340 
obviously but it also has the ability to
skip<00:01:59.070> tracks<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.850> if<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.030> hold<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> down<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
skip tracks so if you hold it down to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.870 
skip tracks so if you hold it down to
one<00:02:01.500> side<00:02:01.710> it'll<00:02:01.950> skip<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> track<00:02:02.520> forward

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
one side it'll skip the track forward

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.149 
one side it'll skip the track forward
and<00:02:03.000> backwards<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.259> merely<00:02:04.469> tap<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
and backwards but if you merely tap it

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.889 
and backwards but if you merely tap it
like<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:06.180> it'll<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.420> control<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
like this then it'll just control the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.830 
like this then it'll just control the
volume<00:02:07.020> alright<00:02:08.149> that's<00:02:09.149> about<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.599> four

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
volume alright that's about all four

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.910 
volume alright that's about all four
controls<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:10.560> actually<00:02:10.679> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
controls but that's actually a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.410 
controls but that's actually a
surprising<00:02:11.430> amount<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.730> control<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.300> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
surprising amount of control so if you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.580 
surprising amount of control so if you
compare<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:12.870> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
compare that to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.949 
compare that to
what<00:02:14.040> you'll<00:02:14.190> see<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.519> normal<00:02:14.780> low-end<00:02:15.780> pair

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
what you'll see on a normal low-end pair

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.360 
what you'll see on a normal low-end pair
of<00:02:16.050> headphones<00:02:16.200> pretty<00:02:17.010> much<00:02:17.129> all<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
of headphones pretty much all the

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.530 
of headphones pretty much all the
controls<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.849> needed<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.269> way<00:02:18.360> that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
controls that I needed and the way that

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.640 
controls that I needed and the way that
they're<00:02:18.660> housed<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.110> actually<00:02:19.470> quite

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
they're housed is actually quite

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.530 
they're housed is actually quite
convenient<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.760> that's<00:02:20.879> about<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.330> build

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
convenient so that's about it for build

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.960 
convenient so that's about it for build
quality<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.170> feels<00:02:22.650> very<00:02:22.950> very<00:02:23.370> good<00:02:23.700> for

quality it feels very very good for

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.610 
quality it feels very very good for
something<00:02:24.330> you'd<00:02:24.450> get<00:02:24.599> for<00:02:24.750> 40<00:02:25.080> bucks<00:02:25.110> but

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
something you'd get for 40 bucks but

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.800 
something you'd get for 40 bucks but
it's<00:02:25.769> definitely<00:02:26.400> not<00:02:26.849> up<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.330> standards

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it's definitely not up to the standards

now<00:02:32.730> I'm<00:02:32.819> really<00:02:33.060> not<00:02:33.150> sure<00:02:33.330> how<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> demo<00:02:33.900> that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.559 
now I'm really not sure how to demo that
one<00:02:34.319> because<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.069> can't<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.430> let<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.330> listen

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
one because I can't just let you listen

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.509 
one because I can't just let you listen
to<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> headphones<00:02:37.260> because<00:02:37.830> I'll<00:02:38.280> be<00:02:38.370> some

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
to the headphones because I'll be some

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
the microphone that I'm using isn't

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.559 
the microphone that I'm using isn't
extremely<00:02:40.140> high<00:02:40.500> quality<00:02:40.610> but<00:02:41.610> anyways<00:02:41.940> these

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
extremely high quality but anyways these

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.869 
extremely high quality but anyways these
are<00:02:42.629> fairly<00:02:43.410> decent<00:02:43.860> sounding<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.519> find<00:02:44.760> it

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
are fairly decent sounding and I find it

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.130 
are fairly decent sounding and I find it
with<00:02:45.150> them<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.390> be<00:02:45.510> completely<00:02:45.930> sufficient

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
with them to be completely sufficient

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.319 
with them to be completely sufficient
for<00:02:46.620> watching<00:02:46.980> videos<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.519> all<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.640> for

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
for watching videos and all that for

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.880 
for watching videos and all that for
watching<00:02:48.660> high-quality<00:02:49.230> music<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.650> probably

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
watching high-quality music you probably

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.720 
watching high-quality music you probably
will<00:02:50.310> feel<00:02:51.019> that<00:02:52.019> they're<00:02:52.170> not<00:02:52.349> as<00:02:52.709> not<00:02:53.549> as

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
will feel that they're not as not as

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.000 
will feel that they're not as not as
powerful<00:02:53.970> not<00:02:54.510> as<00:02:54.690> loud<00:02:54.900> or<00:02:54.959> quite<00:02:55.560> as<00:02:55.680> clear

powerful not as loud or quite as clear

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.470 
powerful not as loud or quite as clear
as<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.310> high-end<00:02:56.610> models<00:02:56.910> as<00:02:57.150> can<00:02:57.390> be

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
as the high-end models as can be

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.539 
as the high-end models as can be
expected<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.739> think<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.069> only<00:02:59.340> really

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
expected but I think you only really

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.190 
expected but I think you only really
noticed<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.420> you're<00:03:00.569> coming<00:03:00.930> straight

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
noticed this if you're coming straight

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.589 
noticed this if you're coming straight
from<00:03:01.470> high-end<00:03:02.010> models<00:03:02.370> because<00:03:03.000> I've<00:03:03.299> never

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
from high-end models because I've never

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.509 
from high-end models because I've never
really<00:03:03.840> used<00:03:03.870> frequently<00:03:04.769> use<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.489> a

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
really used frequently use that is a

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.449 
really used frequently use that is a
pair<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:06.750> $300<00:03:07.410> headphones<00:03:07.799> so<00:03:08.040> for<00:03:08.250> me<00:03:08.340> it

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
pair of to $300 headphones so for me it

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.860 
pair of to $300 headphones so for me it
sounds<00:03:08.670> perfectly<00:03:08.970> fine<00:03:09.209> but<00:03:09.480> if<00:03:09.629> you're

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
sounds perfectly fine but if you're

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.330 
sounds perfectly fine but if you're

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
again if you're an audiophile you're

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.789 
again if you're an audiophile you're
really<00:03:11.579> interested<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.239> sound<00:03:12.420> quality

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
really interested in the sound quality

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.319 
really interested in the sound quality
really<00:03:13.799> don't<00:03:13.980> buy<00:03:14.099> any<00:03:14.280> headphones<00:03:14.910> for<00:03:15.090> 40

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329

able to find one like it again easily if

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.170 
able to find one like it again easily if
you<00:03:37.620> lose<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.190> don't<00:03:38.310> lose<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.549> but<00:03:38.910> again

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
you lose it so don't lose it but again

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.940 
you lose it so don't lose it but again
it<00:03:39.329> just<00:03:39.510> goes<00:03:39.750> into<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.989> standard<00:03:40.349> USB<00:03:40.650> which

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
it just goes into a standard USB which

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.009 
it just goes into a standard USB which
is<00:03:41.099> nice<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.470> convenient<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.680> course<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:45.019> find

is nice and convenient of course I find

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.390 
is nice and convenient of course I find
it<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.230> be<00:03:46.319> useful<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.739> it<00:03:46.799> charges<00:03:46.950> fairly

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it to be useful and it charges fairly

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.860 
it to be useful and it charges fairly
quickly<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.849> battery<00:03:48.150> lasts<00:03:48.510> long

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
quickly and the battery lasts long

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.210 
quickly and the battery lasts long
enough<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:49.260> haven't<00:03:49.590> done<00:03:49.680> significant

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
battery tests on it but maybe well so

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:53.839 
battery tests on it but maybe well so
far<00:03:53.069> I<00:03:53.130> haven't<00:03:53.250> had<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.430> problem<00:03:53.579> with<00:03:53.760> it

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
headphones still I find it useful

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.150 
headphones still I find it useful
because<00:04:15.870> occasionally<00:04:16.289> I<00:04:16.560> want<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.889> use<00:04:17.039> it

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
because occasionally I want to use it

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.069 
because occasionally I want to use it
with<00:04:17.280> my<00:04:17.310> desktop<00:04:17.880> computer<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.810> if<00:04:18.959> I'm

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
with my desktop computer and if I'm

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.599 
with my desktop computer and if I'm
using<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.410> with<00:04:19.530> that<00:04:19.680> then<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.280> Bluetooth

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
using it with that then the Bluetooth

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.029 
using it with that then the Bluetooth
isn't<00:04:20.910> compatible<00:04:21.120> with<00:04:21.389> Windows<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.229> these

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
isn't compatible with Windows so these

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.170 
isn't compatible with Windows so these
haven't<00:04:23.370> figured<00:04:23.580> out<00:04:23.669> how<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.849> get<00:04:24.060> it

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
haven't figured out how to get it

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.240 
haven't figured out how to get it
compatible<00:04:24.419> with<00:04:24.599> Windows<00:04:24.930> yet<00:04:25.169> so

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
compatible with Windows yet so

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.730 
compatible with Windows yet so
that<00:04:26.610> cable<00:04:26.910> makes<00:04:27.210> a<00:04:27.330> nice<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.780> easy<00:04:28.020> way<00:04:28.680> to

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
that cable makes a nice and easy way to

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.460 
that cable makes a nice and easy way to
use<00:04:28.950> those<00:04:29.070> headphones<00:04:29.990> one<00:04:30.990> last<00:04:31.200> thing

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
use those headphones one last thing

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.800 
use those headphones one last thing
these<00:04:31.710> headphones<00:04:31.980> don't<00:04:32.460> fold<00:04:32.880> up<00:04:33.060> flat<00:04:33.480> and

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
these headphones don't fold up flat and

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.680 
these headphones don't fold up flat and
compact<00:04:33.960> some<00:04:34.800> headphones<00:04:35.160> do<00:04:35.820> have<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.420> way<00:04:36.660> to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
compact some headphones do have a way to

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.810 
compact some headphones do have a way to
fold<00:04:37.080> down<00:04:37.260> into<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.590> nice<00:04:37.800> small<00:04:38.130> package<00:04:38.610> so

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
fold down into a nice small package so

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.910 
fold down into a nice small package so
that<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.030> can<00:04:39.210> easily<00:04:39.750> store<00:04:40.200> them<00:04:40.410> or<00:04:40.620> carry

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
that you can easily store them or carry

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.430 
that you can easily store them or carry
them<00:04:41.130> or<00:04:41.250> whatever<00:04:41.400> these<00:04:41.790> these<00:04:42.150> don't<00:04:42.440> so

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
them or whatever these these don't so

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.690 
them or whatever these these don't so
yeah<00:04:43.620> they're<00:04:43.830> not<00:04:43.920> quite<00:04:44.160> as<00:04:44.190> portable<00:04:44.520> as

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
yeah they're not quite as portable as

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.920 
yeah they're not quite as portable as
they<00:04:44.790> could<00:04:44.940> be<00:04:45.060> but<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.450> don't<00:04:45.570> really<00:04:45.720> have<00:04:45.900> a

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
they could be but I don't really have a

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.580
