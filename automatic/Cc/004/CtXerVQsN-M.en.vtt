show you guys this and so we're going to
start<00:00:44.670> off<00:00:44.789> by<00:00:44.820> looking<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> jar<00:00:45.629> which<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
start off by looking at the jar which is

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.990 
start off by looking at the jar which is
probably<00:00:46.890> why<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.100> guys<00:00:47.309> even<00:00:47.489> notice<00:00:47.879> this

probably why you guys even notice this
thing<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> first<00:00:48.360> place<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
thing in the first place so this is the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.160 
thing in the first place so this is the
product<00:00:55.379> itself<00:00:55.610> smeared<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.789> heart<00:00:57.360> pomade

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170

I've no idea what this thing this is a
jar<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.600> probably<00:01:03.780> what<00:01:04.049> caught

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
jar and this is probably what caught

it<00:02:02.500> feels<00:02:02.770> pretty<00:02:02.950> hard<00:02:03.369> but<00:02:04.270> once<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.569> start

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
it feels pretty hard but once you start

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.480 
it feels pretty hard but once you start
scooping<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.200> out<00:02:05.319> is<00:02:05.470> actually<00:02:05.770> not<00:02:06.009> hard<00:02:06.369> at

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
scooping it out is actually not hard at

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.270 
scooping it out is actually not hard at
all<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.810> also<00:02:07.959> smelly<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.709> hands<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.099> not

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
all and also smelly in the hands is not

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.030 
all and also smelly in the hands is not
hard<00:02:09.489> either<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.349> already<00:02:11.620> have<00:02:11.860> like<00:02:11.980> a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
hard either and so I already have like a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.610 
hard either and so I already have like a
one<00:02:12.310> day<00:02:12.489> build<00:02:12.760> up<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:14.230> stuff's<00:02:14.470> pretty

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
one day build up and this stuff's pretty

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.640 
one day build up and this stuff's pretty
heavy<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.900> shouldn't<00:02:16.900> need<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.110> apply<00:02:17.380> much

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
heavy so I shouldn't need to apply much

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.910 
heavy so I shouldn't need to apply much
more<00:02:17.950> else<00:02:18.250> at<00:02:18.549> all<00:02:22.230> but<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.440> notice<00:02:23.769> like

not that's like without a doubt he'll be

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.819

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
stuff this is like actually really

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.640 
stuff this is like actually really
similar<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.239> Lockhart's<00:02:40.930> heavy<00:02:41.109> in<00:02:41.319> terms<00:02:41.500> of

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
similar to Lockhart's heavy in terms of

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.410 
similar to Lockhart's heavy in terms of
the<00:02:41.739> texture<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.280> stuff<00:02:44.760> also<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.180> scent

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
the texture and stuff also the scent

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
gets pretty light when it goes outdoors

it<00:04:18.410> too<00:04:18.560> heavy<00:04:19.840> most<00:04:20.840> definitely

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.520 

alright<00:04:37.620> so<00:04:37.830> with<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.160> sides<00:04:38.430> tucked<00:04:38.790> away<00:04:39.530> go

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
alright so with the sides tucked away go

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:59.290 
alright so with the sides tucked away go
ahead<00:04:40.620> start<00:04:40.889> forming<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.400> pop<00:04:41.580> itself<00:04:42.000> now

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
I think that should do it so go ahead go

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.700 
I think that should do it so go ahead go
through<00:05:02.540> a<00:05:02.570> final<00:05:02.900> inspection<00:05:03.020> of<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.530> hair

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.170 
your side's pretty like nice and tight
the<00:05:18.590> part<00:05:18.830> itself<00:05:19.130> is<00:05:19.340> pretty<00:05:19.520> hard<00:05:19.850> and<00:05:19.970> sharp

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
the part itself is pretty hard and sharp

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.780 
the part itself is pretty hard and sharp
nice<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:21.020> straight<00:05:21.320> but<00:05:22.250> that's<00:05:22.430> just<00:05:22.550> more

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
nice and straight but that's just more

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.390 
nice and straight but that's just more
of<00:05:22.880> my<00:05:23.000> handiwork<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:24.350> pump<00:05:24.620> made<00:05:24.920> the<00:05:25.160> pump

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
of my handiwork the pump made the pump

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.100 
of my handiwork the pump made the pump
itself<00:05:25.760> is<00:05:26.060> actually<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.420> pretty<00:05:26.690> good<00:05:26.870> height

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
itself is actually a pretty good height

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.350 
itself is actually a pretty good height
it<00:05:27.380> sound<00:05:27.740> like<00:05:27.830> an<00:05:27.980> average<00:05:28.250> or<00:05:28.670> so<00:05:28.850> high<00:05:29.090> and

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
it sound like an average or so high and

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.570 
it sound like an average or so high and
also<00:05:30.140> I<00:05:30.590> think<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.920> might<00:05:31.100> have<00:05:31.130> put<00:05:31.370> too<00:05:31.400> much

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
also I think I might have put too much

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.160 
also I think I might have put too much
plumbing<00:05:32.000> in<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:32.360> so<00:05:32.480> it's<00:05:32.630> time<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.870> weigh<00:05:33.020> it

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
plumbing in and so it's time to weigh it

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.420 
plumbing in and so it's time to weigh it
down<00:05:33.550> but<00:05:34.550> overall<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:35.980> already<00:05:36.980> looks<00:05:37.190> pretty

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
down but overall I already looks pretty

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
down but overall I already looks pretty
nice<00:05:37.670> and<00:05:38.000> you'll<00:05:38.750> notice<00:05:39.110> my<00:05:39.770> DA<00:05:40.300> should<00:05:41.300> be

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
nice and you'll notice my DA should be

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.430 
nice and you'll notice my DA should be
pretty<00:05:41.690> clean<00:05:42.050> and<00:05:42.290> tucked<00:05:43.010> away<00:05:44.260> and<00:05:45.260> so

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
pretty clean and tucked away and so

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.950 
pretty clean and tucked away and so
overall<00:05:46.480> everything<00:05:47.480> looks<00:05:47.630> pretty<00:05:47.720> good

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
overall everything looks pretty good

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.050

heavy<00:06:20.930> pump<00:06:21.290> but<00:06:21.860> I<00:06:21.890> would<00:06:22.130> actually<00:06:22.280> say<00:06:22.490> it's

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
heavy pump but I would actually say it's

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.310 
heavy pump but I would actually say it's
not<00:06:22.730> as<00:06:22.940> heavy<00:06:23.120> as<00:06:23.210> like<00:06:23.480> Lockhart's<00:06:23.990> heavy

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
not as heavy as like Lockhart's heavy

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.370 
not as heavy as like Lockhart's heavy
but<00:06:24.980> kind<00:06:25.160> of<00:06:25.220> like<00:06:25.340> a<00:06:25.570> hybrid<00:06:26.570> between<00:06:26.930> the

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
but kind of like a hybrid between the

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.430 
but kind of like a hybrid between the
goon<00:06:27.620> grease<00:06:27.890> and<00:06:28.130> the<00:06:28.700> heavy<00:06:29.170> so<00:06:30.170> it's<00:06:30.290> like<00:06:30.380> a

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
goon grease and the heavy so it's like a

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.810 
goon grease and the heavy so it's like a
pretty<00:06:30.650> balanced<00:06:31.040> pomade<00:06:31.340> you<00:06:31.490> get<00:06:31.640> like<00:06:31.790> a

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
pretty balanced pomade you get like a

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.420 
pretty balanced pomade you get like a
light<00:06:32.090> shining<00:06:32.510> out<00:06:32.570> of<00:06:32.750> it<00:06:32.930> and<00:06:33.170> a<00:06:33.920> heavy<00:06:34.130> hold

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
light shining out of it and a heavy hold

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.700 
light shining out of it and a heavy hold
and<00:06:34.670> definitely<00:06:35.210> your<00:06:36.110> hair<00:06:36.260> is<00:06:36.350> not<00:06:36.500> moving
