figure<00:00:14.379> number<00:00:14.650> 61<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:15.219> I<00:00:15.580> thought<00:00:15.820> I<00:00:15.849> would

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
figure number 61 and I thought I would

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.460 
figure number 61 and I thought I would
review<00:00:16.420> these<00:00:16.630> two<00:00:16.810> together<00:00:17.170> obviously

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
review these two together obviously

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.730 
review these two together obviously
because<00:00:18.220> they're<00:00:18.400> always<00:00:18.580> in<00:00:18.730> a<00:00:18.939> pair<00:00:19.240> and<00:00:19.570> you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
because they're always in a pair and you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.230 
because they're always in a pair and you
can<00:00:20.740> see<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.220> differences<00:00:21.730> here<00:00:21.970> obviously

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
can see the differences here obviously

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.450 
can see the differences here obviously
Latios<00:00:23.050> is<00:00:23.349> going<00:00:23.590> to<00:00:23.680> be<00:00:23.829> a<00:00:23.860> little<00:00:24.310> bit

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
Latios is going to be a little bit

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.859 
Latios is going to be a little bit
bigger<00:00:24.700> than<00:00:24.910> lodi<00:00:25.210> ass

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
bigger than lodi ass

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.049 
bigger than lodi ass
but<00:00:26.680> for<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:26.980> most<00:00:27.130> part<00:00:27.489> they<00:00:27.669> look<00:00:27.880> to<00:00:28.029> be

00:00:28.049 --> 00:00:28.059 
but for the most part they look to be

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:31.080 
but for the most part they look to be
very<00:00:28.570> similar<00:00:28.899> in<00:00:29.230> pose<00:00:29.559> and<00:00:29.980> everything<00:00:30.910> like

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
very similar in pose and everything like

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.209 
very similar in pose and everything like
that<00:00:31.119> so<00:00:31.570> I<00:00:32.020> think<00:00:32.410> I'm<00:00:32.680> going<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:33.010> go<00:00:33.100> ahead

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
that so I think I'm going to go ahead

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:53.090 
that so I think I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:33.670> start<00:00:34.059> with<00:00:34.270> Latios<00:00:34.930> first

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.889 

all<00:00:54.100> right<00:00:54.339> so<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:54.670> completely<00:00:55.239> destroyed<00:00:55.600> the

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
all right so I completely destroyed the

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.779 
all right so I completely destroyed the
packaging<00:00:56.500> there<00:00:56.620> sometimes<00:00:57.129> that<00:00:57.339> packaging

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
packaging there sometimes that packaging

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:59.520 
packaging there sometimes that packaging
just<00:00:57.820> really<00:00:58.449> gets<00:00:58.659> on<00:00:58.839> your<00:00:58.960> nerves<00:00:59.019> after

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
just really gets on your nerves after

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.469 
just really gets on your nerves after
you<00:01:00.039> have<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.309> open<00:01:00.670> it<00:01:00.760> for<00:01:00.909> a<00:01:00.969> while<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.359> you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
you have to open it for a while and you

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.740 
you have to open it for a while and you
have<00:01:01.659> a<00:01:01.870> pretty<00:01:02.350> crappy<00:01:02.649> pair<00:01:02.979> of<00:01:03.100> scissors

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
have a pretty crappy pair of scissors

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.690 
have a pretty crappy pair of scissors
but<00:01:04.750> let's<00:01:04.930> take<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.409> look<00:01:05.680> at<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.159> standard

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
but let's take a look at the standard

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.700 
but let's take a look at the standard
leaflet<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:08.560> has<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.770> QR<00:01:09.159> code<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.810> let's

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
leaflet just has a QR code and let's

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.130 
leaflet just has a QR code and let's
look<00:01:12.009> at<00:01:12.280> Latios<00:01:12.880> now

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.850 

and<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.850> Latios<00:01:22.420> looks<00:01:22.780> pretty<00:01:23.140> good<00:01:23.470> here<00:01:23.830> I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
and so Latios looks pretty good here I

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.580 
and so Latios looks pretty good here I
really<00:01:24.280> love<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.850> deep<00:01:25.569> blue<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:25.869> they<00:01:26.259> used

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
really love the deep blue that they used

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.219 
really love the deep blue that they used
for<00:01:26.800> his<00:01:27.580> wing<00:01:27.850> his<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.509> back<00:01:28.690> part<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.170> his

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
for his wing his the back part of his

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.219 
for his wing his the back part of his
body<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.860> wings<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.909> really<00:01:31.539> stands<00:01:32.080> out

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
body the wings it really stands out

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.139 
body the wings it really stands out
there<00:01:32.590> there's<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.460> copyright<00:01:33.970> information

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
there there's the copyright information

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.320 
there there's the copyright information
I<00:01:35.069> don't<00:01:36.069> really<00:01:36.280> like<00:01:36.549> that<00:01:36.580> that's<00:01:36.940> written

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
I don't really like that that's written

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.539 
I don't really like that that's written
and<00:01:37.659> gray<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.200> can<00:01:38.590> kind<00:01:38.799> of<00:01:38.860> really<00:01:39.069> see<00:01:39.399> that

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
and gray you can kind of really see that

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.880 
and gray you can kind of really see that
that's<00:01:39.789> very<00:01:40.060> obvious<00:01:40.299> seeing<00:01:40.990> his<00:01:41.170> China<00:01:41.590> on

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
that's very obvious seeing his China on

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.490 
that's very obvious seeing his China on
the<00:01:42.039> side<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.549> there

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
the side of it there

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.380 
the side of it there
it<00:01:44.500> looks<00:01:44.679> like<00:01:44.860> my<00:01:45.159> Latios<00:01:45.759> has<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.119> little

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
it looks like my Latios has a little

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.480 
it looks like my Latios has a little
extra<00:01:46.840> piece<00:01:47.110> on<00:01:47.350> his<00:01:47.530> tail<00:01:47.890> here<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.310> don't

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
extra piece on his tail here I don't

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.279 
extra piece on his tail here I don't
think<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:49.030> should<00:01:49.240> be<00:01:49.270> here<00:01:49.630> it's<00:01:49.780> not<00:01:50.020> on

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
think that should be here it's not on

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.740 
think that should be here it's not on
the<00:01:50.409> other<00:01:50.590> side<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.369> there<00:01:54.640> he<00:01:54.819> is<00:01:54.850> from<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
the other side but there he is from the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.929 
the other side but there he is from the
back<00:01:56.909> he<00:01:57.909> does<00:01:58.060> have<00:01:58.240> nice<00:01:58.420> sculpting<00:01:59.229> I<00:01:59.939> like

China is written in grey it's painted in
with<00:02:34.090> grey<00:02:34.450> because<00:02:35.079> you<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.470> really<00:02:35.799> see

with grey because you can really see

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.800 
with grey because you can really see
that<00:02:36.130> that's<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.760> bit<00:02:36.970> annoying<00:02:37.359> you'll<00:02:37.690> have

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
that that's a bit annoying you'll have

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.289 
that that's a bit annoying you'll have
to<00:02:37.959> display<00:02:38.350> him<00:02:38.500> from<00:02:38.709> this<00:02:38.859> side<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:40.060> that

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
to display him from this side if that

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.680 
to display him from this side if that
really<00:02:40.630> bothers<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.670> unfortunately

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
really bothers you and unfortunately

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.629 
really bothers you and unfortunately
Latios<00:02:44.100> doesn't<00:02:45.100> come<00:02:45.310> with<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> stand<00:02:47.639> so

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
Latios doesn't come with a stand so

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.910 
Latios doesn't come with a stand so
you'll<00:02:49.359> just<00:02:49.420> have<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.230> have<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.620> get

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
you'll just have to you have to get

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.220 
you'll just have to you have to get
creative<00:02:51.130> with<00:02:51.609> how<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.790> display<00:02:52.239> him<00:02:52.660> he<00:02:53.109> is

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
creative with how you display him he is

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.660 
creative with how you display him he is
certainly<00:02:53.560> light<00:02:53.829> enough<00:02:54.069> or<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.310> could<00:02:54.489> tie

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
certainly light enough or you could tie

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.670 
certainly light enough or you could tie
him<00:02:54.819> up<00:02:54.880> with<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> string<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.810> have<00:02:55.989> him<00:02:56.230> you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
him up with a string and have him you

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.460 
him up with a string and have him you
know<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.980> flight<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:58.359> unfortunately<00:02:59.260> he'll

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
know in flight but unfortunately he'll

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.990 
know in flight but unfortunately he'll
just<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.799> to<00:02:59.950> rest<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.489> ground<00:03:00.760> because

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
just have to rest on the ground because

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.630 
just have to rest on the ground because
they<00:03:01.239> did<00:03:01.420> not<00:03:01.629> give<00:03:02.049> him<00:03:02.379> a<00:03:02.590> stand<00:03:03.370> or

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
they did not give him a stand or

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.180 
they did not give him a stand or
anything

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
anything

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.320 
anything
that<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:06.140> could<00:03:06.320> not<00:03:07.190> even<00:03:07.400> really<00:03:07.790> stand<00:03:08.150> him

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
that you could not even really stand him

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.720 
that you could not even really stand him
up<00:03:08.450> because<00:03:08.750> his<00:03:09.230> tail<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.860> too<00:03:10.160> too<00:03:10.640> many

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
up because his tail is too too many

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.150 
up because his tail is too too many
ridges<00:03:11.090> but<00:03:11.630> well<00:03:12.380> there<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.770> latias<00:03:16.840> and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
paint that's really annoying but there's

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.680 
paint that's really annoying but there's
the<00:03:59.670> copyright<00:04:00.210> on<00:04:00.390> her<00:04:00.540> wing<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:02.690> latias

the copyright on her wing and latias

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.810 
the copyright on her wing and latias
actually<00:04:04.350> looks<00:04:04.560> like<00:04:04.710> she<00:04:04.890> has<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> bit<00:04:05.610> of

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
actually looks like she has a bit of

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.110 
actually looks like she has a bit of
dirt<00:04:06.210> on<00:04:06.390> her<00:04:07.020> her<00:04:07.470> paint<00:04:07.890> here<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.490> doesn't<00:04:08.850> it

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
dirt on her her paint here it doesn't it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.710 
dirt on her her paint here it doesn't it
doesn't<00:04:09.960> match<00:04:10.170> Latios<00:04:11.010> really<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.910> don't<00:04:12.540> know

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
doesn't match Latios really I don't know

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.780 
doesn't match Latios really I don't know
if<00:04:12.810> this<00:04:12.960> if<00:04:13.230> my<00:04:13.440> camera<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:14.190> pick<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.460> up<00:04:14.550> here

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
if this if my camera can pick it up here

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.660 
if this if my camera can pick it up here
but<00:04:15.000> there<00:04:15.150> seems<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.510> be<00:04:15.570> like<00:04:15.930> some<00:04:16.200> dirt<00:04:16.670> at

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
but there seems to be like some dirt at

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.590 
but there seems to be like some dirt at
least<00:04:17.970> along<00:04:18.330> her<00:04:18.510> neck<00:04:18.780> right<00:04:18.810> here

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.500 

so<00:04:22.110> it's<00:04:22.230> kind<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.530> like<00:04:22.680> almost<00:04:23.010> blue<00:04:23.730> intent

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
so it's kind of like almost blue intent

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.300 
so it's kind of like almost blue intent
here<00:04:25.440> they<00:04:25.590> are<00:04:25.740> together<00:04:27.800> hope<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:28.920> guys<00:04:29.070> can

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
here they are together hope you guys can

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.240 
here they are together hope you guys can
see<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.670> difference<00:04:29.700> there<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:30.600> latias<00:04:31.250> I

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
see the difference there but latias I

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.250 
see the difference there but latias I
deftly<00:04:32.970> think<00:04:33.390> I<00:04:33.420> like<00:04:33.600> Latios<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.320> lot<00:04:34.560> better

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
deftly think I like Latios a lot better

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.660 
deftly think I like Latios a lot better
she<00:04:37.260> doesn't<00:04:37.500> have<00:04:37.590> any<00:04:37.710> extra<00:04:37.920> piece<00:04:38.340> on<00:04:38.520> her

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
she doesn't have any extra piece on her

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.110 
she doesn't have any extra piece on her
tail<00:04:38.910> like<00:04:38.940> like<00:04:39.450> Latios<00:04:39.990> does

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.110 

but<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.660> she<00:04:45.500> they<00:04:46.010> made<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.430> figure<00:04:46.790> so

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
but and she they made the figure so

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.610 
but and she they made the figure so
small<00:04:47.510> they<00:04:47.810> should<00:04:47.990> have<00:04:48.080> made<00:04:48.230> it<00:04:48.320> at<00:04:48.440> least

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
small they should have made it at least

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.680 
small they should have made it at least
a<00:04:48.770> little<00:04:48.800> bigger<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.640> know<00:04:49.940> there<00:04:50.300> is<00:04:50.390> a<00:04:50.420> size

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
a little bigger I know there is a size

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.420 
a little bigger I know there is a size
difference<00:04:50.960> between<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.530> two<00:04:51.830> but<00:04:52.040> it's<00:04:52.280> a

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
difference between the two but it's a

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.170 
difference between the two but it's a
little<00:04:52.730> too<00:04:53.030> much<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.510> size<00:04:53.720> difference<00:04:55.180> but

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
little too much of a size difference but

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.020 
little too much of a size difference but
uh<00:04:56.240> her<00:04:57.230> eyes<00:04:57.440> look<00:04:57.890> really<00:04:58.250> good<00:04:58.460> I<00:04:58.490> like<00:04:58.850> the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
uh her eyes look really good I like the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.130 
uh her eyes look really good I like the
yellow<00:04:59.360> paint<00:04:59.660> in<00:04:59.900> her<00:05:00.170> eyes<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:01.100> her<00:05:02.140> blue

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
yellow paint in her eyes and her blue
triangle<00:05:03.770> looks<00:05:03.980> nice<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:06.470> sculpting<00:05:07.010> is

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
triangle looks nice and the sculpting is

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.640 
triangle looks nice and the sculpting is
is<00:05:07.370> well<00:05:07.670> done<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.300> little<00:05:08.600> better<00:05:08.870> than<00:05:09.110> Latios

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
is well done a little better than Latios

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.160 
is well done a little better than Latios
I<00:05:09.950> think<00:05:10.280> doesn't<00:05:11.060> have<00:05:11.300> any<00:05:11.450> extra<00:05:11.570> pieces

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
I think doesn't have any extra pieces

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.320 
I think doesn't have any extra pieces
like<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.350> said<00:05:12.740> her<00:05:13.310> hands<00:05:13.580> look<00:05:13.760> really<00:05:14.090> good

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
like I said her hands look really good

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.900 
like I said her hands look really good
but<00:05:15.080> that's<00:05:15.320> just<00:05:15.620> unfortunate<00:05:16.490> about<00:05:16.730> the

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
but that's just unfortunate about the

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.270 
but that's just unfortunate about the
paint<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.390> paint<00:05:17.930> they<00:05:18.080> used<00:05:18.290> they<00:05:18.740> chose<00:05:19.010> for

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
paint the paint they used they chose for

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.520 
paint the paint they used they chose for
her<00:05:19.430> her<00:05:19.820> neck<00:05:20.180> here<00:05:20.570> that<00:05:20.750> just<00:05:21.110> it<00:05:21.290> doesn't

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
her her neck here that just it doesn't

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.060 
her her neck here that just it doesn't
look<00:05:21.800> right<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.450> definitely<00:05:23.450> like<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:24.410> Latios

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
look right I definitely like the Latios

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.430 
look right I definitely like the Latios
paint<00:05:25.910> choice<00:05:26.150> butter<00:05:26.510> and<00:05:26.840> he<00:05:27.020> doesn't<00:05:27.230> look

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
paint choice butter and he doesn't look

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.370 
paint choice butter and he doesn't look
like<00:05:27.620> he<00:05:27.800> has<00:05:27.980> dirt<00:05:28.370> on<00:05:28.580> him<00:05:28.880> like<00:05:29.390> latias<00:05:29.930> does

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
like he has dirt on him like latias does

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.830 
like he has dirt on him like latias does
I<00:05:30.590> would<00:05:30.830> I'm<00:05:31.130> probably<00:05:31.520> I<00:05:32.090> can<00:05:32.630> probably

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
I would I'm probably I can probably

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.520 
I would I'm probably I can probably
remove<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.770> with<00:05:33.980> a<00:05:34.010> little<00:05:34.340> bit<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.550> acetone

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
remove it with a little bit of acetone

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.080 
remove it with a little bit of acetone
but<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.560> really<00:05:37.070> you<00:05:37.250> shouldn't<00:05:37.520> have<00:05:37.610> to<00:05:37.940> do

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
but I really you shouldn't have to do

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.120 
but I really you shouldn't have to do
that<00:05:38.270> in<00:05:38.420> the<00:05:38.510> first<00:05:38.720> place<00:05:39.050> but<00:05:39.560> this<00:05:39.920> this

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
that in the first place but this this

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.370 
that in the first place but this this
figure<00:05:40.550> looks<00:05:40.790> like<00:05:40.970> it<00:05:41.090> came<00:05:41.300> to<00:05:41.510> me<00:05:41.660> not<00:05:41.930> new

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
figure looks like it came to me not new

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.860 
figure looks like it came to me not new
is<00:05:42.680> what<00:05:43.250> it<00:05:43.370> looks<00:05:43.550> like<00:05:43.790> like<00:05:44.360> somebody<00:05:44.720> had

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
is what it looks like like somebody had

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.280 
is what it looks like like somebody had
played<00:05:45.200> with<00:05:45.230> it<00:05:45.500> previously<00:05:46.840> we'll<00:05:47.840> just<00:05:48.050> set

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
played with it previously we'll just set

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.830 
played with it previously we'll just set
latias<00:05:48.770> down<00:05:49.250> here<00:05:49.520> hers<00:05:49.760> she's<00:05:50.270> even<00:05:50.660> more

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
latias down here hers she's even more

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.600 
latias down here hers she's even more
unfortunate<00:05:51.500> because<00:05:51.590> she<00:05:51.800> just<00:05:51.980> faces<00:05:52.490> the

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
unfortunate because she just faces the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.330 
unfortunate because she just faces the
ground<00:05:52.880> when<00:05:53.210> you<00:05:53.300> put<00:05:53.510> her<00:05:53.630> down<00:05:53.660> she<00:05:54.340> also

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
ground when you put her down she also

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.850 
ground when you put her down she also
does<00:05:55.730> not<00:05:55.850> come<00:05:56.120> with<00:05:56.270> a<00:05:56.300> stand<00:05:56.660> so<00:05:57.140> she<00:05:57.710> just

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
does not come with a stand so she just

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.710 
does not come with a stand so she just
kind<00:05:58.100> of<00:05:58.160> face-planting<00:05:59.060> into<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.480> ground

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
kind of face-planting into the ground

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:09.280 
kind of face-planting into the ground
there<00:06:05.440> but<00:06:06.440> here<00:06:06.830> they<00:06:06.950> are<00:06:07.160> together<00:06:07.960> just<00:06:08.960> do

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
there but here they are together just do

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:16.150 
there but here they are together just do
a<00:06:09.680> little<00:06:10.370> size<00:06:10.669> comparison<00:06:10.960> here<00:06:15.160> so

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
a little size comparison here so

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.920 
a little size comparison here so
hopefully<00:06:16.580> you<00:06:16.730> can<00:06:16.760> see<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.510> difference

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
hopefully you can see the difference

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.900 
hopefully you can see the difference
there

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.340 

latias<00:06:22.910> is<00:06:23.210> definitely<00:06:23.780> a<00:06:23.810> little<00:06:24.200> bit

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
latias is definitely a little bit

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.090 
latias is definitely a little bit
smaller

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
smaller

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
smaller
they<00:06:26.030> made<00:06:26.240> her<00:06:26.360> wings<00:06:26.660> really<00:06:27.260> small<00:06:28.120> but

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
they made her wings really small but

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.670 
they made her wings really small but
they<00:06:29.720> look<00:06:29.930> good<00:06:30.110> together

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
they look good together

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.130 
they look good together
it's<00:06:30.919> just<00:06:31.520> I<00:06:31.700> can't<00:06:32.270> I<00:06:32.360> can't<00:06:32.660> get<00:06:32.780> over<00:06:33.020> the

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
it's just I can't I can't get over the

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.870 
it's just I can't I can't get over the
paint<00:06:33.410> choice<00:06:33.650> that<00:06:33.890> they<00:06:34.010> use<00:06:34.220> for<00:06:34.460> latias

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
paint choice that they use for latias

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.100 
paint choice that they use for latias
it's<00:06:35.360> just<00:06:35.630> terrible<00:06:37.390> but<00:06:38.390> there<00:06:38.780> they<00:06:38.930> are

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
it's just terrible but there they are

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.880 
it's just terrible but there they are
together<00:06:39.550> and<00:06:41.290> so<00:06:42.290> I<00:06:42.320> would<00:06:42.710> definitely

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
together and so I would definitely

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.490 
together and so I would definitely
recommend<00:06:43.220> Latios<00:06:44.150> I<00:06:44.540> think<00:06:44.750> Latios<00:06:45.200> looks

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
recommend Latios I think Latios looks

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.909 
recommend Latios I think Latios looks
great<00:06:45.860> I<00:06:46.070> really<00:06:46.730> love<00:06:46.970> this<00:06:47.210> figure<00:06:47.660> -<00:06:48.500> you

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
great I really love this figure - you

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.529 
great I really love this figure - you
know<00:06:49.010> the<00:06:49.190> extra<00:06:49.520> piece<00:06:49.700> and<00:06:49.940> the<00:06:50.000> China<00:06:50.270> I

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
know the extra piece and the China I

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.000 
know the extra piece and the China I
think<00:06:50.570> he<00:06:50.870> looks<00:06:51.050> great<00:06:51.229> from<00:06:51.650> this<00:06:51.770> side<00:06:51.979> you

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
think he looks great from this side you

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.219 
think he looks great from this side you
can't<00:06:52.340> tell<00:06:52.550> anything<00:06:52.970> is<00:06:53.090> wrong<00:06:53.270> and<00:06:53.630> if<00:06:54.080> you

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
can't tell anything is wrong and if you

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:55.660 
can't tell anything is wrong and if you
can<00:06:54.470> display<00:06:54.919> it<00:06:55.010> in<00:06:55.280> a<00:06:55.370> way

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
can display it in a way

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.390 
can display it in a way
a<00:06:56.440> that<00:06:57.440> you<00:06:57.680> know<00:06:57.710> he<00:06:57.950> kind<00:06:58.070> of<00:06:58.160> looks<00:06:58.340> like

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
a that you know he kind of looks like

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.310 
a that you know he kind of looks like
he's<00:06:58.580> flying<00:06:58.820> that<00:06:59.330> would<00:06:59.480> look<00:06:59.600> great

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
he's flying that would look great

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.250 
he's flying that would look great
but<00:07:01.100> I<00:07:01.340> don't<00:07:01.550> think<00:07:01.640> I'd<00:07:01.850> recommend<00:07:02.360> latias<00:07:02.930> I

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260 
but I don't think I'd recommend latias I

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.660 
but I don't think I'd recommend latias I
just<00:07:03.560> really<00:07:03.860> don't<00:07:03.980> like<00:07:04.160> the<00:07:04.310> paint<00:07:04.550> they

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
just really don't like the paint they

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.240 
just really don't like the paint they
use<00:07:04.880> for<00:07:05.180> her<00:07:05.300> neck<00:07:05.600> she<00:07:05.960> looks<00:07:06.170> dirty<00:07:06.470> and<00:07:06.890> I

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
use for her neck she looks dirty and I

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.380 
use for her neck she looks dirty and I
really<00:07:07.520> think<00:07:07.730> they<00:07:07.850> should<00:07:07.880> have<00:07:08.060> made<00:07:08.150> the

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390 
really think they should have made the

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.020
