trying to really bulldoze and you've got

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.499 
trying to really bulldoze and you've got
a<00:01:26.130> bulldog<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:26.820> you're<00:01:27.210> trying<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
you're the authority figure and not them

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
you're the authority figure and not them
and<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.600> problem<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.409> that

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
and the problem with that is that that

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.640 
and the problem with that is that that
is<00:01:34.979> much<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.759> established<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.439> much

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
is much more established that it's much

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.950 
is much more established that it's much
bigger<00:01:37.920> than<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:39.060> quite<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> task

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
bigger than you and it's quite a task

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.219 
bigger than you and it's quite a task
this<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.040> David<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.700> Goliath<00:01:42.229> except

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
this is kind of David and Goliath except

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.289 
this is kind of David and Goliath except
in<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.380> case<00:01:43.530> David<00:01:44.689> loses<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:47.299> it's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
in this case David loses so it's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.359 
in this case David loses so it's
important<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> look<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.649> different<00:01:50.009> tactic

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
important to look at a different tactic

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.770 
important to look at a different tactic
you're<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> you're<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.659> to

you're not going to you're not going to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.330 
you're not going to you're not going to
bring<00:01:51.930> down<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> system<00:01:52.530> you're<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.159> going

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
bring down the system you're not going

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.240 
bring down the system you're not going
to<00:01:53.990> you're<00:01:54.990> not<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.799> able<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
to you're not going to be able to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.219 
to you're not going to be able to
overcome<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:57.000> thing<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.689> really<00:01:57.930> want

overcome this thing that you really want
to<00:01:58.290> overcome<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.369> reason<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.880> is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
to overcome and the reason for that is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
to overcome and the reason for that is
not<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:01.110> you're<00:02:01.229> not<00:02:01.259> good<00:02:01.380> enough<00:02:01.560> or

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
because you're incorrect but you're

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.740 
because you're incorrect but you're
coming<00:02:05.009> added<00:02:05.369> from<00:02:05.610> an<00:02:05.790> aggressive<00:02:06.329> point<00:02:06.570> of
