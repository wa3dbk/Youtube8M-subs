00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.560
 And then the tip of today is then how 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.980
 dismantle the ford focus door liner 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.260
 in the first generation it 's very quiet 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.460
 first you get some key in 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.920
 l format and looking back here to read 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.430
 is selling in a hole you put the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:27.390
 O key so when you get this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:30.029
 force if you can only get it out here 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.820
 then with a key if you pull 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:39.930
 these screws and this one for power 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:55.440
 have access to all the screws here are 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:57.300
 of the type p p h2s intermediate that there is a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.980
 Screw here is the only one like that. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.390
 you'll need it 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.430
 the shape of his head is different 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.899
 so you have to score and bolts it is 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.680
 different from all its unique 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.610
 way later then you have to take 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.840
 Be careful because here I have a lock that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.040
 he thinks he has to pull a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.030
 little side look there after you pull 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.850
 enjoy before doing this here too 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.150
 There's goose bone, it 'll fit the people there. 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:36.000
 Had here left after coming back here 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:39.030
 I only have a whip, a girl will not 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.890
 said he pulled a button over here. 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.890
 button he comes here 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.980
 has also shown that they hold them 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.940
 will lose these latches here 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.760
 here is another one and that here if you 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.290
 pull the liberal button over here for you 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.690
 make boot can play videos in case 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.550
 necessary since the low during and 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.730
 then shoot up which is more 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.420
 easy and last to be able to jump out 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.060
 of doors 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.730
 You have total six screws two of 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.630
 each side of the door in two here 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.730
 2 other side in two down status 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.230
 here is a little more complicated 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.250
 or do you have to use a phillips 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.160
 I enjoyed it after dropping them here or 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.740
 using a key that is not the one that has 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.850
 that work there for you to take 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.380
 the screw 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.720
 but out the door you have to 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.080
 will not have another 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.080
 different 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.440
 It's like I said so do not give up. 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.430
 electric glass and a new excuse 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.590
 You're going to have to do a procedure. 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.730
 that a seat the first time is well 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.150
 boring to do after you get the hang of it 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.530
 Calm down, you'll have to stand and pray. 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.170
 because the other person standing in the doorway 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.420
 Do not have inverted here, do it in the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.970
 fox case remove that finish 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.140
 there you will have access here as the key 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.840
 very thin crack 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.790
 you try to find that the ring has a 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.280
 lock it you'll push it back 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.320
 this is the journalists and half fulfilled 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.320
 It's more upsetting the kibon here. 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.799
 the sense of sewer becomes easier 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:51.350
 the landfill I have done this several times 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.600
 supporting here already famous do not tire up 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.460
 him in the middle 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.020
 pt has already left now has since 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.420
 O left here this question and the latch of O 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:11.330
 presence mounts her so not to have 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:12.950
 then lets let it come in that way until 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.290
 because it is easier to sew waste 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.760
 Then you do not have it, and soon you 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.310
 You did not even shop to fit in the 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.560
 game not lose goals and pepe and no 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.410
 forget the sense of riding then it is 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.270
 that part in and then now 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.120
 to ride again you just fit everything 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.530
 push pushes and sees it unless 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.450
 staying in place already leaves everything for not 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.450
 miss this finish
