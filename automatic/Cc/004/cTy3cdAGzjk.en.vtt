00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
is what this board has supports lots of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510 
is what this board has supports lots of
memory<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.020> gigs<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:37.950> see<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> memory

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520

on there and this is using a 40
nanometer<00:00:42.149> architecture<00:00:42.750> CPU<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> great

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
nanometer architecture CPU it's a great

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.250 
nanometer architecture CPU it's a great
tiny<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.070> dual-core<00:00:45.000> 1.6<00:00:45.719> give<00:00:45.960> your<00:00:46.079> hertz

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
tiny one dual-core 1.6 give your hertz

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.860 
tiny one dual-core 1.6 give your hertz
it's<00:00:46.620> got<00:00:46.800> some<00:00:47.039> level<00:00:47.370> 2<00:00:47.610> cache<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.420> it's

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
it's got some level 2 cache on it it's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.229 
it's got some level 2 cache on it it's
got<00:00:49.020> an<00:00:49.170> integrated<00:00:49.500> refused<00:00:50.370> video

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
got an integrated refused video

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.439 
got an integrated refused video
processing<00:00:52.550> core<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.030> well<00:00:54.059> so

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
processing core on there as well so

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.139 
processing core on there as well so
you're<00:00:54.600> gonna<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.930> some<00:00:55.039> some<00:00:56.149> video

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you're gonna have some some video

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.349 
you're gonna have some some video
support<00:00:58.070> integrated<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.520> board<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.090> you

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
support integrated on this board so you

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.790 
support integrated on this board so you
don't<00:01:00.510> need<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.870> necessarily<00:01:01.020> install<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
don't need to necessarily install a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.139 
don't need to necessarily install a
separate<00:01:02.160> video<00:01:02.309> card<00:01:02.640> even<00:01:02.879> though<00:01:02.969> this

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
separate video card even though this

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.770 
separate video card even though this
board<00:01:03.449> does<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.960> PCI<00:01:04.830> Express<00:01:05.090> 16x<00:01:06.090> slot

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
board does have a PCI Express 16x slot

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.730 
board does have a PCI Express 16x slot
on<00:01:07.049> there<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.490> video<00:01:08.760> card<00:01:09.740> options

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
on there the video card options

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.250 
on there the video card options
basically<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.610> would<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.720> would<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:12.960> without<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
basically I would I would do without I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.539 
basically I would I would do without I
would<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.710> use<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.790> integrated<00:01:15.630> or<00:01:15.840> fused

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
would just use this integrated or fused

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.800 
would just use this integrated or fused
processor<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> video<00:01:18.090> which<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.659> more

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
processor for the video which is more

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.469 
processor for the video which is more
than<00:01:18.960> enough<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.439> watch<00:01:19.619> your<00:01:19.920> HD<00:01:20.430> videos<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
than enough to watch your HD videos you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.810 
than enough to watch your HD videos you
know<00:01:21.570> doing<00:01:21.960> some<00:01:22.200> decoding<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:23.070> playing

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
know doing some decoding there playing

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.510 
know doing some decoding there playing
some<00:01:24.090> games<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.600> low<00:01:24.840> settings<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.890> really

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
some games on low settings that's really

little thing as you can see what
sapphire<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.979> done<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.659> they've

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
sapphire is done here on this is they've

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.580 
sapphire is done here on this is they've

done away with the regular DDR memory

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.340 
done away with the regular DDR memory
slots<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.369> put<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.670> these<00:01:59.790> som<00:02:00.540> slots<00:02:00.930> instead

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
slots and put in these som slots instead

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.670 
slots and put in these som slots instead
because<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.399> see<00:02:02.579> these<00:02:02.700> tiny<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:03.680> memory

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
because you see these tiny little memory

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.560 
because you see these tiny little memory
slots<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.700> bit<00:02:05.790> more<00:02:05.939> expensive<00:02:06.299> on

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.449 
slots a little bit more expensive on
average<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.140> guess<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.619> than<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> regular

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
average I guess then than the regular

that<00:02:10.920> way<00:02:11.099> and

that way and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.780 
that way and
added<00:02:12.260> some<00:02:12.470> more<00:02:12.590> SATA<00:02:12.950> connectors<00:02:13.520> at<00:02:13.700> the

added some more SATA connectors at the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.660 
added some more SATA connectors at the
back<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.870> that's<00:02:15.380> pretty<00:02:15.620> nice<00:02:15.800> in<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.580> middle

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
back so that's pretty nice in the middle

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
back so that's pretty nice in the middle
you've<00:02:16.970> got<00:02:17.210> your<00:02:18.250> APU<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.970> processing

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
you've got your APU so the processing

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.210 
you've got your APU so the processing
unit<00:02:20.990> is<00:02:21.200> right<00:02:21.680> there<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.010> center

can play on some games just keep in mind
that<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.340> like<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.730> netbook<00:03:59.239> type<00:03:59.570> of

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
that this is like a netbook type of

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.020 
that this is like a netbook type of
board<00:04:00.110> right<00:04:00.500> something<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.160> would<00:04:01.310> use

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
board right something that you would use

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.590 
board right something that you would use
for<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.780> netbook<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:04.060> what<00:04:05.060> would<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.270> install

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
for a netbook so what would you install

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.180 
for a netbook so what would you install
on<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.840> netbook<00:04:06.020> for<00:04:06.200> example<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:06.920> treat<00:04:07.100> it

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
on a netbook for example and treat it

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.750 
on a netbook for example and treat it
that<00:04:07.220> way

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
that way

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.940 
that way
treat<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.300> that<00:04:08.330> way<00:04:08.480> instead<00:04:08.780> now<00:04:09.500> of<00:04:09.739> course

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
treat it that way instead now of course

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.350 
treat it that way instead now of course
you<00:04:10.160> can<00:04:10.400> upgrade<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:11.000> video<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.720> get<00:04:12.170> higher

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
you can upgrade the video and get higher

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.740 
you can upgrade the video and get higher
benchmark<00:04:14.360> results<00:04:14.900> but<00:04:15.380> really<00:04:15.620> I've<00:04:16.070> seen

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
benchmark results but really I've seen

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.330 
benchmark results but really I've seen
that<00:04:17.750> these<00:04:18.019> types<00:04:18.290> of<00:04:18.410> games<00:04:18.560> work<00:04:18.950> very<00:04:19.250> well

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
that these types of games work very well

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.430 
that these types of games work very well
if<00:04:19.609> you<00:04:19.730> play<00:04:19.910> on<00:04:20.030> low<00:04:20.239> settings<00:04:20.660> maybe<00:04:21.080> even

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
if you play on low settings maybe even

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.469 
if you play on low settings maybe even
medium<00:04:21.830> settings<00:04:22.220> okay<00:04:22.789> so<00:04:22.850> those<00:04:23.090> are<00:04:23.150> some

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
medium settings okay so those are some

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.120 
medium settings okay so those are some
examples<00:04:24.140> on<00:04:24.320> what<00:04:24.380> you

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
examples on what you

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.820 
examples on what you
use<00:04:25.430> this<00:04:25.700> board<00:04:26.030> for<00:04:26.330> if<00:04:26.630> you're<00:04:27.200> using<00:04:27.590> it

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
use this board for if you're using it

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.500 
use this board for if you're using it
for<00:04:28.010> more<00:04:28.190> than<00:04:28.220> just<00:04:28.520> watching<00:04:28.730> movies<00:04:29.270> and

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
for more than just watching movies and

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.570 
for more than just watching movies and
and<00:04:29.720> stuff<00:04:29.960> like<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.350> when<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.310> comes<00:04:31.490> to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
and stuff like that when it comes to

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.240 
and stuff like that when it comes to
temperatures<00:04:32.120> 40<00:04:32.990> degrees<00:04:33.290> Celsius<00:04:33.770> on<00:04:33.890> idle

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
temperatures 40 degrees Celsius on idle

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.600 
temperatures 40 degrees Celsius on idle
about<00:04:34.520> 34<00:04:34.970> watts<00:04:35.240> uses<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.110> at<00:04:36.560> full<00:04:36.770> load<00:04:36.950> 60

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
about 34 watts uses and at full load 60

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.820 
about 34 watts uses and at full load 60
degrees<00:04:37.940> Celsius<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.990> uses<00:04:39.170> about<00:04:39.470> 50

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
degrees Celsius and it uses about 50

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.550 
degrees Celsius and it uses about 50
watts<00:04:40.070> okay<00:04:40.850> so<00:04:40.910> it's<00:04:41.420> the<00:04:41.510> low<00:04:41.810> wattage<00:04:42.110> which

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
watts okay so it's the low wattage which

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.260 
watts okay so it's the low wattage which
is<00:04:42.710> really<00:04:43.070> what<00:04:43.220> it's<00:04:43.340> meant<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.760> do<00:04:43.910> right

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
is really what it's meant to do right

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.630 
is really what it's meant to do right
not<00:04:44.510> use<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.780> lot<00:04:44.990> of<00:04:45.110> energy<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.710> give<00:04:46.040> you<00:04:46.190> the

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
not use a lot of energy and give you the

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.390 
not use a lot of energy and give you the
basic<00:04:47.030> necessities<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.290> really<00:04:48.980> a<00:04:49.010> lot<00:04:49.250> of

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
basic necessities so really a lot of

lots of support for newer technologies

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.840 
lots of support for newer technologies
which<00:04:53.840> is<00:04:53.870> good<00:04:54.260> compact<00:04:55.100> little<00:04:55.370> thing<00:04:55.670> like

which is good compact little thing like
I<00:04:56.030> said<00:04:56.270> but<00:04:56.720> it<00:04:56.870> uses<00:04:57.230> those<00:04:57.410> Esso<00:04:57.860> dim<00:04:58.070> memory

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
I said but it uses those Esso dim memory

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.640 
I said but it uses those Esso dim memory
slots<00:04:58.790> so<00:04:59.360> I'd<00:04:59.450> like<00:04:59.570> to<00:04:59.630> thank<00:04:59.870> Sapphire<00:05:00.380> for
