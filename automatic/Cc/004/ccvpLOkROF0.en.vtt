00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.160
 I want to tell you some things the saga of 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.679
 books glitches jazztel ex will be 15 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.719
 parts and not one more I know there are many 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.089
 to find but find them 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.820
 another person will end up in part 15 and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.890
 good point today I will make my top 10 of the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.830
 best video game songs according to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.689
 My opinion as I said is my opinion 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.240
 start writing comments 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.300
 stupid I invite you to make your own 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.700
 top good let's start in the tenth place 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.370
 there is the famous game donkey kong country 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.469
 one of the best platforms for your 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.960
 epoch and for the time when the super 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.879
 nintendo was fashionable I think I speak 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 for everyone when I say that this game 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.950
 he had good songs but I think the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.870
 better than it is is the one of the first level 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.050
 listen and I invite you to remember old 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.050
 time 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.250
 well let's move to position number 9 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.240
 who has not spent hours playing 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.149
 cell if you have played zelda twilight 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.829
 princess I know you agree with me when 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.719
 I tell you that one of the best 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.899
 songs of that game is that of the people 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.119
 k carico every time I hear it I feel 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.130
 as a great nostalgia for this 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.829
 game was the first in the saga that 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.590
 I played is also a very emotional song 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.399
 for a game like this the number one 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.399
 9 in this top 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.460
 or not 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.920
 at number 8 we have the great 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.320
 Game of Kirby the nightmare in the world 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.690
 of dreams this game is the most 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.090
 simple that exists in great titles 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.670
 of nintendo another game of my childhood 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.459
 that touches my heart when listening to their 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.920
 beautiful melodies the best song of 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.080
 this game is that of the grape gardens 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.390
 this song fits with its title are 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.520
 song lullabies in a game like 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.250
 this and the personality of Kirby the 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.250
 protagonist ranked number 8 in this top 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.070
 the number 7 position occupies my game 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.110
 favorite kingdom hearts those who 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.050
 officiate at the end of fantasy to this game 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.150
 you know what is this song in the game 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.950
 when we get to this boss, we get the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.230
 goose bumps the battle is very 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.320
 difficult and what makes it so is its 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.740
 music obviously put number 7 in 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.740
 this top 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.010
 two 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.830
 in position number 6 we have a 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.960
 classic nintendo cons is one of 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.300
 the most famous games of the nintendo a 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.490
 I really like the game the only thing 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.680
 bad is that in that time the games do not 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.870
 they had history and against what counted 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.030
 a life bar some players 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.730
 they were angry for dying with just one shot 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.730
 but the best level is the first one only 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.270
 for his sticky music put number 6 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.270
 in this top 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.370
 position number 5 occupies golden are 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.950
 the best rpg of the game boy advance this 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.959
 game is a very unique rpg all this 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.000
 game is good but the most I like 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.830
 it's his music every time we 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.170
 we face an enemy we can 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.290
 listen to this song one of the best 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.680
 rpg that I've played number five in 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.680
 this top 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.480
 position number 4 is again occupied by 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.940
 twilight princess the sacred grove is 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.130
 where is the master sword a game of 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.290
 cell without a forest as it is not a cell 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.510
 is another game this song is like a 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.730
 small remake of the song the forests 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.130
 lost this song is the favorite of 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.330
 almost all zelda fans put 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.330
 number 4 in this top 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.200
 a little 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.159
 placed number 3 is the kingdom hearts 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.110
 World's End 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.150
 this song matches your world 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.789
 because the world is also like this 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.580
 weird a very good song for this 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.220
 game and a good rpg in action created by 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.419
 the creators of final fantasy put 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.419
 number 3 in this top 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.480
 in position number 2 is the best 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.790
 sonic game sonic adventure 2 la 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.590
 most music games music 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.050
 of the first level is always the best 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.060
 music escape from the city is a 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.550
 rock song but it's a song 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.660
 what would you like until we have put 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.660
 number 2 in this top 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.909
 they will call me fanboy but I think this 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:59.149
 song and this character deserves a 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:01.669
 tribute the number one position is for the 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:03.559
 crash bandicoot the wrath of cortex this is 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:05.839
 as the fourth part of the saga the 

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:08.419
 music is like a remake of the third 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:10.399
 I play this character and his music 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.459
 deserves a tribute for his glory years 

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:15.979
 in the years of the ps x the number place 

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:18.399
 one of this top and a tribute to cracks 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.399
