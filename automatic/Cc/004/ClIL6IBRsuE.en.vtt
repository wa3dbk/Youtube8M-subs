00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
very confident right last season we had

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.290 
very confident right last season we had
to<00:02:13.130> pretend<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.460> be<00:02:13.550> confident<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.030> didn't

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
to pretend to be confident that didn't

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.470 
to pretend to be confident that didn't
way<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.660> had<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:16.370> hop<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:17.120> now<00:02:17.240> right

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
way we had to just hop but now right

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.210 
way we had to just hop but now right
yeah<00:02:17.690> we<00:02:17.840> feel<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.440> never<00:02:18.560> feel<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.070> I

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
yeah we feel it can never feel it I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.980 
yeah we feel it can never feel it I
think<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> Unites<00:02:20.120> going<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.360> go<00:02:20.510> back<00:02:20.810> where

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
think the Unites going to go back where

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.050
