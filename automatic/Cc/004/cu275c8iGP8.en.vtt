00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:25.319 
to start out drawing just off to one

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:31.249 
to start out drawing just off to one
side<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.819> other<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:29.359> then<00:01:30.359> start

drawing<00:01:31.649> in<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.159> stripes<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.889> the<00:01:34.889> trick<00:01:35.249> with

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
drawing in my stripes and the trick with

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.760 
drawing in my stripes and the trick with
stripes<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.630> instead<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.079> drawing<00:01:37.380> just

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
stripes is that instead of drawing just

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.849 
stripes is that instead of drawing just
straight<00:01:38.100> across<00:01:38.899> kind<00:01:39.899> of<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.229> add<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> little

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
straight across kind of go add a little

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.199 
straight across kind of go add a little
bit<00:01:41.039> of<00:01:41.069> an<00:01:41.219> angle<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.020> that<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.649> line<00:01:44.209> ends

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
bit of an angle so that one line ends

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:47.929 
bit of an angle so that one line ends
where<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.719> line<00:01:46.079> prior<00:01:46.679> to<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> begins<00:01:47.520> if

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
where the line prior to it begins if

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.529 
where the line prior to it begins if
that<00:01:48.329> makes<00:01:48.539> sense<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:51.060> helps<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> make

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
that makes sense and that helps to make

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.870 
that makes sense and that helps to make
it<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.899> little<00:01:52.079> bit<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:52.469> like<00:01:52.679> stripes<00:01:53.130> rather

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
it a little bit more like stripes rather

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.349 
it a little bit more like stripes rather
than<00:01:54.149> just<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.749> Chevron's<00:01:55.969> so<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.029> want<00:01:57.299> to

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
than just like Chevron's so you want to

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.870 
than just like Chevron's so you want to
continue<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.869> across<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.069> entire<00:01:59.520> surface

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
continue that across the entire surface

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.739 
continue that across the entire surface
of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> cup<00:02:01.159> since<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.429> is<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.729> design<00:02:03.240> that's
