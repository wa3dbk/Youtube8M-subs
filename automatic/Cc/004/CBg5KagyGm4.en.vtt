 exchange and all the originality of this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.010

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.900
 but good pass specify the name also 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.610

 if it's a female male object or 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.509

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.430

 indicate that you are interested in a 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.409
 boost to the left that you do not 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.850
 are not, but when you are 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.619
 interested in an object like dante 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.689
 hinder his owner will be warned 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.250
 that if he also covets your object 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.869
 in short, the demand for foreign exchange 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.759
 be mutual so that you are put 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.380

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.180
 use messaging to complete the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.560
 transaction good to know also you 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.729
 can filter objects that switch 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.829
 offers you story that the app does 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.079
 do not propose anything and everything 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.490
 knowing that you just have to 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.880
 review the objects you 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.100
 want 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.119
 get rid eh ben on switch but 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.950
 attention for the moment this 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.200
 free application is available only 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.519
 on iphone bluffed yes I was downright 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.420
 blown away by this brand new app 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.860
 free that you will find 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.310
 exclusively on the store price of 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.440
 google 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.269
 i want to talk about google writing 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.349
 handwritten an application that like his 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.970
 name the indicated suggests you to leave 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.099
 fall the traditional keyboard for 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.170
 type your messages and other texts and 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.970
 return to handwriting earlier 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.560
 a writing that the application will translate 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.910
 she instantly to the characters 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.220
 without even having 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.330
 need to be connected to the internet 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.560
 I told you it's rather bluffing 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.150
 so obviously the ideal for 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.739
 comfortably use google writing 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.360
 handwritten is to have a stylus 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.950
 and a tablet or a fable 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.360
 is like the samsung galaxy note 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.920
 but you can also have fun at 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.480
 write with your finger on the screen of 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.459
 your smartphone but yes even on a 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.680
 smaller screen and with a writing 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.269
 very rough you will see that google 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.769
 handwriting and most of the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.610
 time able to understand everything 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.840
 that you write 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.269
 but it must be said that this application 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.459
 which recognizes 82 languages ​​whose 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.680
 French is expected to interpret 20 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.660
 different types of writing and that in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 more when you activate its option to 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.810
 online recognition google is using 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.370
 so from everything you write for 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.000
 further improve its system of 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.500
 recognition 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.850
 good now you do not have any left 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.319
 than to do a test for example in 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.940
 trying to write with your finger a 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.370
 texto know that you can then 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.900
 also draw your smiley brief let 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.040
 you bluff like me and that's not 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.090
 will cost you nothing because I will 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.709
 Google reminds handwriting 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.510
 is a free application but 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.510
 available only on android 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.680
 but did you ever come from 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.180
 turn on the street again and again to 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.040
 looking for your car from your 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.570
 bike your bike short of your 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.040
 vehicle well yes when we have maybe 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.840
 better to have an app in 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.430
 the occurrence turtur pipes it's not a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.840
 joke that once launched goes precisely 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.980
 those responsible for recording all 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.570
 locations where you park your 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.850
 vehicle using the gps of your 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.660
 smartphone is the particularity of this 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.250
 app is that you do not strictly 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.450
 nothing to do except to let it go 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.640
 in the background 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.720
 good this said if you want to be certain 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.310
 you kill well save your 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.930
 last presentation in front of you can 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.790
 still register it manually 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.990
 but in principle it is not necessary 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.370
 and when you want to find your 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.410
 vehicle eagle just throw 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.730
 tuture and then display your last 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.020
 parking on his map 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.760
 are you going to tell me that you 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.500
 understand that it works very well in 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.180
 outside but what's going on in 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.110
 the underground car parks and well in this 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.850
 case the registry application all 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.650
 just your last position before 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.390
 that you do not engulf yourself is in it 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.770
 in other words they tell you in this 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.570
 case the entrance to the underground car park 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.890
 that's all it's simple and that's it 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.390
 works really well and well 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.709
 your name constantly future background task 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.390
 it has remained thrifty and should not 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.140
 too much impact the longevity of your 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.610
 drums 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.990
 finally note that if you ever 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.130
 restart your smartphone or if 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.660
 inadvertently stop you completely 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.370
 the tutu app will then send you 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.290
 automatically up to 3 in the air for 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.060
 that you thought about the revival and that's it 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.800
 and all this for free but be careful 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.940
 tuture is not available yet 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.940
 only on iphone 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.600
 go for terminus pin-ups a little game 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.980
 obviously a game that I was 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.740
 proposed this week on twitter by 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.900
 jérôme marchessault thanks jérôme and this 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.000
 game for android iphone and windows phone 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.500
 but yes this game is called ultra blur and 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.490
 so 3 blur no score no 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.690
 stopwatch you're just going to have to 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.340
 demonstrate dexterity 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.870
 the goal being to throw a ball of a 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.310
 flick of the finger more or less strong 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.780
 to make sure that by bouncing 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.460
 on objects placed on your screen 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.320
 they manage to reach the exit 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.790
 except that attention you are entitled to 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.560
 whenever a limited number of 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.510
 rebound this number being written on your 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.070
 ball and I promise you that this 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.750
 really complicates things change to 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.460
 so you find the right angle and the 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.889
 good impetus for your ball 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.479
 can reach the exit without exceeding 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.410
 the number of rebounds allowed for lack of 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.760
 what is she going to explode 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.470
 and then also know how to use 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.240
 certain elements of the decorations planned for 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.660
 accelerate or slow down his run will make 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.880
 deviate 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.889
 good I do not tell you more because for 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.690
 the moment I'm trampling at level 25 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.280

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.050
 hundred and I'm waiting to know how far 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.460
