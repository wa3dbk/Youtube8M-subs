00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.259
 the wolf or lopes or zeus or soft and well 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.580
 Welcome to another public the pocket before 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.660
 I'll leave a message for you from 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.490
 always for you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.680
 you already have notes available on the networks 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.510
 we have a facebook account 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.550
 You can follow us on Twitter too. 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.740
 instagram and to close we have a group 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.779
 open will see the links of our networks 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.210
 with is in the description and today 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.669
 let's talk about science and about half 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 I come to you with this theme because it is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.790
 intriguing is not really 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.309
 many do not believe in the man's 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.500
 moon even though the evidence speaks of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.030
 convincingly prefer to believe in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.160
 conspiracy theories 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.469
 so today I will do the following in 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.480
 tries to argue evidence that the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.270
 man's journey to the moon in the 60's 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.120
 it was possible to present to you a 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.770
 world where man has never been to the moon 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.109
 good first you would not have 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.609
 water purifier since it was created 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.770
 on account of the trip to the moon 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.600
 something else that would not exist would be the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.000
 vacuum cleaner 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.130
 today also created for the trip to the moon and 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.930
 knows the worst if the man were never to 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.710
 moon could already have given an auction in the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.260
 space 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.460
 I'll explain the moon goes much further. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.890
 what it looks like 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.600
 is more than 300 thousand kilometers from here 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.630
 just to compare the space station 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.560
 international is 400 km 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.240
 from here 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.640
 this necessitated the construction of the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 saturn a rocket with more than 110 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.110
 meters and to search for clues 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.659
 Lunar ride feel if they were 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.310
 to focus their efforts on smaller ships and 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.420
 not in a ship for rue that we 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.040
 take to the moon 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.380
 space tourism could be a 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.400
 reality today and you know that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.250
 self marotta 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.240
 Wow, I gave it that good self name. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.040
 Photograph 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.869
 You know that crazy photo you take. 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.970
 with the small camera of your cell phone 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.710
 before the going of the man to the moon the cameras 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.540
 they were huge cars 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.670
 It's just you see behind the scenes photos of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.430
 old movies they were ridiculously 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.409
 huge as the astronauts needed 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.329
 camera to record your achievement 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.579
 Why else will you paulo have to 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.770
 filming that is logical the scientists gave 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.509
 the kickoff for the reduction of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.400
 cameras so that they start the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.290
 small space capsules 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.170
 without this obligation to make cameras 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.980
 their evolution would be much more 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.140
 slow 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.540
 maybe we will not even have the digital cameras 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.250
 of today and knows something else that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.370
 there would not be a world where man does not 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.530
 stepped on the moon compact computers yes 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.450
 before the computers were huge 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.700
 size of a room the scientists 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.160
 needed smaller computers and that 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.560
 into the space capsules 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.750
 were it not for the compaction of the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640
 computers would take more time and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.910
 Maybe we'll still be using the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.250
 first pcs and macs then thank 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.950
 trip to the moon when you are reading the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.120
 your conspiracy theory in a connected pc 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.459
 the Internet 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.200
 You know the need that makes you born. 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.720
 the inventor as the astronauts 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.730
 needed purified water cameras 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.709
 and compact computers and one 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.090
 infinity of other things so that the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.620
 trip was possible 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.379
 this ended up generating a great revolution 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.510
 technology for humanity farces do not 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.569
 generate revolution overcoming the limits 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.709
 human beings and this generates revolution 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.840
 Anyway, I hope you liked it. 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.370
 this video if you liked drop 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.090

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.569
 of cinema comics etc. 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.790
 remembering that soon there is news in 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.200
 website explains our car here with 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.200
 big hug and drag
