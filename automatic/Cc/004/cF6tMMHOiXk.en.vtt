00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.340 
solutions but i got see all about eyes
rich<00:01:24.980> formula<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.090> i<00:01:26.360> just<00:01:26.690> realized<00:01:27.140> that

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
rich formula and i just realized that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.310 
rich formula and i just realized that
she<00:01:27.500> gave<00:01:27.650> me<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.890> wrong<00:01:28.040> one<00:01:29.200> we're<00:01:30.200> supposed

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
she gave me the wrong one we're supposed

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.260 
she gave me the wrong one we're supposed
to<00:01:30.470> be<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.680> cream<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.340> thinner<00:01:31.610> one<00:01:31.700> but<00:01:32.150> this

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
to be the cream the thinner one but this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.300 
to be the cream the thinner one but this
is<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.630> rich<00:01:32.810> formula<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:33.980> slightly

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
is the rich formula so it's so slightly

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.550 
is the rich formula so it's so slightly
thicker<00:01:34.670> but<00:01:35.360> yeah<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.720> comes<00:01:35.840> in<00:01:35.990> this<00:01:36.110> tube

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
thicker but yeah it comes in this tube

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.330 
thicker but yeah it comes in this tube
and<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:39.110> what<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.410> consistency<00:01:40.130> looks

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
and this is what the consistency looks

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.130 
and this is what the consistency looks
like<00:01:40.580> but<00:01:40.850> again<00:01:40.970> thing<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.540> got<00:01:41.720> me<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.990> buy

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
anything that i liked so this was the

then you can also make it shorter by

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.820 
then you can also make it shorter by
folding<00:05:52.780> them<00:05:52.900> over<00:05:53.110> let<00:05:53.260> me<00:05:53.320> show<00:05:53.590> you<00:05:53.620> what

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
folding them over let me show you what

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.830 
folding them over let me show you what
it<00:05:53.920> looks<00:05:53.950> like<00:05:55.110> so<00:05:56.110> you<00:05:56.200> can<00:05:56.410> fold<00:05:56.620> them<00:05:56.800> over

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
it looks like so you can fold them over

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.150 
it looks like so you can fold them over
either<00:05:58.840> of<00:05:59.080> these<00:05:59.200> would<00:05:59.410> be<00:05:59.530> really<00:05:59.800> cute

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
either of these would be really cute

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.240 
either of these would be really cute
with<00:06:00.340> jeggings<00:06:00.670> leggings<00:06:01.600> tights<00:06:02.500> anything

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
with jeggings leggings tights anything

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.060 
with jeggings leggings tights anything
so<00:06:03.940> again<00:06:04.330> these<00:06:04.570> are<00:06:04.630> flat<00:06:05.020> so<00:06:05.590> they<00:06:05.740> will<00:06:05.920> be

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
so again these are flat so they will be

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.850 
so again these are flat so they will be
really<00:06:06.430> comfortable<00:06:07.170> to<00:06:08.170> wear<00:06:08.350> for<00:06:08.710> long

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
really comfortable to wear for long

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.160 
really comfortable to wear for long
periods<00:06:08.890> of<00:06:09.310> time<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:09.970> really<00:06:10.840> it<00:06:11.020> feels

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
periods of time and really it feels

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.240 
periods of time and really it feels
really<00:06:11.560> good<00:06:11.770> quality<00:06:12.280> but<00:06:12.730> I<00:06:13.200> love<00:06:14.200> them<00:06:14.380> and

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
really good quality but I love them and

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.950 
really good quality but I love them and
this<00:06:15.460> one<00:06:15.670> I<00:06:15.700> see<00:06:16.000> how<00:06:16.270> much<00:06:16.420> was<00:06:16.600> this<00:06:16.720> one

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
this one I see how much was this one

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.990 
this one I see how much was this one
this<00:06:17.560> one<00:06:17.770> is<00:06:17.800> like<00:06:18.100> a<00:06:18.340> little<00:06:18.610> cheaper<00:06:18.910> was

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
this one is like a little cheaper was

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.360 
this one is like a little cheaper was
like<00:06:19.120> 45<00:06:19.530> so<00:06:20.530> with<00:06:21.220> that<00:06:21.490> I<00:06:22.090> got<00:06:22.720> both<00:06:23.500> pairs<00:06:24.040> i

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
like 45 so with that I got both pairs i

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.730 
like 45 so with that I got both pairs i
think<00:06:24.670> i<00:06:24.760> paid<00:06:24.940> like<00:06:25.180> 91<00:06:25.720> dollars<00:06:26.260> for<00:06:26.590> two

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
think i paid like 91 dollars for two

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.340 
think i paid like 91 dollars for two
pairs<00:06:26.980> so<00:06:27.880> my<00:06:28.510> opinion<00:06:28.690> that's<00:06:28.930> a<00:06:29.050> good<00:06:29.200> deal

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
pairs so my opinion that's a good deal

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.830 
pairs so my opinion that's a good deal
and<00:06:29.710> again<00:06:30.700> i<00:06:30.730> didn't<00:06:31.150> pay<00:06:31.300> for<00:06:31.330> either<00:06:31.690> of

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840
