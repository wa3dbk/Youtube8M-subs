00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.800
 in the first part of 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.770
 we try to answer 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.059
 if the quotations 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.359
 can cause some kind of bad happening 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.599
 we have first that there is a big difference between calls with 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.310
 delay 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.679
 the worst years 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.949
 with the pretensions of Corinthians and those radiations and are called 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.699
 unrealized radiations are the date 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.970
 now as the concept is also very important 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.360
 I know it's past 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.820
 who is this radiation after all he has a life 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.920
 implicit mode 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.920
 Tricycle was easily 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.600
 the powerful and 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.360
 It's time for action, right? 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.520
 the action brotherhood 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.390
 everyone was gang 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 crisis 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.990
 linked to tripoli green energy 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.120
 for your part of our company 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.430
 for being of this nature 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.180
 this computer you're watching is now showing 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.990
 given his television on television but in the case of 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.140
 Diego's half 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.730
 on Monday 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.170
 according to current norms 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.320
 any rigging 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.310
 home appliances 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.160
 connected to the 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.920
 would be lying 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.660
 these are the calls 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.450
 the actions of the human net 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.450
 from unnatural sources, or from something that has been 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.510
 produced by man 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.880
 this is because most of the dwellings that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.150
 the main source of emissions 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.530
 I'm not magnetic 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.230
 which corresponds to 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.230
 all afternoon to health 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.680
 and you can 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 because many times some people believe 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 moving away from the skin flowers 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.009
 to use note 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.719
 we will be like this 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:12.719
 avoiding these radiations 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.299
 is not true 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.489
 was the contribution of electromagnetic radiation said 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.659
 by the environment 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.559
 from stations 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:27.400
 is very small compared to all the stations you like 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.400
 in the strong defenses both the natural photos, mainly the sources 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.400
 natural as unnatural sources walk 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.749
 so you can not think 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.069
 where we do not have 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.000
 it's true the action 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.759
 once again its construction 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.779
 be free of this electromagnetic radiation only and only 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.029
 away to the light points 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.319
 it comes from the storm 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.609
 other appliances 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.209
 in the first part then 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.729
 of our wine that we have and the complaints in the cellular telephony 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.069
 non-ionizing radiation 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.279
 second part now we develop 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.279
 for you to realize that these electromagnetic radiations 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:23.429
 are part of our daily lives are part of our lives I am concerned 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.789
 and that is associated with a number of amenities that we have 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.799
 on the next match 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.809
 we are going then 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.249
 other advice 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.309
 bits to state 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:44.399
 are there any limits 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.339
 will be these patients here 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.339
 if there are 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.180
 the people to the people who live near the antennas for those people 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.919
 that use this technology 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.419
 that will be the role 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.419
 of our third child on this topic 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:08.399
 answer this question 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.599
 or does not hurt
