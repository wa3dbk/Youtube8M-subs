to<00:02:26.910> contouring<00:02:27.480> your<00:02:27.690> nose<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> think<00:02:28.170> is

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to contouring your nose I think is

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.960

always<00:02:28.770> blending<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.430> right<00:02:29.670> into<00:02:29.820> your

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650

look<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.160> lot<00:02:32.550> more<00:02:32.610> natural<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.600> yeah

purple Silver's blues and browns in it
it's<00:04:11.800> like<00:04:11.920> really<00:04:12.460> weird<00:04:12.730> but<00:04:13.000> really<00:04:13.420> really

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
it's like really weird but really really

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.770 
it's like really weird but really really
gorgeous<00:04:13.960> and<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.680> think<00:04:14.920> it's<00:04:15.040> perfect<00:04:15.520> for<00:04:15.580> a

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
gorgeous and I think it's perfect for a

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.690 
gorgeous and I think it's perfect for a
vampy<00:04:16.780> kind<00:04:17.170> of<00:04:17.290> fall<00:04:17.620> look<00:04:17.950> so<00:04:18.220> that's<00:04:18.489> why<00:04:18.670> I

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
vampy kind of fall look so that's why I

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.640 
vampy kind of fall look so that's why I
chose<00:04:19.090> this<00:04:19.150> color<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.930> add<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.110> little<00:04:23.380> bit<00:04:23.590> of

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
chose this color to add a little bit of

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.890 
chose this color to add a little bit of
more<00:04:23.980> depth<00:04:24.370> into<00:04:24.790> my<00:04:24.940> crease<00:04:25.270> I'm<00:04:25.540> taking

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
more depth into my crease I'm taking

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.870 
more depth into my crease I'm taking
this<00:04:26.020> color<00:04:26.290> slow<00:04:26.740> dance<00:04:27.040> which<00:04:27.340> is<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:27.520> really

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
this color slow dance which is a really

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.660 
this color slow dance which is a really
dark<00:04:28.390> brown<00:04:29.080> color<00:04:29.110> with<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.770> hint<00:04:30.160> of<00:04:30.340> purple
