00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 He is king at least in the United States. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.529
 the chord wheel is one of the models 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.870
 sold year after year but now that the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.790
 updated version land in brazil 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.130
 to know if he will win the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.160
 segment of luxury sedans you will have 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.359
 watching the test 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.080
 if it is something the Japanese 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.320
 cherish is the tradition even what they 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.210
 other countries, such as the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.870
 honda accord made in united states 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.430
 since 1976 that is already in the ninth generation 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.309
 so because of this you imagine that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.950
 will find something outdated 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.660
 Inca in his was redesigned 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.700
 with a sportier face 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.120
 but did not lose the way so sober a 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.070
 of his characteristics 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.559
 the trunk could be bigger 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.530
 however the inner space is good look here 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.989
 four adults fit very well 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.800
 only those who go in the middle suffer from the heat in the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.449
 backrest and seat and also does not 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.420
 ball out when it comes to safety 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.840
 with a three-point belt and 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.240
 for all but 60 beck and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.760
 even in the cheaper version it has 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.710
 still disc brakes on all four wheels and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.770
 electronic traction controls and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.770
 stability 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.860
 the inner finish of lx 2.4 is 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.900
 simpler but with good materials and 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.970
 sacred right trimmings 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.090
 but if the extension were clearer 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.659
 or two-tone interior would be more 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.659
 cozy 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.780
 You can only understand the point of some 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.580
 equipment that is already common in positions 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.909
 category and price 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.229
 examples do not want the sunroof 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.869
 manual rearview mirror missing gps 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.729
 everything could be done by rolling 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.830
 comfortable and quiet in any 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.380
 floor and details that make a good 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.170
 sense of solidity merit of good 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.770
 suspension that still allows you to make curves 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.770
 in a nice 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.040
 one of the cool things is to direct the 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.110
 wake up despite having a four engine 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.300
 cylinders as equipped with a system 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.360
 called engetec and controls the aperture 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.709
 of valves has good responses both in 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.690
 high as low speeds 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.670
 The result is that the wakes up 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.480
 effortlessly and has a good 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.880
 performance 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.489
 much of this is also due to the exchange rate 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.700
 automatic five-speed has 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.280
 quick coupling and adapt to the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.530
 way the driver drives but does not have 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.140
 possibility of sequential exchanges 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.800
 An interesting detail is the econ mode. 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.840
 when the engine is switched on and up to an air 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.680
 the next working condition in 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.709
 economic 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.150
 only that despite having it all the consumption 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.480
 disappointed me 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.709
 the average of 6.3 kilometers per liter does not 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.420
 it's cheery 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.700
 even with each of these abstract of the work 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.830
 the chord justifies why it is always 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.299
 among the best-selling cars of the 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.610
 united states 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.220
 but this is where the competition is 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.739
 Brava here for what you charge for this 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.769
 entry version exists competitors 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.380
 which cost less and offers much more 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.890
 now if you think the name round is worth 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.890
 all this 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.420
 this leads 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.420
 your laptop 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.150
 it's not even that version that 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.120
 we are the most in account is x with motor 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.900
 four cylinders costs almost 120 thousand 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.760
 real 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.990
 but you can still spend much more 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.290
 have a honda accord 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.040
 the v6 engine and six- speed automatic 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.660
 marches 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.670
 he leaps to near the 150 thousand 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.960
 147,900 to be exact the price of the sedan 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.730
 German 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.960
 we go to the notes then to know if 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.300
 it 's really worth it 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.820
 as was to be expected of these alencar 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.770
 no ugly performance stays with eight 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.890
 only the consumption that gives a slip 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.799
 takes six security 10 no surprise 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.360
 stability and finishing stability 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:26.830
 internal 8 trunk and cost-effective 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.830
 close the notes with seven
