used these about three times already

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.800 
used these about three times already
they<00:00:47.740> do<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.920> pretty<00:00:48.010> good<00:00:48.250> job<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:49.360> only<00:00:49.600> thing

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
they do a pretty good job the only thing

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.080 
they do a pretty good job the only thing
is<00:00:49.960> some<00:00:50.470> of<00:00:50.740> the<00:00:50.950> curls<00:00:51.280> fall<00:00:51.610> out<00:00:51.730> while

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
is some of the curls fall out while

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.030 
is some of the curls fall out while
you're<00:00:52.210> sleeping<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:52.960> you<00:00:53.770> could<00:00:53.920> always

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
you're sleeping and you could always

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.530 
you're sleeping and you could always
touch<00:00:54.280> them<00:00:54.460> up<00:00:54.550> with<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.730> curling<00:00:54.940> iron<00:00:55.150> it's

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
touch them up with a curling iron it's

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.180 
touch them up with a curling iron it's
better<00:00:55.810> than<00:00:56.020> doing<00:00:56.200> your<00:00:56.410> whole<00:00:56.560> head<00:00:56.920> with

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
better than doing your whole head with

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.790 
better than doing your whole head with
heat<00:00:57.430> so<00:00:57.880> yeah<00:00:58.870> I'm<00:00:59.350> just<00:00:59.440> going<00:00:59.650> to<00:00:59.680> get

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.910 

so<00:01:11.880> you're<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.660> pretty<00:01:13.020> even

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so you're just going to get pretty even

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.100

sections<00:01:14.460> um<00:01:16.160> my<00:01:17.160> hair<00:01:17.370> is<00:01:17.460> pretty<00:01:17.670> thin<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.630> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
sections um my hair is pretty thin so it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.520 
sections um my hair is pretty thin so it
doesn't<00:01:19.470> take<00:01:20.370> much<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:21.210> them<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.080> curl

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
doesn't take much for them to curl

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
doesn't take much for them to curl
you're<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> wrap<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.060> around<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you're just going to wrap it around the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.520 
you're just going to wrap it around the
thing<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:26.570> if<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.690> feels<00:01:27.870> this<00:01:28.050> at<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.350> top

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
thing and if it feels this at the top

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.420 
thing and if it feels this at the top
just<00:01:28.560> curl<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.280> some<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.880> fold<00:01:30.660> it<00:01:30.840> over

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
just curl it up some and fold it over

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.160 
just curl it up some and fold it over
right<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.670> top<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.710> your<00:01:34.710> hair<00:01:35.720> it's<00:01:36.720> okay<00:01:37.080> if

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
right on top of your hair it's okay if

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.170 
right on top of your hair it's okay if
they<00:01:37.290> hang<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:37.950> because<00:01:38.910> they'll

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
they hang down a little because they'll

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:52.500 
they hang down a little because they'll
stay<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.540> place

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.840 

you<00:01:53.080> can<00:01:53.260> roll<00:01:53.470> away<00:01:53.920> from<00:01:54.160> your<00:01:54.310> face<00:01:54.520> or

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
you can roll away from your face or

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.960 
you can roll away from your face or
towards<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.630> like<00:01:56.260> doing<00:01:56.530> away<00:01:56.980> that's<00:01:57.760> just

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
towards I like doing away that's just

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.860 
towards I like doing away that's just
the<00:01:58.090> way<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.620> prefer<00:01:59.730> it<00:02:00.730> I<00:02:01.120> think<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.840> looks

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
the way I prefer it I think it looks

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.750 
the way I prefer it I think it looks
better<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.320> way<00:02:02.470> but<00:02:02.650> it's<00:02:03.040> really<00:02:03.190> all<00:02:03.520> up

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
better that way but it's really all up

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:17.090 
better that way but it's really all up
to<00:02:03.910> you

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.030 

if<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:18.060> center<00:02:18.390> sections<00:02:19.020> then<00:02:19.410> your

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
if you get center sections then your

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.370 
if you get center sections then your
hair<00:02:20.220> will<00:02:20.340> be<00:02:20.540> it'll<00:02:21.540> make<00:02:21.660> tighter<00:02:21.960> curls

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
hair will be it'll make tighter curls

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.250 
hair will be it'll make tighter curls
but<00:02:22.830> if<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.580> thicker<00:02:24.450> sections<00:02:24.720> it'll

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
but if you get thicker sections it'll

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.000 
but if you get thicker sections it'll
make<00:02:25.410> loose<00:02:25.680> curls<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.740> depending<00:02:28.740> on<00:02:28.740> which

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
make loose curls so depending on which

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.990 
make loose curls so depending on which
one<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.370> want<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.550> make<00:02:32.700> thicker

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
minutes so that's good this is about the

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.370 
minutes so that's good this is about the
only<00:06:52.440> amount<00:06:53.340> no<00:06:53.520> fall<00:06:53.900> these<00:06:54.900> curls<00:06:55.170> will

last all day and if you want you can

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.290 
last all day and if you want you can

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.730 
just put a headband in if they're to pit
before<00:07:00.420> you<00:07:00.660> just<00:07:00.810> brush<00:07:01.350> it<00:07:01.380> out<00:07:01.560> with<00:07:01.710> your

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
before you just brush it out with your

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.060 
before you just brush it out with your
hands<00:07:02.100> and<00:07:02.490> uh<00:07:02.630> yeah<00:07:03.630> I<00:07:03.870> usually<00:07:04.830> have<00:07:04.950> to

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
hands and uh yeah I usually have to

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.550 
hands and uh yeah I usually have to
recur<00:07:05.430> more<00:07:05.910> pieces<00:07:06.330> than<00:07:06.360> I<00:07:06.660> did<00:07:06.810> today<00:07:06.960> but<00:07:07.380> I

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
recur more pieces than I did today but I

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.070 
recur more pieces than I did today but I
found<00:07:07.770> that<00:07:08.040> if<00:07:08.640> you<00:07:09.030> roll<00:07:09.360> them<00:07:09.510> when<00:07:09.750> your

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
found that if you roll them when your

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.380 
found that if you roll them when your
hair<00:07:10.320> is<00:07:10.350> very<00:07:11.030> very<00:07:12.620> almost<00:07:13.620> dry<00:07:14.550> like<00:07:14.970> a

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.390 
hair is very very almost dry like a

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.840 
hair is very very almost dry like a
little<00:07:15.900> bit<00:07:16.020> damp<00:07:16.320> I<00:07:16.440> usually<00:07:16.590> curl<00:07:17.520> them<00:07:17.700> up

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850 
little bit damp I usually curl them up

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.220 
little bit damp I usually curl them up
when<00:07:18.120> they're<00:07:19.730> medium<00:07:20.730> wet<00:07:21.180> too<00:07:21.390> damp<00:07:21.600> but<00:07:21.900> I

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.230 
when they're medium wet too damp but I

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.140 
when they're medium wet too damp but I
found<00:07:22.530> that<00:07:22.650> if<00:07:22.800> you<00:07:23.010> roll<00:07:23.580> them<00:07:23.760> when<00:07:23.940> they're

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
found that if you roll them when they're

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.450 
found that if you roll them when they're
a<00:07:24.480> lot<00:07:25.080> drier<00:07:25.380> than<00:07:25.680> that<00:07:25.860> works<00:07:26.190> a<00:07:26.310> lot<00:07:26.400> better

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 
a lot drier than that works a lot better

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.640 
a lot drier than that works a lot better
so<00:07:27.440> this<00:07:28.440> is<00:07:28.590> the<00:07:28.680> finished<00:07:28.830> product<00:07:29.340> and<00:07:29.580> i

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.650 
so this is the finished product and i

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.110 
so this is the finished product and i
really<00:07:31.650> like<00:07:31.890> these<00:07:32.040> rollers<00:07:32.490> they<00:07:32.760> do<00:07:32.820> hurt

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 
really like these rollers they do hurt

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.100 
really like these rollers they do hurt
when<00:07:33.240> you're<00:07:33.360> sleeping<00:07:33.570> but<00:07:33.660> they're<00:07:33.930> worth

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
when you're sleeping but they're worth

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.520 
when you're sleeping but they're worth
it<00:07:34.380> and<00:07:35.390> they<00:07:36.390> last<00:07:36.660> all<00:07:36.900> day<00:07:36.930> so<00:07:37.110> they<00:07:37.470> were

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530 
it and they last all day so they were

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.520 
it and they last all day so they were
very<00:07:38.270> worth<00:07:39.270> the<00:07:39.480> pain<00:07:39.690> i<00:07:39.720> guess<00:07:40.169> you<00:07:40.350> could

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
very worth the pain i guess you could

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.760 
very worth the pain i guess you could
say<00:07:40.800> and<00:07:41.070> it<00:07:41.940> helps<00:07:42.419> not<00:07:43.200> use<00:07:43.350> heat<00:07:43.560> on<00:07:43.680> your

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:43.770

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.050
