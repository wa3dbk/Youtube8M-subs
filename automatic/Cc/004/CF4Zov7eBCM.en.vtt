00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.650
 the truth is that in the end I do not know 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.960
 exactly help them in a hundred and one 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.090
 photographs those that have been 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.230
 finally in the exhibition and we have is 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.900
 a tour d 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.300
 over time they are a selection 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.470
 of photographs taken between the year 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.180
 2008 and 2014 that I think there's no 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.730
 Another claim is not that of 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.430
 illustrate a little 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.040
 where has the work been moving 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.079
 throughout these last of these 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.840
 last years and the truth that good was 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.699
 a fantastic occasion the power 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.620
 present them like that as a whole 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.750
 not because over the years since 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.570
 well you've been doing like small 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.070
 exhibitions in gallery but of course 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.150
 always gives you how to present the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.300
 I work much more 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.910
 fragmented and now I think it's good 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.070
 a good opportunity and stop throwing a 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.330
 little one look as well as towards the past 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.330
 most recent have a vision 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.540
 he produces a language that is universal 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.520
 when working with everyday objects and 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.900
 with things the things that we have to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.640
 our around in the people 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.950
 immediately recognizes it 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.360
 immediately he is perfectly capable of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.250
 watch 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.490
 that something is happening there that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.930
 compositions and the confrontations and the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.720
 violence let's say that in many cases 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.580
 they produce facing objects that do not 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.740
 they make sense between them let's say but 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.740
 that produce a new sense a 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.470
 thinking a metaphor makes the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.930
 people collaborate in some way be 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.600
 active in front of the work I believe that the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.260
 speech is enriched with the step 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.880
 of time is also taking a greater 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.800
 I think a greater complexity goes 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.619
 Acquiring also a greater dexterity 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.990
 to play a little with the meanings 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.810
 and with the references 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.670
 and I think that's something they appreciate 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.670
 the images
