00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.700
 good guys this video I had it 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.050
 asked quite how you want to keep your 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.730
 shiny hair what do I do 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.530
 so that it is bright the truth is that 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.360
 they are not many things and they think that 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.490
 It lies in simplicity but good 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.440
 let's start this video you know if 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.300
 they like to put line dejes comments 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.070
 questions all or if not on facebook 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.599
 they also ask me any things and 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.619
 if we just started then what 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:27.140
 first with what shampoo or that you already used 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.089
 I would televise a shampoo that I discovered 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.949
 like a year that I like a lot and it's 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.379
 especially just for brightness then 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.879
 I do not know for me it works suddenly 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.829
 for other people it can not work and 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.410
 really the chapu depends on each type 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.730
 of hair and everything they have and do not 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.140
 they all work the same but 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.929
 well this is the one that works for me and 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.019
 I use this fan has that is brightness 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.160
 extreme then it is a sum of things in 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.170
 actually this is the bread has shine 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.300
 this is like the big guy 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.829
 I have one that is about to end and this 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.600
 is the one that I bought new and says 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.670
 hair twice as bright from its 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.379
 first use and no longer here 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.940
 in a strange state about five dollars 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.170
 more or less that is a presentation a 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.659
 little bit more than this because that 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.330
 it really is super big but it's not 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.950
 really clear then with that is that 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.710
 is the shampoo that I use and what 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.659
 I do is throw myself shampoo, I wash my head 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.520
 and then what are we going to wait for a while 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.380
 you clean all the meters you go 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.909
 paying and then I go back to throw another 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.799
 small amount is not me I wash the 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.509
 heads twice I do not know why I do not 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.820
 they ask but I wash my head two 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.890
 times where you have to fall first do not know 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.630
 of the whole society and everything that 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.220
 let's have then at least I 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.600
 I won another question that suddenly I 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.280
 will do is that if I use 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.050
 conditioner and I do not use 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.990
 conditioned I think all my friends 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.580
 they use it and they do not have as I have it 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.960
 At least we have a hair 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.000
 Brilliant that is beautiful 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.950
 manageable but is that you take care of it then 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.270
 I think that was the main option that 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.429
 is what I do is use the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.500
 mask for oily hair for 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.810
 natural normal hair what is this 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.640
 mask I'm putting here here 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.770
 down I'm here very low I'm going to put the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 boxes the box of a mask 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.850
 of fatty hair 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.840
 I'm going to put it on if there is not 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.520
 is that I've uploaded the video, I'm 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.470
 putting here to see how to have a 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.840
 Shiny hair is a woman and is super 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.580
 simple the two are super simple and 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.069
 that in reason we put it on before 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.989
 bathe and this and it really helps a lot 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.370
 because it nourishes your hair then if 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.110
 you want a change that more nourished 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.370
 as a little kid for example a little boy 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.530
 that is not well nourished that all 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.569
 skinny and everything so decayed but someone 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.610
 that is well nourished are more 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.620
 happy and the same goes for your hair 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.650
 then that is also going to make it 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.690
 brightness quoted then we have that and there 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.670
 another thing that I also like, I follow 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.940
 hair but let's leave that behind 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.190
 we also something is every two three 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.930
 months I cut the ends 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.940
 I know that someone who are not 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.680
 used to that but to me 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.880
 it works pretty well I go to where the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.530
 hairdresser I only tell you that I 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.060
 cut the ends because I usually 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.739
 like to talk about my hair if I do not tell 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.090
 that I cut myself a little bit more but I 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.290
 I like pretty much in the length of my hair 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.180
 and I just remembered how this is 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.810
 bit then that does that and that 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.170
 I realized that it helps quite a lot 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.930
 battered cut and you have hairpins 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.180
 which are open when seeing what 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.250
 will happen is that your hair will nourish 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.870
 like that part and it 's lost is 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.120
 like dead hair in disney this way 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.910
 then my very graphic explanation 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.530
 then you will lose nutrients there that 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.180
 the rest of your hair would need 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.530
 so if you are a cut in 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.879
 the tips your hair will be more 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.140
 though you think is healthy 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.670
 shorter but there is no problem 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.239
 otherwise it will grow more that 's another 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.560
 tip 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.440
 one shows a video about superman 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.420
 them then this one is going to know that his 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.610
 hair grows more and looks brighter 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.540
 Another one of my tips is also how to 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.400
 dry the hair 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.810
 the for me to good by where as his 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.340
 children the hair because most and it 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.440
 it burns and a change that is burned 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.870
 it's never going to be brilliant, it never goes 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.579
 to be brilliant then here I am 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.849
 putting a box in the with the 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.910
 show me how it came to me and the hair and what 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.769
 first thing I do is dry me from afar and 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.299
 always with the average temperature if 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.599
 you have are not the temperature with 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.390
 but you are watching the video 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.769
 they dry up that far then then what 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.430
 I do it is very important also 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.739
 tips 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.780
 grabbing them with your hand and then 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.459
 you grab the dryer and they do it like 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.669
 I am teaching in the wind if you 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.350
 move away those tips of the heat will do 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.020
 that dry normal that can be sealed 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.060
 but that they do not mistreat themselves is 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.949
 then the other tip that I put in 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.889
 practice to get my hair is 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.960
 I always use cold air at the end 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.120
 then with this cold air that has 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.400
 call my dryer I grab and now if 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.379
 my hair in this part of here and 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.879
 I put here what that does is close 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.190
 because in our case we also have 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:47.770
 something like now another thing that I do 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.360
 I have a little coconut oil 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.250
 oil and something for which they are 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.629
 to do is give yourself massages but this 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.699
 only if you have dry hair 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.409
 because if you have normal hair or 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.360
 fatty you can that this goes to 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.069
 change I know that your hair is going to 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.440
 become more greasy or in the event that 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.389
 it is normal for the coconut to be greasy 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.860
 juice helps a lot a lot for our 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.409
 hair or you can also buy 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.680
 shampoos that have coconut oil 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:13.960
 Incorporated the coconut is a great help 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.880
 for what is the hair another thing 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.819
 It is also when ironing 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.099
 always try to use this one 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.870
 hair protector and there are very good 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.909
 I'm going to leave this a list of those that I 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.289
 they like me but it's a bit difficult to 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.180
 get because now this friend is the 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.770
 market in hair projects because 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.389
 they only sell it in the United States and 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.650
 well do not find it here so now 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.360
 I'm traveling, I'm going back 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.040
 to get some other advice 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.199
 It is also time to wash your 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.210
 hair at the end consists a base with 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.380
 warm or hot water with whatever they are going 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.750
 to throw a jet of cold water 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.030
 so good there if they are going to have to 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.919
 endure a little cold but or put 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.389
 the head imposes in cold water that 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.820
 It is also very good for your hair 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.680
 Another thing is that they do not wash their 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.690
 hair every day do not wash all 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.160
 the days because they take away a lot of 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.270
 natural fats and oils you need 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.009
 The hair 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.509
 then try at least if it is 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.310
 that go open the days are put 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.380
 a bag or those things that before 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.970
 they existed that I do not know what they are called but 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.350
 what it does is fix not understand its 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.449
 dry hair 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.160
 then interdiary wash does not pass 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.780
 nothing and you are still associated with all 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.550
 advice he could give them to have a 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.880
 Glossy hair as you have realized 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.229
 it 's nothing otherworldly, it's just 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.720
 maintain a healthy routine for your 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.610
 hydrated hair nourish it and we do not 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.169
 commit excesses with hair 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.550
 then attention follow the things and 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.010
 also natural things like oil 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.720
 of coconut then yes I hope that you have 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.970
 liked and if you have any doubt I the 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.500
 leave here or also by facebook not 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.240
 they ask there in either of the two 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.700
 sides I answer them if they put you like the 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.380
 video if you like 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.610
 and not knowing how to subscribe in the part of 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.080
 up here to be followed more than 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.850
 these videos and come I have this 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.570
 bracelet that is from my last video 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:51.090
 Look, they are little hands I like the
