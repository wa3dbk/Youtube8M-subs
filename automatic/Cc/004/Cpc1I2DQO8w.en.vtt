00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
video you want to set up crystals that

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.760 
video you want to set up crystals that
go<00:01:01.120> around<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:02.410> outer<00:01:02.590> page<00:01:02.860> like<00:01:03.460> this<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.710> is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
go around the outer page like this it is

go around the outer page like this it is
optional<00:01:06.160> to<00:01:06.520> use<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.690> sticky<00:01:08.200> piston<00:01:08.440> or<00:01:08.860> a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
optional to use a sticky piston or a

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.010 
optional to use a sticky piston or a
regular<00:01:09.220> person<00:01:09.580> if<00:01:10.240> you're<00:01:10.390> using<00:01:10.509> a<00:01:10.660> sticky

regular person if you're using a sticky

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.719 
regular person if you're using a sticky
piston<00:01:11.410> you<00:01:11.619> can<00:01:11.800> actually<00:01:11.950> put<00:01:12.310> it<00:01:12.399> a<00:01:12.490> layer

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
piston you can actually put it a layer

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.660 
piston you can actually put it a layer
down<00:01:12.759> and<00:01:13.450> have<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.259> block<00:01:14.619> up<00:01:14.890> on<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.220> top<00:01:15.460> if

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
down and have a block up on the top if

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.040 
down and have a block up on the top if
you<00:01:15.789> kind<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.119> know<00:01:16.180> what<00:01:16.360> I<00:01:16.420> mean<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:16.960> you

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
you kind of know what I mean so you

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.230 
you kind of know what I mean so you
don't<00:01:17.200> have<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.470> do<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:17.710> this<00:01:17.830> way<00:01:18.039> but<00:01:18.310> this<00:01:19.180> is

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
don't have to do it this way but this is

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.050 
don't have to do it this way but this is
the<00:01:19.390> most<00:01:19.840> simplest<00:01:20.289> and<00:01:20.619> cheapest<00:01:21.009> way<00:01:21.160> and

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
the most simplest and cheapest way and

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.650 
the most simplest and cheapest way and
survival<00:01:22.509> if<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:25.060> need<00:01:25.209> to<00:01:25.240> place<00:01:25.479> down

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
survival if they need to place down

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.359 
survival if they need to place down
bedrock<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.380> don't<00:01:26.679> need<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:27.039> make<00:01:27.190> it<00:01:27.280> look

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
bedrock I don't need to make it look

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.109 
bedrock I don't need to make it look
like<00:01:27.550> Jill<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.360> don't<00:01:28.390> have<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:30.330> like<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.479> so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
like Jill you don't have to I like to so

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.359 
like Jill you don't have to I like to so
it<00:01:34.119> is<00:01:34.270> pretty<00:01:34.420> simple<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.830> just<00:01:36.009> once<00:01:36.190> I

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
it is pretty simple and just once I

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.969 
it is pretty simple and just once I
should<00:01:36.520> set<00:01:37.149> up<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.390> pressure<00:01:37.810> plate<00:01:38.170> around

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
should set up the pressure plate around

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.219 
should set up the pressure plate around
the<00:01:39.490> outer<00:01:39.700> edge<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.599> bedrock<00:01:40.990> or

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
the outer edge of the bedrock or

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.089 
the outer edge of the bedrock or
whatever<00:01:41.950> block<00:01:42.340> place<00:01:42.670> on<00:01:42.849> the<00:01:42.910> bottom<00:01:44.099> and

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
whatever block place on the bottom and

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.160 
whatever block place on the bottom and
you<00:01:45.520> can<00:01:45.550> test<00:01:46.330> it<00:01:46.450> out<00:01:46.569> if<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.840> would<00:01:46.989> like<00:01:47.140> to

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
you can test it out if you would like to

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.820 
you can test it out if you would like to
make<00:01:47.649> sure<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:47.950> all<00:01:48.009> works<00:01:50.369> also<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:53.590> will<00:01:53.739> be

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
make sure it all works also this will be

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.729 
make sure it all works also this will be
commenting<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.429> saying<00:01:54.640> oh<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:56.380> break<00:01:56.590> the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:56.739 
commenting and saying oh just break the

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:58.290 
commenting and saying oh just break the
jail<00:01:56.950> it's<00:01:57.340> really<00:01:57.580> meant<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:57.849> be<00:01:58.030> on<00:01:58.239> the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
jail it's really meant to be on the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.749 
jail it's really meant to be on the
server<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:58.929> protected<00:01:59.920> somebody<00:02:00.399> else<00:02:00.580> could

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
server and protected somebody else could

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.630 
server and protected somebody else could
break<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:03.179> so<00:02:05.099> the<00:02:06.099> next<00:02:06.280> thing<00:02:06.399> you<00:02:06.459> want<00:02:06.520> to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
break it so the next thing you want to

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.460 
break it so the next thing you want to
do<00:02:06.789> is<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.090> want<00:02:07.239> to<00:02:07.300> grab<00:02:07.420> some<00:02:07.690> bedrock<00:02:08.050> or

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
do is you want to grab some bedrock or

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.240 
do is you want to grab some bedrock or
again<00:02:09.280> any<00:02:09.610> block<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.090> like<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.069> want<00:02:12.130> to

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
again any block you like and you want to

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.699 
again any block you like and you want to
place<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.610> just<00:02:13.599> enough<00:02:14.080> for<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.379> to<00:02:14.500> walk

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
place it just enough for you to walk

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.610 
place it just enough for you to walk
under<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:16.060> want<00:02:16.239> to<00:02:16.300> make<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.599> right<00:02:17.110> over

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
under and you want to make it right over

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.610 
under and you want to make it right over
the<00:02:18.400> pressure<00:02:18.640> plate<00:02:19.590> right<00:02:20.590> over<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:22.300> then

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
the pressure plate right over and then

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:33.759 
the pressure plate right over and then
just<00:02:23.620> basically<00:02:24.520> do<00:02:24.730> what<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:24.970> do<00:02:25.030> here<00:02:25.390> and

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.209 

of<00:02:34.769> course<00:02:35.159> you<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.609> test<00:02:36.329> it<00:02:36.829> again<00:02:37.829> to<00:02:38.040> make

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
of course you can test it again to make

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.699 
of course you can test it again to make
sure<00:02:38.400> everything<00:02:38.909> works<00:02:39.150> correctly<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.560> way

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
sure everything works correctly the way

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.699 
sure everything works correctly the way
you<00:02:40.769> would<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.189> to<00:02:41.340> what<00:02:45.530> next<00:02:46.530> thing<00:02:46.650> you

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
you would like it to what next thing you

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.770 
you would like it to what next thing you
want<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:46.890> do<00:02:47.069> little<00:02:47.609> this<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.659> the

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
want to do little this is this is the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.660 
want to do little this is this is the
optional<00:02:49.200> part<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.159> make<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.400> look<00:02:50.549> like
