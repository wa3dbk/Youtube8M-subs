00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.470
 but i am andreas vockrodt 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.080
 guitar teacher and organizer of the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.160
 guitars world record and I'll show you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.289
 today what you basically need around 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:28.580
 to play the songs like for example 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:28.580
 highway to hell or tnt 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.200
 or jailbreak 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 was standing 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.770
 O 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770
 O 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 Naturally 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.500
 So what is the secret of the sed you 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.250
 I would say it's easy 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.930
 specially chosen chords and exactly 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.930
 I'll show you now 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.720
 we start with the power chord there 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.660
 simply picks up the index finger 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.290
 the a and b side each on the second 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.500
 bunch and we hit the a and b side 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.500
 on 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.180
 but to play them as a whole 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.070
 normal e major hiker comes in the reason 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.500
 that is taken as it is the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.210
 middle finger on the a side of the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.190
 ring finger on the b side and the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.100
 index finger on the opposite side in the first 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.020
 bunch and you should only use the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.460
 strike four deep strings when the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.650
 it is not so thin with blades 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.250
 bad 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.250
 hdg page 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:16.489
 yes next chord is the g power chord 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.560
 he goes as follows now goes the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.470
 middle finger on the third bunch of 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.930
 before page and the third finger 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.180
 on the hair side in the third bunch and the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.190
 small fingers on the thin side too 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.810
 in the third band the middle finger should be 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.950
 so a bit the a side touches that 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.450
 which can not succeed 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.610
 Now you have all six strings 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.519
 every now and then let lcd them 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.799
 also leave the thin side or leave it 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.390
 even the h page and the beautiful side 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.640
 away and then you should get the chords 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.640
 if possible only strike up to the b side 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.800
 next act is the power chord 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.480
 similar to the epower chord only 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.840
 this time , the index finger on the d 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.940
 and g string each on the second bunch 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.550
 the a side is struck the side 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:12.220
 and g string and can with the thumb too 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.489
 the thick side touch me so 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.470
 to dampen a bit 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.140
 next act is the d accord 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.650
 lcd very often attack them here 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.720
 normally a d converter chord again 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.989
 the thumb touches the thick side 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.030
 index finger g string second bunch 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.099
 middle finger thin side second waistband and 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.810
 ring finger on the hair side in the third 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.060
 band and now we can all again 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.620
 Six strings hit the dge side 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.569
 is damped when I'm the fat 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.260
 side a little more pressure I come to 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.840
 next 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.040
 That power does not coke that 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.390
 really a farmer chord comes however 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.180
 very often at lcd you before 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.380
 which is an the idf is in bars for example, 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.150
 highway to hell a bit more pleasant 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.410
 this chord is perhaps to grab 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.690
 So we have now the index finger 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.760
 on the thick side the middle finger 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.190
 on the b-side on the second and respectively 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 and on the third band of the a-side the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.380
 third finger the draisaitl let in 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.329
 the fall away alternatively comes the accord 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.530
 even so grab the second 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.139
 third and fourth finger 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.229
 that too is a very common one 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.500
 handle way we come already to 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:33.400
 last chord that is a c 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.440
 no chord sounds awful is talking 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.960
 but very easy to pick up practically 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.150
 just like the g-power chord only this one 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.750
 time is the index finger on the a-side 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:47.280
 and at the same time the thick side 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.280
 and the idea side 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.409
 this comes for example at you shook 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.409
 me all night long ago 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:59.739
 yes that was it for today 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:02.709
 I would suggest you practice first 

00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:05.199
 Let's grab those chords clean and 

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:08.289

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.330
