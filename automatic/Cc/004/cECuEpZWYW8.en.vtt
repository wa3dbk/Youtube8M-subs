00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
worth a late-round pick or would you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.410 
worth a late-round pick or would you
still<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.280> rather<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.789> someone<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.179> Josh

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
still just rather have someone like Josh

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.939 
still just rather have someone like Josh
Hill<00:00:48.690> who<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.960> know<00:00:49.109> is<00:00:49.260> probably<00:00:49.769> going<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
Hill who you know is probably going to

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.520 
Hill who you know is probably going to
see<00:00:50.159> more<00:00:50.190> targets<00:00:50.789> right<00:00:50.909> off<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> hop<00:00:51.530> yeah

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
I think I probably would still lean

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.700 
I think I probably would still lean
towards<00:00:54.359> Josh<00:00:54.629> Hill<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.499> the<00:00:55.559> way

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
towards Josh Hill and you and by the way

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.349 
towards Josh Hill and you and by the way

with Brock Osweiler at quarterback so we
don't<00:01:39.690> know<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.320> Denver<00:01:40.680> offenses

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
just yet I it's a little bit too rich

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.270 
just yet I it's a little bit too rich
for<00:01:44.730> my<00:01:44.850> blood<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.420> him<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:46.590> any<00:01:46.830> draft<00:01:47.160> at

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
for my blood to take him in any draft at

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.250 
for my blood to take him in any draft at
this<00:01:47.400> point<00:01:47.640> yeah<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.060> am<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> mean

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
this point yeah I am with you so I mean

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.230 
this point yeah I am with you so I mean
basically<00:01:49.620> I<00:01:49.860> haven't<00:01:50.220> ranked<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.550> low-end

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
basically I haven't ranked as a low-end

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.030 
basically I haven't ranked as a low-end
tight<00:01:51.600> end<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.110> right<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.860> that's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
tight end to right now and that's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.620 
tight end to right now and that's
probably<00:01:53.730> where<00:01:54.000> he's<00:01:54.150> going<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:54.330> end<00:01:54.390> up

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
probably where he's going to end up

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.810 
probably where he's going to end up
being<00:01:54.900> unless<00:01:55.230> something<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:55.590> changes<00:01:56.460> he

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
being unless something really changes he

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.010 
being unless something really changes he
gets<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.150> first<00:01:57.270> team<00:01:57.540> wraps<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.990> know

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
gets the first team wraps you know

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.630 
gets the first team wraps you know
Daniels<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.890> bench<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> one

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
Daniels is on the bench but the one

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.590 
Daniels is on the bench but the one
thing<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.000> always<00:02:00.030> pointed<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.510> with

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
thing that I always pointed out with

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.180 
thing that I always pointed out with
green<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.960> he's<00:02:01.080> one<00:02:01.230> of<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.350> best<00:02:01.470> blockers

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
green is he's one of the best blockers

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.940 
green is he's one of the best blockers
at<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.240> position<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.230> Broncos

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
at the position and with the Broncos

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.680 
at the position and with the Broncos
offensive<00:02:05.400> line<00:02:05.550> kind<00:02:05.760> of<00:02:05.880> banged<00:02:06.120> up<00:02:06.300> he's

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
offensive line kind of banged up he's

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.850 
offensive line kind of banged up he's
probably<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.290> say<00:02:07.409> back<00:02:07.590> in

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
probably have to going to say back in

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.210 
probably have to going to say back in
protect<00:02:08.550> Peyton<00:02:08.879> Manning<00:02:09.209> wony<00:02:09.709> yeah<00:02:10.709> yeah

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
protect Peyton Manning wony yeah yeah

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.309 
protect Peyton Manning wony yeah yeah
and<00:02:11.670> that's<00:02:11.970> part<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.659> reason<00:02:12.780> why<00:02:13.019> he

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
and that's part of the reason why he

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.870 
and that's part of the reason why he
stays<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.860> field<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.190> we're<00:02:14.460> going<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.700> yes

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
stays on the field so we're going to yes

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.050 
stays on the field so we're going to yes
so<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.200> case<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.819> don't

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
so if that's the case to you don't

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.190 
so if that's the case to you don't
necessarily<00:02:18.300> really

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
necessarily really

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.809 
necessarily really
want<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.709> want<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.980> move<00:02:20.160> guy<00:02:20.400> then<00:02:20.670> in

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
want that you want the move guy then in

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.280 
want that you want the move guy then in
that<00:02:20.940> offense<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.629> move<00:02:21.780> guy<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.110> going

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.630 
might look at him definitely in the
fifth<00:03:04.260> at<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.530> point<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.829> becomes<00:03:05.040> value<00:03:05.489> and

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
fifth at that point it becomes value and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.220 
fifth at that point it becomes value and
that's<00:03:05.760> where<00:03:05.940> Kelsey's<00:03:06.420> going<00:03:06.720> currently

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
that's where Kelsey's going currently

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.319 
that's where Kelsey's going currently
but<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:08.310> know<00:03:08.400> did<00:03:08.610> like<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.940> fact<00:03:09.180> that

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
but you know did like the fact that

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.479 
but you know did like the fact that
Russell<00:03:09.720> Wilson<00:03:10.049> looked<00:03:10.380> grams<00:03:10.739> way<00:03:11.040> during

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
Russell Wilson looked grams way during

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.370 
Russell Wilson looked grams way during
the<00:03:11.519> preseason<00:03:11.819> game<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:12.780> should<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:13.230> him

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
the preseason game so we should see him

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.960 
the preseason game so we should see him
integrated<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.099> he's<00:03:14.220> obviously<00:03:14.489> taken<00:03:14.910> a

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
integrated but he's obviously taken a

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.819 
integrated but he's obviously taken a
hit<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.660> more<00:03:15.930> conservative<00:03:16.560> run<00:03:16.709> how

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
hit and that more conservative run how

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.220 
hit and that more conservative run how
to<00:03:16.890> be<00:03:17.010> often<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.849> think<00:03:18.150> that's<00:03:18.390> there<00:03:18.780> that

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
to be often so I think that's there that

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.259 
to be often so I think that's there that
second<00:03:19.799> here<00:03:20.069> Jimmy<00:03:20.400> Graham<00:03:20.670> Travis<00:03:21.120> Kelce

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
second here Jimmy Graham Travis Kelce

second here Jimmy Graham Travis Kelce
Greg<00:03:21.660> Olsen<00:03:22.079> Martellus<00:03:22.920> Bennett<00:03:22.950> we<00:03:23.370> could

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
Greg Olsen Martellus Bennett we could

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.610 
Greg Olsen Martellus Bennett we could
probably<00:03:23.700> toss<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.209> there<00:03:24.389> as<00:03:24.510> well<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:25.560> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
probably toss in there as well is a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.460 
probably toss in there as well is a
pretty<00:03:25.859> 30<00:03:26.190> seconds<00:03:26.579> here<00:03:26.730> after<00:03:27.600> those<00:03:27.930> five

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
