00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
this product but in any event here's how

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
this product but in any event here's how
to<00:00:44.550> correctly<00:00:44.940> apply<00:00:45.300> rigid<00:00:45.960> head<00:00:46.110> flashing

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
to correctly apply rigid head flashing

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.529 
to correctly apply rigid head flashing
all<00:00:46.980> right<00:00:47.100> now<00:00:47.219> we've<00:00:47.399> cut<00:00:47.730> our<00:00:47.910> rigid<00:00:48.359> head

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
all right now we've cut our rigid head

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
all right now we've cut our rigid head
flashing<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> same<00:00:49.680> dimension<00:00:50.160> as

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
flashing so it's the same dimension as

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
flashing so it's the same dimension as
the<00:00:50.370> window<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.480> believe<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the window now we believe this is the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.020 
the window now we believe this is the
right<00:00:52.800> way<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> do<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.730> we're<00:00:53.940> going

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
right way to do it because we're going

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.759 
right way to do it because we're going
to<00:00:54.090> set<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.570> rigid<00:00:54.870> head<00:00:55.050> flashing<00:00:55.289> into<00:00:55.620> wet

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
to set our rigid head flashing into wet

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.020 
to set our rigid head flashing into wet
sealant<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:58.339> you're<00:00:59.339> not<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> set<00:00:59.879> yours

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
sealant if you're not going to set yours

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.910 
sealant if you're not going to set yours
in<00:01:00.390> wet<00:01:00.660> sealant<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.350> think<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> bad<00:01:01.769> idea

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
in wet sealant we think it's a bad idea

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.229 
in wet sealant we think it's a bad idea
but<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.339> you're<00:01:02.460> not<00:01:02.579> gonna<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.059> might

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
but if you're not gonna then you might

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.930 
but if you're not gonna then you might
cut<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.600> long<00:01:03.839> and<00:01:04.080> crimp<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.440> downwards<00:01:04.940> but

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
cut it long and crimp it downwards but

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.030 
cut it long and crimp it downwards but
since<00:01:06.150> we're<00:01:06.390> setting<00:01:06.750> ours<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.230> wet<00:01:07.440> sealant

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
since we're setting ours in wet sealant

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.830 
since we're setting ours in wet sealant
we<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:08.640> think<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> need<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> cut<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.660> long

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
we don't think you need to cut it long

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.560 
we don't think you need to cut it long
and<00:01:10.170> crimp<00:01:10.590> downwards<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.880> first<00:01:12.150> step<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
and crimp downwards the first step is to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.270 
and crimp downwards the first step is to
apply<00:01:12.750> sealant<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.320> top<00:01:13.620> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> window<00:01:14.070> like

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
apply sealant on top of the window like

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.110 
apply sealant on top of the window like
this<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.950> prevents<00:01:17.490> water<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:17.850> getting

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
this this prevents water from getting

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.900 
this this prevents water from getting
under<00:01:18.630> our<00:01:18.780> head<00:01:19.020> flashing<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:20.580> moving

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
under our head flashing and moving

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.990 
under our head flashing and moving
laterally<00:01:22.160> then<00:01:23.160> we<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.490> make<00:01:23.610> sure<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
laterally then we need to make sure that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.290 
laterally then we need to make sure that
there's<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.390> sealant<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.530> wall<00:01:26.180> now<00:01:27.180> if

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
there's what sealant on the wall now if

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.940 
there's what sealant on the wall now if
you're<00:01:27.450> doing<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> exact<00:01:28.470> same<00:01:28.680> time

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
you're doing this if the exact same time

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.500 
you're doing this if the exact same time
as<00:01:29.010> your<00:01:29.280> window<00:01:29.640> you've<00:01:29.880> already<00:01:30.180> got<00:01:30.330> wet

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
as your window you've already got wet

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.270 
as your window you've already got wet
sealant<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.050> wall<00:01:31.200> but<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> case<00:01:32.070> where

the<00:01:32.580> sealant<00:01:32.940> may<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.120> set<00:01:33.330> up<00:01:33.480> put<00:01:34.470> some

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the sealant may have set up put some

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.420 
the sealant may have set up put some
more<00:01:34.890> sealant<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.550> wall<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.240> this

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
now when we press our rigid head

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.800 
now when we press our rigid head
flashing<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.620> place<00:01:41.060> you'll<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> squeezed

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
flashing in place you'll see it squeezed

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.890 
flashing in place you'll see it squeezed
out<00:01:43.020> nicely<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.830> any<00:01:44.520> fasteners<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.600> use

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
will travel through the wet sealant this

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.110 
will travel through the wet sealant this
is<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.580> right<00:01:50.820> way<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:53.190> apply<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.550> rigid<00:01:53.970> head
