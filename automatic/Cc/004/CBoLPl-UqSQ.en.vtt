camera<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> left<00:01:39.270> side<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.810> just

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
camera just the left side you can just

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.179 
camera just the left side you can just
see<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> Hudson<00:01:41.159> River

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
see a little bit of the Hudson River

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.670 
see a little bit of the Hudson River
exactly<00:01:41.939> where<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.630> plane<00:01:42.899> apparently<00:01:43.470> went

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
exactly where this plane apparently went

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
exactly where this plane apparently went
down<00:01:43.890> only<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.189> short<00:01:44.520> time<00:01:44.729> ago<00:01:44.880> we<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.270> told

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
down only a short time ago we are told

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.249 
down only a short time ago we are told
again<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.619> US<00:01:47.100> Air<00:01:47.399> flight<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.509> US<00:01:49.049> Air

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
again it is a US Air flight a US Air

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.649 
again it is a US Air flight a US Air
flight<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:50.009> has<00:01:50.159> gone<00:01:50.369> down<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.000> water

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
flight that has gone down in the water

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.649 
flight that has gone down in the water
the<00:01:51.869> plane<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.420> significant<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.600> case

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the plane as is significant in this case

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.910 
the plane as is significant in this case
appears<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.250> intact<00:01:56.850> still<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.719> point

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
appears to be intact still at this point

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.870 
appears to be intact still at this point
again<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.310> through<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> steam<00:01:59.850> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
again you can see through the steam that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.749 
again you can see through the steam that
adding<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.799> effort<00:02:02.070> making<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.549> such<00:02:02.729> a

adding to this effort making it such a

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.429 
adding to this effort making it such a
challenge<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> simple<00:02:03.869> fact<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.229> it's

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
challenge is the simple fact that it's

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.100 
challenge is the simple fact that it's

take you to a different angle and try to

give you a better sense of exactly what

give you a better sense of exactly what
is<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.250> right<00:02:17.490> now<00:02:17.520> again<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.600> plane

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
is going on right now again this plane

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.440 
is going on right now again this plane
going<00:02:19.680> down<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> Hudson<00:02:20.340> River<00:02:20.640> only<00:02:21.330> a

going down in the Hudson River only a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.900 
going down in the Hudson River only a
short<00:02:21.720> time<00:02:21.930> ago<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:23.190> shot<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.490> it's<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.700> live

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
short time ago this shot is it's a live

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.160 
short time ago this shot is it's a live
picture<00:02:24.150> we're<00:02:24.360> looking<00:02:24.390> at<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.020> just

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
picture we're looking at or is it's just

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.540 
picture we're looking at or is it's just
a<00:02:25.230> picture<00:02:25.410> from<00:02:25.590> a<00:02:25.680> short<00:02:25.890> time<00:02:26.100> ago

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
a picture from a short time ago

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.750 
a picture from a short time ago
I<00:02:27.860> think<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:28.980> shot<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.280> from<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.580> couple

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
I think this shot is just from a couple

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.430 
I think this shot is just from a couple
of<00:02:29.880> moments<00:02:30.060> ago<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.660> see<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:31.050> plane<00:02:31.290> it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
of moments ago you can see that plane it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.780 
of moments ago you can see that plane it
almost<00:02:31.650> appears<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.220> though<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.550> being

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
almost appears as though it's being

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
almost appears as though it's being
tugged<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.630> being<00:02:33.840> pulled<00:02:34.140> forward<00:02:34.470> at

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
tugged in it's being pulled forward at

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.700 
tugged in it's being pulled forward at
this<00:02:35.460> point<00:02:36.080> still<00:02:37.080> trying<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.410> gather<00:02:37.500> more

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
this point still trying to gather more

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.290 
this point still trying to gather more
information<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:38.250> exactly<00:02:38.490> what<00:02:38.910> type<00:02:39.270> of

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
information on exactly what type of

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.210 
information on exactly what type of
plane<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.290> at<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.500> point<00:02:40.590> okay<00:02:40.860> here<00:02:41.160> you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
plane it is at this point okay here you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.440 
plane it is at this point okay here you
go<00:02:41.310> here's<00:02:41.520> a<00:02:41.580> better<00:02:41.790> look<00:02:41.910> now<00:02:42.210> we<00:02:42.270> can

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
go here's a better look now we can

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.750 
go here's a better look now we can
really<00:02:42.690> look<00:02:42.810> at<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.050> much<00:02:43.470> more<00:02:43.680> closely<00:02:43.980> this

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
really look at it much more closely this

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.060 
really look at it much more closely this
appears<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.210> be<00:02:45.330> a<00:02:45.450> US<00:02:45.900> Airways<00:02:46.230> plane<00:02:46.890> that

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
appears to be a US Airways plane that

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.500 
appears to be a US Airways plane that

a call in to the FAA they don't have

a call in to the FAA they don't have
anything<00:02:58.710> immediate<00:02:59.280> but<00:02:59.430> that's<00:02:59.610> because

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
anything immediate but that's because

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.970 
anything immediate but that's because
this<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.180> breaking<00:03:00.630> as<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:00.960> speak<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.770> a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
this is breaking as we speak this is a

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.410 
this is breaking as we speak this is a
it<00:03:02.160> looks<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.520> me<00:03:02.670> like<00:03:02.700> you're<00:03:03.060> looking<00:03:03.240> at<00:03:03.390> a

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
it looks to me like you're looking at a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.680 
it looks to me like you're looking at a
regional<00:03:03.930> jet<00:03:03.990> and<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.370> really<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.360> one

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
regional jet and this is really the one

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.020 
regional jet and this is really the one
of<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> mainstays<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.920> US<00:03:08.160> Airways<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.910> they

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
of the mainstays of US Airways as they

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.800 
of the mainstays of US Airways as they
fly<00:03:09.270> into<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.990> out<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.170> New<00:03:10.500> York<00:03:11.720> listen<00:03:12.720> I

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
fly into and out of New York listen I

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.000 
fly into and out of New York listen I
think<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.140> have<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.350> look<00:03:13.470> at<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.710> fact<00:03:13.950> that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
think you have to look at the fact that

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.740 
think you have to look at the fact that
they've<00:03:14.160> got<00:03:14.190> one<00:03:14.610> door<00:03:14.880> open<00:03:15.240> in<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.360> front

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
they've got one door open in the front

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.920 
they've got one door open in the front
and<00:03:15.959> thus<00:03:16.260> far<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.860> looks<00:03:17.160> like<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:18.150> plane<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and thus far it looks like the plane the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.770 
and thus far it looks like the plane the
the<00:03:19.440> actual<00:03:19.800> fuselage<00:03:20.520> is<00:03:20.880> above<00:03:21.360> water

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
the actual fuselage is above water

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.080 
the actual fuselage is above water
you've<00:03:22.770> got<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:23.010> right<00:03:23.250> now<00:03:23.459> be<00:03:23.640> worried<00:03:23.940> about

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
you've got a right now be worried about

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.240 
you've got a right now be worried about
the<00:03:24.270> people<00:03:24.690> inside<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:25.500> there<00:03:25.650> are<00:03:25.890> people

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
the people inside if there are people

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.520 
the people inside if there are people
inside<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.910> exposure<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.690> very<00:03:28.050> frigid

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
inside and exposure to that very frigid

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.830 
inside and exposure to that very frigid
water<00:03:28.770> in<00:03:29.040> Hudson<00:03:29.820> Bay<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.239> see<00:03:30.540> there<00:03:30.750> it

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
water in Hudson Bay you see there it

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.780 
water in Hudson Bay you see there it
looks<00:03:31.020> to<00:03:31.170> me<00:03:31.200> like<00:03:31.320> you've<00:03:31.680> got<00:03:31.890> New<00:03:32.640> York

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
looks to me like you've got New York

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.880 
looks to me like you've got New York
City<00:03:33.030> Fire<00:03:33.780> Department<00:03:33.810> boats<00:03:34.560> that<00:03:34.830> are

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
City Fire Department boats that are

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.340 
City Fire Department boats that are
right<00:03:35.160> alongside<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:36.090> plane<00:03:36.480> but<00:03:37.230> that

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
right alongside that plane but that

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.990 
right alongside that plane but that
certainly<00:03:37.500> looks<00:03:37.830> like<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.070> regional<00:03:38.580> jet<00:03:38.610> to

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
certainly looks like a regional jet to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.880
