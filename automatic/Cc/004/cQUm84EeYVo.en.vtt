00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:50.309
 bar the windows phone 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:53.539
 souza is a very simple question about 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.660
 the gorilla glass because many people 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.300
 complaining that their handsets nokia 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.980
 regardless of whether the brand falls on the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 floor devices that have technology 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.820
 gorilla glass and breaks the screen to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.540
 I 'll start by explaining to you a 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.659
 thing what the government of greece gorilla 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.600
 glass is nothing less than one 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.530
 an improvement of glass with the world 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.310
 the device's touchscreen reached the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.479
 Greece 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:33.060
 he is as follows he is resistant to 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.189
 risks and small impacts is much 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.220
 we talk about the gorilla glass is resistant 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.939
 to risks and no wrong impacts 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.860
 the olÃ© is resistant to scratches and 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.630
 small impacts what happens 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.770
 said that it is resistant to scratches not that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.360
 risk-proof 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.399
 so it goes it can scratch 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.869
 or phone of goiania 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.990
 1 2 or 3 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.329
 it can scratch the screen the same way 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.750
 and what would that be resistant to 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.520
 small impacts is the following I am 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.009
 here with windows phone computer 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.860
 Souza this is the number 720 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.390
 windows phone souza here I'm here 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.290
 I use it to make videos and use it too 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.650
 normally 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.200
 He is. If you do not know, he's with 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.939
 film I use film on it 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.790
 the film matca only what happens 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:29.799
 I'll explain the following to you here. 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.430
 Is my name's screen on beauty care? 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.390
 glass scratch resistant beauty of this 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.480
 Part I will not talk 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.849
 Let's focus more on dropping the telephone. 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.530
 It fell from 35 to five centimeters and 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.879
 broke the screen what happens to us 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.579
 has to know the following goalkeeper 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.680
 agazzi resistant to small impacts 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.859
 impact are these is not that impact 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.260
 telephone and small office 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.239
 impacts that is resistant to pressure is 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.239
 it's not impacts 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.239
 so it is pressure that it is resistant 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.239
 equal 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.489
 it is resistant to small impacts 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.989
 when telephone and fax machine what 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.560
 I happen to explain what happens to 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.449
 the glass if your name falls off the screen 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.010
 front in our view the surface 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.769
 flat 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.690
 he runs the very great risk of not 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.970
 break the screen and that's what you 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.489
 heard if he wants a surface 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.650
 if it falls completely straight into the 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.099
 flat surface the probability of it 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.919
 being heard in doubt is too small 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.949
 is this really because the following what we 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:38.169
 know is heard it is not flexible 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:41.199
 video does not have you double ear 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:45.489
 it is not flexible when the device 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:47.230
 falls flat on a flat surface 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.470
 only he has to go straight from the galley that 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.659
 happens in physics every time the object 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.980
 falls you have a gravitational force 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.590
 pushing the object down and when 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.859
 it hits the ground another force 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.359
 pushes up and it is this force that has 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.690
 cartel absorb old 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:11.739
 if I'm not mistaken, this is it if it does not 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.870
 for michael straight on any surface 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.090
 flat what do you know why he runs 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.039
 risk of not breaking because it forces 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.289
 was assigned back on the screen of the 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.480
 device it will be distributed by 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.820
 equal 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.070
 you will not be able to cushion the impact 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.190
 then that force will be distributed 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.610
 glass for the same 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.720
 device crashes or weather 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.790
 the higher pressure is coming from here 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.100
 part that hits the first as alive 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.370
 it is not flexible what is the only way 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.200
 free flight at joking pressure 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.150
 this is the only way for glass to 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.170
 pressure one thing I recommend for 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.420
 you 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:56.920
 composed the unit make sure that a 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.770
 thing it is glass or plastic screen 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.690
 if it is a plastic beauty screen you 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.340
 puts on a film that guarantees that 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.750
 will win and not have to worry 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.690
 with falls because he will not 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.690
 break a whole says on your phone 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.850
 has glass screen immediately not that 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.790
 the actor is nothing more than that 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:19.360
 immediately do the following put in 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.540
 silicone film and cap 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.970
 I much prefer the silicone cap . 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.030
 I think she gets a lot better at it. 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.950
 handset besides protecting cute 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.170
 if you do not like you movie neither 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.970
 ethically because the film is 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.590
 down in a few pictures but I 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.410
 I'm already used to it. 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.090
 very simple option that is the flip cover 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.430
 have you heard 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.200
 click on windows phone souza 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.600
 which will take you to the channel video 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.120
 of the direct tank where he explains about 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.130
 the cours clip and deal with the links that 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.440
 you can buy for your device 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.560
 so click now if you want to know 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.730
 coolest curve that's it folks if your 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.950
 device with the colleague broke the screen that 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.610
 we can do nothing this is one thing 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.900
 very thing one thing happens 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.190
 falls and if you can not avoid 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.470
 You have to take utmost care. 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.580
 possible that my nokia lumia that he is 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.110
 very rebellious 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.180
 whenever you try to get it out of my pocket 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.400
 he is threatening to fall on the ground but the 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.660
 securely and he does not fall 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.570
 are you guys I would like to 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.660
 explain to you the gorilla glass is yes 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.660
 resistant to scratches and small impacts 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.640
 only if he breaks the fault is not the 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:34.080
 because he fulfilled his 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:37.289
 paper it is impact resistant 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.300
 the pressure it is resistant to pressure it 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:41.370
 not resistant to kinetic drops 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.960
 because ear it is normal to play in 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.259
 that the only way to 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:51.030
 relieve the pressure now on the issue of 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:53.069
 impression it is already existing as 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.740
 Are you talking here is resistant to 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:58.830
 pressure and not falls 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.659

 try to be quiet because I have 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:07.919
