furniture by now most communities
collect<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.290> recycle<00:00:10.559> their<00:00:10.889> cardboard

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
collect and recycle their cardboard

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.129 
collect and recycle their cardboard
turning<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.059> into<00:00:12.179> something<00:00:12.480> useful<00:00:12.750> like

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
turning it into something useful like

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.320 
turning it into something useful like
insulation<00:00:13.830> or<00:00:14.009> pet<00:00:14.219> bedding<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.179> on

gummy<00:00:15.660> style<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.139> think<00:00:16.379> we<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.680> go<00:00:16.800> one

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
gummy style we think we can go one

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
gummy style we think we can go one
better<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.550> actually<00:00:18.090> reuse<00:00:18.570> not<00:00:19.050> recycle

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
better and actually reuse not recycle

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.529 
better and actually reuse not recycle
the<00:00:19.740> cardboard<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.430> avoid<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.029> waste<00:00:21.240> stream

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the cardboard and avoid the waste stream

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.450 
the cardboard and avoid the waste stream
all<00:00:21.689> together<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.650> first<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.100> got<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.279> get

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
all together but first we got to get

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.130 
all together but first we got to get
enough<00:00:23.699> material<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.300> actually<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> work

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
enough material to actually do the work

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.560 
enough material to actually do the work
so<00:00:25.380> we're<00:00:25.830> here<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.130> San<00:00:26.340> Francisco's<00:00:26.910> recycle

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
so we're here at San Francisco's recycle

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.970 
so we're here at San Francisco's recycle
central<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.320> get<00:00:28.500> some<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.890> material

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
central to get some of the material

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:45.350 
central to get some of the material
before<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.730> gets<00:00:29.970> recycled

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.610 

most<00:00:46.360> people<00:00:46.660> think<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.900> cardboard<00:00:47.410> as<00:00:47.590> a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
most people think of cardboard as a

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.290 
most people think of cardboard as a
material<00:00:48.160> that<00:00:48.310> really<00:00:48.490> doesn't<00:00:48.850> have<00:00:49.090> a<00:00:49.120> lot

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
material that really doesn't have a lot

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.910 
material that really doesn't have a lot
of<00:00:49.450> strength<00:00:49.780> once<00:00:50.050> it's<00:00:50.200> been<00:00:50.350> bent<00:00:50.680> or

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
of strength once it's been bent or

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.250 
of strength once it's been bent or
scored<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:51.730> sort<00:00:51.970> of<00:00:52.030> loses<00:00:52.240> its<00:00:52.510> structural

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
scored it sort of loses its structural

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.530 
scored it sort of loses its structural
integrity<00:00:53.530> but<00:00:53.980> really<00:00:54.700> that's<00:00:54.880> not<00:00:54.970> true

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
integrity but really that's not true

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.270 
integrity but really that's not true
now<00:00:55.990> this<00:00:56.170> box<00:00:56.380> you<00:00:56.560> can<00:00:56.710> see<00:00:56.860> it's<00:00:56.980> already

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
now this box you can see it's already

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.010 
now this box you can see it's already
kind<00:00:57.550> of<00:00:57.580> falling<00:00:57.910> apart<00:00:58.030> but<00:00:58.690> just<00:00:58.930> by

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
kind of falling apart but just by

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.390 
kind of falling apart but just by
keeping<00:00:59.380> the<00:00:59.530> relative<00:00:59.980> structural

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
keeping the relative structural

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.340 
keeping the relative structural
integrity<00:01:00.640> up<00:01:01.030> right<00:01:01.240> here<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.810> up<00:01:02.050> right<00:01:02.170> on

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
integrity up right here and up right on

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.760 
integrity up right here and up right on
this<00:01:02.530> angle<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.940> holding<00:01:04.270> his<00:01:04.420> entire<00:01:04.770> 750

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
this angle it's holding his entire 750

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.720 
this angle it's holding his entire 750
pound<00:01:05.980> body<00:01:06.220> weight<00:01:07.800> so<00:01:08.800> Chad<00:01:09.220> this<00:01:09.400> is<00:01:09.460> the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
pound body weight so Chad this is the

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.670 
pound body weight so Chad this is the
approach<00:01:10.150> that<00:01:10.180> you're<00:01:10.900> gonna<00:01:11.050> take<00:01:11.320> which<00:01:11.530> is

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
approach that you're gonna take which is

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.330 
approach that you're gonna take which is
a<00:01:11.890> tongue-and-groove<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:14.170> called<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:15.040> tab

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
a tongue-and-groove it's called a tab

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.940 
a tongue-and-groove it's called a tab
slot<00:01:16.240> from<00:01:17.200> what<00:01:17.410> it<00:01:17.500> looks<00:01:17.680> like<00:01:17.800> you're

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
slot from what it looks like you're

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.820 
slot from what it looks like you're
going<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.100> be<00:01:18.220> using<00:01:18.550> nothing<00:01:18.790> but<00:01:19.710> pieces<00:01:20.710> of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
going to be using nothing but pieces of

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.560 
going to be using nothing but pieces of
cardboard<00:01:21.070> upright<00:01:21.640> like<00:01:21.820> this<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.300> then<00:01:22.540> a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
cardboard upright like this and then a

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.510 
cardboard upright like this and then a
series<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:23.110> pieces<00:01:23.290> kind<00:01:23.740> of<00:01:23.860> slide<00:01:24.160> it<00:01:24.340> into

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
series of pieces kind of slide it into

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.670 
series of pieces kind of slide it into
it<00:01:24.729> like<00:01:24.880> this<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.360> as<00:01:25.930> you<00:01:26.110> put<00:01:26.320> those<00:01:26.410> pieces

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
it like this and as you put those pieces

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.850 
it like this and as you put those pieces
together<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.430> makes<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.210> structural<00:01:28.690> unit

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.920 

then<00:01:32.860> now<00:01:32.979> we're<00:01:33.190> making<00:01:33.310> another<00:01:34.210> chair<00:01:34.570> here

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
then now we're making another chair here

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.440 
then now we're making another chair here
using<00:01:35.259> cardboard<00:01:35.530> that's<00:01:36.009> much<00:01:36.250> more<00:01:36.490> raw<00:01:37.150> and

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
using cardboard that's much more raw and

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.749 
using cardboard that's much more raw and
scrappy<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.740> pieces<00:01:39.190> don't<00:01:39.310> match<00:01:39.490> so

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
scrappy and the pieces don't match so

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.160 
scrappy and the pieces don't match so
much<00:01:39.940> so<00:01:40.450> we're<00:01:40.570> going<00:01:40.660> to<00:01:40.720> use<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:40.900> technique

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
much so we're going to use a technique

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.440 
much so we're going to use a technique
that<00:01:41.619> kind<00:01:42.430> of<00:01:42.460> compensates<00:01:43.030> for<00:01:43.119> that<00:01:43.240> and

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
that kind of compensates for that and

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.969 
that kind of compensates for that and
still<00:01:43.630> make<00:01:43.750> something<00:01:44.110> structural<00:01:44.650> even

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
still make something structural even

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.800 
still make something structural even
though<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.220> pieces<00:01:45.490> are<00:01:45.610> pretty<00:01:45.700> sloppy<00:01:46.030> what

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
though the pieces are pretty sloppy what

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.180 
though the pieces are pretty sloppy what
we're<00:01:46.900> going<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.050> end<00:01:47.229> up<00:01:47.320> with<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.800> kind<00:01:48.100> of

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
we're going to end up with is a kind of

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.950 
we're going to end up with is a kind of
lounge<00:01:48.400> chair<00:01:48.790> that<00:01:49.390> looks<00:01:49.570> something<00:01:49.810> like

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
lounge chair that looks something like

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.550 
lounge chair that looks something like
this<00:01:50.650> low<00:01:51.550> to<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.730> ground<00:01:52.560> comfortable

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
this low to the ground comfortable

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.350 
this low to the ground comfortable
something<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.700> wouldn't<00:01:54.970> mind<00:01:55.120> sitting

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
something that you wouldn't mind sitting

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.120 
something that you wouldn't mind sitting
in<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.720> watch<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:56.020> movie<00:01:56.320> or<00:01:56.440> play<00:01:56.470> video<00:01:56.740> games

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
in to watch a movie or play video games

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.219 
in to watch a movie or play video games
we'll<00:01:57.909> see<00:01:58.060> how<00:01:58.210> far<00:01:58.420> we<00:01:58.570> get<00:01:58.780> but<00:01:59.050> what's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
we'll see how far we get but what's

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.930 
we'll see how far we get but what's
interesting<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.070> chair<00:02:00.370> it's<00:02:00.640> actually

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
interesting is that chair it's actually

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.250 
interesting is that chair it's actually
being<00:02:01.120> compressed<00:02:01.479> together<00:02:01.900> because

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
being compressed together because

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.360 
being compressed together because
there's<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.560> hole<00:02:02.770> drilled<00:02:02.979> through<00:02:03.130> each

through<00:02:05.440> that<00:02:05.650> hole<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.010> then<00:02:06.340> there's<00:02:06.550> just

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
through that hole and then there's just

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.150 
through that hole and then there's just
a<00:02:06.820> washer<00:02:07.150> in<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.360> nut<00:02:07.510> on<00:02:07.630> either<00:02:07.780> end

everyday<00:04:06.510> chair<00:04:07.050> this<00:04:07.530> particular<00:04:07.920> design<00:04:08.489> I

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
everyday chair this particular design I

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.100 
everyday chair this particular design I
would<00:04:08.820> probably<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.480> give<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> thumbs

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
would probably have to give a thumbs

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.920 
would probably have to give a thumbs
down<00:04:10.230> to<00:04:10.440> like<00:04:11.160> we<00:04:11.310> suspected<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:12.420> back<00:04:12.690> leg

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
down to like we suspected this back leg

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.900 
down to like we suspected this back leg
having<00:04:13.380> no<00:04:13.530> support<00:04:14.220> on<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.400> at<00:04:14.580> all<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.880> a

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
having no support on it at all is a

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.199 
having no support on it at all is a
little<00:04:15.180> bit<00:04:15.299> flimsy<00:04:15.720> however<00:04:16.500> as<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:17.580> beautiful

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
little bit flimsy however as a beautiful

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.409 
little bit flimsy however as a beautiful
piece<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.630> art<00:04:19.049> hanging<00:04:19.979> on<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.250> wall<00:04:23.210> not<00:04:24.210> so

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
piece of art hanging on the wall not so

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.710 
piece of art hanging on the wall not so
bad<00:04:25.220> but<00:04:26.220> this<00:04:26.400> was<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.580> good<00:04:26.790> experiment<00:04:27.180> we

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
bad but this was a good experiment we

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.180 
bad but this was a good experiment we
try<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:27.990> design<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.560> we<00:04:28.680> just<00:04:28.860> pretty<00:04:29.100> much

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
try to design that we just pretty much

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.240 
try to design that we just pretty much
made<00:04:29.550> up<00:04:29.700> on<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.030> spot<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:31.860> really<00:04:32.130> only

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
made up on the spot and it really only

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.800 
made up on the spot and it really only
took<00:04:32.460> us<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.729> couple<00:04:32.760> hours<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.300> labor<00:04:33.600> to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
took us a couple hours of labor to

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.900 
took us a couple hours of labor to
figure<00:04:34.050> out<00:04:34.200> if<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.500> design<00:04:34.800> works<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.340> would

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
figure out if the design works I would

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.730 
figure out if the design works I would
say<00:04:36.060> we're<00:04:36.240> mostly<00:04:36.600> there<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:37.080> with<00:04:37.410> just<00:04:37.650> a

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
say we're mostly there and with just a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.620 
say we're mostly there and with just a
couple<00:04:37.979> of<00:04:38.070> modifications<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:39.270> design

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
couple of modifications this design

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.600 
couple of modifications this design
would<00:04:39.810> be<00:04:39.870> rock<00:04:40.140> solid<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:41.130> can<00:04:41.280> see<00:04:41.460> that

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
would be rock solid you can see that

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.700 
would be rock solid you can see that
you've<00:04:41.700> got<00:04:41.729> a<00:04:42.090> piece<00:04:42.720> going<00:04:43.020> this<00:04:43.169> way<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.560> a

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
you've got a piece going this way and a

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.740 
you've got a piece going this way and a
piece<00:04:43.919> going<00:04:44.100> this<00:04:44.370> way<00:04:44.550> what<00:04:45.360> you're<00:04:45.510> really

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
piece going this way what you're really

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.300 
piece going this way what you're really
missing<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.229> third<00:04:46.620> component<00:04:47.130> of<00:04:47.250> a

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
missing is that third component of a

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.850 
missing is that third component of a
piece<00:04:47.520> going<00:04:47.850> this<00:04:48.360> way<00:04:48.540> on<00:04:49.169> each<00:04:49.350> of<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.650> legs

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
piece going this way on each of the legs

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.320 
piece going this way on each of the legs
and<00:04:50.130> that<00:04:50.430> way<00:04:50.550> these<00:04:50.729> legs<00:04:51.000> would<00:04:51.180> then

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
and that way these legs would then

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.850 
and that way these legs would then
become

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
become

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.010 
become
very<00:04:51.949> independently<00:04:52.759> strong<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.449> structural

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
very independently strong and structural

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.390 
very independently strong and structural
whereas<00:04:54.500> right<00:04:54.710> now<00:04:54.889> they<00:04:55.069> still<00:04:55.250> have<00:04:55.310> a

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
whereas right now they still have a

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.520 
whereas right now they still have a
tendency<00:04:55.879> to<00:04:55.969> be<00:04:56.090> flexible<00:04:56.599> all<00:04:57.020> in<00:04:57.229> all<00:04:57.349> our

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
tendency to be flexible all in all our

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.080 
tendency to be flexible all in all our
experiments<00:04:58.069> were<00:04:58.159> pretty<00:04:58.400> interesting<00:04:58.879> we

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
experiments were pretty interesting we

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.420 
experiments were pretty interesting we
learned<00:04:59.270> a<00:04:59.360> couple<00:04:59.509> of<00:04:59.750> things<00:04:59.900> one<00:05:00.770> from<00:05:01.219> this

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
learned a couple of things one from this

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.040 
learned a couple of things one from this
lounge<00:05:01.879> chair<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:02.389> we<00:05:02.479> made<00:05:02.659> we<00:05:02.840> learned

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
lounge chair that we made we learned

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.719 
lounge chair that we made we learned
that<00:05:03.229> when<00:05:03.680> you<00:05:03.770> compress<00:05:04.159> cardboard

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
that when you compress cardboard

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.969 
that when you compress cardboard
together<00:05:04.909> it<00:05:05.419> becomes<00:05:05.719> extremely<00:05:06.139> strong

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
together it becomes extremely strong

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.640 
together it becomes extremely strong
rigid<00:05:07.550> and<00:05:07.879> structural<00:05:08.539> and<00:05:09.139> in<00:05:09.259> this<00:05:09.379> chair

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
rigid and structural and in this chair

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.320 
rigid and structural and in this chair
is<00:05:09.770> rock<00:05:09.979> solid<00:05:10.219> as<00:05:10.580> if<00:05:10.699> it<00:05:10.819> was<00:05:10.939> made<00:05:11.090> from<00:05:11.240> a

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
is rock solid as if it was made from a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.390 
is rock solid as if it was made from a
single<00:05:11.539> piece<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:11.840> wood<00:05:11.990> so<00:05:12.740> I<00:05:13.009> think<00:05:13.219> we

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
single piece of wood so I think we

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.980 
single piece of wood so I think we
should<00:05:13.430> make<00:05:13.729> one<00:05:13.759> or<00:05:14.120> two<00:05:14.240> more<00:05:14.449> chairs<00:05:14.689> like

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
should make one or two more chairs like

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.770 
should make one or two more chairs like
this<00:05:15.020> maybe<00:05:15.800> even<00:05:16.129> an<00:05:16.219> ottoman<00:05:16.610> or<00:05:17.270> even

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
this maybe even an ottoman or even

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.540 
this maybe even an ottoman or even
turned<00:05:17.960> it<00:05:18.080> into<00:05:18.199> a<00:05:18.319> couch<00:05:18.590> but<00:05:19.129> the<00:05:19.250> next

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
turned it into a couch but the next

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.550 
turned it into a couch but the next
reuse<00:05:19.909> project<00:05:20.389> for<00:05:20.539> the<00:05:20.599> game<00:05:20.810> room<00:05:21.020> is<00:05:21.139> a

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
reuse project for the game room is a

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.100 
reuse project for the game room is a
coffee<00:05:21.979> table<00:05:22.280> or<00:05:22.699> some<00:05:23.090> end<00:05:23.270> tables<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:24.020> I

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
coffee table or some end tables and I

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.600 
coffee table or some end tables and I
think<00:05:24.349> the<00:05:24.439> perfect<00:05:24.650> material<00:05:25.279> for<00:05:25.310> that

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
think the perfect material for that

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.580 
think the perfect material for that
would<00:05:25.729> be<00:05:25.849> from<00:05:26.060> these<00:05:26.419> some<00:05:26.629> found<00:05:26.930> steel

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
would be from these some found steel

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.350 
would be from these some found steel
pipe<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.159> some<00:05:28.279> other<00:05:28.430> scrounge<00:05:28.759> materials

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
pipe and some other scrounge materials

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.490 
pipe and some other scrounge materials
stay<00:05:30.319> tuned<00:05:30.469> for<00:05:30.710> that<00:05:30.770> project<00:05:31.009> next
