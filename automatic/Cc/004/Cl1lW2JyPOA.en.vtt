00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.240
 we have here a perfect example of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.570
 someone who has just examined mine 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.059
 because it seems short because it is not 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.650
 with a moment we are here in scene of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.710
 celebration 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:22.599
 it is already god we have finished feeling 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.599
 from liberation to joy and over here 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.970
 more worried 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.559
 julia are very happy 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.140
 the sun that has had experience I am 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.140
 is a resident of 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.140
 banxico 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.630
 no no no no 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 one 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.040
 but it is a woman motivation that the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.820
 silence and push very correct appointments 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.820
 that they have to street 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.790
 backwards 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.999
 then a speech then 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.330
 but then I hope now that this 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.920
 it's a speech that we started with the 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.920
 prepared cup listen to them 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 single 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.770
 of all these 78 months 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.310
 I prefer the essence 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.680
 good 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.180
 so the essence of that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.350
 although if we are below 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:46.050
 creators with merchandise 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:50.190
 again very grown up to be with 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.360
 you and slaves always have to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.360
 hold on until I die 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.769
 A) Yes 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.060
 for a few moments we are going to leave 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.090
 cortizo juniors 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.800
 and let's move on to cortizo sr 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.990
 I'm fine 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.990
 It is this speech of Mr. Party
