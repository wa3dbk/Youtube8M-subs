 card for the camp and I just you 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.739

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.840
 forbidding lags to break just go 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.690

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.899
 stampede for camp hi camp buy 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.439
 imagine rusik pliz just write very 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.820
 for a long time do not blow anything up 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.409
 don't even think to just go through the map 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.880
 read me not to tear indies not to attack 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.479
 do not press buttons on pressure plates 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.290
 and the other also and even there i will say that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.409
 so you must strictly follow paragraph 1 and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.689
 second etc. can only be if you 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.030
 chose the same path and basically 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.549
 further standard set of rules a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.689
 but the complexity of not tearing down religion 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.930
 or do you even go through this card quickly 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.840
 note that everywhere 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:50.579
 farther i write so they translit ok 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.799
 okay you're like you're going about parkour 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.560
 little things are we don't even have to 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:01.680
 do anything to go through the card then I 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.790
 blow up she'll blow up all decide 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.790

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:18.420
 Generally ass not flew need to 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.640
 anyone pushed this ass who would 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.430
 it could be listening to a thousand people on 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:33.980
 server, you can choose anyone here to you 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:38.220

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:42.110
 a pair of needles with a needle a little puffer fish 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.190

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.489

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:17.669
 the village stole 10 smells under cut 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.720

00:04:51.199 --> 00:05:06.930
 I think you know what we really do. 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:10.560
 that almost all three are what we do in short i 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.270
 just noticed here that at first they 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.699
 not very interested to play all 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:25.550
 difficulties besides not yes i was right i 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:29.090
 having chosen that notebook and it did not come 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:33.720
 hip you saw it 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.770
 packs I watched it would be cool go 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:47.210
 I can't come here 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:47.210
 lager is a little bit higher than i am a little bit 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.919
 something has not fallen so far about one foot 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:06:00.210
 a quest attempt well my question 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:02.400
 ohnut interesting here so let's you 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.610
 that here ours would be so mechanisms 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.780
 mechanisms mechanisms we are here such stand 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:12.240
 standing standing throw rights and freedoms 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.270
 cheek not free look down and again 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.950
 the same camp realized Card 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.050
 it turned out cool to me personally 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.880
 I liked what was made of 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.960
 dynamite and we didn't have there dynamite 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.700
 arrange but we still 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.040
 I think we will arrange it with lager then at least 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.930
 we will blow up the village to want something 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.730
 yourself blow it up already for us even the map 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.110
 blows it up somehow don't be with us 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:35.669
 pass and lay there on the canal yes 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:40.350

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:42.240
 thanks for the leader lags also rip 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.350
 attack if suddenly for the first time share 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.620
 on our channels 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:50.190
 what else by the way did you notice that in this 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.669
 the series had no neighbor so i think this 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:58.140
 deserves Huskies need those so was not 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:07:05.810
 who took the house there must be half-camp 

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:05.810
 did not want to save money
