defense so I'm ma my videos can only be

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.700 
defense so I'm ma my videos can only be
10<00:00:14.969> minutes<00:00:15.150> long<00:00:15.450> as<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.719> know<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.109> we're

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
10 minutes long as you know and we're

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.019 
10 minutes long as you know and we're
going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.920> examine<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.670> different

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
going to examine the different

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.189 
going to examine the different
variations<00:00:19.640> in<00:00:20.640> different<00:00:21.600> videos<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.109> I'm

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
variations in different videos so I'm

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.140 
variations in different videos so I'm
only<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.680> cover<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:23.189> variation<00:00:23.580> per

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
only going to cover one variation per

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.960 
only going to cover one variation per
video<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:25.859> Chinese<00:00:26.220> dragon<00:00:26.640> happens

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
video and the Chinese dragon happens

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.929 
video and the Chinese dragon happens
after<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:28.109> typical<00:00:28.650> Yugoslavia<00:00:29.460> tak<00:00:29.640> moves

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
after you typical Yugoslavia tak moves

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.910 
after you typical Yugoslavia tak moves
so<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.929> don't<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.260> need<00:00:31.470> much<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.769> an

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
so we don't really need much of an

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.100 
so we don't really need much of an
explanation<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.930> you're<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
explanation for for this if you're a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.630 
explanation for for this if you're a
dragon<00:00:34.440> player<00:00:34.770> you've<00:00:35.010> probably<00:00:35.370> played

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.770 
dragon player you've probably played
this<00:00:35.969> tons<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> times<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:38.090> yes<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.300> course<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
this tons of times and yes of course the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.569 
this tons of times and yes of course the
other<00:00:39.930> variations<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.800> totally<00:00:41.190> playable

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
other variations are totally playable

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.910 
other variations are totally playable
but<00:00:41.969> we're<00:00:42.930> looking<00:00:43.170> at<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> chinese<00:00:43.710> dragon

variations Bishop to be three is not

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.639 
variations Bishop to be three is not
technically<00:01:00.359> forced<00:01:00.899> air<00:01:01.109> although<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
still the most common move and I guess

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.969 
still the most common move and I guess
it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.170> prudent<00:01:04.860> action<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:06.600> five

certainly playable h4 is the move that

the option of taking on b3 which is

the option of taking on b3 which is

actually the best thing to do in some
variations<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> be<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> best

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
variations and it's going to be the best

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
bishop can come to d5 so position it

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.830

looks like blacks horrible but in fact
that's<00:03:40.080> not<00:03:40.349> really<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.769> case<00:03:40.799> Knight<00:03:41.790> takes

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
that's not really the case Knight takes

b3 gets rid of that powerful attacking
piece<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:46.879> obviously<00:03:47.879> we<00:03:48.000> can<00:03:48.150> take<00:03:48.299> back

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
piece and obviously we can take back

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.320

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
option here pawn takes actually is a lot

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.400 
option here pawn takes actually is a lot
worse<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.419> a<00:04:28.479> move<00:04:28.660> because<00:04:28.870> why<00:04:29.050> it<00:04:29.110> doesn't

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
worse of a move because why it doesn't

cases we can come up to f5 with the
bishop<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.389> put<00:04:34.930> more<00:04:35.110> pressure<00:04:35.259> so<00:04:35.680> rip

black<00:04:53.289> has<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.680> pretty<00:04:53.860> powerful<00:04:54.160> idea<00:04:54.699> what

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
black has a pretty powerful idea what

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.460 
black has a pretty powerful idea what
the<00:04:54.970> smooth<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.449> rook<00:04:55.599> is<00:04:55.780> simply<00:04:56.199> going<00:04:56.349> to

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
the smooth the rook is simply going to

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.310 
the smooth the rook is simply going to
shift<00:04:56.800> over<00:04:57.039> to<00:04:57.310> be<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.759> file<00:04:58.570> perhaps<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.229> then

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
shift over to be a file perhaps and then

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.969 
shift over to be a file perhaps and then
come<00:05:00.190> down<00:05:00.220> here<00:05:00.639> it's<00:05:01.180> an<00:05:01.330> idea<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:02.199> it<00:05:02.800> also

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
come down here it's an idea and it also

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.219 
come down here it's an idea and it also
gives<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.580> d6<00:05:04.030> bones<00:05:04.270> of<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:04.539> defense<00:05:04.840> and<00:05:05.080> in

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
gives the d6 bones of the defense and in

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.529 
gives the d6 bones of the defense and in
the<00:05:05.349> future<00:05:05.530> a<00:05:05.979> pawn<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.310> will<00:05:06.639> come<00:05:06.849> to<00:05:06.970> f6

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
the future a pawn that will come to f6

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.200 
the future a pawn that will come to f6
and<00:05:07.810> we'll<00:05:08.289> see<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:09.160> ID<00:05:09.340> developing<00:05:10.030> in<00:05:10.120> a

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
and we'll see that ID developing in a

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.469 
and we'll see that ID developing in a
moment<00:05:10.539> now<00:05:11.289> real<00:05:11.979> quickly<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.789> want<00:05:13.120> to<00:05:13.210> show

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
moment now real quickly I want to show

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.499 
moment now real quickly I want to show
you<00:05:13.539> am<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.470> little<00:05:15.099> opening<00:05:15.669> trap<00:05:16.030> here<00:05:16.330> that

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
you am a little opening trap here that

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.060 
you am a little opening trap here that
white<00:05:16.690> can<00:05:16.900> fall<00:05:17.139> into<00:05:17.320> if<00:05:17.530> he<00:05:17.650> doesn't<00:05:17.979> know

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
white can fall into if he doesn't know

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.490 
white can fall into if he doesn't know
the<00:05:18.220> line<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:18.750> obviously<00:05:19.750> this<00:05:19.990> is<00:05:20.169> not<00:05:20.199> the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
the line and obviously this is not the

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.490 
the line and obviously this is not the
best<00:05:20.650> moves<00:05:21.009> but<00:05:21.190> it<00:05:21.310> does<00:05:21.550> showcase<00:05:22.090> them<00:05:22.500> the

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
best moves but it does showcase them the

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:32.490 
best moves but it does showcase them the
idea<00:05:23.919> um<00:05:26.220> g4<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:30.240> rook<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.389> six<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.960> better<00:05:31.990> but

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
idea um g4 and rook a six is better but

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.230 
idea um g4 and rook a six is better but
for<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:32.830> just<00:05:33.039> the<00:05:33.159> sake<00:05:33.400> of<00:05:33.580> demonstrating

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
for the just the sake of demonstrating

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.219 
for the just the sake of demonstrating
the<00:05:34.330> idea<00:05:34.570> let's<00:05:34.750> just<00:05:34.930> play<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.199> 5<00:05:35.610> h<00:05:36.610> 5<00:05:36.970> g5<00:05:37.930> and

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
the idea let's just play a 5 h 5 g5 and

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.170 
the idea let's just play a 5 h 5 g5 and
what<00:05:38.830> happened<00:05:39.190> is<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.430> blight<00:05:39.729> queen<00:05:40.000> is

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
what happened is the blight queen is

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.210 
what happened is the blight queen is
entombed<00:05:40.539> it<00:05:41.289> doesn't<00:05:41.650> get<00:05:41.740> out<00:05:41.800> very<00:05:41.919> easily

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
entombed it doesn't get out very easily

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.120 
entombed it doesn't get out very easily
actually<00:05:43.000> to<00:05:43.750> correct<00:05:44.050> myself<00:05:44.320> I<00:05:44.710> should<00:05:44.740> say

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
actually to correct myself I should say

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:51.580 
actually to correct myself I should say
after<00:05:47.220> play<00:05:48.220> this<00:05:48.400> first<00:05:48.729> Rick<00:05:49.300> goes<00:05:49.479> back<00:05:49.750> 85

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
after play this first Rick goes back 85

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.300 
after play this first Rick goes back 85
and<00:05:51.860> now<00:05:52.670> Queens<00:05:53.060> and<00:05:53.300> do<00:05:53.420> so<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.170> fudge<00:05:55.070> the

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
and now Queens and do so I fudge the

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.920 
and now Queens and do so I fudge the
move<00:05:55.460> order<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.850> bit<00:05:56.030> but<00:05:56.240> you<00:05:56.360> guys<00:05:56.480> get<00:05:56.780> the

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
move order a bit but you guys get the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.190 
move order a bit but you guys get the
idea<00:05:56.960> um<00:05:57.530> blacks<00:05:58.520> position<00:05:58.700> is<00:05:59.300> awesome<00:06:00.020> now

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
idea um blacks position is awesome now

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.130 
idea um blacks position is awesome now
it's<00:06:00.710> downright<00:06:01.700> impossible<00:06:02.180> for<00:06:02.750> white<00:06:02.930> to

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
it's downright impossible for white to

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.200 
it's downright impossible for white to
break<00:06:03.350> through<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.670> it's<00:06:04.790> kind<00:06:04.940> of<00:06:04.970> a<00:06:05.060> cool

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
break through so it's kind of a cool

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.200 
break through so it's kind of a cool
little<00:06:05.420> idea<00:06:05.780> now<00:06:06.320> of<00:06:06.650> course<00:06:07.250> white<00:06:07.940> can

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
little idea now of course white can

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.960 
little idea now of course white can
improve<00:06:08.540> this<00:06:08.810> a<00:06:08.840> little<00:06:09.050> bit<00:06:09.260> and<00:06:09.820> it<00:06:10.820> can

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
improve this a little bit and it can

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.060 
improve this a little bit and it can
play<00:06:11.180> h5<00:06:11.840> straight<00:06:12.290> away<00:06:12.500> but<00:06:12.740> after<00:06:13.610> g5<00:06:15.070> rook

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
play h5 straight away but after g5 rook

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.770 
play h5 straight away but after g5 rook
takes<00:06:17.290> d6f<00:06:18.290> 6<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:19.790> Queen<00:06:20.030> suffers<00:06:20.570> from<00:06:20.720> the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
takes d6f 6 the Queen suffers from the

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.810 
takes d6f 6 the Queen suffers from the
same<00:06:20.900> problem<00:06:21.380> now<00:06:21.890> obviously<00:06:22.070> this<00:06:22.610> is

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
same problem now obviously this is

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.450 
same problem now obviously this is
better<00:06:23.120> than<00:06:23.240> them<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:24.740> line<00:06:24.950> I<00:06:24.980> just<00:06:25.310> showed

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
better than them the line I just showed

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.410 
better than them the line I just showed
you<00:06:25.490> previously<00:06:25.820> because<00:06:27.970> you<00:06:28.970> know<00:06:29.120> white

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
you previously because you know white

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.890 
you previously because you know white
has<00:06:29.660> a<00:06:29.690> pawn<00:06:30.080> and<00:06:30.700> white<00:06:31.700> may<00:06:32.000> be<00:06:32.060> able<00:06:32.330> to<00:06:32.630> get

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
has a pawn and white may be able to get

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.110 
has a pawn and white may be able to get
out<00:06:32.930> with<00:06:33.260> the<00:06:33.350> moves<00:06:33.530> like<00:06:33.650> g3<00:06:34.430> followed<00:06:34.940> by<00:06:35.090> a

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
out with the moves like g3 followed by a

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.220 
out with the moves like g3 followed by a
possible<00:06:35.690> f4<00:06:36.280> but<00:06:37.280> in<00:06:37.460> the<00:06:37.970> meantime<00:06:38.230> black

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
possible f4 but in the meantime black

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.120 
possible f4 but in the meantime black
can<00:06:39.650> go<00:06:40.280> with<00:06:40.430> this<00:06:40.580> idea<00:06:40.820> again<00:06:41.390> and<00:06:41.750> I<00:06:42.590> really

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
can go with this idea again and I really

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.830 
can go with this idea again and I really
think<00:06:43.310> black<00:06:43.580> is<00:06:43.610> won't<00:06:44.030> the<00:06:44.210> advantage<00:06:44.660> here

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
think black is won't the advantage here

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.480 
think black is won't the advantage here
and<00:06:45.020> the<00:06:45.320> database<00:06:46.190> supports<00:06:46.730> that<00:06:46.970> um

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
and the database supports that um

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.360 
and the database supports that um
conclusion<00:06:49.490> so<00:06:50.350> this<00:06:51.350> is<00:06:51.560> the<00:06:51.710> main<00:06:51.920> reason

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
conclusion so this is the main reason

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.910 
conclusion so this is the main reason
why<00:06:52.550> I<00:06:54.160> don't<00:06:55.160> really<00:06:55.370> recommend<00:06:55.820> the<00:06:56.180> early

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
why I don't really recommend the early

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.360 
why I don't really recommend the early
Bishop<00:06:57.920> dh6<00:06:58.550> um<00:06:59.650> perhaps<00:07:00.650> if<00:07:00.980> you<00:07:01.070> want<00:07:01.280> to

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
Bishop dh6 um perhaps if you want to

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.940 
Bishop dh6 um perhaps if you want to
play<00:07:01.520> Bishop<00:07:01.670> to<00:07:01.940> h6<00:07:02.030> early<00:07:02.840> you<00:07:03.530> should<00:07:03.770> go

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:03.950 
play Bishop to h6 early you should go

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.410 
play Bishop to h6 early you should go
along<00:07:04.250> with<00:07:04.640> them<00:07:06.250> Sergey<00:07:07.250> coutras<00:07:07.760> idea<00:07:08.150> of

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:08.420 
along with them Sergey coutras idea of

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.530 
along with them Sergey coutras idea of
playing<00:07:08.930> night<00:07:09.470> d<00:07:09.710> 5<00:07:09.980> straight<00:07:10.400> away<00:07:10.640> which

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
playing night d 5 straight away which

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.990 
playing night d 5 straight away which
may<00:07:11.810> very<00:07:11.840> well<00:07:12.260> be<00:07:12.410> better<00:07:12.650> um<00:07:12.950> I<00:07:13.400> don't<00:07:13.760> have

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
may very well be better um I don't have

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.850 
may very well be better um I don't have
enough<00:07:14.240> time<00:07:14.450> to<00:07:14.510> look<00:07:14.900> at<00:07:15.050> this<00:07:15.230> variation

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
enough time to look at this variation

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.440 
enough time to look at this variation
independently<00:07:16.460> I<00:07:16.490> recommend<00:07:17.030> that<00:07:17.090> you<00:07:17.270> look

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450 
independently I recommend that you look

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.400 
independently I recommend that you look
