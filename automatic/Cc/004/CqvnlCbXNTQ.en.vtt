dominant I'm kind of playing with that

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.200 
dominant I'm kind of playing with that
freely<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:17.130> these<00:00:17.369> different<00:00:17.730> keys<00:00:17.940> I

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
freely in these different keys I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.670 
freely in these different keys I
modulate<00:00:19.020> ran<00:00:19.770> sharp<00:00:20.400> very<00:00:20.789> sharp<00:00:21.380> half<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
then eventually get back to G the key of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.529 
then eventually get back to G the key of
the<00:00:24.900> song<00:00:25.199> itself<00:00:25.380> each<00:00:26.189> time<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.269> try<00:00:27.510> to

this live my kind of alter it a bit from
what<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.680> recorded<00:00:38.010> except<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> very

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760

little<00:00:41.010> riff<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.399> C<00:00:41.730> sharp<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.570> 10etime<00:00:44.149> what

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
little riff on C sharp for 10etime what

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.490 
little riff on C sharp for 10etime what
I<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> try<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.840> keep<00:00:46.020> things<00:00:46.230> quiet<00:00:48.500> all

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
I do is to try to keep things quiet all

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.590 
I do is to try to keep things quiet all
this<00:00:49.739> part<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> hand<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.640> all<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> rest

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.060 

I'm<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.870> walking<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.620> C<00:00:58.829> sharp

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
I'm just walking down that C sharp

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.429 
I'm just walking down that C sharp
Phrygian<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.670> then<00:00:59.760> I'll

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.890 

and<00:01:04.439> I'll<00:01:04.530> improvise<00:01:05.390> c-sharp<00:01:06.390> frisson<00:01:06.780> so

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and I'll improvise c-sharp frisson so

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.420 
and I'll improvise c-sharp frisson so
it's<00:01:07.020> good<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.200> know<00:01:07.409> where<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.280> of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it's good to know where it is all of

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.700 
it's good to know where it is all of
these<00:01:08.700> divide<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.439> try<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.710> change<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.570> the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
these divide and I try to change out the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.469 
these divide and I try to change out the
phrasing<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> little<00:01:13.950> bit<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.520> that's

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
phrasing a little bit so that that's

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
phrasing a little bit so that that's
obviously<00:01:16.020> got<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.350> trick<00:01:16.680> where<00:01:16.860> i'm

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
obviously got a little trick where i'm

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.830 
obviously got a little trick where i'm
using<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> edge<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.850> pic<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.360> fluttering

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
using the edge of the pic for fluttering

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.609 
using the edge of the pic for fluttering
and<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:26.119> three<00:01:27.119> fingers<00:01:27.539> for<00:01:27.840> straying<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and I three fingers for straying kind of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.899 
and I three fingers for straying kind of
thing<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.740> d<00:01:31.890> sharp<00:01:32.130> none<00:01:32.430> I'm

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
thing I get to the d sharp none I'm

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.080 
thing I get to the d sharp none I'm
playing<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:34.280> blues<00:01:35.280> phrasing<00:01:35.819> but<00:01:35.940> i'm

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
playing more of a blues phrasing but i'm

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:53.440 
playing more of a blues phrasing but i'm
using<00:01:37.080> Phrygian<00:01:37.500> tom

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.120 

so<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.840> changes<00:01:55.260> it<00:01:55.410> there<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.770> instead<00:01:56.070> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
so that changes it there so instead of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.980 
so that changes it there so instead of
the<00:01:56.370> phrygian<00:01:57.300> of<00:01:57.390> c<00:01:57.570> sharp

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.490 

using<00:02:04.990> phrygian<00:02:05.380> Tom<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:06.780> may<00:02:07.780> go<00:02:07.930> up<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.140> fi<00:02:08.440> do

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
using phrygian Tom it may go up to fi do

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.830 
using phrygian Tom it may go up to fi do
the<00:02:08.679> same<00:02:08.860> thing<00:02:09.160> but<00:02:09.759> I'm<00:02:10.119> back<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.509> playing<00:02:10.720> a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
the same thing but I'm back to playing a

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.360 
the same thing but I'm back to playing a
fast<00:02:11.110> line

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.699 

again<00:02:17.370> I'm<00:02:18.180> using<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.870> here<00:02:19.109> and<00:02:19.260> then<00:02:19.290> apply

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
again I'm using this here and then apply

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:26.630 
again I'm using this here and then apply
now

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.430 

then<00:02:27.640> I've<00:02:27.730> got<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.910> switch<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.569> think<00:02:28.780> there's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
then I've got a switch and think there's

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.770 
then I've got a switch and think there's
that<00:02:29.530> other<00:02:29.830> guitar<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.000> we<00:02:31.150> recorded<00:02:31.510> that

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
that other guitar that we recorded that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.050 
that other guitar that we recorded that
sort<00:02:31.990> of<00:02:32.020> slides<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:32.650> what<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.370> do<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.790> back<00:02:34.030> up

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
sort of slides in what I do is I back up

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.220 
sort of slides in what I do is I back up
the<00:02:34.360> wall

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.990 

then<00:02:41.230> when<00:02:41.409> this<00:02:41.500> melody<00:02:42.370> comes<00:02:42.489> back<00:02:42.760> in

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
then when this melody comes back in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.420 
then when this melody comes back in
while<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.510> gets<00:02:43.720> brighter

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.649 

important<00:02:49.430> thing<00:02:49.550> about<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:49.940> transition<00:02:50.180> is

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
important thing about that transition is

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.800 
important thing about that transition is
that<00:02:50.780> I've<00:02:51.099> after<00:02:52.099> I've<00:02:52.310> done<00:02:52.519> these

sharp<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.799> F<00:02:57.890> then<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.280> get<00:02:58.430> back<00:02:58.640> to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.210 
it's actually what's going on beneath it
so<00:03:14.269> does<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.050> last<00:03:15.260> solo<00:03:15.590> ends<00:03:16.099> with<00:03:16.310> this

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
so does that last solo ends with this

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:28.720 
so does that last solo ends with this
other<00:03:19.220> guitar<00:03:19.580> comes<00:03:19.819> in<00:03:20.000> going

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:37.339 

you<00:03:29.730> get<00:03:29.879> back<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.209> wall<00:03:30.360> part<00:03:36.349> that's

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
you get back to the wall part that's

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.869 
you get back to the wall part that's
pretty<00:03:37.590> much<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:37.769> then<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.430> get<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.849> end

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
pretty much it then we get to the end

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.979 
pretty much it then we get to the end
there<00:03:40.970> there's<00:03:41.970> two<00:03:42.120> interesting<00:03:42.540> parts<00:03:42.810> one

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
there there's two interesting parts one

00:03:42.989 --> 00:04:04.170 
there there's two interesting parts one
is<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.170> little<00:03:43.700> syncopated<00:03:44.700> part

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.809 

this<00:04:05.180> one<00:04:05.390> is<00:04:05.510> really<00:04:05.810> hard<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.170> keep<00:04:06.349> quiet

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
this one is really hard to keep quiet

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:22.860 
this one is really hard to keep quiet
and<00:04:07.819> it's<00:04:08.510> better<00:04:08.720> not<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.959> have<00:04:09.050> a<00:04:09.170> jacket<00:04:09.440> on

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.620 

pretty<00:04:23.870> much<00:04:23.990> get<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.290> idea
