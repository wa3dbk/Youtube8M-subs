00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.910 
get me started on the players all them
basically<00:04:07.780> had<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.990> same<00:04:08.020> build<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.740> I<00:04:08.770> could

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
basically had the same build and I could

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.190 
basically had the same build and I could
only<00:04:09.040> just<00:04:09.130> make<00:04:09.460> out<00:04:09.640> who<00:04:10.540> each<00:04:10.720> player<00:04:10.990> was

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200
