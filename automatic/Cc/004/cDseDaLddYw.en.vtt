00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.560
 Hello, how are you 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.910
 this video is but we should learn about function and 10 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.849
 functions without direct restrictions that you give 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.109
 to the program to the game you are playing 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.210
 is a direct order of the type 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.179
 the case 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.970
 would be destroyed 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.539
 things like 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.210
 there is an infinity of functions bbm which has almost 1 thousand 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.980
 functions 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.580
 fusions they are not just used to give the order says 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.800
 but they also serve to give information 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.339
 there are some types of functions that can fetch some hand 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.360
 curiosity is something you want to know 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.470
 he brought information 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.579
 are very useful for you know if for example né a certain position 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.750
 is there any object there 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.570
 institutions of various kinds 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.710
 that he brought sports also you can look for the solution 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.650
 being executed 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.120
 if there is an instance of a given object 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.880
 all part of functions 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.030
 is always giving orders 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.130
 and also to request information the program 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.860
 the merger that we will use 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 will it destroy this month 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.090
 to district instance 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.490
 of the object 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.040
 ball when colliding with the wall 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.210
 to use in the corrected event 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.210
 a wall 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.270
 meeting 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.600
 I think here. 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.920
 not typing 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 the name is of the event of the function 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.440
 they 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.040
 london wine 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.040
 even uncle of him 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.929
 exposes 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.929
 you need to place 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.149
 the relatives 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:18.919
 click here 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.919
 hot wine 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.169
 tighten lawsuit 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.699
 let's observe 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.989
 at the time the ball 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.989
 crashed into the wall 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.710
 logical that the collegiate event 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.959
 was fired 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.789
 and his content too 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.789
 the content of it was precisely the function 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.359
 instants destroy 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.680
 he destroyed the instance of the ball that collided 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.689
 Let's put it now. 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:14.089
 how would be the first one to be loaded the are produced here all good nobody 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.809
 on here 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.559
 put an explosive 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:23.759
 This time we're going to lower the braganza volume it's such a bad explosion. 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:26.759
 the one put by the little kid that's good 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:31.209
 tighten ok 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.209
 the sound is already loaded 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.269
 I discovered that it is the year to change the name 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.689
 I opened the ball 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.659
 noor event correct with wall 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.619
 Let's click and 15 criticized 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.569
 the bcv kiki functions it is necessary that we put semicolon 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.009
 this time in the sales chiça 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:07.219
 the examples 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.219
 lord d 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.309
 sound rise of tony tornado 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.459
 We use the function are after 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.690
 remembering that of a function and another that is necessary to put what regulates 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.810
 that is able to differentiate a function from the routine of the 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.340
 ask that it's all one thing and it's going to be a problem 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.439
 we have to put a little bit of what we can only distinguish 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.439
 each other 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.090
 let's put 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.969
 relatives 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.689
 inside the parecis but let's put the name of the son lucas and run 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.240
 we won that only a little 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.120
 So 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.559
 at the time that the event happens to correct 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:57.590
 first 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.240
 but if you notice the function 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.360
 this one is destroyed 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.360
 and then it will perform function 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.449
 and within that year of the lawsuit 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.680
 the sound we chose was a bit 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.779
 In this ocasion 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.240
 Let's save 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.240
 Let's test now 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:21.979
 - check 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.979
 is 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.199
 the body 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.240
 You pronounced me on the case. 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.270
 but it was executed 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.270
 carlos sena has managed to listen 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.379
 this one here 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.170
 editing the sound a bit 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.750
 you raise a little but I'll put you in the attack if you want more 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.199
 blue zone high medication 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.199
 in the ears 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.759
 so here goes the course again 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.749
 here he played previously diagnosed 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:04.279
 only this time 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:07.689
 the programming medium using the jimi hendrix language 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.490
 let's save now 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:16.939
 save money 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.939
 of class 3 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:23.689
 is saved 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.059
 Congratulations 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:27.249
 you are evolving 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.939
 to the next
