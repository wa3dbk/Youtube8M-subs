00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
side to be learning on this side on the

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.769 
side to be learning on this side on the
right<00:00:14.080> side<00:00:14.110> all<00:00:15.099> right<00:00:15.540> cross<00:00:16.540> the<00:00:16.660> right

like this you've got like a nice loop Oh
the<00:00:50.500> final<00:00:50.800> product<00:00:51.010> is<00:00:51.280> going<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.699> just<00:00:52.210> like

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
the final product is going to just like

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.410 
the final product is going to just like
a<00:00:52.360> regular<00:00:52.540> bow<00:00:53.079> tie<00:00:53.290> it's<00:00:54.040> going<00:00:54.190> to<00:00:54.280> be<00:00:54.420> two

a regular bow tie it's going to be two
layers<00:00:55.989> here<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:58.149> layer<00:00:58.329> behind<00:00:58.570> and

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
layers here and one layer behind and

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.400 
layers here and one layer behind and
then<00:00:59.649> one<00:01:00.010> layer<00:01:00.190> on<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.460> front<00:01:00.489> here<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.410> two

then one layer on the front here and two
layers<00:01:02.620> in<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.859> back<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:04.920> pull<00:01:05.920> this<00:01:06.369> end

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
layers in the back now pull this end

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.540 
layers in the back now pull this end
over<00:01:07.590> where<00:01:08.590> you're<00:01:08.770> holding<00:01:08.920> where<00:01:09.429> you're

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
you will have to find the loop again I

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.650 
you will have to find the loop again I
lost<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:39.250> either<00:01:42.850> oops<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:44.380> make<00:01:45.380> mistakes

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
because it's the same principle except

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.009
