[music]

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.540
I-I had a lot of friends

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.280
til I drove them 'round the bend

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.240
And then they left me all alone

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.300
and so I roam around the globe

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.520
In search of new shiny buddies

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.500
to share with them my worries

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.640
And my joys and my toys

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.060
and my secret jars of poison

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.160
I-I searched up high (high)

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.000
I searched down low

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.580
But, no matter where I look

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.420
no friends began to show

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.520
And so I made a list of killers

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.520
and wrote them all letters

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.540
Asking lots of friendly questions

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.980
with all the best intent they told me

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.260
Don't ask you questions to the wall (Don't ask the wall)

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.280
They keep their secrets locked inside (Locked inside)

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.240
If blood and bones are what you want (Are what you want)

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.780
I suggest that you look behind you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.320
I keep each letter in a box under my bed

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.440
It really rocks 'cause when I'm sad

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.340
I just read all of them again

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.480
I sent them drawings done in crayon

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.500
and plans for domination

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.440
Even cute little collages

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.700
of their exploits from the papers

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.860
And when they get out, we will be friends

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.920
Bestest buddies until the end

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.780
We'll go on picnics, with long pork sammies (sammies)

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.000
But I keep thinking 'bout

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.140
what-what they told me

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.240
Don't ask your questions to the wall (Don't ask the wall)

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.220
They keep their secrets locked inside (Locked inside)

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.220
If blood and bones are what you want (Are what you want)

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.740
I suggest that you look behind you

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.120
Don't ask you questions to the wall (Don't ask the wall)

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.400
They keep their secrets locked inside (Locked inside)

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.260
If blood and bones are what you want (Are what you want)

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.700
I suggest that you look behind you

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.580
Hahaha... I like chips!

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:24.940
