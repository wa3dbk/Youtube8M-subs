00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.250
 managed to extract the jets from our 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:12.660
 sure look what stood 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:16.970
 primary air chamber 135 fuel 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.109
 was 107 5 this is the value 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.140
 we have a mixture of air with 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.140
 fuel 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.369
 we have it set to the maximum 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.300
 power too i said 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:36.000
 there is already a very rich mixture 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.300
 there were basically candles were black 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.890
 sooty was a lot of soot 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.829
 that is, it seems to be true that the machine 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.100
 worked on rich mix and secondary 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.430
 the camera was set up 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:55.050
 also somewhere on the richest maximum 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.770
 I will try to adjust the power of my case 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 more on 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:08.240
 reduced gas mileage over here 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:12.900
 marked this here this 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:18.710
 enrichment power fuel consumption from 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.170
 these values ​​are a normal mixture 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:27.439
 a pencil noted further goes poor 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.659
 the mixture and at the very top is already all 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.840
 no excess air mixture will work 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.930
 not raise you once applied now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.860
 I will pick up the existing and jets 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.570
 something optimal for a carburetor such 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.939
 jet on the farm at this 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.890
 the moment of them and I will choose 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.549
 first the primary camera is two 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.090
 air 100 135 and fuel 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.600
 face value spread out on the corresponding 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.829
 values ​​of 100 does not work for me 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.299
 mixture too rich perry enriched 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.359
 that is, it will actually fill a little 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:13.889
 will go a lot of fuel 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:17.730
 135 135 normal operation remains 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:20.730
 here are two cells marked here goes rich 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:27.689
 the mixture here is poor from the upper limit 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:30.750
 the rich mixture gets 95 jet that is 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:34.219
 I put the first camera 95 to 135 on 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:43.069
 sample the second camera should be richer 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:51.889
 richer than zero 704 thousandths 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:57.060
 150 and air jet and 107 5 fuel 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:03:01.609
 117 will not work it is broken it is no longer in 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.609
 cool so you can remove it too 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.659
 a160 and secondary camera is obtained 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.290
 principle mixture will be 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:18.930
 rather poor in my opinion but usually she 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:27.629
 poorer than on the primary camera try 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:30.720
 such a combination of 95 by 135 7 and 5 by 150 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:33.859
 in theory, the first cell will be economical 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.180
 ride the primary when opening 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.129
 throttle more than 30 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.530
 percent when opening the secondary chamber 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.900
 there will be a mixture of rich man machine will be more 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.939
 spend well and therefore better 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.069
 go 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:50.209
 that's all theory alpha meter practice 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.209
 will show the composition of the mixture 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.250
 the carburetor has set not to arrange already 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.350
 I will be tomorrow 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.450
 already managed 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:05.380
 in first impressions gaining momentum 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.380
 just magical 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.430
 tomorrow will be more precise settings
