 toy to cook and do more 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.680
 noise

 I'm a headache it takes 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270
 Taking a walk can be a good year. 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.180

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:48.060

 the ruca knew he could do a 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.219
 Good job taking care of the kitchen but 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.219
 Let's draw music and I will too. 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:36.870
 life does not think about it there for the same 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:38.790
 not triggered but never looks at this 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.000
 confusion I believe to take care of the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.890
 life does not practice such as it because 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.590
 I thought it was a great injustice but 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.430
 the play with her I feel there 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.950
 silence is the fault of logic I was 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.760
 Give it a try and you need to sleep the way you do. 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:03.390
 not 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:06.359
 I thought I did not want to go back here. 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.620
 a thing of 90 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:13.109
 so when I soon this people I 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.340
 criei rosita for the fans she did not call 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.780
 it 's not easy being older is not better 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.170

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.209

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.160
 When I was little once I had to 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.870
 take care of my cousin's because 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.650
 my parents had to follow clues 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.650
 what made him 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:39.040
 Expressed the entire toothpaste 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:42.690
 With my head, I'm going to scream this and I 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.690
 Go restless, come back with everything. 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:53.359
 Good job, the ruca that is 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.620
