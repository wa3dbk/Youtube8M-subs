really nice we've got these mirroring
each<00:00:56.129> other<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:56.879> goes<00:00:57.000> up<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.510> then

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
each other so this one goes up and then

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200 
each other so this one goes up and then
down<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.190> goes<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.550> way<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.789> up

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
down and this one goes this way and up

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.810 
down and this one goes this way and up
which<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.680> mirrors<00:01:02.579> really

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
which is it just in mirrors really

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.469 
which is it just in mirrors really
nicely<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.629> makes<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.229> nice<00:01:04.470> shapes

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
nicely and just makes really nice shapes

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.640 
nicely and just makes really nice shapes
almost<00:01:06.479> kind<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.750> plays<00:01:06.930> with<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:07.290> eyes<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
almost kind of plays with your eyes and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.200 
almost kind of plays with your eyes and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
you look at it you look at it one way it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.280 
you look at it you look at it one way it
looks<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> different<00:01:09.689> shape<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.229> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
looks like a different shape and you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.109 
looks like a different shape and you
yeah<00:01:11.030> it's<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.200> cool<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> yeah<00:01:14.939> it's

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
yeah it's all cool like so yeah it's

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
yeah it's all cool like so yeah it's
nice<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> welded<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:18.590> welded<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.710> right

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
nice and welded up here welded it right

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.999 
nice and welded up here welded it right
to<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> frame<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.330> chose<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.439> right<00:01:22.619> here

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
to the frame we chose to go right here

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.920 
to the frame we chose to go right here
where<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> piece<00:01:23.700> goes<00:01:23.880> across<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.659> we

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
where this piece goes across because we

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.270 
where this piece goes across because we
figured<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.500> would<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> pretty<00:01:25.920> strong

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
figured that would be a pretty strong

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.609 
figured that would be a pretty strong
point<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.750> mount<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.850> we've<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.180> side

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
point to mount up to we've got that side

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.310 
point to mount up to we've got that side
kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> welded<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.100> pretty<00:01:33.000> low<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.049> then<00:01:34.229> we

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
kind of welded on pretty low and then we

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109 
kind of welded on pretty low and then we
ran<00:01:34.500> out<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> wire<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.310> side<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.000> we

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
ran out of wire on this side so we

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.510 
ran out of wire on this side so we
stopped<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.049> side<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:38.310> really

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
stopped on this side but it's really

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.679 
stopped on this side but it's really
solid<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:40.520> when<00:01:41.520> he<00:01:41.610> pushed<00:01:41.820> down<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.420> all

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
solid now when he pushed down it all

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.080 
solid now when he pushed down it all
moves<00:01:43.320> along<00:01:43.770> with<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.130> before<00:01:44.280> we<00:01:44.939> got<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
moves along with it before we got a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.999 
moves along with it before we got a
little<00:01:45.329> bit<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.509> flex<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.869> these<00:01:46.020> pipes<00:01:46.290> not

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
little bit of flex in these pipes not

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:47.600 
little bit of flex in these pipes not
bad

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
bad

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.120 
bad
but<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.689> another<00:01:49.439> reason<00:01:49.619> why<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.890> put

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
but that's another reason why we put

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.260 
but that's another reason why we put
these<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.610> were<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> put<00:01:51.030> these<00:01:51.119> in

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
these in we were going to put these in

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.749 
these in we were going to put these in
anyways<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.960> decided<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> definitely<00:01:53.640> go

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
anyways but decided to definitely go

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.179 
anyways but decided to definitely go
with<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.689> strengthened<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.009> then

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
with it it strengthened it up and then

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.889 
with it it strengthened it up and then
once<00:01:56.369> we<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> cage<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.840> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
once we get the cage on it it's going to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.709 
once we get the cage on it it's going to
make<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.740> thing<00:01:58.920> absolutely<00:01:59.430> solid<00:01:59.719> it's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
make this thing absolutely solid it's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.429 
make this thing absolutely solid it's
going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:00.990> nice

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
going to be nice

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.760 
going to be nice
go-kart<00:02:01.920> after<00:02:02.130> we're<00:02:02.250> done<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.689> yeah<00:02:04.560> I'm

go-kart after we're done so yeah I'm

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.179 
go-kart after we're done so yeah I'm
excited

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189

if you guys have any questions on how
I'm<00:02:08.590> doing<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:09.069> I<00:02:10.319> might<00:02:11.319> be<00:02:11.650> able<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.830> draw

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
I'm doing this I might be able to draw

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.000 
I'm doing this I might be able to draw
you<00:02:12.099> guys<00:02:12.430> up<00:02:12.640> some<00:02:12.790> plans<00:02:13.060> possibly<00:02:14.010> each

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you guys up some plans possibly each

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.410 
you guys up some plans possibly each
four-wheeler<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.670> different<00:02:16.000> though

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
four-wheeler is different though

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.650 
four-wheeler is different though
so<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.190> front<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.790> how<00:02:19.420> we're<00:02:19.569> going

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
so with this front and how we're going

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.430 
so with this front and how we're going
to<00:02:19.750> extend<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:21.360> we've<00:02:22.360> got<00:02:22.510> all<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.870> original

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
to extend it we've got all the original

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.140 
to extend it we've got all the original
steering<00:02:24.340> system<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> four-wheeler<00:02:26.010> and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
steering system to the four-wheeler and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.729 
steering system to the four-wheeler and
we're<00:02:28.150> just<00:02:28.330> going<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.540> we've<00:02:29.170> cut<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.560> all

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
we're just going to we've cut that all

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.009 
we're just going to we've cut that all
out<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.330> instead<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.569> being<00:02:31.600> almost

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
out and instead of it being almost

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.320 
out and instead of it being almost
upright<00:02:32.470> we're<00:02:33.340> going<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.550> lay<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.790> down<00:02:33.819> and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
upright we're going to lay it down and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.360 
upright we're going to lay it down and
it's<00:02:35.170> going<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.319> work<00:02:35.500> exactly<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.069> same<00:02:36.250> so

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
it's going to work exactly the same so

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.520 
it's going to work exactly the same so
you<00:02:36.459> don't<00:02:36.610> have<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.959> know<00:02:38.050> turn<00:02:38.350> this

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
you don't have to you know turn this

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.199 
you don't have to you know turn this
frame<00:02:38.860> because<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.160> want<00:02:39.340> these<00:02:39.519> trees<00:02:39.940> you

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
frame because you want these trees you

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.309 
frame because you want these trees you
can<00:02:40.360> get<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.569> because<00:02:40.690> that's<00:02:40.930> where<00:02:41.110> your

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
can get it because that's where your

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.670 
can get it because that's where your
your<00:02:42.390> training<00:02:43.390> capabilities<00:02:43.900> come<00:02:44.080> from<00:02:44.380> but

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
your training capabilities come from but

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.500 
your training capabilities come from but
we're<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.430> take<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:45.850> these<00:02:48.510> steering

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
we're going to take this these steering

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.330 
we're going to take this these steering
which<00:02:50.260> McCall<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.830> can't<00:02:51.010> think<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.220> what

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
which McCall it's I can't think of what

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.670 
which McCall it's I can't think of what
this<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:51.970> piece<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.299> called<00:02:52.500> we're<00:02:53.500> going<00:02:53.620> to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
this this piece is called we're going to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.610 
this this piece is called we're going to
cut<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.130> right<00:02:54.459> here<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.319> then<00:02:56.319> we're<00:02:56.500> going

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
cut this right here and then we're going

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.789 
cut this right here and then we're going
to<00:02:56.760> kind<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.850> cut<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> point<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.170> do<00:02:59.680> the

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
to kind of cut it to a point and do the

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.620 
to kind of cut it to a point and do the
same<00:03:00.010> with<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.280> bit<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.610> this<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.000> solid

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
same with a bit of this this is solid

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.229 
same with a bit of this this is solid
stock<00:03:01.930> bar<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.730> we're<00:03:03.730> going<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.910> weld<00:03:04.120> it

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
stock bar and we're going to weld it

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.270 
stock bar and we're going to weld it
together<00:03:04.360> really<00:03:05.019> really<00:03:05.290> strong<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.040> it'll

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
together really really strong so it'll

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.370 
together really really strong so it'll
never<00:03:06.430> bend<00:03:06.760> or<00:03:06.940> break<00:03:07.090> or<00:03:07.390> anything<00:03:07.540> this

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
never bend or break or anything this

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.630 
never bend or break or anything this
one's<00:03:08.620> going<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.830> come<00:03:09.069> all<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.310> way<00:03:09.340> across

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
one's going to come all the way across

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.240 
one's going to come all the way across
to<00:03:10.480> probably<00:03:10.780> about<00:03:10.870> here<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.410> then<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.100> one

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
to probably about here and then this one

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.490 
to probably about here and then this one
we're<00:03:12.489> going<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:12.670> extend<00:03:13.030> about<00:03:13.420> here<00:03:13.780> so

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
we're going to extend about here so

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.810 
we're going to extend about here so
they're<00:03:14.680> right<00:03:14.920> there<00:03:15.130> right<00:03:15.430> next<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.730> each

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
they're right there right next to each

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.569 
they're right there right next to each
other<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:16.329> there's<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.470> bar<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.950> they're

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
other so there's this bar that they're

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.920 
other so there's this bar that they're
going<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.790> connect<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.180> that's<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.720> original

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
going to connect to that's the original

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.860 
going to connect to that's the original
four-wheeler<00:03:21.269> steering<00:03:22.269> column<00:03:22.630> we're<00:03:22.840> going

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
four-wheeler steering column we're going

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.160 
four-wheeler steering column we're going
to<00:03:23.079> extend<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.590> a<00:03:23.829> little<00:03:24.040> bit<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:25.170> that'll

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
to extend this a little bit to that'll

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.690 
to extend this a little bit to that'll
work<00:03:26.410> really<00:03:26.650> well<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:29.290> yeah<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:30.340> guys<00:03:30.459> have

these<00:03:37.060> shocks<00:03:37.359> are<00:03:37.570> nice<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.900> adjustable<00:03:38.440> as

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
these shocks are nice and adjustable as

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.310 
these shocks are nice and adjustable as
well<00:03:39.359> these<00:03:40.359> shocks<00:03:41.109> are<00:03:42.750> turned<00:03:43.750> down<00:03:44.079> all

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
well these shocks are turned down all

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.500 
well these shocks are turned down all
the<00:03:44.410> way<00:03:44.560> which<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:44.980> nice<00:03:45.160> because<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.850> holds

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
the way which is nice because it holds
