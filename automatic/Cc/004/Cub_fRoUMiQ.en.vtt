00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
they're not going to require a whole lot

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.810 
they're not going to require a whole lot
of<00:00:26.380> break<00:00:26.500> in<00:00:26.649> time<00:00:26.829> the<00:00:27.340> other<00:00:27.489> thing<00:00:27.669> that<00:00:27.700> I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
want you to notice is they use a lot of

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.650 
want you to notice is they use a lot of
stretch<00:00:30.250> material<00:00:30.790> at<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.029> back<00:00:31.180> of<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.419> hand

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
stretch material at the back of the hand

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.319 
stretch material at the back of the hand
and<00:00:31.869> at<00:00:32.259> the<00:00:32.380> fingers<00:00:32.739> and<00:00:32.980> that<00:00:33.430> allows<00:00:34.030> you

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
and at the fingers and that allows you

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.660 
and at the fingers and that allows you
to<00:00:34.360> grip<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.870> bars<00:00:35.079> comfortably<00:00:36.040> which<00:00:36.489> is

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
to grip the bars comfortably which is

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.210 
to grip the bars comfortably which is
critical<00:00:37.390> in<00:00:37.570> an<00:00:38.020> insulated<00:00:38.500> glove<00:00:38.710> you<00:00:39.190> can

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
critical in an insulated glove you can

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.860 
critical in an insulated glove you can
imagine<00:00:39.520> with<00:00:39.970> all<00:00:40.000> that<00:00:40.270> extra<00:00:40.630> fabric

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
imagine with all that extra fabric

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.050 
imagine with all that extra fabric
inside<00:00:41.560> the<00:00:41.770> fingers<00:00:42.160> it<00:00:42.550> makes<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:42.880> that<00:00:43.000> much

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
inside the fingers it makes it that much

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.450 
inside the fingers it makes it that much
harder<00:00:43.240> to<00:00:44.020> hold<00:00:44.230> on<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:44.650> grab<00:00:44.800> especially<00:00:45.370> if

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
harder to hold on and grab especially if

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.330 
harder to hold on and grab especially if
the<00:00:45.550> fingers<00:00:45.940> are<00:00:46.150> real<00:00:46.750> stiff<00:00:47.080> which<00:00:48.070> leads

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
the fingers are real stiff which leads

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.069 
the fingers are real stiff which leads
to<00:00:48.490> hand<00:00:48.670> fatigue<00:00:49.030> and<00:00:49.240> on<00:00:49.570> a<00:00:49.600> long<00:00:49.840> ride

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
to hand fatigue and on a long ride

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.940 
to hand fatigue and on a long ride
that's<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.380> last<00:00:50.530> thing<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:50.800> need

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
that's the last thing you need

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.310 
that's the last thing you need
especially<00:00:51.130> if<00:00:51.520> it's<00:00:51.640> cold<00:00:51.850> out<00:00:52.030> so<00:00:52.840> what<00:00:53.200> they

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
especially if it's cold out so what they

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.569 
especially if it's cold out so what they
do<00:00:53.380> is<00:00:53.530> they<00:00:53.620> actually<00:00:53.740> pre<00:00:54.160> curved<00:00:54.400> the

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
do is they actually pre curved the

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.040 
do is they actually pre curved the
fingers<00:00:54.880> you<00:00:54.970> can<00:00:55.060> see<00:00:55.180> with<00:00:55.270> my<00:00:55.390> hand<00:00:55.570> relaxed

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
fingers you can see with my hand relaxed

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.440 
fingers you can see with my hand relaxed
it's<00:00:56.380> actually<00:00:56.770> pre<00:00:57.010> curved<00:00:57.310> the<00:00:57.790> palm<00:00:58.030> is<00:00:58.239> pre

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
it's actually pre curved the palm is pre

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.270 
it's actually pre curved the palm is pre
curved<00:00:58.690> so<00:00:59.200> it's<00:00:59.320> really<00:00:59.530> comfortable<00:01:00.040> right

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
curved so it's really comfortable right

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.950

lot of winter gloves will be really
really<00:04:39.340> thick<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.960> it's<00:04:40.960> actually<00:04:41.380> tiring

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
really thick and it's actually tiring

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.300

just to hold on to the bars because of

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.850 
just to hold on to the bars because of
the<00:04:45.400> amount<00:04:45.670> of<00:04:45.850> insulation<00:04:46.510> that<00:04:46.900> is<00:04:47.590> built

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
the amount of insulation that is built

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.000 
the amount of insulation that is built
in

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
you could probably ride with these I'm

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.540 
you could probably ride with these I'm
going<00:05:23.000> to<00:05:23.090> estimate<00:05:23.539> probably<00:05:24.130> four<00:05:25.130> for<00:05:25.520> a

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
going to estimate probably four for a

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.570 
going to estimate probably four for a
shorter<00:05:25.940> ride<00:05:26.150> like<00:05:26.419> say<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.750> commute<00:05:27.139> you<00:05:27.350> know

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
shorter ride like say a commute you know

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.180 
shorter ride like say a commute you know
30<00:05:28.580> 40<00:05:28.729> minute<00:05:29.449> commute<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:30.830> could<00:05:30.979> probably

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
30 40 minute commute you could probably

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.890 
30 40 minute commute you could probably
ride<00:05:31.460> with<00:05:31.699> these<00:05:31.850> down<00:05:32.240> into<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.720> teens

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
ride with these down into the teens

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.490 
ride with these down into the teens
especially<00:05:33.710> with<00:05:33.919> a<00:05:34.060> thermal<00:05:35.060> liner<00:05:35.300> now<00:05:36.080> if

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
especially with a thermal liner now if

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.930 
especially with a thermal liner now if
you're<00:05:36.710> going<00:05:36.919> on<00:05:37.039> any<00:05:37.190> kind<00:05:37.400> of<00:05:37.490> extended

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
you're going on any kind of extended
