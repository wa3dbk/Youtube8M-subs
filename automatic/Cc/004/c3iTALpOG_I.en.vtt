00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 Hello youtube my name is chimpanzee 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.740
 and this is the battle news no 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.509
 So not really are 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.160
 the metal user always with the mega test 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.719
 together but we are both on the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.219
 gamescom and honestly I will be you 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.330
 in this video not at all with the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.830
 gamescom bored or something 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.480
 to say no I will also the word 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.220
 Do not call here once more 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.050
 but what I have here now are 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.760
 a few news that are no longer in the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.199
 last episode with news 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.580
 and not likely in the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.289
 be followed next because 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.830
 It will probably be very, very much 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.660
 from said fair in new following next 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.890
 incorporated weeks halt and is not 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.540
 thought more you bring out again 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.579
 twitter everything out almost goes to him and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.530
 pax all these information again 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.750
 for you in a little video that is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.190
 then worth or value or are here 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 so again to be called 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.520
 just let me have it now 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.539
 no distinction made that is 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.160
 Here are several things to the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.410
 different battlefield split off so 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.930
 Thursday it is again an update from 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.640
 Give community web project in the city 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.800
 under location on the internet 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.239
 just as blind with folks content 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.789
 not anymore but even already 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.109
 full patch no idea what was 100 years ago 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.149
 maybe meant by a percentage 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.589
 The twitter has adorno too 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.450
 I'm not sure 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.530
 but an update from the community web 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.150
 I personally always find project 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.200
 Of course, very nice, of course, no 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.390
 I am also looking forward to that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.010
 community more project and it was yes 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.110
 already the last update really cool 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.369
 there were already complete textures from it 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.750
 lacked not so much from 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.070
 In our opinion one could say that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.780
 thing is more or less after 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.540
 driven home and already finished by 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 therefore on Thursday wanted to take a look 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.290
 I can only say it 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.720
 voldemort fair stop somehow 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.189
 and missed yes the payment is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.590
 Yes, I'm also very active on twitter 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.710
 me, of course, one or the other 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.290
 on the one hand he has in principle 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.360
 tweet that if you crashes on 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 pearl market and envy and on the maps 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.619
 should have stopped then but the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.729
 In any case, let them know and 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.920
 then please write in 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.990
 which graf graphic setting asolo medium 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.149
 hai or ultra the whole thing is supposed to happen 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.619
 but I think it's just a type of 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.670
 has been torn from the context 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.950
 Here we come for a moment 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.920
 to talk about that because we have to 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.710
 honestly, now 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.790
 after all, there is battlefield leyen 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.970
 Yes, I have sent under 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.500
 pushed the dlc reverie intended for 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.270
 premium and non-premium players well 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.860
 so be released in september 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.209
 not so long and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.410
 particularly, the console players 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.330
 that's probably more 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.950
 happy as the pixi people because on the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.170
 pc we have roundabout 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.360
 two and a half thousand players the whole 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.660
 gamble daily all over the world 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.300
 be zte patchday and the summer 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.500
 patch is currently live or is now available 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.390
 went live a few days ago 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.800
 there should probably synonymous tv by means 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.970
 have been adjusted again then I 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.530
 I am very much looking forward to yours 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.030
 I have not got feedback before now 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.340
 I like to write more in the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.470
 Comment on whether this happened because she 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.330
 speaks acdc has already played and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.220
 of course if you then with the tv 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.959
 missel are satisfied again 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.310
 or accordingly, not me either 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.170
 personally the woman has to play yes 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.760
 relatively rare because I myself takes it 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.650
 the head in there but there too 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.110
 Of course it just has to be 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.580
 works great news there was 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.930
 it already has some videos with me 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.440
 unfortunately only a very small part with 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.180
 it was confirmed that it was in 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.829
 2016 to enter a new battlefield 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.060
 should 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.680
 Now the question is in the way 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.390
 bad company 3 or maybe that is 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.760
 even a battlefield 5 already and if 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.590
 lisbeth b5 is what a bed fixes 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.880
 then that is then likely no son 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.200
 I've been in the stream of 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.329
 heard someone is such a kind 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.400
 afghanistan comes photo i have no idea 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.380
 be something like this or will the whole 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.600
 still a very early thing there is but 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.920
 rather as a kind of future part therefore be 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.480
 My personal opinion is me or myself 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.489
 Just think in the future parts now 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.410
 not because the feedback is what you 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.820
 now stop synonymous from a dlc 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.410
 he got battlefield 4 hat 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.780
 through with the flying tanks and 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.310
 excite and so on and so forth yes 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.019
 I just say that came the 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.700
 whole community not so good at and 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.040
 if you complete the whole lot 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.870
 that can also bring in the future 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.190
 back parapet therefore worth it 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.840
 I can well imagine company 3 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.459
 above all things synonymous for the consoles 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.040
 player walden bad company still 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.410
 a very expansive singleplayer part 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.889
 stop with it was so next info 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.690
 is 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.040
 if you have windows 10 installed 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.030
 You should be surprised why the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.280
 performance maybe not quite 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.720
 It is optimal with battlefield there 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.370
 new geforce driver if you still 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.630
 should not have installed what I 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.890
 honestly can not imagine 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.300
 now after a few days but if 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.490
 Not 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.690
 update the force drivers 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.190
 are probably all also 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.670
 ati or I was now on twitter 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.489
 no information directly before then 120 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.430
 trade server that is 120 hertz 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.260
 ticket server that's right 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.960
 probably after the summer patch 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.750
 someday be made available 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.280
 there is still a lot in circulation 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.690
 somehow and you have not seen it 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.520
 It may be that it can come in 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.980
 be that the different providers 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.390
 So speak like nitrate etc as well 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.190
 can have a say but can 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.740
 be that it does not come in but 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.560
 they should stop after the summer patch 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.540
 somehow become current and then stop 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.640
 I personally think about the focus 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.440
 that the nice 120 ticket server 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.480
 I will even have one more euro 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.380
 worth per month so canada euro 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.240
 contain 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.290
 you know but they are allowed 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.350
 Of course not too disproportionate 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.270
 Expensive again for explanation 120 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.430
 hertz has nothing to do with your framerate 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.170
 do that is just the yes the art 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.960
 the query so speak the frequency 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.700
 the query between your client so 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.440
 the game that runs with you and 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.970
 of course the server on the whole 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.800
 Game then took place and ever 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.169
 more often this query takes place in 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.150
 quotation marks more is better very 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.100
 nice but also the more load 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.080
 one causes on the corresponding one 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.770
 server he has nothing with a framerate 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.169
 to do 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.570
 Nevertheless, that is partly responsible 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.980
 for a yes, according to clean 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.140
 fun and accordingly has 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.370
 in clean at short time under 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.620
 circumstances could also be said simply 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.770
 the higher the tig rate is the less 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.600
 Feldmann quasi killed around if you already 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.760
 has long been run around a corner 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.380
 that was not a sentence at last 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.750
 long talk short sense there I am 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.730
 hottest on it I can imagine 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.080
 that one or the other provider then 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.770
 has it that we do not get back the 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.210
 Last is just too high house 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.560
 users are ready there a bit 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.870
 a little money holding slaughter 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.819
 I can understand it 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.860
 server view, of course, the one or 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.210
 other players but also say there 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.680
 I personally do not like it now 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.440
 but we do not have to do that either 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.330
 There are so many servers 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.370
 here in battlelog erb there it comes 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.460
 now on a more or less an and 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.620
 think that then I specifically the 60 or 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.879
 later also has the 120 server 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.190
 when should they come again 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.560
 then already as a unique feature 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.330
 would somehow want to put out like that 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.949
 I have much more info on this now 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.780
 So do not think about it community 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.009
 keep an eye on the project 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.009
