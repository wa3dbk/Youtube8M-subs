gun could be completely nerved I do know

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
gun could be completely nerved I do know
that<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> first<00:01:04.530> beta<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.129> m16<00:01:05.700> was

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
that in the first beta the m16 was

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
that in the first beta the m16 was
pretty<00:01:06.119> dang<00:01:06.360> good<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.900> AKM<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> number

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
pretty dang good the AKM was the number

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.460 
pretty dang good the AKM was the number
one<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> m16<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> second

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
one but the m16 was like the second

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.960 
one but the m16 was like the second
fiddle<00:01:10.799> now<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> other<00:01:11.790> way

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
fiddle now I think it's the other way

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.530 
fiddle now I think it's the other way
around

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
around

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.080 
around
I<00:01:12.570> believe<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> m16<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.520> number<00:01:14.880> one

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
I believe the m16 is the number one

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.530 
I believe the m16 is the number one
along<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> g36<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.130> m416<00:01:17.729> just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
along with the g36 the m416 just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.570 
along with the g36 the m416 just
absolute<00:01:19.140> laser<00:01:19.500> guns<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.220> that's<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
absolute laser guns and that's what you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.070 
absolute laser guns and that's what you
need<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:20.970> game<00:01:21.090> because<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.720> time<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
need in this game because the time to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.530 
need in this game because the time to
kill<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:23.159> fast<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.420> get

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
kill is really fast and if you can get

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.149 
kill is really fast and if you can get
all<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.810> shots<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.259> target<00:01:25.290> you're<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:25.950> be

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
all your shots on target you're gonna be

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.490 
all your shots on target you're gonna be
dropping<00:01:26.490> people<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:27.090> almost<00:01:27.570> any<00:01:27.840> range<00:01:28.200> like

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
dropping people at almost any range like

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.859 
dropping people at almost any range like
you'll<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.710> able<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.220> kill<00:01:29.430> people<00:01:29.479> beyond<00:01:30.479> 100

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
you'll be able to kill people beyond 100

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
you'll be able to kill people beyond 100
meters<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.439> m16<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.340> tap<00:01:32.549> fire<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
meters with the m16 just tap fire and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
meters with the m16 just tap fire and
tap<00:01:33.150> firing<00:01:33.390> tap<00:01:33.630> fire<00:01:33.869> they'll<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.409> dead<00:01:34.619> so

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
tap firing tap fire they'll be dead so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
tap firing tap fire they'll be dead so
it's<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.970> strong<00:01:36.210> weapon<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it's a really strong weapon in that

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.440 
it's a really strong weapon in that
regard<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> judge<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.880> weapon<00:01:39.299> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
regard and the way I judge a weapon to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
regard and the way I judge a weapon to
be<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> best<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> gun<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.250> performs<00:01:41.790> well

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
be the best is a gun that performs well

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.929 
be the best is a gun that performs well
at<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.390> ranges<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.430> let's<00:01:44.700> say

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
at all ranges so you can have let's say

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.630 
at all ranges so you can have let's say
a<00:01:45.210> UMP<00:01:46.049> 45<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.950> great<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.280> short<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
a UMP 45 which is great at short and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.370 
a UMP 45 which is great at short and
medium<00:01:47.970> range<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.170> best

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
medium range but it's not the best

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.139 
medium range but it's not the best
because<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> doesn't<00:01:50.220> perform<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.729> every

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
because it doesn't perform in every

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
because it doesn't perform in every
instance<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> same<00:01:52.079> way<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.500> shotgun<00:01:52.920> is

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
instance the same way that a shotgun is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.740 
instance the same way that a shotgun is
bad<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> sniper<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.909> bad<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.360> reason

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
bad or a sniper is bad for that reason

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.749 
bad or a sniper is bad for that reason
because<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.530> doesn't<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.340> overall

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
because it doesn't have the overall

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.690 
because it doesn't have the overall
package<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.509> m16<00:01:58.110> absolutely<00:01:59.009> has<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.460> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
package the m16 absolutely has that it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.459 
package the m16 absolutely has that it
is<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.420> most<00:02:00.659> powerful<00:02:00.930> assault

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
is one of the most powerful assault

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
is one of the most powerful assault
rifles<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> game<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.520> terms<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.450> it's

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
rifles in the game in terms of not it's

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.080 
rifles in the game in terms of not it's
damaged<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.530> RPM<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.100> 800<00:02:05.790> rounds<00:02:06.030> per

high<00:02:09.569> time<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.080> kill<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.500> that's<00:02:10.709> all<00:02:11.009> you

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
high time to kill and that's all you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.960 
high time to kill and that's all you
really<00:02:11.430> need

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
really need

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.270 
really need
in<00:02:12.120> FPS<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.840> all<00:02:13.020> about<00:02:13.320> time<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.830> kill<00:02:14.040> and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
in FPS it's all about time to kill and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.250 
in FPS it's all about time to kill and
that's<00:02:14.670> where<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.000> m16<00:02:15.570> performs<00:02:16.020> really

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that's where the m16 performs really

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.080 
that's where the m16 performs really
well<00:02:16.410> now<00:02:16.890> didn't<00:02:17.160> want<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.400> video<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.940> a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
on most of the guns but with the m16

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.960 
on most of the guns but with the m16
it's<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.650> little<00:02:34.890> bit<00:02:35.010> special<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.550> me<00:02:35.670> just

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
particular weapon now that is a very

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.100 
particular weapon now that is a very
difficult<00:02:55.709> task<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:57.030> lot<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.660> kills

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
difficult task that is a lot of kills

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.080 
difficult task that is a lot of kills
you<00:02:58.350> need<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.770> get<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.340> when<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.640> think<00:02:59.940> about

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
you need to get but when you think about

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.180 
you need to get but when you think about
it<00:03:00.510> it's<00:03:00.660> really<00:03:01.020> not<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.320> much<00:03:01.709> if<00:03:01.980> you're

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
it it's really not that much if you're

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.760 
it it's really not that much if you're
putting<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.000> much<00:03:03.240> time<00:03:03.300> into<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:04.200> weapon

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
putting so much time into a weapon

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.040 
putting so much time into a weapon
you'll<00:03:05.040> get<00:03:05.190> 500<00:03:05.760> kills<00:03:06.000> pretty<00:03:06.270> easily<00:03:06.480> like

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
you'll get 500 kills pretty easily like

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.380 
you'll get 500 kills pretty easily like
my<00:03:07.380> top<00:03:07.560> 5<00:03:07.770> weapons<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.310> at<00:03:08.459> least<00:03:08.670> 2,000

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.090 
my top 5 weapons I have at least 2,000
kills<00:03:09.600> with<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.140> know<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.740> be<00:03:10.920> done

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100

kills with you know it can be done
pretty<00:03:11.340> fast<00:03:11.700> like<00:03:11.940> for<00:03:12.209> me<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.630> beta<00:03:12.840> of

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
pretty fast like for me and the beta of

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.140 
pretty fast like for me and the beta of
being<00:03:13.200> able<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.470> get<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.830> done<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.040> surely<00:03:14.670> when

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
being able to get it done so surely when
