00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.650
 Look, connect on the training channel. 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.630
 people today are mondays and like all 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.340
 on Mondays deposits videos 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.320
 new here on the channel 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.769
 I'll post an hour on a circuit 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.070
 that goes that promises to eliminate all weight 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.670
 your body to the whole group and leave 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.290
 all so stiff and not all O 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.730
 those skin works 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.489
 that's why every monday 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.890
 opposite a different video where you are 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.010
 working the entire musculature as a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.860
 everything is not only specific here or 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.120
 That's when you train together. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.360
 so next 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.699
 Today's lesson will focus on what is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.899
 usually and mainly that is the focus 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.820
 central thigh common and mainly 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.119
 mainly those fats that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.280
 We have here in the cups, I'll explain. 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.890
 this is the last to explain 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.470
 is thus a sequence of three 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.229
 where I 'm going to do one in the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.650
 sequence of the other 15 repetitions three 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.189
 Sometimes not everything is so the first is 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:27.720
 to pass his legs well was to crouch and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.990
 touch the toes on the floor and I 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.159
 I fell when I fell and I fell with the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.750
 tiptoe on the ground I will not fall 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.420
 flat on the floor with crooked feet because 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 will have an impact mainly on the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.570
 region of the lumbar and knee 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.220
 always circular and falls on the edge 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.320
 soft as free 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.420
 So this is the first one I'll stay with. 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.360
 side to watch and I'm going down with 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.659
 a boom back and not built to 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.119
 I'm going down here and I'm going to jump. 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.280
 This is the first one to do 15 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.579
 repetitions in sequence 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.960
 I will do what the lift the knee and 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:13.780
 at the same time and to meet 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.540
 with othon 112 stem is not only 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.790
 raise the knee descends trunk too 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 in the air whenever you want and the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.340
 third, which is where it goes 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.500
 promise or burn the fat of 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.440
 back is in the race 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.110
 today we move the arms of this 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.819
 This is a way to tilt it a little bit. 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:39.850
 back and O 12 force behind it 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.950
 says against this part here it makes force 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.840
 with the conbrascom behind 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.880
 so let's start today's lesson the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.459
 people are going to do this sequence once 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.760
 for you to do it in your house, go 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:59.640
 there he will find on the floor jump 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:04.680
 23 against the abdomen slightly 4 5 6 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:14.819
 7 8 and 9 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:35.150
 10 11 12 13 14 and 15 in the sequence I will 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:57.689
 amend 12 26 34 45 56 67 88 99 10 10 11 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:04:02.639
 12 13 14 and 15 8 9 10 11 12 14 and 15 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:05.879
 It does this is three times 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.729
 This race is over. 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.430
 already the amendment plus one starting the first 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:14.220
 second and the race is past three 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.090
 times do every day 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.539
 You do not need to rest the other day. 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.780
 because it is an aerobic activity and not 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.780
 we work with weight and overload 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:33.270
 then it gives the body time to recover 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.419
 naturally a four hour break 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.150
 72 hours when we work with 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.110
 overload on the cores we are 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.159
 that 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.440
 instagram writes the channel 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:50.490

 went
