00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 so you'll learn right now 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.609
 some ways of raising this ceiling in the 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.420
 in accordance with the legislation of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.880
 Traffic 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.769
 Follow with me, you're one of those who 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.389
 They like a bike. 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.790
 but to get to the destination where you go 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.250
 pedaling you need to know how to transport 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.199
 there you go to do it anyway 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.160
 can take a fine still have the vehicle 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.590
 seized 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.510
 maira knows what's right until she's bought it 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.939
 this truck just to take the bike 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.460
 she puts it back there pretty well 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.189
 tied to the four corners of the bucket 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.649
 I get on a bike quickly and I'm already in. 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.630
 it is much more practical there are other 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.670
 ways to carry a bicycle and 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.460
 different types of support for the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 coupling for rear cover and proto 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.480
 to start 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.520
 should not exceed the maximum width of the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.100
 vehicle that is for your reference 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 the mirrors can not pass from them and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.250
 never compromise the stability of the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.750
 vehicle 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 we will demonstrate to you now 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.309
 how to take the bike on the roof 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.039
 have this fastening bracket 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.290
 I already open his cap and felipe 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.450
 will bring the gutter that will fit 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.650
 right up here for the bike 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.570
 then do not 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.869
 we advise you to really take the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.880
 bike standing up here the docking 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.580
 her in undue cash that she already has 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 prepared in the test said cleto 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.890
 I come to do a test, it's not to move. 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.479
 bike to see if it is fixed 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.450
 Correct, you must be wondering. 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.970
 But how is the bike transport in? 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.700
 foot is not allowed as the load on the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.509
 car roof and silk 50cm 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.329
 height 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.759
 in this case specifically to an exception 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.159
 in law only bicycles can be 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.170
 transported in such conditions 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.479
 taking the bike back and it's over 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.060
 capping the taillights and the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.100
 a light repeater must be installed and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.420
 an additional card that needs to be 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.159
 sealed by the detran 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.560
 even better if you have a support 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.560
 with all this along with this one from here 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.109
 coupling is also necessary for those who 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.850
 You need to take the bike for example to around 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:09.009
 make the trailer into action 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.230
 which has all the installation 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.239
 required with brake lights 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.069
 for sure and flashlights 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.410
 remembering that it must be registered 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.170
 as if it were another vehicle 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.160
 now the truck drivers have more 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.330
 one option 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.549
 good bike or bike 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.989
 you follow all the rules right 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.599
 there is no problem 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.780
 there only take more care and attention 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.030
 When you drive, remember to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.680
 when parking the car 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.680
 You do not want to be robbed, do not you?
