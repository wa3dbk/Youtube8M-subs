00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.480
 a lot of child freedom 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.370
 but there is another helmet 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.519

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.679

 Of course there are in contrast to yours 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.050
 beloved the classic flaps 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.089
 as the name suggests, it can be done 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.030
 Divide the child upwards 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.440
 this is a comfort feature when refueling 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.710
 very popular one can accordingly 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.089
 what childhood is still about interests are yes 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.039
 next to the flaps , there are also still 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.780
 the classical integral what do you have 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.269
 because so typical in the program 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.070
 So here too a classic 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.590
 integral helmet as the name suggests it 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.570
 consists of a piece where the child 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.469
 has accordingly not upwards 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.810
 can fold 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.100
 feature agreed here 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.439
 of course, an integrated 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.420
 Sonnenblende I already see it here 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.409
 for example, the windbreak again 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.000
 extra for the nose in there 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.689
 Also on equipment so this 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.700
 Specially also has all the pump system 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.520
 this can be seen very clearly here 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.409
 never with the cheek pads 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.929
 inflate accordingly nestle 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.030
 accordingly better the cheeks and 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.590
 the head of the customer accordingly 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.200
 that means I just have it here 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.670
 Facial also feature again what 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.710
 me a better fit then at the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.270
 Helmet allows just that 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.640
 Accordingly, you can just stop the helmet 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.200
 to adapt better now, of course 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.210
 also very different materials 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.829
 what is there for the helmets used 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.409
 because im so basically for 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.219
 materials that are used 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.380
 essentially, these are exactly three 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.229
 materials once polycarbonate 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.270
 fiberglass and carbon you have here 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.620
 for example, from your own brand exe 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.180
 and carbon helmet stand for 299 euros 299 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.620
 euro this is in comparison to the carbon 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.360
 Heroes of other manufacturers yes really 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.390
 cheap how come you on this 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.099
 Price difference yes first of the price 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.380
 says nothing about the quality 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.519
 we definitely do not cut back on what 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.800
 the quality is concerned 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.410
 This helmet was also released in 2013 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.670
 Motorcycle with well rated the 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.380
 essential components of the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.330
 Price differences are just that at 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.220
 from our factory to our stores 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.860
 Occasion will be with us 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.260
 no dealer in between means like 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.970
 operator also no sponsoring etc 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.920
 that means you have very little 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.299
 Distribution costs the short way from the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.220
 manufacture directly in the store 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.230
 That's just where the customer is with you 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.930
 saving is right I am now 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.120
 already used to things 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.380
 volume just what a cross 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.920
 hellmann you go up here that is 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.750
 just a windscreen you have 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.549
 to try out the different helmets 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.430
 here in the wind tunnel 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.410
 how is that so when buying advice 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.359
 of course, when making a purchase decision as well 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.060
 if a customer for different 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.260
 helmets are always interested 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.970
 Everybody was a little bit different 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.620
 somehow different or so 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.569
 basically applies when buying helmets 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.910
 every helmet just has to be tested 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.410
 The fit is different 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.690
 but every manufacturer has his own 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.620
 philosophy and of course the head 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.540
 the customer is accordingly 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.760
 different but there I would be smooth 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.319
 Let's say that we have here in the wind tunnel 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.090
 but then let's just time in the home 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.889
 we test yes exactly I've just 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.480
 some which and then we look at that 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.130
 is still the same it breaks me still 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.390
 really convinced of another guy 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.390
 the mind is okay 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.290
 especially in the wind tunnel, both were very 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.760
 quietly but I would just say that 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.040
 grab us another colleague 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.269
 from you and best texts in which I 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.420
 on the street and then we drive 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.420
 times 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.750
 more 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.930
 we have the two skies just fine 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.520
 please have a look at the next one 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.230
 polo store over and try a few 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.340
 Models from there is always a good one 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.630
 Selection from different manufacturers 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.980
 and dealers 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.480
 but I'm going to sit down now 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.520
 my crossing on because now it works 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.060
 continue with the test report of ktm 11 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.060
 990 adventure
