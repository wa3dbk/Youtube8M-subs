00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.160
Today we’ve got our hands on the Touareg,
the latest version of Volkswagen’s large

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.070
SUV. First unveiled at the Beijing Auto Show
in 2014, bi-xenon headlights are now standard,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.510
and there’s a new four-bar grille along
with reprofiled bumpers front and rear. Overall

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.760
the Touareg now looks just that bit wider
and meaner.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.930
Under the skin, the biggest changes include
a coasting function for the eight-speed gearbox

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.899
and tweaks to the diesel engine, all geared
towards making the Touareg more affordable

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.391
to run.
Starting at just over £40,000 there’s no

00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:58.039
doubting the Touareg is a premium model. Even
the entry-level SE we’re driving gets leather

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.579
upholstery as standard, along with dual zone
climate control and this vast and easy-to-use

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.130
8-inch touch-screen. The wooden trim might
not be to everyone’s taste, but there’s

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:21.020
no doubting the quality of everything in here
and all the controls are well laid-out.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.930
Space is ample, particularly shoulder room,
and there’s lots of room in the back seats

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.030
for children or adults. They can also slide
back and forth and recline for extra comfort

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.789
on long trips. But, this brings us on to our
main criticism, which is the lack of a seven-seat

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:41.090
version, as offered by most rivals.
There’s 580-litres of luggage volume behind

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.409
the rear seats, extending to 1,642 litres,
which is less than the 650-litres found in

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:59.870
the BMW X5 and the vast boot in the Land Rover
Discovery.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.750
The Touareg shares its basic underpinnings
with the Porsche Cayenne, but the two feel

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.600
very different to drive. The Volkswagen has
relaxed driving manners and feels much softer

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:17.590
in its responses than the Porsche. Its meaty
controls, flexible V6 diesel and smooth automatic

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.420
remind us more of a luxury saloon than an
off-roader, but the Touareg can get you over

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.709
rough terrain.
Along a twisty road the Touareg has little

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.260
body roll and plenty of grip, even if there’s
still a sense you are driving a large, heavy

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.629
vehicle. One benefit of its size is the Touareg’s
ability to haul large trailers and caravans

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.879
with ease, thanks to its 3.5 tonne towing
capacity.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.380
Just one engine is available, a 3.0-litre
V6 diesel in either the 204bhp version we’re

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:00.090
testing or with 262bhp. To be honest, either
feels brisk enough, with the sprint to 62mph

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:08.760
shrinking from the 8.7 seconds of this model
to just over 7 seconds. The automatic gearbox

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.019
changes gear swiftly and smoothly, and the
coasting function allows the car to freewheel

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.810
when you back off the throttle, saving fuel.
Both can return 43mpg.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:28.740
The 
Touareg is a smart looking and solid contender

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.560
amongst SUVs, undercutting some of its more
premium rivals on price. Our main niggles

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.670
are its five-seat-only layout and smallish
boot, but if these don’t concern you, the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.270
Touareg is more economical than the likes
of the Discovery and a little more car-like

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.390
to drive.
But, what do you think of the Volkswagen Touareg?
