"No one comes to live
permanently in my heart."

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:30.002
"No one comes to live
permanently in my heart."

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.589

It is not surprising that the king

00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:02.434
..was much interested in
classical music too.

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:05.122
Whether it was a 'Khayal',
'Thumri' or 'Drupad'..

00:01:05.396 --> 00:01:08.284
..Jagjit Singh was expert
in all the styles.

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:12.561
"Touch it with your lips.."

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:16.760
In the year 1965, Jagjit Singh
came to Mumbai.

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:21.385
His desire was to be
a musician or a singer.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.485
In the beginning, Jagjit Singh
used to sing jingles for ads.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.235
There he met Chitra Singh.

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:32.273
Though they didn't know at that
time that they would become husband..

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:34.010
..and wife and get into
a lifelong relationship.

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:43.451
"There would have been a sigh..
I must not have listened."

00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:52.781
"While leaving.. you must
have called out to me."

00:01:53.017 --> 00:01:57.567
When Jagjit Singh started
singing Ghazals..

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.030
..there were already many
big shots in this field.

00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:04.538
Such as Begum Akhtar, Noor Jehan,
Mehndi Hassan and Talat Mehboob.

00:02:04.618 --> 00:02:06.993
But steadily, Jagjit Singh..

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.356
..tried more and more to make
Ghazal singing simpler.

00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:13.772
But he never interfered with
the format of a Ghazal.

00:02:13.993 --> 00:02:16.568
"Why did you love?"

00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:18.955
"What will you achieve from it?"

00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:21.693
Jagjit Singh's Ghazals and songs..

00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:24.231
..slowly started carving a place
in people's heart.

00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:27.831
And it was not much longer that
Jagjit Singh was going to be an..

00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:30.131
..uncrowned king of  Ghazals.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.514
"Why are you smiling so much?"

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:37.696
When Jagjit Singh sir started
singing for films..

00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:41.609
..a new genre of film singing
was presented to the audience.

00:02:41.886 --> 00:02:45.214
Such as the songs for film
'Saath Saath' and 'Arth'.

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:49.460
"The skirting eyes."

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.526
But Jagjit Singh got
the most popularity..

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:53.565
..when he sang the
Ghazals for the film..

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:59.713
..'Mirza Ghalib'. This television
serial was produced and directed by..

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.249
.. Jagjit Singh's friend, Gulzar sir.

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.340
"It's just the heart."

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.860
Chitra Singh and  Jagjit Singh's
voice gave a new dimension to..

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.580
.. Mirza Ghalib's Ghazals.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.031
"O naÄ«ve heart.."

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.251
Slowly, Jagjit Singh moved
away from films.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.764
But Jagjit Singh's private
albums made him very popular.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.500
Jagjit Singh's pairing was
made with many talented poets.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.591
Such as Javed Akhtar,
Gulzar and Nida Fazli.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.758
"You make me believe.."

00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:39.531
Not just India, but his
concerts used to be loved..

00:03:39.778 --> 00:03:43.085
by international audiences too.

00:03:43.298 --> 00:03:45.618
"O Mother..."

00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:52.078
Jagjit Singh and Chitra Singh's
life came across a dangerous turn..

00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:56.640
..when their only 20 year old son,
Vivek was killed in a car accident.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.470
After this incident,
Chitra Singh stopped singing.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:08.793
But Jagjit Singh bravely faced the
world with his broken heart and kept..

00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:12.569
..entertaining us with
his Ghazals and songs.

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:17.549
"After hurting my heart."

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:25.816
"Where are you heading
where you can find peace."

00:04:26.296 --> 00:04:30.346
"Where you can find peace."

00:04:31.217 --> 00:04:35.307
"Where you can find peace."
