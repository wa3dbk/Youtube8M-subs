I wanted to quickly go through nd
filters<00:00:13.810> quickly<00:00:14.410> and<00:00:14.740> show<00:00:15.130> three<00:00:15.370> different

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
filters quickly and show three different

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.909 
filters quickly and show three different
types<00:00:15.790> of<00:00:15.940> MD<00:00:16.209> filter<00:00:16.630> that's<00:00:17.410> these<00:00:17.619> neutral

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:17.919 
types of MD filter that's these neutral

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.849 
types of MD filter that's these neutral
density<00:00:18.099> filters<00:00:18.609> I<00:00:18.939> want<00:00:19.269> to<00:00:19.359> show<00:00:19.859> basically

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859

on<00:00:21.070> the<00:00:21.220> 600d<00:00:22.029> here<00:00:22.300> which<00:00:22.419> I'm<00:00:22.570> filming<00:00:23.019> on

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
on the 600d here which I'm filming on

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.019 
on the 600d here which I'm filming on
I've<00:00:23.710> got<00:00:23.859> one<00:00:23.980> of<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:24.130> ND<00:00:24.400> filters<00:00:24.789> a<00:00:24.820> net

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
I've got one of the ND filters a net

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.329 
I've got one of the ND filters a net
variable<00:00:25.449> nd<00:00:25.869> on<00:00:26.079> the<00:00:26.230> camera<00:00:26.560> and<00:00:27.039> again<00:00:27.130> we

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339 
variable nd on the camera and again we

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:28.620 
variable nd on the camera and again we
might<00:00:27.429> remember<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.849> way<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:27.970> point<00:00:28.449> of<00:00:28.539> all

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
might remember the way the point of all

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.479 
might remember the way the point of all
of<00:00:28.659> this<00:00:28.810> was<00:00:29.019> to<00:00:29.109> try<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.380> get<00:00:29.529> a<00:00:29.980> wide

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
of this was to try and get a wide

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.400 
of this was to try and get a wide
aperture<00:00:30.789> shot<00:00:31.239> that's<00:00:31.839> a<00:00:31.989> lot<00:00:32.110> of<00:00:32.230> lighting

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
aperture shot that's a lot of lighting

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.470 
aperture shot that's a lot of lighting
to<00:00:32.800> allow<00:00:33.340> this<00:00:33.520> narrow<00:00:33.820> depth<00:00:34.030> of<00:00:34.180> field<00:00:34.360> so<00:00:34.450> I

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
to allow this narrow depth of field so I

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.210 
to allow this narrow depth of field so I
should<00:00:34.780> be<00:00:34.900> in<00:00:35.020> focus<00:00:35.170> there<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:35.770> the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
should be in focus there and the

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.040 
should be in focus there and the
background<00:00:36.640> should<00:00:36.790> be<00:00:36.910> out<00:00:37.000> of<00:00:37.030> focus<00:00:37.240> and<00:00:37.960> I

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
background should be out of focus and I

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.390 
background should be out of focus and I
can<00:00:38.200> do<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.440> because<00:00:38.620> I'm<00:00:38.800> using<00:00:38.950> an<00:00:39.160> ND

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
can do that because I'm using an ND

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.940 
can do that because I'm using an ND
filter<00:00:39.430> on<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.060> front<00:00:40.420> of<00:00:40.810> the<00:00:40.930> lens<00:00:41.320> so<00:00:41.710> I'm

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
filter on the front of the lens so I'm

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.770 
filter on the front of the lens so I'm
quickly<00:00:42.220> show<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.490> the<00:00:42.550> three<00:00:42.760> types<00:00:43.000> and<00:00:43.510> and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
quickly show you the three types and and

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.750 
quickly show you the three types and and
you<00:00:44.530> can<00:00:44.680> have<00:00:44.770> a<00:00:44.800> look<00:00:44.950> yourself<00:00:45.010> so<00:00:45.400> you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
you can have a look yourself so you

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.970 
you can have a look yourself so you
think<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:46.030> them<00:00:46.150> but<00:00:46.750> three<00:00:47.470> different<00:00:47.530> three

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
think of them but three different three

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.820 
think of them but three different three
different<00:00:48.810> types<00:00:49.810> of<00:00:50.020> ND<00:00:50.230> filters<00:00:50.500> ready<00:00:50.680> for

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
different types of ND filters ready for

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.670 
different types of ND filters ready for
the<00:00:50.890> same<00:00:51.040> job<00:00:51.310> and<00:00:51.490> the<00:00:51.730> same<00:00:51.940> end<00:00:52.240> result<00:00:52.680> so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
the same job and the same end result so

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.640 
the same job and the same end result so
the<00:00:54.550> first<00:00:54.790> way<00:00:54.880> I've<00:00:54.940> got<00:00:55.090> on<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.810> variable

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
the first way I've got on is a variable

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.490 
the first way I've got on is a variable
ND<00:00:56.890> filter<00:00:57.130> this<00:00:57.790> is<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:57.970> light<00:00:58.690> craft<00:00:59.020> light

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
ND filter this is a light craft light

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.550 
ND filter this is a light craft light
works<00:00:59.800> in<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:01.300> variable<00:01:01.780> ND<00:01:01.960> filter<00:01:01.990> I<00:01:02.350> bought

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
works in the variable ND filter I bought

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.829 
works in the variable ND filter I bought
this<00:01:02.710> because<00:01:02.920> it's<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.460> mid<00:01:03.880> range<00:01:04.089> it's<00:01:04.689> not

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
this because it's a mid range it's not

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.880 
this because it's a mid range it's not
so<00:01:05.079> cheap<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.590> can<00:01:06.490> get<00:01:06.670> them<00:01:06.820> LaBella<00:01:07.749> 70<00:01:08.710> to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
so cheap you can get them LaBella 70 to

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.219 
so cheap you can get them LaBella 70 to
100<00:01:09.280> pounds<00:01:09.429> I<00:01:09.640> think<00:01:09.869> depending<00:01:10.869> on<00:01:10.929> the<00:01:10.990> size

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
100 pounds I think depending on the size

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.499 
100 pounds I think depending on the size
of<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.469> lens<00:01:11.679> and<00:01:11.999> I<00:01:12.999> got<00:01:13.149> this<00:01:13.240> particular

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
of the lens and I got this particular

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.550 
of the lens and I got this particular
one<00:01:13.840> on<00:01:14.020> this<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:16.270> one<00:01:16.479> is<00:01:16.689> a<00:01:17.100> 72<00:01:18.240> millimeter

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
one on this this one is a 72 millimeter

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.050 
one on this this one is a 72 millimeter
nd<00:01:20.560> variable<00:01:21.100> ND<00:01:21.310> filter<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.819> reason<00:01:22.030> I

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
nd variable ND filter and the reason I

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.149 
nd variable ND filter and the reason I
got<00:01:22.179> that<00:01:22.359> was<00:01:22.539> basically<00:01:22.899> because<00:01:23.259> it<00:01:23.590> will

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
got that was basically because it will

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.840 
got that was basically because it will
fit<00:01:24.399> my<00:01:24.549> 72<00:01:25.179> millimeter<00:01:25.569> filter<00:01:26.109> size<00:01:26.579> lens<00:01:27.579> my

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
fit my 72 millimeter filter size lens my

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.929 
fit my 72 millimeter filter size lens my

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
50 millimeter 1.2 Canon lens so I pulled

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.309 
50 millimeter 1.2 Canon lens so I pulled
it<00:01:30.999> for<00:01:31.119> that<00:01:31.210> reason<00:01:31.359> but<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:31.960> want<00:01:32.139> to<00:01:32.200> be<00:01:32.259> able

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
it for that reason but I want to be able

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.870 
it for that reason but I want to be able
use<00:01:32.469> it<00:01:32.560> on<00:01:32.649> other<00:01:32.770> lenses<00:01:33.189> so<00:01:33.429> I'm<00:01:33.549> using<00:01:33.729> it

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
use it on other lenses so I'm using it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.700 
use it on other lenses so I'm using it
now<00:01:33.939> on<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.119> 50<00:01:34.359> millimeter<00:01:34.509> 1.8<00:01:35.259> lens<00:01:35.499> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
now on the 50 millimeter 1.8 lens the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.039 
now on the 50 millimeter 1.8 lens the

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
Canon 50 minutes that great lens and as

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.450 
Canon 50 minutes that great lens and as
a<00:01:38.139> result<00:01:38.439> rather<00:01:38.649> than<00:01:38.770> by<00:01:38.920> another<00:01:39.189> filter

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
a result rather than by another filter

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.789 
a result rather than by another filter
variable<00:01:39.909> ND<00:01:40.179> filter<00:01:40.210> all<00:01:40.899> i<00:01:40.929> do<00:01:41.200> i've<00:01:41.530> got<00:01:41.560> is

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
variable ND filter all i do i've got is

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.129 
variable ND filter all i do i've got is
a<00:01:41.829> step-down<00:01:42.159> ring<00:01:42.609> from<00:01:43.179> 72<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:46.139> 52

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.139 
a step-down ring from 72 to 52

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:50.999 
a step-down ring from 72 to 52
millimeters<00:01:49.229> step-down<00:01:50.229> ring<00:01:50.499> so<00:01:50.679> it<00:01:50.770> allows

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
millimeters step-down ring so it allows

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.340 
millimeters step-down ring so it allows
me<00:01:51.159> to<00:01:51.310> use<00:01:51.459> it<00:01:51.729> on<00:01:51.819> both<00:01:51.850> lenses<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:53.139> that's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
me to use it on both lenses so that's

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.929 
me to use it on both lenses so that's
there<00:01:53.560> I<00:01:53.590> also<00:01:53.859> have<00:01:54.039> a<00:01:54.069> look<00:01:54.159> at<00:01:54.249> these<00:01:54.369> other

there I also have a look at these other

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.300 
there I also have a look at these other
two<00:01:55.209> options<00:01:55.450> as<00:01:55.780> well<00:01:55.959> the<00:01:56.679> variable<00:01:57.009> n<00:01:57.100> DS

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
two options as well the variable n DS

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.889 
two options as well the variable n DS
tend<00:01:57.609> to<00:01:57.700> be<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:57.880> most<00:01:57.999> expensive<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.630> one<00:01:58.810> on

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
tend to be the most expensive the one on

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.469 
tend to be the most expensive the one on
the<00:01:58.959> camera<00:01:59.319> I<00:01:59.469> can<00:01:59.889> have<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.009> look<00:02:00.130> at<00:02:00.219> this<00:02:00.479> one

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
the camera I can have a look at this one

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.139 
the camera I can have a look at this one
option<00:02:01.779> which<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:02.049> probably<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.009> cheapest<00:02:03.969> is

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
option which is probably the cheapest is

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.779 
option which is probably the cheapest is
just<00:02:04.359> the<00:02:04.479> fixed<00:02:04.840> ND<00:02:05.829> filter<00:02:06.249> this<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.459> a<00:02:06.490> coud

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
just the fixed ND filter this is a coud

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.940 
just the fixed ND filter this is a coud
mid-range<00:02:07.329> one<00:02:07.600> before<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.349> Canon<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.799> get

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
mid-range one before the Canon you get

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.759 
mid-range one before the Canon you get
them<00:02:09.069> in<00:02:09.189> different

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
them in different

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.479 
them in different
strengths<00:02:10.579> that's<00:02:11.299> named<00:02:11.510> d4<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.170> mv8<00:02:12.799> and

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
strengths that's named d4 and mv8 and

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.429 
strengths that's named d4 and mv8 and
I've<00:02:13.549> got<00:02:13.640> an<00:02:13.730> MD<00:02:13.909> 16<00:02:14.359> here<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:14.959> then<00:02:15.230> finally

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
I've got an MD 16 here and then finally

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.830 
I've got an MD 16 here and then finally
another<00:02:15.709> look<00:02:15.890> at<00:02:16.299> these<00:02:17.299> ones<00:02:17.569> these<00:02:17.689> are<00:02:17.750> the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
another look at these ones these are the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.250 
another look at these ones these are the
flat<00:02:18.469> these<00:02:18.620> are<00:02:18.799> resin<00:02:19.040> ones<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:20.140> these<00:02:21.140> are

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
flat these are resin ones and these are

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.280 
flat these are resin ones and these are
actually<00:02:21.530> very<00:02:22.719> these<00:02:23.719> are<00:02:23.840> good<00:02:23.959> quality

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
actually very these are good quality

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.869 
actually very these are good quality
ones<00:02:24.469> not<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.890> most<00:02:25.010> expensive<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.519> fairly

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
ones not the most expensive a fairly

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.800 
ones not the most expensive a fairly
good<00:02:26.000> quality<00:02:26.359> and<00:02:26.599> these<00:02:28.209> are<00:02:29.209> quite<00:02:29.750> large

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
good quality and these are quite large

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.990 
good quality and these are quite large
100<00:02:30.500> mil<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.680> think<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.400> they'll<00:02:31.609> fit<00:02:31.790> over

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
100 mil I think and they'll fit over

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.729 
100 mil I think and they'll fit over
pretty<00:02:32.150> well<00:02:32.239> any<00:02:32.420> lens<00:02:32.689> and<00:02:32.989> for<00:02:33.439> that<00:02:33.530> reason

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
pretty well any lens and for that reason

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.050 
pretty well any lens and for that reason
you<00:02:33.769> have<00:02:33.829> a<00:02:33.920> special<00:02:34.219> mount<00:02:34.459> for<00:02:34.700> them<00:02:34.849> and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
you have a special mount for them and

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.030 
you have a special mount for them and
you<00:02:35.870> can<00:02:35.900> fit<00:02:36.139> more<00:02:36.349> than<00:02:36.409> one<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.799> them<00:02:36.920> they

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
you can fit more than one of them they

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.559 
you can fit more than one of them they
come<00:02:37.219> in<00:02:37.310> different<00:02:37.430> strengths<00:02:37.969> too<00:02:38.180> and

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
come in different strengths too and

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.360 
come in different strengths too and
again<00:02:39.109> you<00:02:39.200> can<00:02:39.349> fit<00:02:39.560> four<00:02:39.920> different<00:02:40.219> types

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
again you can fit four different types

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.619 
again you can fit four different types
of<00:02:40.549> size<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.879> lens<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.269> different<00:02:42.489> adapter

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
of size the lens is different adapter

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.309 
of size the lens is different adapter
things<00:02:44.629> for<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:44.930> we'll<00:02:45.049> have<00:02:45.109> a<00:02:45.169> quick

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
things for that so we'll have a quick

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.270 
things for that so we'll have a quick
look<00:02:45.379> at<00:02:45.500> fitting<00:02:45.709> they're<00:02:45.859> three<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.129> them

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
look at fitting they're three of them

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.979 
look at fitting they're three of them
and<00:02:46.519> you'll<00:02:46.849> see<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.090> effect<00:02:47.150> though<00:02:47.480> is

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
and you'll see the effect though is

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:57.620 
and you'll see the effect though is
pretty<00:02:48.590> well<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:49.010> same

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.030 

so<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.810> variable<00:02:59.170> ND<00:02:59.410> filter<00:02:59.440> there<00:02:59.860> if<00:02:59.950> I

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
so the variable ND filter there if I

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.100 
so the variable ND filter there if I
just<00:03:00.190> check<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.490> exposure<00:03:00.850> again<00:03:01.180> there

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
just check the exposure again there

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.510 
just check the exposure again there
that's<00:03:02.530> not<00:03:02.710> even<00:03:02.950> see<00:03:03.100> it's<00:03:03.250> slightly

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
that's not even see it's slightly

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.700 
that's not even see it's slightly
overexposed<00:03:03.900> I've<00:03:04.900> got<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.110> filter<00:03:05.380> on<00:03:05.500> now

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
overexposed I've got the filter on now

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.760 
overexposed I've got the filter on now
and<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:07.060> by<00:03:07.180> moving<00:03:07.330> it<00:03:07.570> around<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:08.470> can<00:03:08.590> see

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
and just by moving it around you can see

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.920 
and just by moving it around you can see
I<00:03:08.800> can<00:03:09.100> let<00:03:09.220> more<00:03:09.910> let<00:03:10.270> more<00:03:10.450> likely<00:03:10.750> in<00:03:10.810> or

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
I can let more let more likely in or

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.160 
I can let more let more likely in or
what<00:03:11.080> turn<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.470> other<00:03:11.500> way<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:12.720> can<00:03:13.720> reduce

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
what turn it the other way I can reduce

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.120 
what turn it the other way I can reduce
the<00:03:14.350> amount<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.560> light<00:03:14.710> coming<00:03:14.740> in<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.100> can

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
the amount of light coming in you can

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.790 
the amount of light coming in you can
see<00:03:15.340> there<00:03:15.490> just<00:03:15.640> by<00:03:15.730> turning<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.150> round<00:03:16.330> so

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
see there just by turning it round so

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.380 
see there just by turning it round so
it's<00:03:17.800> pretty<00:03:18.340> well<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.520> exact<00:03:18.820> amount<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.240> want

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
it's pretty well the exact amount I want

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.470 
it's pretty well the exact amount I want
in<00:03:19.980> there<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.100> can<00:03:21.250> see<00:03:21.280> there<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:22.120> I'll<00:03:22.180> stand

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
in there you can see there so I'll stand

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.910 
in there you can see there so I'll stand
in<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.810> picture<00:03:23.200> now<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.530> just<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.740> show<00:03:23.890> you

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
in the picture now and just to show you

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.949 
in the picture now and just to show you
that<00:03:24.010> works

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.240 

so<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.769> see<00:03:31.950> there<00:03:32.189> hopefully<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.510> I'm

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
so you can see there hopefully that I'm

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.709 
so you can see there hopefully that I'm
in<00:03:35.250> focus<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.819> area<00:03:36.000> behind<00:03:36.150> me<00:03:36.329> that's

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:36.719 
in focus in the area behind me that's

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.539 
in focus in the area behind me that's
using<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.049> variable<00:03:37.349> nd<00:03:37.590> one<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:37.980> sandy

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
using the variable nd one so sandy

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:39.319 
using the variable nd one so sandy
because<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:38.879> actually<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.239> fly

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
because you can actually on the fly

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.940 
because you can actually on the fly
change<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.140> amount<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.379> light<00:03:40.530> coming<00:03:40.560> in

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
change the amount of light coming in

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.589 
change the amount of light coming in
just<00:03:41.069> by<00:03:41.219> rotating<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.239> gonna<00:03:42.359> use<00:03:42.450> this

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
just by rotating it I'm gonna use this

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.759 
just by rotating it I'm gonna use this
time<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.019> coudé<00:03:45.049> these<00:03:46.049> these<00:03:46.230> coud<00:03:46.530> fix

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
time the coudé these these coud fix

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:47.809 
time the coudé these these coud fix
filters<00:03:47.159> you<00:03:47.250> can<00:03:47.310> get<00:03:47.459> many<00:03:47.549> different

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
filters you can get many different

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.309 
filters you can get many different
brands<00:03:48.030> cludes<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.389> good<00:03:48.510> mid-level<00:03:48.930> one<00:03:49.079> or

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
brands cludes a good mid-level one or

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.869 
brands cludes a good mid-level one or
japanese-made<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.980> thing<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> pretty<00:03:50.730> good

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
japanese-made a thing and a pretty good

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.289 
japanese-made a thing and a pretty good
quality<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.109> coud<00:03:52.489> ND<00:03:53.489> 16<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.120> think

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
quality so this is a coud ND 16 I think

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.309 
quality so this is a coud ND 16 I think
that<00:03:54.480> gives<00:03:54.659> three<00:03:54.959> stops<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.889> them<00:03:56.760> of

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
that gives three stops of them of

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:06.330 
that gives three stops of them of
darkening<00:03:58.319> so<00:03:58.560> if<00:03:58.620> I<00:03:58.709> put<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:58.980> there<00:03:59.129> over

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.620 

and<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.910> refocus<00:04:07.450> again

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
and I refocus again

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.420 
and I refocus again
being<00:04:10.230> still<00:04:10.470> well<00:04:10.620> we<00:04:10.710> nearly<00:04:10.890> there<00:04:11.100> we<00:04:11.220> got

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
being still well we nearly there we got

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.070 
being still well we nearly there we got
to<00:04:11.640> says<00:04:12.180> here<00:04:12.360> now<00:04:12.480> we're<00:04:12.690> two<00:04:13.350> stops

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
to says here now we're two stops

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.620 
to says here now we're two stops
overexposed<00:04:16.080> so<00:04:16.650> I'm<00:04:16.860> going<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.070> put<00:04:17.250> the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
overexposed so I'm going to put the

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.350 
overexposed so I'm going to put the
another<00:04:18.630> filter<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.020> this<00:04:19.080> is<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.380> coud<00:04:21.080> nd

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
another filter and this is the coud nd

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.690 
another filter and this is the coud nd
four<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.630> should<00:04:24.840> give<00:04:24.960> me<00:04:25.700> probably

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
four and that should give me probably

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.100 
four and that should give me probably
another<00:04:26.880> stopper<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.450> I've<00:04:27.630> got<00:04:27.750> an<00:04:27.840> nd8

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
another stopper so I've got an nd8

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.600 
another stopper so I've got an nd8
action<00:04:28.590> if<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:28.980> doesn't<00:04:29.130> work<00:04:29.250> let<00:04:29.400> me<00:04:29.430> just

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
action if this doesn't work let me just

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.540 
action if this doesn't work let me just
put<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.760> over<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.120> lens<00:04:31.280> yeah<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:32.400> looks

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
put it over the lens yeah that looks

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.920 
put it over the lens yeah that looks
about<00:04:32.640> right<00:04:32.790> so<00:04:33.210> that's<00:04:33.300> going<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.570> give<00:04:33.870> you

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
about right so that's going to give you

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.910 
about right so that's going to give you
the<00:04:34.020> right<00:04:34.140> exposure<00:04:34.830> there<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:36.290> in<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.590> fall

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
the right exposure there so in the fall

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.830 
the right exposure there so in the fall
now<00:04:38.160> on<00:04:38.430> top<00:04:38.880> some<00:04:39.060> point<00:04:39.240> one<00:04:39.450> on<00:04:39.570> top<00:04:39.660> of<00:04:39.780> the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
now on top some point one on top of the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.460 
now on top some point one on top of the
other<00:04:39.960> now<00:04:40.200> if<00:04:40.650> it<00:04:40.770> were<00:04:40.830> on<00:04:40.890> top<00:04:41.010> of<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.190> other

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
other now if it were on top of the other

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.540 
other now if it were on top of the other
and<00:04:43.470> I'm<00:04:43.620> just<00:04:43.770> going<00:04:43.890> to<00:04:43.950> refocus<00:04:44.250> again

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
and I'm just going to refocus again

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.690 
and I'm just going to refocus again
because<00:04:44.700> it<00:04:45.210> does<00:04:45.390> all<00:04:45.420> with<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:46.460> focus<00:04:47.460> there

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
because it does all with the focus there

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.460 
because it does all with the focus there
you<00:04:47.880> don't<00:04:48.000> keep<00:04:48.450> checking<00:04:48.690> there<00:04:48.960> that's

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
you don't keep checking there that's

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.930 
you don't keep checking there that's
there<00:04:49.740> because<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.310> back<00:04:50.490> is<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.640> bit<00:04:50.760> brighter

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
there because the back is a bit brighter

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.670 
there because the back is a bit brighter
it's<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.360> bit<00:04:51.510> underexposed<00:04:51.870> probably<00:04:52.500> at<00:04:52.560> the

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
it's a bit underexposed probably at the

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.860 
it's a bit underexposed probably at the
front<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:53.850> could<00:04:54.090> even<00:04:54.300> probably<00:04:54.540> take<00:04:54.720> off

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
front so I could even probably take off

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.800 
front so I could even probably take off
the<00:04:55.020> other

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.480 

to<00:05:00.290> leave<00:05:00.410> a<00:05:00.440> little<00:05:00.650> bit<00:05:00.770> more<00:05:00.830> lights<00:05:01.160> on<00:05:01.400> the

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
to leave a little bit more lights on the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.190 
to leave a little bit more lights on the
scene<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:02.300> again<00:05:02.510> I'll<00:05:02.600> just<00:05:02.630> refocus<00:05:03.110> in

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
scene and again I'll just refocus in

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.260 
scene and again I'll just refocus in
because<00:05:03.380> again<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.680> lose<00:05:03.880> my<00:05:04.880> messing<00:05:05.150> around

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
because again you lose my messing around

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.000 
because again you lose my messing around
with<00:05:05.480> other<00:05:05.720> lanes<00:05:05.930> and<00:05:06.080> turning<00:05:06.380> it<00:05:06.500> put

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
with other lanes and turning it put

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.830 
with other lanes and turning it put
these<00:05:07.130> filters<00:05:07.430> on<00:05:07.520> you<00:05:07.610> lose<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.880> focus<00:05:08.060> so

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
these filters on you lose the focus so

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.350 
these filters on you lose the focus so
that's<00:05:08.990> using<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:10.150> coud<00:05:11.150> their<00:05:11.590> fixed

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
that's using the coud their fixed

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.700 
that's using the coud their fixed
filters<00:05:14.360> nd<00:05:15.020> filters

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.710 

so<00:05:21.280> finally<00:05:23.009> so<00:05:24.009> finally<00:05:24.310> just<00:05:24.490> to<00:05:24.669> use<00:05:25.090> third

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
so finally so finally just to use third

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.210 
so finally so finally just to use third

resin type filters and these are a brand
called<00:05:29.919> a<00:05:30.190> high-tech<00:05:31.180> so<00:05:31.570> they're<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.750> pretty

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
called a high-tech so they're a pretty

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.180 
called a high-tech so they're a pretty
good<00:05:32.080> brand<00:05:32.380> they're<00:05:32.530> not<00:05:32.620> highest<00:05:32.919> quality

pretty<00:05:39.430> good<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.910> can<00:05:40.060> use<00:05:40.090> them<00:05:40.330> in<00:05:40.440> DSLR

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
pretty good you can use them in DSLR

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.100 
pretty good you can use them in DSLR
rigs<00:05:41.710> they<00:05:42.160> can<00:05:42.310> slide<00:05:42.610> in<00:05:42.820> to<00:05:43.479> the<00:05:43.570> area<00:05:43.870> and

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
rigs they can slide in to the area and

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.469 
rigs they can slide in to the area and
normally<00:05:44.590> in<00:05:44.889> front<00:05:45.070> of<00:05:45.130> the<00:05:45.190> barn<00:05:45.400> doors<00:05:45.669> so

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
normally in front of the barn doors so

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.450 
normally in front of the barn doors so
they<00:05:46.630> use<00:05:46.780> kind<00:05:47.020> of<00:05:47.080> more<00:05:47.199> commercial<00:05:47.710> type

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
they use kind of more commercial type

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.480 
they use kind of more commercial type
shoots<00:05:48.759> I<00:05:48.910> guess<00:05:49.120> and<00:05:50.280> where<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:51.400> would

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
shoots I guess and where you would

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.740 
shoots I guess and where you would
