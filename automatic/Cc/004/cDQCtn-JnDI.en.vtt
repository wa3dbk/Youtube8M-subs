 I saw this video of mine today 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.030
 guys we will resume the column that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.580
 I had practically created a long time ago 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.670
 about a year ago on my channel then 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.350
 I had abandoned for lack of money 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.630
 boy why do you complete this 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.890
 heading or the completion of all 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.750
 the pokÃ©mon cards really wanted us 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.000
 lots of money especially for cards 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.890
 rare but now guys that I came out of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.920
 simulate a bit of pennies in this 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.260
 time I didn't do videos I gave myself 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.059
 looking for these cards and kills them 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.500
 very particular position of carpi 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.210
 really very rare in my opinion that 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.980
 they are precisely the crystallines 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.260
 first of all the crystalline boys who 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.230
 we find for only 27 or 7 of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.850
 water polis and ski raid that you don't 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.910
 I will write all the descriptions of these 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.320

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.030

 many many rare cards of seven 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.280

 only one 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.310

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.130
 bombard 40 and where there is a burn of 60 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.600

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.170
 let's call them series from the custom-built cars 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.549
 then the card action and this beautiful 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.470

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.009

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.899

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.210

 not even if I would like them a bit 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.200
 finish in English which are more beautiful 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.420
 in my opinion it is much rarer however it is 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.950
 an attack from 50 queues everywhere though 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.990
 were not strong cards to play i 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.180
 boys were more for the collectors 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.870
 beautiful mind and now guys together 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.430
 with 7 and 7 ski raid 7 cards 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.440
 very difficult to finish employed 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.830

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.960
 144 and then the guys card that I 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.840

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.770

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.220
