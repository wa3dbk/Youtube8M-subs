00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.360
 right position with a small 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.080
 particularity 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.410
 he starts with his left foot on us 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.260
 make our first step here now 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.750
 turned on the left side that are 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.840
 we take our first step then it works 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.040
 continue with the second here as well 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.650
 at the very young is the second 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.310
 step again the biggest thing about the lady 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.650
 past 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.370
 this is again in the line 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:38.050
 set either forward or obliquely each 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.610
 after how fast you turn 12 now 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.909
 the special feature on the contrary is true 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.240
 right film I have here on 3 1 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.290
 cross with your left foot that's me 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.979
 do not close but cross here 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.860
 hanging together looks like this 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:58.680
 we have our heels on 1 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.680
 then turn step to the left 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.500
 123 Now it goes on as well as at 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.459
 the young, we have our little one 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.899
 step back to the side and 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.159
 shut down 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.890
 only during imagine all 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.030
 Turn time left for the lady applies 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.730
 here also the same 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.079
 it does the same thing again men 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.110
 only mirrored that means it catches 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.459
 in the second part 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 For the lady, the whole thing begins with the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.099
 right foot we have the second part 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.489
 that is small step to the rear where 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.769
 close it to the left 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.480
 Now it continues with verse step 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.329
 forward to the left 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:51.480
 and here continue to set the pace and 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:56.739
 then cross the whole and 123 123 and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.599
 123 123 which left too young feels 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.620
 opposite to the right-hand position 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.209
 is then also back to the lady 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.829
 but vischer instead of in one 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.780
 to pull to the right 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:13.930
 I push it more to the left-ago 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.340
 that we have a wiper 123 123 12 kern 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.079
 the job wants to continue dancing now 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.849
 and sees it mostly in the men 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.470
 that they are already preparing for the 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.019
 so that usually notices that now one 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.359
 to follow movement now on itself 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:31.319
 to push the lady at the same time in 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:34.799
 the left hand in the left 123 123 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.799
 from the side 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:44.540
 123 123 123 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.150
 as I said while going forward dancing 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.980
 forth to the lady on the go backwards 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.870
