button<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> go<00:01:51.659> through<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.979> once<00:01:53.159> that's

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
button to go through so once that's

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.340 
button to go through so once that's
popped<00:01:53.700> through<00:01:53.939> into<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.840> whole<00:01:55.049> you

can push the the rest of the case on

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.530 
can push the the rest of the case on
they<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:59.040> bit<00:01:59.219> awkward<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.670> were<00:02:00.149> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
they are a little bit awkward to were to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.870 
they are a little bit awkward to were to
get<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.280> case<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.520> going

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
get on and so it's just a case of going

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.300 
get on and so it's just a case of going
around<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.299> phone<00:02:03.930> making<00:02:04.740> sure<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.189> all

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
lined up pop the power button out there

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.130 
lined up pop the power button out there
so<00:02:08.640> that's<00:02:08.940> er<00:02:09.300> that's<00:02:09.330> lined<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.929> quite

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
so that's er that's lined up quite

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.290 
so that's er that's lined up quite

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
put the volume out as well like I said

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.230 
put the volume out as well like I said
there<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.130> be<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.340> little<00:02:18.490> bit<00:02:18.700> tricky<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.060> work

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
there can be a little bit tricky to work

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.220 
there can be a little bit tricky to work
to<00:02:19.750> get<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:20.130> but<00:02:21.130> normally<00:02:21.490> worth<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.210> wall<00:02:25.230> so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
to get on but normally worth the wall so

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.950 
to get on but normally worth the wall so
there<00:02:26.770> we<00:02:26.920> go<00:02:26.950> finally<00:02:27.400> got<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.820> through<00:02:28.150> so

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
there we go finally got that through so

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.200 
there we go finally got that through so
the<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:30.040> power<00:02:30.250> button<00:02:30.460> there's<00:02:30.760> covered

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
the the power button there's covered

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.080 
the the power button there's covered
feels<00:02:32.140> nice<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:32.740> there's<00:02:32.920> no<00:02:33.040> no<00:02:33.580> issues<00:02:33.940> with

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.510 
feels nice so there's no no issues with
that<00:02:34.150> sign<00:02:35.020> with<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.380> with<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.950> volume<00:02:36.130> button

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
that sign with the with a volume button

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.090 
that sign with the with a volume button
as<00:02:36.640> well<00:02:36.790> got<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.360> nice<00:02:37.510> nice<00:02:38.350> action<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.890> that

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
important that you get them lined up

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.760 
important that you get them lined up
that<00:02:43.240> pretty<00:02:43.360> much<00:02:43.600> makes<00:02:43.870> or<00:02:44.260> breaks<00:02:44.290> the

that pretty much makes or breaks the
case<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:46.000> that's<00:02:46.870> nicely<00:02:47.140> lined<00:02:47.470> up<00:02:47.680> at<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
case if that's nicely lined up at the

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.330 
case if that's nicely lined up at the
top<00:02:48.240> got<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.810> usual<00:02:50.200> cutouts<00:02:50.680> there<00:02:51.010> they

with the the charging USB port and also
the<00:02:57.220> microphone<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.870> give<00:02:59.650> you<00:02:59.740> an<00:02:59.890> idea<00:03:00.010> how

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
the microphone so give you an idea how

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.770 
the microphone so give you an idea how
thick<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.790> lip<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.120> on<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.360> front<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.660> the

phone and see you've got a few
millimeters<00:03:04.540> there<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:05.290> helps<00:03:05.950> with<00:03:06.330> any

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
millimeters there so that helps with any

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.570 
millimeters there so that helps with any
year<00:03:07.780> any<00:03:07.900> forward<00:03:08.350> drop<00:03:08.560> protection<00:03:08.710> you've

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
year any forward drop protection you've

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.210 
year any forward drop protection you've
got<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.820> nice<00:03:09.970> cushioned<00:03:10.840> area<00:03:11.170> here<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.680> good

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
got the nice cushioned area here so good

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.720 
got the nice cushioned area here so good
impact<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.940> on<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.420> corners<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:15.160> solid

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
impact on the on the corners the solid

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.760 
impact on the on the corners the solid
back<00:03:15.910> case<00:03:16.240> actually<00:03:16.600> comes<00:03:17.050> protects<00:03:17.560> all

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
back case actually comes protects all

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.990 
back case actually comes protects all
round<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.160> side<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:18.670> that's<00:03:18.820> where<00:03:18.940> you

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
round the side so that's where you

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.300 
round the side so that's where you
actually<00:03:19.120> grip<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.630> phone<00:03:19.840> it's<00:03:20.650> it's<00:03:21.160> got

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
actually grip the phone it's it's got

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.040 
actually grip the phone it's it's got
this<00:03:21.430> pattern<00:03:21.820> over<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.239> which<00:03:22.480> get<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.810> info

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
this pattern over it which get that info

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.150 
this pattern over it which get that info
because<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.290> can<00:03:23.410> see<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:24.040> that

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
because you can see that so that

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.430 
because you can see that so that
provides<00:03:24.520> summer<00:03:24.670> some<00:03:25.270> good<00:03:25.450> grip<00:03:25.780> so

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
provides summer some good grip so

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.080 
provides summer some good grip so
hopefully<00:03:26.709> you're<00:03:26.980> less<00:03:27.130> likely<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.489> work<00:03:27.940> to

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
hopefully you're less likely to work to

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.130 
hopefully you're less likely to work to
