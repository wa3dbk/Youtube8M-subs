00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
death is a very complex thing because

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.220 
death is a very complex thing because
while<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.399> people<00:00:53.550> believe<00:00:54.000> there's<00:00:54.719> heaven

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
while some people believe there's heaven

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and hell and reincarnation and all that

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
and hell and reincarnation and all that
stuff<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:59.010> be<00:00:59.129> approaching<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.730> from

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
stuff I will be approaching this from

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.200 
stuff I will be approaching this from
the<00:01:00.390> stance<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.170> someone<00:01:02.070> who<00:01:02.250> believes<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the stance of someone who believes that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.509 
the stance of someone who believes that
there<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.629> no<00:01:03.809> heaven<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.290> hell<00:01:04.470> there's<00:01:05.129> just

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
there is no heaven or hell there's just

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
there is no heaven or hell there's just
life<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.390> earth<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.960> that's<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.439> most

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
life on this earth and that's all most

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.130 
life on this earth and that's all most
people<00:01:08.400> see<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> very<00:01:09.210> dismal<00:01:09.810> point

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
people see this as a very dismal point

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.149 
people see this as a very dismal point
of<00:01:10.229> view<00:01:10.409> something<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.070> very

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
of view something that is very

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.260 
of view something that is very
depressing<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.890> just<00:01:13.890> overall<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.850> sad

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
depressing and just overall really sad

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.620 
depressing and just overall really sad
now<00:01:16.020> while<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.890> view<00:01:17.520> death<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> sad<00:01:18.390> thing

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
now while I do view death as a sad thing

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.230 
now while I do view death as a sad thing
I<00:01:18.900> also<00:01:19.140> feel<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.430> important<00:01:21.090> for

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I also feel like it's important for

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.170 
I also feel like it's important for
people<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:23.090> when<00:01:24.090> someone<00:01:24.479> dies<00:01:26.180> there

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
people to know when someone dies there

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
people to know when someone dies there

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.300 
make an impact and I don't think we
truly<00:02:10.200> realize<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.920> until<00:02:11.069> they're<00:02:11.489> not<00:02:11.640> there

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
truly realize it until they're not there

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.000 
truly realize it until they're not there
and<00:02:12.430> while<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.450> unfortunate<00:02:14.260> it's<00:02:14.530> good

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
and while that is unfortunate it's good

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.430 
and while that is unfortunate it's good
to<00:02:15.190> acknowledge<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.209> impact<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.020> see<00:02:17.230> that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
to acknowledge that impact and see that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.880 
to acknowledge that impact and see that
that<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.040> something<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.430> lives<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.900> and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
that is something that lives on and and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.460 
that is something that lives on and and
can<00:02:21.700> change<00:02:22.510> things<00:02:22.780> for<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.140> better<00:02:23.200> and

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
can change things for the better and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.250 
can change things for the better and
improve<00:02:24.069> things<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:24.730> beautiful<00:02:25.540> when

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
improve things and it's beautiful when

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.380

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
think that's important as well but once

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.440 
think that's important as well but once
we<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.190> acknowledged<00:03:00.700> those<00:03:00.880> feelings<00:03:01.299> and

positive<00:03:05.200> things<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:05.799> have<00:03:05.920> come<00:03:05.950> out<00:03:06.160> from

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
positive things that have come out from

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.580 
positive things that have come out from
this<00:03:06.760> person's<00:03:07.209> life<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.750> how<00:03:08.200> we<00:03:08.260> can

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
this person's life and how we can

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.420 
this person's life and how we can
glorify<00:03:09.099> that<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.670> make<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:10.060> great<00:03:10.390> thing

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
glorify that and make that a great thing

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.910 
glorify that and make that a great thing
because<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.670> really<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.330> it's<00:03:14.110> very<00:03:14.410> easy<00:03:14.739> to

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
because it really is it's very easy to

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.190 
because it really is it's very easy to
get<00:03:15.220> caught<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.489> in<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.849> negative<00:03:16.269> any<00:03:16.570> hard

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
get caught up in the negative any hard

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.110 
get caught up in the negative any hard
times<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:18.220> I'm<00:03:18.340> not<00:03:18.370> saying<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.910> should

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
times and I'm not saying you should

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.940 
times and I'm not saying you should
ignore<00:03:19.209> those<00:03:19.630> but<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:19.959> should<00:03:20.320> not<00:03:20.470> dwell<00:03:20.920> on

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
ignore those but you should not dwell on

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.330 
ignore those but you should not dwell on
them<00:03:21.280> but<00:03:21.970> focus<00:03:22.870> on<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.530> beauty<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.130> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
them but focus on the beauty of the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.849 
them but focus on the beauty of the
situation<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.329> that's<00:03:25.810> difficult<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.769> know

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
situation and that's difficult I know

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.680 
situation and that's difficult I know
but<00:03:27.579> it<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.900> worth<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:30.609> is<00:03:30.690> very

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
but it is worth it and it is very

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.430 
but it is worth it and it is very
important<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:35.549> guess<00:03:36.549> that's<00:03:36.850> all<00:03:37.180> i<00:03:37.410> have<00:03:38.410> to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
important I guess that's all i have to

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.540 
important I guess that's all i have to
say<00:03:38.739> i<00:03:38.950> don't<00:03:39.160> want<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.400> make<00:03:39.519> this<00:03:39.670> too<00:03:40.299> long
