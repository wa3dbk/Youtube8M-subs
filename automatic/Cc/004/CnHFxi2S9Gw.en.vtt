00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
some kind of quick release so that it

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.660

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
one they make a bigger version of this

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.230 
one they make a bigger version of this
if<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.710> had<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.160> do<00:02:36.280> again<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.610> get<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.880> larger

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
if I had it to do again I get the larger

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.030 
if I had it to do again I get the larger
version<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:37.780> we're<00:02:38.380> gonna<00:02:38.500> go<00:02:38.680> find<00:02:38.920> a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
version of this we're gonna go find a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.590 
version of this we're gonna go find a
tree<00:02:39.220> do<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.520> little<00:02:39.730> bit<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:39.940> chopping<00:02:40.360> with<00:02:40.450> it

my honest opinion so let's pause the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.140 
my honest opinion so let's pause the
camera<00:02:46.480> we'll<00:02:46.600> go<00:02:46.660> find<00:02:46.810> something<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.110> cut

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
camera we'll go find something to cut

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.820 
camera we'll go find something to cut
all<00:02:49.150> right<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:49.630> we're<00:02:50.350> here<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.800> a

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
all right so we're here this is a

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.580 
all right so we're here this is a
purchases<00:02:51.610> data<00:02:51.880> actually<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:53.290> it's<00:02:53.410> still

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
purchases data actually but it's still

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
light people came in here because of how

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.240 
light people came in here because of how
remote<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.290> place<00:03:02.500> does<00:03:02.710> not<00:03:02.890> want<00:03:03.100> to<00:03:03.160> get

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
remote this place does not want to get

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.470 
remote this place does not want to get
up<00:03:03.310> here<00:03:03.550> anything<00:03:03.760> directly<00:03:04.090> under<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
up here anything directly under the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.140 
up here anything directly under the
power<00:03:04.720> lines<00:03:04.810> they<00:03:05.230> put<00:03:06.130> some<00:03:06.310> blazes<00:03:06.790> in<00:03:07.000> and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
power lines they put some blazes in and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.050 
power lines they put some blazes in and
put<00:03:07.480> some<00:03:07.510> chemical<00:03:08.140> burn<00:03:08.620> on<00:03:08.860> them<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.610> this

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
put some chemical burn on them so this

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.790 
put some chemical burn on them so this
tree<00:03:10.300> was<00:03:10.450> killed<00:03:10.720> earlier<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.140> year<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.710> we

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
tree was killed earlier this year so we

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.260 
tree was killed earlier this year so we
might<00:03:11.980> as<00:03:12.070> well<00:03:12.190> get<00:03:12.370> ready<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.790> use<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:13.120> for

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
might as well get ready to use it for

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.320 
might as well get ready to use it for
this<00:03:14.070> let's<00:03:15.070> take<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.280> look<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.790> do<00:03:15.850> have<00:03:16.120> the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
this let's take a look and I do have the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.810 
this let's take a look and I do have the
knife<00:03:16.680> still<00:03:17.680> in<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.920> handle<00:03:18.250> what<00:03:18.370> I'm<00:03:18.490> doing

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
knife still in the handle what I'm doing

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.000 
knife still in the handle what I'm doing
this<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.840> let's<00:03:20.110> let's<00:03:20.590> see<00:03:20.710> if<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.830> knife

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
this so let's let's see if the knife

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.630 
this so let's let's see if the knife
stays<00:03:21.280> in<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.730> let's<00:03:21.880> see<00:03:22.120> how<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.570> cuts<00:03:26.640> now

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
stays in and let's see how it cuts now

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.230 
stays in and let's see how it cuts now
you<00:03:27.730> see<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.940> mean<00:03:28.210> for<00:03:28.390> small<00:03:28.510> stuff<00:03:30.240> this

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
you see I mean for small stuff this

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.950 
you see I mean for small stuff this
works<00:03:31.510> pretty<00:03:31.690> good<00:03:33.300> stuff<00:03:34.300> on<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.540> back<00:03:34.720> that

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
works pretty good stuff on the back that

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.060 
works pretty good stuff on the back that
you<00:03:35.020> probably<00:03:35.170> can't<00:03:35.440> see<00:03:35.560> from<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.770> camera

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
you probably can't see from the camera

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.070 
you probably can't see from the camera
but<00:03:36.190> it'll<00:03:36.400> come<00:03:36.580> right<00:03:36.610> off<00:03:36.790> let's<00:03:37.690> now<00:03:37.840> go

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
but it'll come right off let's now go

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:50.670 
but it'll come right off let's now go
ahead<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.380> cut<00:03:38.530> into<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.860> tree<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:49.680> mean

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
ahead and cut into the tree I mean

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.370 
ahead and cut into the tree I mean
pretty<00:03:51.610> good<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:52.150> works<00:03:52.390> out<00:03:52.660> alright<00:03:53.080> now<00:03:53.320> you

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
pretty good it works out alright now you

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.890 
pretty good it works out alright now you
gotta<00:03:53.560> remember<00:03:53.860> this<00:03:54.070> tree<00:03:54.340> was<00:03:54.900> already

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
gotta remember this tree was already

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.930 
gotta remember this tree was already

is one of the Arkansas dogs comes to see
is<00:04:44.280> for<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.430> hunter<00:04:45.850> again<00:04:46.330> for<00:04:46.630> breaking

I<00:04:48.550> think<00:04:49.480> its<00:04:49.600> biggest<00:04:49.840> advantage<00:04:50.500> is<00:04:50.650> if<00:04:50.830> you

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
I think its biggest advantage is if you

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.440 
I think its biggest advantage is if you
have<00:04:51.160> a<00:04:51.190> machete<00:04:51.640> or<00:04:51.790> something<00:04:52.210> else<00:04:52.330> we're

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
have a machete or something else we're

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:53.790 
have a machete or something else we're
doing<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:52.690> majority<00:04:52.780> of<00:04:53.170> your<00:04:53.260> chopping

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
doing the majority of your chopping

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.820 
doing the majority of your chopping

that<00:04:57.160> will<00:04:57.340> work<00:04:57.550> great<00:04:57.730> as<00:04:57.940> a<00:04:57.970> hammer<00:04:58.240> for<00:04:58.620> for

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
that will work great as a hammer for for

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.910 
that will work great as a hammer for for
breaking<00:05:00.070> things<00:05:00.250> for<00:05:00.580> crashing<00:05:01.030> things<00:05:01.920> but

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
breaking things for crashing things but

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.710 
breaking things for crashing things but
if<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.070> had<00:05:03.220> it<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.340> do<00:05:03.490> again<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:04.000> buy<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.270> larger
