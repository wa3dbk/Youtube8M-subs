00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
parts even can vary from the same part

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.789 
parts even can vary from the same part
is<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:39.990> missing<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> spider<00:01:40.500> time<00:01:40.680> if

is not to be missing a spider time if
it's<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.360> ramped<00:01:42.659> it's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it's there it can be just ramped it's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.179 
it's there it can be just ramped it's
completely<00:01:43.049> random<00:01:43.290> parts<00:01:43.590> including<00:01:43.979> random

determine<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> doors<00:02:47.580> need<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.849> turban

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
determine all the doors need a turban

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.850 
determine all the doors need a turban
open<00:02:48.480> them<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:51.480> here<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> second

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
open them and then here is the second

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.059 
open them and then here is the second
part<00:02:53.099> it's<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:54.090> one<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.860> ladder<00:02:55.860> that

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
part it's this one is the ladder that

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.410 
part it's this one is the ladder that
gets<00:02:56.190> less<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.549> gets<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.790> top<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.269> bus

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
gets less you gets the top of the bus

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.030 
gets less you gets the top of the bus
this<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.380> really<00:02:58.620> useful<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.069> cos<00:02:59.750> this<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:01.040> you

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
this is really useful to cos this is you

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.250 
this is really useful to cos this is you
can<00:03:02.069> put<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.580> thing<00:03:03.209> in<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.599> middle<00:03:03.720> because

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
can put that thing in the middle because

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.599 
can put that thing in the middle because
it<00:03:04.470> goes<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.769> smell<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> boxing<00:03:05.459> on<00:03:05.549> the

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
it goes in the smell the boxing on the

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.090 
it goes in the smell the boxing on the
inside<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.019> then<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:07.920> use

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
inside of it so then you can just use

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.640 
inside of it so then you can just use
that<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.430> get<00:03:08.579> up<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.970> go<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.329> bus<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:09.840> i'll

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
that to get up and go the bus so i'll

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.900 
that to get up and go the bus so i'll
show<00:03:10.859> you<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> spot<00:03:11.190> in<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.549> game<00:03:11.790> actually

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
show you a spot in this game actually

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.580 
show you a spot in this game actually
later<00:03:12.269> was<00:03:12.450> going<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.660> be<00:03:12.750> really<00:03:12.959> useful<00:03:13.049> but

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
later was going to be really useful but

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.319 
later was going to be really useful but

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
try to take a little safer so I don't

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.900 
try to take a little safer so I don't
have<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.120> do<00:03:24.269> any<00:03:24.420> stupid<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:24.900> unnecessary<00:03:25.910> so

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
have to do any stupid and unnecessary so

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.250 
have to do any stupid and unnecessary so
we<00:03:27.030> could<00:03:27.180> bus<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.450> go<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.569> little<00:03:27.720> bit<00:03:27.959> get<00:03:28.170> out

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
we could bus to go a little bit get out

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.790 
we could bus to go a little bit get out
here<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:30.859> hop<00:03:31.859> in<00:03:32.069> it

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.920 

I<00:03:34.890> put<00:03:35.490> this<00:03:35.610> part<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.210> its<00:03:36.360> kind<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.810> weird

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
I put this part on to its kind of weird

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.960 
I put this part on to its kind of weird
I<00:03:37.080> mean<00:03:37.110> it's<00:03:37.320> pretty<00:03:37.860> simple<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:38.370> you'd<00:03:38.490> just

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
I mean it's pretty simple if you'd just

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.370 
I mean it's pretty simple if you'd just
play<00:03:39.360> off<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> little<00:03:39.720> bit<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.260> look

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
play off a little bit but you look

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.510 
play off a little bit but you look
straight<00:03:40.560> up<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.920> doesn't<00:03:41.250> tell<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
straight up it doesn't tell you the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.730 
straight up it doesn't tell you the
depressive<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.360> jump<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.810> then<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.050> you

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
depressive you jump and then you you

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.560 
depressive you jump and then you you
look<00:03:43.890> at<00:03:43.980> show<00:03:44.070> up<00:03:44.190> then<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.460> tells<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.150> at<00:03:45.420> the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
look at show up then it tells you at the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.620 
look at show up then it tells you at the
part<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.770> now<00:03:46.950> this<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.910> pretty<00:03:48.240> cool<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:48.510> can

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
part and now this is pretty cool you can

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.820 
part and now this is pretty cool you can
jump<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:48.990> type<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.230> bus<00:03:49.470> while<00:03:49.680> you're

jump on the type of bus while you're
driving<00:03:50.100> even<00:03:50.780> but<00:03:51.780> it's<00:03:51.930> definitely<00:03:52.410> a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
driving even but it's definitely a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.960 
driving even but it's definitely a
little<00:03:52.770> dangerous<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.400> I'll<00:03:53.460> show<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.700> here

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
but with the layer being useful I could

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.020 
but with the layer being useful I could
use<00:05:19.890> that<00:05:19.980> layer<00:05:20.130> to<00:05:20.280> get<00:05:20.400> at<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.640> top<00:05:20.850> and<00:05:20.970> I

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
use that layer to get at the top and I

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.750 
use that layer to get at the top and I
wouldn't<00:05:21.240> even<00:05:21.300> had<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.570> buy<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.750> store<00:05:22.080> here
