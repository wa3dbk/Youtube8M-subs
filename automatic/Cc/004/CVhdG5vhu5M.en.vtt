00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
as you can see we're going to start the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.710 
as you can see we're going to start the
second<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.269> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.539> higher

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
shape as you can see and then we're

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.280 
shape as you can see and then we're
going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.410> continue<00:00:37.980> straight<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.430> down<00:00:39.290> with

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
going to continue straight on down with

going to continue straight on down with
that<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.410> I'm<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> close<00:00:43.829> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that and then I'm going to close that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.279 
that and then I'm going to close that
off<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.870> just<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
off there just like that

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.400 
off there just like that
and<00:00:46.379> then<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.850> detail<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> cactus<00:00:49.079> I'm

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and then for a detail on the cactus I'm

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.979 
and then for a detail on the cactus I'm
just<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.739> draw<00:00:50.180> lines<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.510> straight

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
just going to draw lines going straight

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.680 
just going to draw lines going straight
down<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.120> then<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.360> these<00:00:54.510> I'm

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
down like that and then for these I'm

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.880 
down like that and then for these I'm
going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> start<00:00:55.199> right<00:00:55.440> where<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> first

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
going to start right where the first

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.770 
going to start right where the first
line<00:00:56.160> let<00:00:56.789> off<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
line let off and I'm going to do the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.709 
line let off and I'm going to do the
exact<00:00:58.140> same<00:00:58.170> thing<00:00:59.149> there<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.329> second

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
exact same thing there in the second

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.789 
exact same thing there in the second
part<00:01:00.899> as<00:01:02.750> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.049> I'm<00:01:04.140> kind<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.439> curving

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
part as you can see I'm kind of curving

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.570 
part as you can see I'm kind of curving
these<00:01:04.949> lines<00:01:05.189> from<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> top<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.810> that

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
these lines from the top just like that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.740 
these lines from the top just like that
and<00:01:08.580> then<00:01:08.820> I'm<00:01:08.909> also<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> want<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> draw

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and then I'm also going to want to draw

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.190 
and then I'm also going to want to draw
as<00:01:10.820> if<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.970> were<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> ground<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
as if it were in the ground just the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.730 
as if it were in the ground just the
little<00:01:13.439> piece<00:01:13.619> right<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:15.619> on<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
little piece right there and on the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.539 
little piece right there and on the
sides<00:01:17.009> I'm<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.210> two<00:01:18.570> three<00:01:19.549> like

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
sides I'm going to go one two three like

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.789 
sides I'm going to go one two three like
a<00:01:20.580> V<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.509> middle<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:22.560> draw

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a V and then one in the middle to draw

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.969 
a V and then one in the middle to draw
on<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:24.210> course<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.720> poker<00:01:25.200> things<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
on of course the poker things on the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.230 
on of course the poker things on the
cactus

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.310 

all<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.960> all<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> way

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
all right so just going all the way

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.820 
all right so just going all the way
around<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.800> random<00:01:35.280> here<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.550> there<00:01:35.730> a<00:01:36.500> V<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
around just random here in there a V and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:51.820 
around just random here in there a V and
then<00:01:37.980> one<00:01:38.160> in<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.310> middle<00:01:43.130> okay<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.520> one

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.780 

okay<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:54.050> then<00:01:54.890> for<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.130> last<00:01:55.340> step<00:01:55.550> if<00:01:55.760> you

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
okay and then for the last step if you

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.840 
okay and then for the last step if you
want<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.090> have<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.360> maybe<00:01:56.570> in<00:01:56.810> like<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.850> potted

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
want to have it maybe in like a a potted

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.940 
want to have it maybe in like a a potted
container<00:01:59.300> you<00:02:00.110> can<00:02:00.230> just<00:02:00.440> draw<00:02:00.620> a<00:02:00.650> line<00:02:00.920> down

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
container you can just draw a line down

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.150 
container you can just draw a line down
from<00:02:01.400> there<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:01.790> then<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.590> curved<00:02:03.590> line<00:02:03.740> like

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
from there and then a curved line like

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.030 
from there and then a curved line like
that<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.990> then<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.170> can<00:02:06.290> draw<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:08.830> little<00:02:09.830> pot

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
that and then you can draw a little pot

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.110 
that and then you can draw a little pot
there<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.430> then<00:02:10.520> I'm<00:02:10.640> just<00:02:10.670> going<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:10.940> make

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
there and then I'm just going to make

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.020 
there and then I'm just going to make
this<00:02:11.300> thicker<00:02:11.600> though<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.380> dirt<00:02:13.030> is

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
this thicker though so that the dirt is

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.490 
this thicker though so that the dirt is
on<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.270> inside<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.900> not<00:02:15.080> level<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.430> pot

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
on the inside and not level to the pot
