00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
accurate data and every snake because

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.430 
accurate data and every snake because
the<00:01:52.230> population<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.830> so<00:01:53.010> small<00:01:53.400> oh<00:01:54.410> she's<00:01:55.410> a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.480 
and the snake populations are now
increasing<00:02:21.900> we've<00:02:22.320> managed<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.830> reintroduce

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
increasing we've managed to reintroduce

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.190 
increasing we've managed to reintroduce
them<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.030> three<00:02:24.300> more<00:02:24.510> little<00:02:24.660> islands<00:02:25.110> of

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
them to three more little islands of

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.200 
them to three more little islands of
Antigua<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.490> numbers<00:02:26.820> have<00:02:26.940> climbed

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
Antigua and the numbers have climbed

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.950 
Antigua and the numbers have climbed
from<00:02:27.360> about<00:02:27.630> 50<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.650> run<00:02:29.130> about<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.370> thousand<00:02:29.960> we

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
from about 50 to run about a thousand we

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.240 
from about 50 to run about a thousand we
move<00:02:31.140> them<00:02:31.350> up<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> Green<00:02:31.800> Island<00:02:31.950> which<00:02:32.220> is

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
move them up to Green Island which is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.640 
move them up to Green Island which is
another<00:02:32.580> Island<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.180> have<00:02:33.330> quite<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> few<00:02:33.720> or

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
another Island we have quite a few or

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.500 
another Island we have quite a few or
offshore<00:02:35.250> island<00:02:35.610> which<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> same

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
offshore island which is in the same

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.920 
offshore island which is in the same
area<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:37.520> assisted<00:02:38.520> by<00:02:38.790> moving<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.420> snake<00:02:39.660> back

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
area I assisted by moving the snake back

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.020 
area I assisted by moving the snake back
and<00:02:40.140> forth<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.709> some<00:02:41.280> time<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.490> have<00:02:41.670> catch

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
them as well as our project grown we've

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.830 
them as well as our project grown we've
been<00:02:44.670> addressing<00:02:44.970> many<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> other<00:02:45.660> issues

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.380 
been addressing many of the other issues
within<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:46.739> whole<00:02:46.950> ecosystem<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.090> land

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
within this whole ecosystem on the land

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.420 
within this whole ecosystem on the land
and<00:02:48.600> in<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.720> sea<00:02:48.840> we're<00:02:49.650> not<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:50.010> working<00:02:50.130> on

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and in the sea we're not just working on

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.430 
and in the sea we're not just working on
the<00:02:50.520> snake<00:02:50.760> now<00:02:50.970> we're<00:02:51.150> working<00:02:51.270> on<00:02:51.540> birds<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
the snake now we're working on birds and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.860 
the snake now we're working on birds and
on<00:02:52.530> on<00:02:52.800> turtles<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.550> other<00:02:53.640> things<00:02:53.910> we<00:02:54.540> also

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
on on turtles and other things we also

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.050 
on on turtles and other things we also
restore<00:02:55.230> habitats<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.070> we've<00:02:56.190> restored<00:02:56.520> 13

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
restore habitats so we've restored 13

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.310 
restore habitats so we've restored 13
islands<00:02:57.450> with<00:02:57.570> Antigua<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.230> is

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
islands with Antigua and this is

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.340 
islands with Antigua and this is
benefiting<00:02:58.830> many<00:02:59.040> many<00:02:59.220> other<00:02:59.400> species<00:02:59.700> I

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
benefiting many many other species I

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.229 
benefiting many many other species I
hope<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:01.680> can<00:03:01.800> restore<00:03:01.950> as<00:03:02.400> many<00:03:02.670> islands

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
hope that we can restore as many islands

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.780 
hope that we can restore as many islands
as<00:03:03.360> possible<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.050> we<00:03:04.170> can<00:03:04.320> have<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.920> lot<00:03:05.550> of<00:03:05.580> the

as possible so we can have a lot of the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.840 
as possible so we can have a lot of the

with<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.569> floating<00:04:09.780> classroom<00:04:10.019> program

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
with the floating classroom program

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.280 
with the floating classroom program
we're<00:04:11.700> basically<00:04:12.060> trying<00:04:12.390> to<00:04:12.629> educate<00:04:12.780> the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
we're basically trying to educate the
