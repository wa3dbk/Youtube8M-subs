00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
all right in our last video I showed you

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.749 
all right in our last video I showed you
guys<00:00:02.460> how<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.090> are<00:00:03.540> able<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:04.230> connect<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.460> your

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
guys how you are able to connect to your

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.519 
guys how you are able to connect to your
Raspberry<00:00:06.359> Pi<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.049> graphical<00:00:07.500> user

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
Raspberry Pi to the graphical user

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.730 
Raspberry Pi to the graphical user
interface<00:00:08.400> using<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.570> VNC<00:00:10.050> server<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.710> I

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
interface using a VNC server so I

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.180 
interface using a VNC server so I
already<00:00:10.889> have<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.370> set<00:00:11.610> up<00:00:11.639> like<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.300> did<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
already have it set up like I did in the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.570 
already have it set up like I did in the
last<00:00:14.190> video<00:00:15.120> I'm<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.770> Raspberry<00:00:17.310> Pi<00:00:17.400> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
last video I'm the Raspberry Pi is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.760 
last video I'm the Raspberry Pi is
already<00:00:18.029> plugged<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.449> something<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.199> forgot<00:00:19.710> to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
already plugged in something I forgot to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.500 
already plugged in something I forgot to
mention<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.810> if<00:00:22.010> you<00:00:23.010> want<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:24.359> this

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
mention is that if you want to do this

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.250 
mention is that if you want to do this
again

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
again

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.109 
again
so<00:00:25.380> say<00:00:25.590> tomorrow<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.609> turn<00:00:26.939> off<00:00:27.090> your

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
so say tomorrow you you turn off your

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.509 
so say tomorrow you you turn off your
Raspberry<00:00:27.750> Pi<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.769> want<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.099> get<00:00:29.340> back

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
Raspberry Pi and you want to get back

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.580 
Raspberry Pi and you want to get back
and<00:00:29.789> again<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.179> are<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.869> have<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.289> start

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
and again you are going to have to start

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.270 
and again you are going to have to start
up<00:00:31.830> your<00:00:32.070> Raspberry<00:00:32.790> Pi<00:00:32.930> SSH<00:00:33.930> n<00:00:34.170> again<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
up your Raspberry Pi SSH n again and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.830 
up your Raspberry Pi SSH n again and
then<00:00:35.579> you're<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> see<00:00:36.480> VNC

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
then you're going to want to see VNC

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.799 
then you're going to want to see VNC
server<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.860> again<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.660> this

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
server one again so you have to do this

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
server one again so you have to do this
every<00:00:40.170> time<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.559> want<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.950> able<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.219> patch

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
every time you want to be able to patch

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.440 
every time you want to be able to patch
in<00:00:41.670> through<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> VNC<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:44.450> you

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
in through the VNC like that and you

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.569 
in through the VNC like that and you
could<00:00:45.690> write<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> script<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.590> boots<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.399> up

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
could write a script that boots this up

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.040 
could write a script that boots this up
you<00:00:47.700> could<00:00:47.850> set<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.090> up<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.510> boots<00:00:48.899> up

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you could set it up so that boots up

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.869 
you could set it up so that boots up
automatically<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.890> haven't<00:00:50.219> gotten<00:00:50.399> around<00:00:50.610> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
automatically I haven't gotten around to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
to show you how to do is transfer files

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.029 
to show you how to do is transfer files
between<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.820> Raspberry<00:01:00.480> Pi<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.079> your

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
between your Raspberry Pi and your

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.969 
between your Raspberry Pi and your
computer<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:06.110> right<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.290> we're<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.530> able<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
computer it right now we're not able to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
computer it right now we're not able to
do<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.729> wrote<00:01:08.909> something<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.450> my

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
do it if I wrote something on my

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.390 
do it if I wrote something on my
computer<00:01:09.630> wanted<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> upload<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> pine

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
computer wanted to upload it to the pine

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370 
computer wanted to upload it to the pine
directly<00:01:11.820> let's<00:01:12.119> say<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> song<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.869> whatever<00:01:13.049> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
directly let's say a song or whatever I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.460 
directly let's say a song or whatever I
can't<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.939> right<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.720> that's<00:01:16.320> what

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
can't do that right now and that's what

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.719 
can't do that right now and that's what
we're<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.860> set<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:17.490> are<00:01:17.580> two

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
we're going to set up and there are two

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.789 
we're going to set up and there are two
methods<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> little<00:01:19.560> bit

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
methods to do that one is a little bit

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.640 
methods to do that one is a little bit
more<00:01:19.979> elegant<00:01:20.490> than<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.729> other<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.439> can

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
more elegant than the other in one I can

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.640 
more elegant than the other in one I can
use<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.009> finder<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.900> get<00:01:24.900> into<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.409> like

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
use the finder and get into it just like

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.679 
use the finder and get into it just like
it<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> device<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> shared<00:01:26.939> device<00:01:27.360> like

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it was a device or a shared device like

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.630 
it was a device or a shared device like
you<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.470> other<00:01:28.619> computers<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.490> my

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you see other computers here on my

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.819 
you see other computers here on my
network<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.590> through

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
network or you can do it through

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.010 
network or you can do it through
FileZilla<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.909> an<00:01:33.030> FTP<00:01:33.509> client<00:01:33.540> I'll

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
FileZilla which is an FTP client I'll

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
FileZilla which is an FTP client I'll
show<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.320> how<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> set<00:01:34.740> up<00:01:34.829> both<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.250> this

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
show you how to set up both in this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.270 
show you how to set up both in this
video<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.810> first<00:01:37.259> let's<00:01:37.590> set<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
video so first let's set it up so that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.130 
video so first let's set it up so that
we<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.610> actually<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> shared<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.869> this

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
we can actually see it shared like this

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.590 
we can actually see it shared like this
the<00:01:40.860> way<00:01:41.009> you're<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.299> first

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the way you're going to do that is first

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.179 
the way you're going to do that is first

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.890 
here if we open up tester 3 we see poop
3<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.859> we<00:03:53.069> know<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.669> it<00:03:53.849> is<00:03:53.970> communicating<00:03:54.689> an

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
3 so we know that it is communicating an

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.649 
3 so we know that it is communicating an
alternative<00:03:55.859> way<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.299> communicating<00:03:57.299> sharing

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
alternative way of communicating sharing

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.099 
alternative way of communicating sharing
files<00:03:58.430> from<00:03:59.430> your<00:03:59.669> computer<00:03:59.790> is<00:04:00.389> through

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
files from your computer is through

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.770 
files from your computer is through
another<00:04:01.650> program<00:04:01.919> called<00:04:02.400> FileZilla<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.689> if

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
another program called FileZilla and if

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.499 
another program called FileZilla and if
you<00:04:04.560> download<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:05.370> FileZilla<00:04:05.790> client<00:04:05.939> this

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:06.509 
you download the FileZilla client this

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.809 
you download the FileZilla client this
is<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.750> free<00:04:07.259> open-source<00:04:07.590> platform<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.579> believe

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
is a free open-source platform I believe

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.909 
is a free open-source platform I believe
together<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.209> go<00:04:09.329> open-source<00:04:09.919> free

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
together you go open-source free

open-source platform and you install
this<00:04:12.719> on<00:04:12.900> your<00:04:12.930> computer<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.919> can<00:04:13.949> connect<00:04:14.549> to

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
this on your computer you can connect to

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.610 
this on your computer you can connect to
the<00:04:15.269> Raspberry<00:04:15.780> Pi<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:17.759> open<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.180> up<00:04:18.299> now

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
the Raspberry Pi so if we open it up now

and<00:04:32.260> we<00:04:32.500> are<00:04:32.590> connecting<00:04:33.040> through<00:04:33.250> port<00:04:33.550> 22

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
and we are connecting through port 22

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.460 
and we are connecting through port 22
which<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.720> SSH<00:04:35.350> port<00:04:35.680> we<00:04:36.340> quick<00:04:36.880> connect

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
which is the SSH port we quick connect

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.500 
which is the SSH port we quick connect
yes<00:04:38.470> it's<00:04:38.710> ok<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.990> here<00:04:40.990> on<00:04:41.520> our<00:04:42.520> right<00:04:43.180> we

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
yes it's ok and here on our right we

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.190 
yes it's ok and here on our right we
have<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.410> PI<00:04:44.920> side<00:04:45.340> here<00:04:45.760> on<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.090> left<00:04:46.360> is<00:04:46.690> the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
have the PI side here on the left is the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.500 
have the PI side here on the left is the
computer<00:04:47.710> from<00:04:47.950> which<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.550> are<00:04:48.700> on<00:04:48.910> currently

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
computer from which you are on currently

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.300 
computer from which you are on currently
side<00:04:50.580> so<00:04:51.580> if<00:04:51.850> we<00:04:52.120> go<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.660> desktop<00:04:52.990> here<00:04:53.530> we

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
side so if we go to the desktop here we

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.170 
side so if we go to the desktop here we
do<00:04:54.520> see<00:04:54.850> our<00:04:55.180> tester<00:04:56.080> and<00:04:56.230> tester<00:04:56.980> 3<00:04:57.220> file<00:04:57.460> just

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
do see our tester and tester 3 file just

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.460 
do see our tester and tester 3 file just
like<00:05:02.790> just<00:05:03.790> like<00:05:03.850> we<00:05:04.120> see<00:05:04.330> here<00:05:04.660> our<00:05:04.780> tester

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
like just like we see here our tester

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.740 
like just like we see here our tester
and<00:05:05.650> tester<00:05:06.160> 3<00:05:06.430> files<00:05:06.610> so<00:05:06.880> we<00:05:07.060> can<00:05:07.240> quickly

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
and tester 3 files so we can quickly

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.180 
and tester 3 files so we can quickly
download<00:05:08.200> these<00:05:08.560> files<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:08.920> I'm<00:05:08.980> going<00:05:09.160> to

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
download these files so I'm going to

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.880 
download these files so I'm going to
delete<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:10.300> tester<00:05:10.900> 3<00:05:11.140> file<00:05:11.350> on<00:05:11.560> my<00:05:11.860> computer

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
delete the tester 3 file on my computer

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.440 
delete the tester 3 file on my computer
and<00:05:13.620> it's<00:05:14.620> defaulting<00:05:15.220> to<00:05:15.250> the<00:05:15.460> desktop<00:05:15.760> now<00:05:15.940> I

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
and it's defaulting to the desktop now I

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.770 
and it's defaulting to the desktop now I
can<00:05:16.990> now<00:05:17.230> download<00:05:18.210> tester<00:05:19.210> 3<00:05:19.450> so<00:05:19.630> we're

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
can now download tester 3 so we're

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.380 
can now download tester 3 so we're
connecting<00:05:20.310> transfer<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.430> files<00:05:21.640> 6<00:05:21.970> bytes<00:05:22.210> in

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
connecting transfer the files 6 bytes in

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.110 
connecting transfer the files 6 bytes in
one<00:05:22.540> second<00:05:22.990> here<00:05:23.290> it<00:05:23.410> is<00:05:23.530> now<00:05:23.770> tester<00:05:24.370> 3<00:05:24.640> again

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
one second here it is now tester 3 again

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.470 
one second here it is now tester 3 again
so<00:05:26.130> it<00:05:27.130> effectively<00:05:27.610> allows<00:05:27.970> you<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.240> do<00:05:28.360> the

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
so it effectively allows you to do the

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.050 
so it effectively allows you to do the
same<00:05:28.660> thing<00:05:29.050> but<00:05:29.380> this<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.830> far<00:05:30.250> less<00:05:30.550> elegant

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
same thing but this is far less elegant

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.470 
same thing but this is far less elegant
than<00:05:31.480> simply<00:05:31.840> using<00:05:31.980> finder<00:05:32.980> which<00:05:33.580> you<00:05:34.360> know

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
than simply using finder which you know

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.150 
than simply using finder which you know
if<00:05:34.660> you're<00:05:34.810> already<00:05:35.050> used<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.440> using<00:05:35.500> a<00:05:35.919> Mac

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
if you're already used to using a Mac

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.330 
if you're already used to using a Mac
this<00:05:36.430> is<00:05:36.610> this<00:05:36.940> is<00:05:37.120> quick<00:05:37.360> and<00:05:37.480> easy

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
this is this is quick and easy

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.340 
this is this is quick and easy
compared<00:05:39.340> to<00:05:39.400> this<00:05:39.640> so<00:05:39.970> this<00:05:40.330> is<00:05:40.390> this<00:05:40.990> is<00:05:41.050> the

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
compared to this so this is this is the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.590 
compared to this so this is this is the
nice<00:05:41.560> way<00:05:41.740> in<00:05:42.130> my<00:05:42.280> opinion<00:05:42.580> of<00:05:42.910> sharing<00:05:43.390> files

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
nice way in my opinion of sharing files

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.050 
nice way in my opinion of sharing files
between<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.800> Raspberry<00:05:45.310> Pi<00:05:45.400> and<00:05:45.820> your

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
between the the Raspberry Pi and your

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.090 
between the the Raspberry Pi and your
computer<00:05:46.540> this<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.380> less<00:05:47.560> nice<00:05:47.770> way<00:05:48.040> but

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
computer this is the less nice way but

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.990 
computer this is the less nice way but
an<00:05:48.490> alternative<00:05:49.120> way<00:05:49.330> to<00:05:49.960> get<00:05:50.919> this<00:05:51.160> set<00:05:51.850> up

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
an alternative way to get this set up

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.930 
an alternative way to get this set up
and<00:05:52.210> you<00:05:52.750> can<00:05:52.900> do<00:05:53.020> this<00:05:53.200> on<00:05:53.410> a<00:05:53.440> PC<00:05:53.919> as<00:05:54.130> well<00:05:54.160> I'm

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
and you can do this on a PC as well I'm

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.600 
and you can do this on a PC as well I'm
not<00:05:55.150> too<00:05:55.330> sure<00:05:55.510> about<00:05:55.570> this<00:05:56.200> on<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.560> PC<00:05:57.160> so<00:05:57.190> this

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
not too sure about this on a PC so this

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.210 
not too sure about this on a PC so this
is<00:05:58.390> how<00:05:58.630> you<00:05:58.690> set<00:05:59.140> up<00:05:59.290> file<00:05:59.590> sharing<00:05:59.950> between

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
is how you set up file sharing between

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.580 
is how you set up file sharing between
your<00:06:00.580> Raspberry<00:06:01.060> Pi<00:06:01.150> and<00:06:01.660> the<00:06:01.870> computer<00:06:02.260> that

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
your Raspberry Pi and the computer that

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.190 
your Raspberry Pi and the computer that
you're<00:06:02.770> working<00:06:02.890> on
