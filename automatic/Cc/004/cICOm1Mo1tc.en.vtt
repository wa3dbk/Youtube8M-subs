00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
national newspaper as being one of the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080 
national newspaper as being one of the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
that club when I got to the club it was

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.900 
that club when I got to the club it was
basically<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.650> was<00:02:47.709> at<00:02:47.860> rock<00:02:47.980> bottom<00:02:48.040> its

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
basically it was at rock bottom its

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.500 
basically it was at rock bottom its
lowest<00:02:49.180> ebb<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:50.250> lot<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.340> work<00:02:51.459> went<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.820> on<00:02:52.000> the

lowest ebb a lot of work went in on the
plane<00:02:52.690> side<00:02:52.959> I<00:02:53.459> felt<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.700> plane<00:02:54.880> side

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
plane side I felt that the plane side

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.070 
plane side I felt that the plane side
was<00:02:55.480> was<00:02:56.459> underachieving<00:02:57.630> we<00:02:58.630> worked<00:02:58.840> hard<00:02:59.020> on

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
was was underachieving we worked hard on

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.500 
was was underachieving we worked hard on
the<00:02:59.200> training<00:02:59.230> ground<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:01.030> made<00:03:01.360> sure<00:03:01.390> we

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the training ground we made sure we

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.240 
the training ground we made sure we
brought<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.989> players<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.590> were<00:03:02.709> were

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
passionate about being successful and we

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.850 
passionate about being successful and we
developed<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.820> formula<00:03:07.600> where<00:03:08.110> we<00:03:08.350> had<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.530> squad

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
developed a formula where we had a squad

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.830 
developed a formula where we had a squad
that<00:03:09.070> was<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.760> not<00:03:09.880> only<00:03:10.000> full<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.360> ability<00:03:10.690> but

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
that was it not only full of ability but

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.580 
that was it not only full of ability but
had<00:03:10.989> desire<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:11.560> achieve<00:03:11.890> things<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:14.200> know<00:03:14.320> we

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
had desire to achieve things you know we

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.290 
had desire to achieve things you know we
went<00:03:14.860> through<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.010> scenario<00:03:15.160> where<00:03:15.370> we<00:03:15.520> had<00:03:15.700> no

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
went through a scenario where we had no

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.360 
went through a scenario where we had no
money<00:03:16.450> at<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.690> beginning<00:03:17.020> to<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> successful

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
money at the beginning to a successful

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.970 
money at the beginning to a successful
chairman<00:03:18.820> coming<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.180> who<00:03:20.140> then<00:03:20.380> plowed<00:03:20.950> a

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
chairman coming in who then plowed a

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.280 
chairman coming in who then plowed a
little<00:03:21.190> bit<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.340> money<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.730> club<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:23.140> on

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
little bit of money to the club and on

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.320 
little bit of money to the club and on
both<00:03:23.470> scenarios<00:03:23.799> we<00:03:24.670> put<00:03:24.850> together<00:03:24.940> at<00:03:25.209> like

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
both scenarios we put together at like

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.539 
both scenarios we put together at like
Sarah<00:03:25.570> formula<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.049> was<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.440> think<00:03:27.370> at<00:03:27.459> the

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
Sarah formula that was I think at the

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.370 
Sarah formula that was I think at the
end<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:27.790> season<00:03:27.970> if<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.959> wasn't<00:03:29.200> for<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
end of this season if it wasn't for the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.640 
end of this season if it wasn't for the
ground<00:03:30.450> grading<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.750> think<00:03:32.290> we'd<00:03:32.380> have<00:03:32.410> got<00:03:32.560> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
ground grading I think we'd have got the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.680 
ground grading I think we'd have got the
club<00:03:32.769> into<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.130> conference<00:03:33.370> national<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:34.150> year

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
club into the conference national a year

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.340 
club into the conference national a year
had<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.870> schedule<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.730> yeah<00:03:36.910> effort<00:03:37.120> from<00:03:37.299> a
