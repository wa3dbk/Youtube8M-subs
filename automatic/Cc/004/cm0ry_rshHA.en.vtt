00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.029
 yes here at sky walk the manfred and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.400
 also here at the fair 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:14.350
 the c3 gone big interest manfred was 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.670
 do you think you can tell me? 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.240
 tell more about what is the reason 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.980
 for this 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.080
 I think we have the nerve of 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.800
 pilots just hit with the full 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.470
 because it is mb screen of the same 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.609
 many pilots speak of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.380
 Flight behavior is not complete here 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.720
 but it is still exhausted 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.579
 high performance features if now for 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.870
 For example, let's have a look here 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:41.640
 Carrying strap only a minimal bundle 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.250
 on linen at the level only two more 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.760
 linen and back into the fluh 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.719
 deep direction 3 suspension points 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.910
 He has really done very much 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.140
 little little resistance and that's why 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.050
 make this job easy 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.390
 outstandingly well overwhelmed but the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:04.360
 do not pilot you can you say what 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.460
 So it has nothing more to do with gp2 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.100
 but it is the little brother of 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.320
 successful kalkar in four of the now 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.850
 Also last year in the distance flight 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.860
 championship won he is 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.390
 is in two camps in spans 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 direction from which Manfred Bader tells 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.550
 there has very little line resistance 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.380
 the umbrella is for the pilots group 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.790
 very easy to fly 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.290
 we are easy on the handling that 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.970
 you just spend a very long time with the umbrella 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.550
 Flying is relatively low 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.650
 tax pressure and always the 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.350
 discussion chopsticks and are the umbrellas 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.390
 now somehow more demanding because of that 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.950
 I just want to stop there 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.620
 this prejudice that the rods sense 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.840
 because we use nylon linen here 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.890
 the sewn in are around the front edge 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.040
 easy 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.930
 get out and those nylon linen the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.700
 are any 0 was 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.770
 there are no problems with it at all 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.110
 packaging or similar is also 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.520
 not suitable for hangers 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.490
 to produce more 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.140
 that means these techniques are the new ones 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 are not bad per se and it comes 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.280
 also to beamer very much and with 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.780
 which material is another point 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.940
 the location of the hanger points would like 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.980
 Maybe you say something or the situation 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.270
 the hanger points is not for us 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.489
 different as before 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.280
 that means two like a chili 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.920
 at the cayenne 3 our philosophy at the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 The location is that the pilot of the screen 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.570
 buys so can fly and so too 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.760
 can do a safety training 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.010
 so that it can practice that way 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.100
 We also feel at the approval 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.100
 was given that that is he is 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.920
 on the highest of technology was but 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.959
 he is also comparable to the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.420
 shield the pilot from earlier 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.920
 that was just what that was 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.530
 It is very important to us that he is simple 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.079
 knows this is an honest device and he 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.670
 does not have to be on any 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.769
 Stability stiffen the bottom line 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.769
 maybe the risk of risk 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.209
 Maybe it will be possible 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.890
 once important to mention that we 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.200
 These little ones are also in the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.209
 Discussion are the approval as 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.040
 generally do not use because we 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.810
 simply want the pilot afterwards in the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.670
 safety training the same 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.799
 Behavior can reproduce as we do in 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.980
 the approval also had so 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.550
 no case small with us 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.379
 some ask the easy tour 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.510
 is it then somehow on the 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.349
 Cost of the strength of the 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.810
 durability 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.120
 it's not that kinda now 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.980
 maxed out we have under sail 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.170
 lightweight cloth that does not play big 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.489
 There is not much to come 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.170
 solar radiation on it and in the upper one 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.780
 area where it really matters too 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.750
 but very stable for the porosity 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.970
 material of the very successful 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.819
 compromise of weight and and 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.209
 durability 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.069
 To say this, everything is one 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.290
 conventional very strong material 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.629
 nothing is deformed there 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.019
 both ribs and bender as well 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.599
 that's all a material and it is 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.430
 still have built durability 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:13.069
 the ease with a screen 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.069
 achieved great then I thank you
