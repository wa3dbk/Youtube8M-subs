00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.260 
hit on Nicholas Hagman most analysts
I've<00:01:51.409> seen<00:01:51.740> have<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.220> suspension<00:01:52.820> pegged<00:01:53.120> at

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
I've seen have the suspension pegged at

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.120 
I've seen have the suspension pegged at
somewhere<00:01:53.659> between<00:01:53.720> three<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:54.380> five<00:01:54.710> games

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
somewhere between three and five games

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.190 
somewhere between three and five games
but<00:01:55.400> some<00:01:55.640> suggest<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.210> could<00:01:56.240> even<00:01:56.510> be<00:01:56.659> longer

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
but some suggest it could even be longer

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.750 
but some suggest it could even be longer
and<00:01:57.350> I'm<00:01:57.500> not<00:01:57.650> sure<00:01:57.860> I<00:01:57.890> disagree<00:01:58.430> with<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.610> I

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
and I'm not sure I disagree with that I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.340 
and I'm not sure I disagree with that I
mean<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.030> was<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.240> vicious<00:01:59.479> hit<00:01:59.870> and<00:02:00.049> it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
mean that was a vicious hit and it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.510 
mean that was a vicious hit and it
looked<00:02:00.530> like<00:02:00.650> he<00:02:00.860> went<00:02:00.950> straight<00:02:01.340> for

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
looked like he went straight for

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.520 
looked like he went straight for
hagman's<00:02:01.970> head<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.510> Hagmann<00:02:02.990> really<00:02:03.350> has

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
hagman's head and Hagmann really has

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.770 
hagman's head and Hagmann really has
been<00:02:03.830> one<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.220> best<00:02:04.520> Leafs<00:02:04.880> arguably<00:02:05.570> the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
been one of the best Leafs arguably the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.690 
been one of the best Leafs arguably the
best<00:02:05.990> leave<00:02:06.350> this<00:02:06.590> season<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.280> that<00:02:07.549> is<00:02:07.670> a

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
best leave this season and that is a

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.999 
best leave this season and that is a
huge<00:02:08.090> blow<00:02:08.599> to<00:02:08.629> the<00:02:08.959> lineup<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:09.470> see<00:02:09.649> him<00:02:09.860> out

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
huge blow to the lineup to see him out

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.680 
huge blow to the lineup to see him out
but<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.340> really<00:02:10.580> got<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.940> admire<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.450> guts

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
but you really got to admire the guts

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.020 
but you really got to admire the guts

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
was trying to get up on his own strength

and<00:02:16.220> get<00:02:16.370> off<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.700> ice<00:02:16.819> but<00:02:17.330> he<00:02:17.420> was<00:02:17.569> a<00:02:17.599> little

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
and get off the ice but he was a little

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.780 
and get off the ice but he was a little
too<00:02:18.049> wobbly<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.680> ultimately<00:02:19.159> needed<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.670> be

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
too wobbly and ultimately needed to be

too wobbly and ultimately needed to be
helped<00:02:20.090> off<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.569> I<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.140> debate<00:02:21.439> of

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
helped off and I know the debate of

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.440 
helped off and I know the debate of
fighting<00:02:21.920> rages<00:02:22.159> on<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.730> think<00:02:23.030> something

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
fighting rages on that I think something

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.509 
fighting rages on that I think something
that<00:02:23.599> everyone<00:02:23.930> can<00:02:24.230> agree<00:02:24.379> on<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.860> shots<00:02:25.250> to

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
that everyone can agree on is shots to

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.330 
that everyone can agree on is shots to
the<00:02:25.549> head<00:02:25.670> need<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:26.990> taken<00:02:27.560> out<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.830> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
here's your chance question of the game

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.119 
here's your chance question of the game
what<00:02:50.760> should<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.150> mandatory<00:02:51.830> suspension<00:02:52.830> be

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
what should the mandatory suspension be

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.580 
what should the mandatory suspension be
for<00:02:53.910> deliberate<00:02:54.450> body<00:02:54.690> checks<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.290> head

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
for deliberate body checks to the head

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.500 
for deliberate body checks to the head
for<00:02:55.950> example<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.549> this<00:02:56.730> isn't<00:02:57.030> necessarily

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
for example and this isn't necessarily

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.750 
for example and this isn't necessarily
what<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.780> think<00:02:58.170> start<00:02:58.799> at<00:02:58.890> five<00:02:59.129> games<00:02:59.489> and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
what I think start at five games and

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.460 
what I think start at five games and
then<00:03:00.120> with<00:03:00.330> discretion<00:03:00.930> based<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.349> the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
then with discretion based on the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.890 
then with discretion based on the
incident<00:03:01.920> go<00:03:02.280> up<00:03:02.459> moving<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.209> news<00:03:03.390> outside
