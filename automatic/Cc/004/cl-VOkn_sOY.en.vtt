as far down the hill as we dared go in

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
then we anchored the front of the record

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.840 
then we anchored the front of the record
to<00:01:32.570> another<00:01:32.869> truck<00:01:33.260> and<00:01:33.500> proceeded<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.400> winch

crawling<00:02:08.970> over<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.450> boulders<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.590> record

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
crawling over the boulders as the record

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.949 
crawling over the boulders as the record
cable<00:02:11.280> guided<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> front<00:02:12.240> end<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.750> hill

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.470 
cable guided the front end up the hill
things<00:02:13.650> worked<00:02:13.920> pretty<00:02:14.100> good<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:15.120> we<00:02:15.239> still

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
things worked pretty good but we still

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.510 
things worked pretty good but we still
had<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> really<00:02:15.840> steep<00:02:16.530> Bank<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:17.069> get<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.340> and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
had a really steep Bank to get up and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:03:06.870 
had a really steep Bank to get up and
over

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:39.570 

like

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.580 

I'm<00:03:40.580> sure<00:03:40.910> glad<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.240> walked<00:03:41.600> up<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.020> front

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.869 

once<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:47.800> head<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.069> front<00:03:48.310> of<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.459> Jeep<00:03:48.640> up

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
once we head the front of the Jeep up

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.910 
once we head the front of the Jeep up
over<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.269> bank<00:03:49.510> we<00:03:50.110> were<00:03:50.200> too<00:03:50.349> close<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.830> the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
over the bank we were too close to the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.610 
over the bank we were too close to the
wrecker<00:03:51.099> to<00:03:51.280> winch<00:03:51.550> it<00:03:51.730> any<00:03:51.879> further<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:53.470> was

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
wrecker to winch it any further it was

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.830 
wrecker to winch it any further it was
at<00:03:53.800> that<00:03:53.830> point<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.400> had<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:54.580> decide<00:03:55.060> do<00:03:55.540> we<00:03:55.629> set

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
at that point I had to decide do we set

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.140 
at that point I had to decide do we set
the<00:03:55.989> Jeep<00:03:56.200> down<00:03:56.410> move<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.040> wrecker<00:03:57.250> wench<00:03:57.940> it

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
the Jeep down move the wrecker wench it

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.210 
the Jeep down move the wrecker wench it
further<00:03:58.420> where<00:03:59.170> do<00:03:59.260> we<00:03:59.379> try<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.800> just<00:03:59.980> drive

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
further where do we try and just drive

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.539 
further where do we try and just drive
the<00:04:00.400> whole<00:04:00.550> works<00:04:00.790> out<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.739> decided<00:04:02.739> that<00:04:03.129> this

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
the whole works out I decided that this

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.270 
the whole works out I decided that this
was<00:04:03.610> a<00:04:03.760> perfect<00:04:04.239> opportunity<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:05.170> see<00:04:05.440> just

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
was a perfect opportunity to see just

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.900 
was a perfect opportunity to see just
how<00:04:06.370> good<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.000> new<00:04:07.209> grizzly<00:04:07.660> locker<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.230> and

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
how good that new grizzly locker is and

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.250 
how good that new grizzly locker is and
sure<00:04:09.910> enough<00:04:09.940> we've<00:04:10.480> called<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.930> rest<00:04:11.110> the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
sure enough we've called the rest the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.110 
sure enough we've called the rest the
way<00:04:11.379> up<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.650> hill<00:04:11.860> without<00:04:12.220> even<00:04:12.670> spinning<00:04:13.000> a

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
way up the hill without even spinning a

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.589 
way up the hill without even spinning a
tire

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
tire

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.020 
tire
although<00:04:14.319> I<00:04:14.590> think<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.250> Jeep<00:04:15.459> was<00:04:15.670> still<00:04:15.879> in

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
although I think the Jeep was still in

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.939 
although I think the Jeep was still in
gear<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.479> helping<00:04:16.959> itself<00:04:17.320> along<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.680> little

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
gear and helping itself along a little

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:27.719 
gear and helping itself along a little
bit<00:04:25.200> once<00:04:26.200> we<00:04:26.410> were<00:04:26.530> around<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.889> bend<00:04:27.190> we<00:04:27.580> were

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
bit once we were around the bend we were

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.460 
bit once we were around the bend we were
in<00:04:27.850> a<00:04:27.880> safe<00:04:28.120> enough<00:04:28.419> spot<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:29.050> where<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.229> could

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
in a safe enough spot to where I could

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.740 
in a safe enough spot to where I could
set<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.830> Jeep<00:04:30.040> down<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.940> hook<00:04:31.120> up<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.479> sling

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
set the Jeep down and hook up the sling

00:04:31.750 --> 00:05:31.550 
set the Jeep down and hook up the sling
for<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.350> rest<00:04:32.560> of<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.800> tow<00:04:32.979> back<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.430> camp

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.220 

then<00:05:32.560> once<00:05:33.130> we<00:05:33.310> had<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.610> sling<00:05:33.850> hooked<00:05:34.120> up<00:05:34.330> we

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
then once we had the sling hooked up we

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.230 
then once we had the sling hooked up we
had<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.500> go<00:05:35.620> off<00:05:35.740> trail<00:05:36.070> just<00:05:36.280> a<00:05:36.460> little<00:05:36.670> bit<00:05:36.850> to

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240
