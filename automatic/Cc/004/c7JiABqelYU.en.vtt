00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 everything's fine, I came to you guys 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.670
 passed the seed that is the watch the divo 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.330
 grandchildren, right? 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.920
 You can do today, Santa and Santa . 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.049
 anyone a stuffed animal that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.779
 Do you have any Christmas season? 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.300
 to do cart and kitty of any 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.300
 thing is just to use your creativity 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.039
 It was too much for that, because of the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.410
 My kitchen and I hope you 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.630
 like the video that accompanies step 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.700
 step well you will love the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.380
 quickly make you have the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
 people who you will need a 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.180
 watch size there that you prefer 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.950
 I bought a picnic 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.200
 I already bought it in that little bit 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.530
 red because my doll's outfit 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.350
 is red also loaded combines 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 so this little doll's outfit is 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.739
 white you buy one with white border 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 and so it goes 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 a watch a hot glue scissors in that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.309
 doll that I paid $ 7 in the store 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.040
 tite big field goal he's a 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.040
 That's it, baby. 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.900
 It's cute, but I cut the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.970
 but it can be anyone. 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.610
 snowman and we'll make the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.340
 people are going to be like little dolls going 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.439
 separate the head from the arms of this body 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.009
 the middle because the little body in the middle of it 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.659
 It will turn that clock. 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.659
 so it's just I came here on the cut 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.170
 April dolls usually come with 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.330
 this dispute then you take out there that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.080
 it is easier to separate the arms from the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.760
 body is there you only cut here it is 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.500
 interesting if you had a mix 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.470
 because this episode is very 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.810
 big and I do not have much mobility 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.780
 with her but only you cut it straight 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.160
 here was little doll with little arms 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.440
 and the bottom that I'm going to get out of here 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.210
 So he's going to let go and see these potatoes. 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.220
 this is going to rule out in case I 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.370
 I discarded because he was learning 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.680
 with this business here and what was then 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.930
 Courteous too and now we're going to do 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.660
 is to lock it here on the watch and not 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.600
 lose the little feet here people will stay 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.989
 very cute, come on, I'll see more or 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.940
 less where are you going to stay? 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.709
 this arm in being able to have an average here 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.410
 As far as I pass glue 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:46.110
 I used to make the barÃ§a glue that the center 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:52.680
 first only paid the kent people make lime 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:55.140
 here in the center and I'll stick my head well 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.310
 the center of the clock 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.680
 Are you there now or acecol the little hands? 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.799
 It is also that way to stay well 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.019
 thin so you suppose I go 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.019
 give a speck of glue that also 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.020
 making 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:22.240
 I'm going to stick a glue here and I'm going 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.190
 to a glue spit here also 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.150
 Your criteria should rain like this. 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.430
 loose can leave people alone just so the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.340
 to be cute will look very cute and dream 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.950
 kitchen here you can watch it appear 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.340
 If there is any here, I'll spend more 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:47.230
 a little glue also to help 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:50.830
 well heated and here comes full tail 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.950
 Look, folks, what else is not right now? 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.070
 to adopt the cover legs that more or 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.640
 less so where you put and tails 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.640
 little leg 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.350
 So people, the doll is like that. 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.930
 snowman watch 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.239
 You can do Father's Santa. 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.610
 Noel stays on fire, too . 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.230
 kilogram when only this santa 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.540
 should not say that the one who grows 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.730
 net external super soft plush 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.440
 I'm going to put the kitchen, I 'm going back. 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.660

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.700
 kiss so that's now hope 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.350
 You liked it if you liked it. 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.330
 forget it, I know mine 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.040
 underneath it is expected that this will 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.960
 all updates for the month of December 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.180
 will have several videos of the staff that 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.950

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.870
 It helps a lot, you do not like it down. 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.850
 It's good and it helps the channel a lot. 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.410
 helping a lot to make the decision 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.180
 because to me 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.210
 Let me count it down here this time. 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.480
 I like it very well with God. 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.480
