sunday and get a win go from there your
finger<00:05:46.330> was<00:05:46.449> maybe<00:05:46.569> a<00:05:46.720> bit<00:05:46.810> complacency<00:05:47.560> in

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
finger was maybe a bit complacency in

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.559 
finger was maybe a bit complacency in
the<00:05:47.740> team<00:05:47.889> after<00:05:48.039> six<00:05:48.370> wins<00:05:48.819> in<00:05:48.909> a<00:05:49.000> row<00:05:49.030> yes<00:05:49.389> I

lot<00:06:12.220> of<00:06:12.400> easy<00:06:12.490> buckets<00:06:13.120> and<00:06:13.330> we<00:06:13.479> had<00:06:13.599> a<00:06:13.630> lot<00:06:13.840> of

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
lot of easy buckets and we had a lot of

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.110 
lot of easy buckets and we had a lot of
open<00:06:14.229> shots<00:06:14.440> that<00:06:14.680> we<00:06:14.770> usually<00:06:15.159> make<00:06:15.370> but<00:06:16.000> we

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
open shots that we usually make but we

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.730 
open shots that we usually make but we
didn't<00:06:16.330> make<00:06:16.419> them<00:06:16.599> tonight<00:06:16.900> so<00:06:17.380> therefore

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
didn't make them tonight so therefore

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.529 
didn't make them tonight so therefore
you<00:06:17.860> gotta<00:06:18.039> resolve<00:06:18.430> to<00:06:18.610> defaults<00:06:19.120> and<00:06:19.300> we

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
you gotta resolve to defaults and we

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.089 
you gotta resolve to defaults and we
didn't<00:06:19.750> play<00:06:19.870> much<00:06:19.900> defense<00:06:20.500> at<00:06:20.620> all<00:06:20.710> tonight

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
didn't play much defense at all tonight

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:22.890 
didn't play much defense at all tonight
you<00:06:21.669> aren't<00:06:21.909> working<00:06:22.180> together<00:06:22.270> much<00:06:22.569> more<00:06:22.629> as

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
you aren't working together much more as

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.270 
you aren't working together much more as
a<00:06:22.960> team<00:06:23.199> but<00:06:23.379> tonight<00:06:23.650> the<00:06:23.770> distinct<00:06:24.129> should

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
a team but tonight the distinct should

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.339 
a team but tonight the distinct should
be<00:06:24.370> interesting<00:06:24.879> to<00:06:25.030> be<00:06:25.659> in<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:25.870> back<00:06:26.050> step

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
be interesting to be in the back step

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.010 
be interesting to be in the back step
really<00:06:26.770> yes<00:06:27.250> we<00:06:27.580> took<00:06:27.699> a<00:06:27.819> step<00:06:28.030> back<00:06:28.240> and<00:06:28.270> once

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
really yes we took a step back and once

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.540 
really yes we took a step back and once
again<00:06:29.169> I<00:06:29.319> think<00:06:29.500> it's<00:06:29.770> because<00:06:29.860> we<00:06:30.069> won<00:06:30.219> six

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
again I think it's because we won six

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.879 
again I think it's because we won six
straight<00:06:30.610> so<00:06:31.090> maybe<00:06:31.840> that<00:06:32.050> loss<00:06:32.199> is<00:06:32.409> good<00:06:32.590> for

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
straight so maybe that loss is good for

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.709 
straight so maybe that loss is good for
us<00:06:33.009> bring<00:06:33.219> us<00:06:33.340> back<00:06:33.520> to<00:06:33.699> reality<00:06:33.849> and<00:06:34.389> get<00:06:34.539> back

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
us bring us back to reality and get back

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:36.719 
us bring us back to reality and get back
to<00:06:34.870> working<00:06:35.080> hard<00:06:35.380> like<00:06:35.590> we<00:06:35.740> supposed<00:06:35.889> to<00:06:36.370> and

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
to working hard like we supposed to and

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.939 
to working hard like we supposed to and
be<00:06:36.909> hunger<00:06:37.300> again<00:06:37.539> because<00:06:37.960> from<00:06:38.469> here<00:06:38.530> on<00:06:38.710> out

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
be hunger again because from here on out

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.370 
be hunger again because from here on out
every<00:06:39.099> game<00:06:39.460> we<00:06:39.789> was<00:06:40.330> tooling<00:06:40.569> eight<00:06:40.870> so<00:06:41.110> every

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
every game we was tooling eight so every

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.290 
every game we was tooling eight so every
game<00:06:41.560> is<00:06:41.740> a<00:06:41.770> playoff<00:06:42.130> game<00:06:42.159> to<00:06:42.610> us<00:06:42.699> so<00:06:42.940> we<00:06:42.969> need

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
game is a playoff game to us so we need
