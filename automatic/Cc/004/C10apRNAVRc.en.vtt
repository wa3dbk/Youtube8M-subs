00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
now this is really cool so let's get

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.789 
now this is really cool so let's get
into<00:03:47.400> how<00:03:47.579> to<00:03:47.609> do<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.720> basically<00:03:49.590> you

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
into how to do this so basically you

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.170 
into how to do this so basically you
want<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.010> go<00:03:50.069> into<00:03:50.280> your<00:03:50.370> name<00:03:50.549> tag<00:03:50.850> edit
