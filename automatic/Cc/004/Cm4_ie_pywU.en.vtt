00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.830 
considering getting this custom you know
drivetrain<00:03:39.510> setup<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.500> was<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:42.360> little<00:03:42.750> bit

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
drivetrain setup I was a little bit

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.940 
drivetrain setup I was a little bit
concerned<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.590> wouldn't<00:03:43.800> be<00:03:43.890> enough

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
concerned that that wouldn't be enough

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.860 
concerned that that wouldn't be enough
gears<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.880> know<00:03:45.000> cuz<00:03:45.180> I'd<00:03:45.270> be<00:03:45.390> losing<00:03:45.540> some

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
gears you know cuz I'd be losing some

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
gears you know cuz I'd be losing some
gears<00:03:46.080> up<00:03:46.230> front<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.840> it's<00:03:49.200> worked<00:03:49.470> out<00:03:49.620> great

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
gears up front but it's worked out great

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.400 
gears up front but it's worked out great
I<00:03:50.670> couldn't<00:03:51.060> have<00:03:51.150> been<00:03:51.210> happier<00:03:51.600> this<00:03:52.200> whole

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
I couldn't have been happier this whole

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.100 
I couldn't have been happier this whole
setup<00:03:52.710> makes<00:03:53.250> this<00:03:53.550> run<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.150> lot<00:03:54.480> quieter

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
setup makes this run a lot quieter

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.700 
setup makes this run a lot quieter
it<00:03:55.650> keeps<00:03:55.920> tension<00:03:56.430> on<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:57.060> chain<00:03:57.090> itself<00:03:57.710> so

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
it keeps tension on the chain itself so

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.350 
it keeps tension on the chain itself so
I<00:03:58.740> mean<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.220> go<00:03:59.310> down<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.670> trail<00:03:59.880> this<00:04:00.120> isn't

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
I mean you go down the trail this isn't

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.880 
I mean you go down the trail this isn't
going<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.510> be<00:04:00.570> flapping<00:04:01.080> around<00:04:01.170> clankity

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
going to be flapping around clankity

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.190 
going to be flapping around clankity
clank<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.670> know<00:04:02.790> against<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.930> I've

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
clank you know against this and I've

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.750 
clank you know against this and I've
even<00:04:04.320> got<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:06.210> tire<00:04:06.960> this<00:04:07.860> is<00:04:08.010> an<00:04:08.130> old<00:04:08.280> tire<00:04:08.460> with

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
even got a tire this is an old tire with

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.930 
even got a tire this is an old tire with
some<00:04:09.050> like<00:04:10.050> some<00:04:10.230> plumber's<00:04:10.650> tape<00:04:10.890> wrapped<00:04:11.760> on

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
some like some plumber's tape wrapped on

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.850 
some like some plumber's tape wrapped on
there<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.390> sounds<00:04:12.990> kind<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.230> hokey<00:04:13.350> but<00:04:13.740> it

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
there it sounds kind of hokey but it

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.840 
there it sounds kind of hokey but it
actually<00:04:14.780> it's<00:04:15.780> worked<00:04:16.020> really<00:04:16.350> well<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.950> it

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
actually it's worked really well and it

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.160 
actually it's worked really well and it
actually<00:04:18.030> looks<00:04:18.390> pretty<00:04:18.450> good<00:04:18.660> too<00:04:18.930> on<00:04:19.080> the

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
actually looks pretty good too on the

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.260 
actually looks pretty good too on the
bike<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:20.430> it's<00:04:20.580> got<00:04:20.700> some<00:04:20.850> little<00:04:20.940> two<00:04:21.120> zip

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
bike and it's got some little two zip

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.400 
bike and it's got some little two zip
ties<00:04:21.299> then<00:04:21.720> they'd<00:04:21.870> hold<00:04:22.020> it<00:04:22.200> all<00:04:22.290> together

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
ties then they'd hold it all together

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.060 
ties then they'd hold it all together
under<00:04:22.710> II<00:04:22.830> underneath<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> tape<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.860> it

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
under II underneath the tape so if it

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.970 
under II underneath the tape so if it
does<00:04:26.310> happen<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.820> slap<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.630> little<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.860> know

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
does happen to slap the little you know

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.670 
does happen to slap the little you know
the<00:04:29.100> chain<00:04:29.550> guide<00:04:29.790> there<00:04:30.200> it<00:04:31.200> doesn't<00:04:31.440> make

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
the chain guide there it doesn't make

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.870 
the chain guide there it doesn't make
any<00:04:31.800> noise<00:04:31.890> at<00:04:32.160> all<00:04:32.250> but<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.640> don't<00:04:32.670> even

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
any noise at all but it I don't even

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.310 
any noise at all but it I don't even
think<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.240> does<00:04:33.390> because<00:04:33.690> I<00:04:33.780> never<00:04:33.960> hear

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
think it does because I never hear

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.180 
think it does because I never hear
anything<00:04:34.590> when<00:04:34.800> I'm<00:04:34.890> on<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.100> trail<00:04:35.340> with<00:04:35.460> this

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
anything when I'm on the trail with this

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.530 
anything when I'm on the trail with this
and<00:04:38.190> then<00:04:38.310> lastly<00:04:38.640> we've<00:04:38.820> got<00:04:38.850> this<00:04:39.120> little

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
and then lastly we've got this little

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.530 
and then lastly we've got this little
thing<00:04:39.780> here<00:04:40.340> which<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.460> really<00:04:42.210> like<00:04:42.360> it

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
thing here which I really like it

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.330 
thing here which I really like it
actually<00:04:42.810> it's<00:04:43.380> really<00:04:43.530> light<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:44.190> doesn't

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
actually it's really light it doesn't

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.070 
actually it's really light it doesn't
add<00:04:44.490> hardly<00:04:45.030> any<00:04:45.180> weight<00:04:45.360> it's<00:04:45.630> peaked<00:04:45.870> in

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
add hardly any weight it's peaked in

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.430 
add hardly any weight it's peaked in
actually<00:04:46.640> and<00:04:50.540> basically<00:04:51.540> what<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.960> does<00:04:52.140> is

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
actually and basically what it does is

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.160 
actually and basically what it does is
it<00:04:52.920> keeps<00:04:54.110> this<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.500> this<00:04:56.780> which<00:04:57.780> are<00:04:57.930> what

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
it keeps this and this which are what

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.170 
it keeps this and this which are what
your<00:04:58.350> rear<00:04:58.830> brakes<00:04:59.100> are<00:04:59.250> mounted<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.610> it<00:04:59.970> keeps

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
your rear brakes are mounted to it keeps

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.180 
your rear brakes are mounted to it keeps
that<00:05:00.360> keeps<00:05:00.780> your<00:05:00.900> bike<00:05:01.080> frame<00:05:01.290> from<00:05:01.620> flexing

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
that keeps your bike frame from flexing

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.670 
that keeps your bike frame from flexing
when<00:05:02.490> you<00:05:02.580> apply<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:02.850> brakes<00:05:03.200> so<00:05:04.200> I<00:05:04.230> basically

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
when you apply the brakes so I basically

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.700 
when you apply the brakes so I basically
just<00:05:04.800> make<00:05:05.160> sure<00:05:05.400> where<00:05:05.990> your<00:05:06.990> rear<00:05:07.170> brakes<00:05:07.440> a

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
just make sure where your rear brakes a

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.440 
just make sure where your rear brakes a
lot<00:05:08.400> more<00:05:08.550> responsive<00:05:09.150> than<00:05:09.180> they<00:05:09.420> are

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
lot more responsive than they are

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.650 
lot more responsive than they are
normally<00:05:10.700> you<00:05:11.700> know<00:05:11.760> these<00:05:11.940> aluminum<00:05:12.420> frames

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
normally you know these aluminum frames

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.090 
normally you know these aluminum frames
they're<00:05:12.930> they're<00:05:13.260> really<00:05:13.470> light<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:13.979> they're

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
they're they're really light and they're

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.670 
they're they're really light and they're
pretty<00:05:14.580> flexible<00:05:14.729> so<00:05:15.320> just<00:05:16.320> adds<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.590> little

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
pretty flexible so just adds a little

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.140 
pretty flexible so just adds a little
bit<00:05:16.830> more<00:05:16.950> stiffness<00:05:17.400> there

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
bit more stiffness there

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.080 
bit more stiffness there
oh<00:05:19.040> let's<00:05:20.040> see<00:05:20.190> it<00:05:20.280> skipped<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.639> couple<00:05:20.850> parts

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
oh let's see it skipped a couple parts

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.850 
oh let's see it skipped a couple parts
