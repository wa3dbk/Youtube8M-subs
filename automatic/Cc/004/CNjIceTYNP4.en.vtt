particular<00:00:20.640> video<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.570> actually<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.230> be

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
particular video is actually going to be

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.490 
particular video is actually going to be
on<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.859> ump45<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.269> without<00:00:24.390> further<00:00:24.539> ado

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
on the ump45 so without further ado

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000 
on the ump45 so without further ado
let's<00:00:25.949> get<00:00:26.099> started<00:00:26.510> ok<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.570> looking<00:00:28.140> at<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
let's get started ok so looking at the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.339 
let's get started ok so looking at the
description<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> ump45<00:00:30.390> submachine<00:00:31.170> gun

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
description of the ump45 submachine gun

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.370 
description of the ump45 submachine gun
we<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.679> obviously<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.730> says<00:00:32.820> fully

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
we can obviously see that it says fully

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.750 
we can obviously see that it says fully
automatic<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> close<00:00:34.860> range<00:00:35.160> well<00:00:35.399> obviously

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
automatic and close range well obviously

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.819 
automatic and close range well obviously
because<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> submachine<00:00:36.930> gun<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
because it's a submachine gun so that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.350 
because it's a submachine gun so that
doesn't<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.219> help<00:00:38.640> us<00:00:38.850> when<00:00:39.149> we're

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
doesn't really help us when we're

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.030 
doesn't really help us when we're
deciding<00:00:39.930> whether<00:00:40.110> or<00:00:40.230> not<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.559> should<00:00:40.590> use

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
deciding whether or not we should use

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.360 
deciding whether or not we should use
this<00:00:41.579> gun<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.809> not<00:00:43.020> ok<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.739> looking<00:00:44.190> at<00:00:44.340> some

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this gun or not ok so looking at some

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.910 
this gun or not ok so looking at some
comparative<00:00:45.090> aspects<00:00:45.719> we<00:00:46.170> will<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
comparative aspects we will see that the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.330 
comparative aspects we will see that the
ump45<00:00:47.750> beats<00:00:48.750> out<00:00:48.960> every<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:49.649> submachine

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
ump45 beats out every other submachine

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.779 
ump45 beats out every other submachine
gun<00:00:50.579> except<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.410> fire<00:00:52.739> rate<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
gun except for the fire rate it's got a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.330 
gun except for the fire rate it's got a
slower<00:00:54.300> fire<00:00:54.660> rate<00:00:54.899> than<00:00:55.140> every<00:00:55.739> submachine

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
slower fire rate than every submachine

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
slower fire rate than every submachine
gun<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.750> make<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> prediction

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
gun so here we can make a prediction

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.420 
gun so here we can make a prediction
that<00:00:58.789> rapid<00:00:59.789> fire<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.719> make<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.079> gun

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
that rapid fire will make this gun

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.160 
that rapid fire will make this gun
amazing<00:01:02.430> ok<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.750> being<00:01:03.930> said

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
amazing ok so with all that being said

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410 
amazing ok so with all that being said
this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.040> class<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.610> suggest<00:01:06.000> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
this is the class that I suggest you
don't<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.140> use<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:08.040> I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
don't have to use it but what I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.700 
don't have to use it but what I
recommend<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> UMP<00:01:09.330> 45<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:10.110> rapid<00:01:10.500> fire

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
recommend is a UMP 45 with rapid fire

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.840 
recommend is a UMP 45 with rapid fire
and<00:01:11.070> range<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.150> an<00:01:12.869> MP<00:01:13.200> nine<00:01:13.400> well<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
actually in this game play I was only

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.350 
actually in this game play I was only
using<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.009> red<00:01:47.220> dot<00:01:47.430> sight<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.299> not

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
using the red dot sight on it and not

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.649 
using the red dot sight on it and not
the<00:01:48.990> suggested<00:01:49.649> class<00:01:49.920> because<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.479> such

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the suggested class because it was such

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.590 
the suggested class because it was such
a<00:01:51.689> low<00:01:51.869> level<00:01:52.079> when<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> was<00:01:52.680> using<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.950> gun<00:01:53.159> I

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
a low level when I was using a gun I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.440 
a low level when I was using a gun I
still<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:55.020> recommend<00:01:55.700> rapid<00:01:56.700> fire<00:01:56.880> but<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
still do recommend rapid fire but you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.990 
still do recommend rapid fire but you
could<00:01:57.600> also<00:01:57.869> put<00:01:58.350> extended<00:01:59.070> bags<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
could also put extended bags on it and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.719 
could also put extended bags on it and
that<00:02:00.060> would<00:02:00.630> help<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.899> lot<00:02:00.930> too<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> give

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that would help a lot too now to give

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.280 
that would help a lot too now to give
you<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> few<00:02:03.149> tips<00:02:03.180> when<00:02:03.689> you're<00:02:03.810> using<00:02:04.049> this

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
you a few tips when you're using this

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.130 
you a few tips when you're using this
gun<00:02:04.560> make<00:02:05.159> sure<00:02:05.189> you're<00:02:05.610> using<00:02:06.090> its<00:02:06.570> mobility

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
gun make sure you're using its mobility

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.529 
gun make sure you're using its mobility
to<00:02:07.619> your<00:02:07.799> advantage<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.489> think<00:02:09.090> I've<00:02:09.179> said<00:02:09.360> this

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
to your advantage I think I've said this

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.809 
to your advantage I think I've said this
before<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:10.280> whatever<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.430> gun<00:02:11.610> you're

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
before but whatever your gun you're

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.850 
before but whatever your gun you're
using<00:02:12.090> you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
using you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.330 
using you
it's<00:02:13.040> advantages<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:14.540> your<00:02:14.870> advantage<00:02:15.350> now

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
it's advantages to your advantage now

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.980 
it's advantages to your advantage now
that<00:02:16.520> might<00:02:16.640> sound<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.970> little<00:02:17.000> silly<00:02:17.480> but<00:02:17.660> it's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
that might sound a little silly but it's

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.820 
that might sound a little silly but it's
the<00:02:18.080> same<00:02:18.320> idea<00:02:18.710> as<00:02:19.630> using<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.900> sniper<00:02:21.470> from

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the same idea as using a sniper from

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.430 
the same idea as using a sniper from
long<00:02:22.100> range<00:02:22.130> so<00:02:22.910> that<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.360> can<00:02:23.540> outgun<00:02:23.960> every

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
long range so that you can outgun every

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
to want to play smarter than you would

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.190 
to want to play smarter than you would
with<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.740> just<00:02:40.040> an<00:02:40.160> assault<00:02:40.580> rifle<00:02:40.780> because<00:02:41.780> you

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
with a just an assault rifle because you

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.660 
with a just an assault rifle because you
know<00:02:42.320> there's<00:02:42.560> head<00:02:42.740> glitchers<00:02:43.130> in<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.459> game

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
know there's head glitchers in this game

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.230 
know there's head glitchers in this game
and<00:02:44.830> which<00:02:45.830> makes<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.160> hard<00:02:46.459> for<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:46.970> kill

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
and which makes it hard for you to kill

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.850 
and which makes it hard for you to kill
somebody<00:02:47.450> with<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.690> submachine<00:02:47.959> gun<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.680> has

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
somebody with a submachine gun that has

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.670 
somebody with a submachine gun that has
kick<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.520> not<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> lot<00:02:50.180> of<00:02:50.209> range<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:51.170> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
kick and not a lot of range so the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.820 
kick and not a lot of range so the
reason<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:52.040> killed<00:02:52.310> this<00:02:52.640> guy<00:02:52.910> here<00:02:53.300> was<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.200> came

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
reason I killed this guy here was I came

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
out here was because he was right out in

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.670 
out here was because he was right out in
the<00:02:56.450> open<00:02:56.510> but<00:02:56.900> say<00:02:57.020> he<00:02:57.050> was<00:02:57.290> head<00:02:57.440> glitching

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
the open but say he was head glitching

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.729 
the open but say he was head glitching
behind<00:02:58.070> this<00:02:58.220> truck<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.850> would<00:02:59.540> want<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.930> run

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
behind this truck I would want to run

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.160 
behind this truck I would want to run
around<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.040> other<00:03:01.190> way<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:02.720> can<00:03:02.840> flank

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
around the other way so that I can flank

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.960 
around the other way so that I can flank
him<00:03:03.320> from<00:03:03.560> behind<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.310> get<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.610> close-range

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
him from behind and get the close-range

him from behind and get the close-range
kill<00:03:05.420> instead<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:06.050> killing<00:03:06.500> myself<00:03:06.830> running

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
kill instead of killing myself running

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.110 
kill instead of killing myself running
straight<00:03:08.150> at<00:03:08.209> him<00:03:08.540> no<00:03:09.350> I'm<00:03:09.470> gonna<00:03:09.830> die<00:03:10.130> now<00:03:10.400> the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
straight at him no I'm gonna die now the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.510 
straight at him no I'm gonna die now the
great<00:03:11.390> thing<00:03:11.420> about<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.930> ump45<00:03:12.590> along<00:03:13.310> with

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
great thing about the ump45 along with

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.680 
great thing about the ump45 along with
the<00:03:13.610> mp7<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.350> has<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.459> lot<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.209> range

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
the mp7 is that it has a lot of range

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.820 
the mp7 is that it has a lot of range
and<00:03:18.250> almost<00:03:19.250> no<00:03:19.489> recoil<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.480> basically<00:03:20.930> it's

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
and almost no recoil so basically it's

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.620 
and almost no recoil so basically it's
gonna<00:03:21.950> be<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.100> lot<00:03:22.250> easier<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.790> get<00:03:23.060> those<00:03:23.299> long

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
gonna be a lot easier to get those long

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.350 
gonna be a lot easier to get those long
shots<00:03:24.049> and<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:25.549> has<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.730> bunch<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.030> added

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
shots and it has a bunch of added

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.539 
shots and it has a bunch of added
bonuses<00:03:26.870> like<00:03:26.930> mobility<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.160> it's<00:03:28.340> kind<00:03:28.519> of

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
bonuses like mobility so it's kind of

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.860 
bonuses like mobility so it's kind of
like<00:03:28.959> assault<00:03:29.959> rifle<00:03:30.580> but<00:03:31.580> like<00:03:31.760> 10<00:03:32.150> times<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
like assault rifle but like 10 times the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.370 
like assault rifle but like 10 times the
mobility<00:03:33.440> which<00:03:33.950> makes<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.430> great<00:03:35.000> gun<00:03:35.420> now

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
mobility which makes it a great gun now

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.770 
mobility which makes it a great gun now
in<00:03:36.500> modern<00:03:36.769> warfare<00:03:36.890> 2<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.880> was<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.120> trihard

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
in modern warfare 2 this was the trihard

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.949 
in modern warfare 2 this was the trihard
yawn<00:03:39.019> you<00:03:39.260> know<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.650> new<00:03:39.830> gun<00:03:40.220> the

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
yawn you know the new gun the

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.440 
yawn you know the new gun the
overpowered<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.290> fmg9<00:03:42.910> akimbo<00:03:44.200> type<00:03:45.200> 95<00:03:46.450> that

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
overpowered the fmg9 akimbo type 95 that

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.770 
overpowered the fmg9 akimbo type 95 that
gun<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:49.040> was<00:03:49.970> really<00:03:50.090> overpowered

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
gun so it was really overpowered

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.960
