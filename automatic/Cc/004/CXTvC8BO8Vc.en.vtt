00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.560
 i 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.450
 the today the artist is ice cream 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.580
 favorites of Colombians since 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.070
 many years and will soon reach the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.829
 peru I came to bogota to know the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.460
 factory and I was impressed not 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.000
 only 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.550
 for the taste of the ice creams but for the 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.180
 so artisan processes that still 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.180
 conserve 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.250
 putting away 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.890
 and how your passion for this dessert of 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.710
 really see from my house from my 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.379
 house because we always had the culture 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.989
 to consume ice cream my daddy's dad 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.400
 He died for the ice cream fascinated him 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.800
 unfortunately he was diabetic but what 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.080
 only that with which neglected 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.700
 I would have formulated for an ice cream that will be 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.740
 what will it be that they have ice creams that 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.350
 we like them so much because you like them when 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.210
 you're a kid you like when you're 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.190
 great when I love old people 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.750
 the ice cream that you wait for and then you have 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.430
 bad because since you do next 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.229
 it works when you're sad of the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.399
 they worked joyful distance from the side 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:33.570
 unites on the reconciliation side is an excuse 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.570
 perfect to pamper 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.140
 in ice cream in calories and a little bit and if 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.260
 more calories this has really been something 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.180
 that has differentiated us we have always 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.409
 wanted to cover all the niches of 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.630
 market that all people are 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.080
 feel that there is something special for them 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.520
 they end up low then we chose 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.350
 develop products that were low 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.540
 in calories that did not have any 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.790
 addition of sugar and that we also 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.790
 allow to have low quality 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.320
 I can prove which one is which one 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.840
 has about 10 low stored in 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.300
 Canada are explained by the color 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.760
 black color we have variety of flavors 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.010
 we have brownie lines of instruments what 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.070
 we are going to exhibit we have fruits of 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.270
 forest light we have mandarin vanilla 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.180
 and what they are trying to do we are trying to do 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.610
 is that we open the most successful flavor 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.800
 that we thought of cream wearing our 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.560
 happy image version what a wonder 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.030
 great without sacrificing the taste 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.420
 qualify the experience that these 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.420
 children 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.329
 while we walk through the factory we 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.709
 we find a room where they are 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.019
 squeezing tangerines 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.030
 I could not believe it they really had 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.090
 workers cutting the tangerines and 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.799
 exposing one by one to the moon that 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.049
 I was impressed when I saw the 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.049
 workers squeezing tangerines in 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.469
 real tangerines the biggest challenge 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.139
 because we wanted and put our plant 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.609
 super modern but we did not want to lose 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.829
 our handcrafted part 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.200
 and the secret 6 my secret is in the 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.230
 orange for mandarin orange for 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.609
 tangerine catch strawberry x strawberry and that's 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.500
 what has managed to have a flavor 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.450
 that we have today besides life 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.460
 spectacular lemon is also a 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.910
 combination a perfect balance of 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.910
 acid 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.240
 I was eating seems the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.950
 tangerine delight 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.629
 ah 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.400
 with him every how much they liked a 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.170
 new alejandra we are around 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.970
 our our meditate and it is through 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.370
 develop about four flavors a year 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.620
 we are in this process in recent years 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.239
 has been much more much stronger the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.090
 development issue because we have alliances 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.160
 also with others with other types of 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.170
 movies that force us take them to 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.239
 develop new flavors only is 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.130
 that your customers always find something 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.080
 new something new and how we have clients 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.180
 very faithful are they ask what's 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.739
 new we have then innovation 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.099
 is a fundamental part of our 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.099
 company 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.209
 an ice cream yes with the flavor recommends that 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.209
 get up and down 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.010
 we usually put the flavor down 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.639
 softer and higher when extracting the side 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.639
 stronger 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.250
 and the next 200 good and evil and if 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.770
 you are going to combine fruit with milk fruit with 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.380
 milk not as you want as we want 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.479
 you want if you do not have no you do not have 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.250
 order each one your search 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.270
 like many things here not everyone will 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.810
 you can put the sauce you want the 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.810
 banana split 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.560
 the ice cream is to pamper you 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.750
 to put you in a straitjacket that 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.669
 won you can not put them how it sells 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.350
 this does not combine is not going not here 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.550
 you can make the craziest combinations 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.550
 and all too 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.400
 actually 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.680
 I would love a chasm of duration
