00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.760
 so hello my name is yellow and I 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.139
 am leaving high mountain 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.839
 I work in the massif du sancy in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.130
 winter basically and the rest of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.050
 year 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.320
 I split my time between 106 and the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.320
 friends 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.320
 1 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.090
 and 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.580
 I had a group of cascading ice cream 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.680
 today some quarters the fury 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.850
 ashes is to start first 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.310
 by the safety instructions 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.630
 I explain to them how he 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.489
 need to focus on how 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.489
 must use ice axes and crampons 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.990
 once I explained to them 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.720
 how do we just hang on 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.260
 how in grains 1h30 2h for stifle 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.260
 they are fun 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.970
 suddenly I had a two-hour break 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.170
 and half two hours between noon and two 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.870
 the conditions were exceptional 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.840
 and I took the opportunity to go to go 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.390
 to make a small corridor in the valley 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.990
 hell 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.990
 m 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.970
 I made the shot their sticky throws and 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.650
 redundancy since saving pure so we 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.560
 goes down on art wire is hard whose 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.030
 until 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.939
 until the start of the blow their pantyhose 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.710
 gene you discovered the most mythical the 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.710
 steepest of hell valley 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.490
 2-3 first turn it was more for 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.750
 test the snowpack and to feel 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.260
 a little if there was something that is 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.240
 a plate 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.790
 because college is if you do yourself 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.840
 catch the skis in a casting in sight 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.420
 of dragged to the bottom in 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.399
 pebbles and it's very good after you 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.470
 attacks directly the most passing 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.360
 steep so the passage the priest is 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.160
 often in ice cube there was good 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.830
 snow but every turn under the snow 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.070
 of touch the class was going to do 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.070
 Warning 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.410
 according to you go out in the big hall 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.239
 principal in the sun had to finish that one 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.390
 throws quiet it's the art is the most 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.390
 dense 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.939
 there days like that there are three 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.239
 or four in the winter you do not need them 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.920
 miss 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.689
 I was at work so I could not 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.920
 enjoy it completely but I have when 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.230
 even had these two little hours of 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.480
 niches in the middle of the day 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.480
 I did not let them pass the megan 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.560
 but OK
