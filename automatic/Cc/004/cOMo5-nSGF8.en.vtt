00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.360
 very good to everyone I'm boss spray 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.170
 I'm going to show you how to 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.790
 make a formula 1 cake like this 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.430
 there are some parts that do not come out but it's 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.560
 that if I do not have time to finish it 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.390
 weather 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.270
 first let's make the marks in the 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.820
 cake to cut everything we cut 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.100
 with the shape of the car we are going to cut 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.220
 all the parts back to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.960
 leave it right and with what's left over 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.450
 Let's make this the top 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 part is a rectangle and cut it out 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.720
 of so that it remains but now we are going to 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.520
 make gaps in these parts and 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.510
 then we will apply all half 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.510
 to fill it 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.820
 in the peking part and then we throw him 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.190
 butter cream water cream 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.440
 It is made with chocolate and then filled 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.310
 of chocolate we cover it crushes very 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.410
 little so that they stick 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.850
 and then we cover it all with cream and a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.440
 Once covered we can paste the part 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.730
 above that we will also cover 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.040
 cream 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.410
 Now let's stretch the fondant and go 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.720
 to cover the cake this is what has 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.420
 to be more careful you have to go very 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.370
 little by little calmly to go eliminating 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.820
 the wrinkles and that not 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.320
 and that they do not break and a 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.600
 little bit sinking in the holes 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.630
 also go down and open each 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.390
 wrinkle so that it does not stop 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.790
 then and you have to go around the whole 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.940
 little by little, because if not, if 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.380
 remove one all the wrinkle apart then 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.040
 it can not be removed from the other 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.450
 side then we give you a review with the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.170
 director so that it remains tomÃ¡s know 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.170
 list 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.810
 and cut what's left over 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.700
 this has to be cut, we have to make a 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.740
 some pressure to then not 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.640
 stay attached and when you break it 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.050
 it comes to everything and we take off what 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.570
 And then we're going to give you another 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.100
 passed with the smoothing and sinking the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.140
 holes are also 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.179
 and it would look something like that, it looks much more 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.250
 soft this is another cake that had already 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.040
 made that only a rectangular cake 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.810
 it is confusing 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.840
 with a lot of squares made one to 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.760
 one 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.739
 that would be like the line while you 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.960
 we are going to put pills so that endurance 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:27.750
 the other cake and do not be sinking 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.750
 and then we put the other cake on top 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.530
 it would not fall apart 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.740
 and we leave it 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.850
 we see that it is not mode 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.330
 and something like that would remain 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.330
 Now let's take out the rubbers that I 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.910
 I took the measure of one of a cutter 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.310
 I had to mark it with this later 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.130
 cut it with a knife and remove the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.460
 inside with a teaspoon for 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.890
 that not to put it the part of those of 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.590
 the rhythms we cover each one with 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.780
 cream all 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.910
 and then we're going to cover it with fondant 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.739
 this is like the cake so they have 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.629
 more careful because it is smaller and 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.770
 the form was a bit difficult I took 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.840
 a little discovering 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.540
 but you have to be careful is that you do not 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.579
 it is wrong 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.090
 and then you cut what about like 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.940
 with the cake 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.769
 then one I'm going to make some rectangles and 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.209
 some tubes that I'm going to put it with a 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.510
 stick so they do not fall for 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.620
 hit the edges of the cake where 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.620
 the wheels are going to stick 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.780
 this is going to take a few of the two 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.780
 sides 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.610
 and then this is going to get glue 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.640
 to paste the cars but first we go 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.590
 to put before the rubbers paste here 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.890
 a few black squares that would be a 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.870
 part of there that has to cool 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.880
 because if you had the facts it would be a 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.640
 little harder to put it 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.350
 already caused them we are going to do the drawing 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.930
 which is that I will put four strips and 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.420
 he hit with sms four strips to each one 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.209
 and then for the wheels with a strip 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.540
 white I do it as a circle and then 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.900
 an X and this will then paint it from 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.919
 Silver color with brush coloring 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.470
 I put a stick to the cake first 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.509
 I put it down because it's harder and 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.789
 because he has a little more time 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.979
 Fondant has already dried up and stays there 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.210
 the rubbers are stuck and that we have 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.940
 moved 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.639
 and then we do the same thing back only 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.840
 a little shorter because it is more because 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.820
 this more 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.260
 more since the cations to fall the 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.440
 captchas here we will open it as a 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.440
 hole to put another bit 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.639
 and for the rear spoiler with a couple of 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.180
 red rectangles with chopsticks so that 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.180
 stand and the white part 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.560
 I did double the rays so that 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.699
 I had two chopsticks and will hold on 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.099
 then I folded it 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.139
 and it was tolerated a little more there is that 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.909
 pay to put up a little too you 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.819
 I put a black square on the side of the 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:23.159
 steering wheel and the steering wheel that was a 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:27.990
 rectangle and open the gaps then you 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:30.900
 I did the logos on the spoiler 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.729
 front that I had forgotten and then 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.159
 I had to do it very quickly, it was 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.199
 how is it like the one in the back and is more 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:41.960
 easy to paste because it has stuck to the 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:44.569
 cake down and this part that blank 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.139
 to cut out the shape a bit and then 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.139
 leave it 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.550
 and it is already 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.939
 that has been everything and that is how it has been 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.270
 that you liked it if you do not forget
