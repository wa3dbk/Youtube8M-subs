thirty dollars and stuff like that but

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.300 
thirty dollars and stuff like that but
I'm<00:02:05.700> recommending<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.719> QIOs<00:02:07.049> kilos<00:02:07.740> out<00:02:08.130> of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
I'm recommending the QIOs kilos out of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.220 
I'm recommending the QIOs kilos out of
all<00:02:08.490> of<00:02:08.520> them<00:02:08.700> because<00:02:09.330> kilos<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.500> only<00:02:12.230> their

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
all of them because kilos are only their

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.809 
all of them because kilos are only their
80<00:02:13.410> bucks<00:02:13.710> compared<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> other<00:02:14.760> ones

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
80 bucks compared to the other ones

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.660 
80 bucks compared to the other ones
which<00:02:15.150> are<00:02:15.270> 230<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.050> stuff<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.640> course

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
which are 230 and stuff and of course

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.000 
which are 230 and stuff and of course
any<00:02:18.060> other<00:02:18.390> turtle<00:02:18.750> we<00:02:18.840> should<00:02:19.020> work<00:02:19.230> fine<00:02:19.470> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
any other turtle we should work fine you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.830 
any other turtle we should work fine you
could<00:02:20.190> get<00:02:20.670> probably

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
could get probably

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.470 
could get probably
Triton's<00:02:23.840> too<00:02:24.110> if<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.520> mean<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:26.180> can<00:02:26.330> get

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
Triton's too if you I mean you can get

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.690 
Triton's too if you I mean you can get
one<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:27.260> can<00:02:27.380> get<00:02:27.500> Triton's<00:02:27.920> throw<00:02:28.220> pitches<00:02:28.430> i

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
one you can get Triton's throw pitches i

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.220 
one you can get Triton's throw pitches i
think<00:02:28.730> would<00:02:29.060> be<00:02:29.180> fine<00:02:29.360> i<00:02:29.390> think<00:02:29.540> Triton's<00:02:30.080> are

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
think would be fine i think Triton's are

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.810 
think would be fine i think Triton's are
probably<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.680> little<00:02:30.800> bit<00:02:30.980> better<00:02:31.190> but<00:02:31.520> i

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
probably a little bit better but i

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.940 
probably a little bit better but i
decided<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.900> go<00:02:32.960> with<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.200> i<00:02:33.440> got<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.800> today

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
decided to go with this i got it today

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.220 
decided to go with this i got it today
and<00:02:34.400> today<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.270> nineteenth<00:02:35.720> what<00:02:36.080> you're

and today is the nineteenth what you're

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.600

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610
