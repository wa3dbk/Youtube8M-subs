00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.510
 so today's review we will talk about 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.760
 locks on royal and shaft that is show 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.790
 how reliable good 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.800
 the design may be easily vulnerable when 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.150
 help 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.680
 very simple and affordable tools 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.739
 which attackers use when 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 stealing a car means working principle 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.879
 the steering shaft lock is very simple then 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.800
 there is a lock 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.769
 grabs that is a metal clutch 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 grab the steering shaft respectively 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.949
 car owner getting out of the car 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.839
 pushes the pin in 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.690
 rotation begins to rest on some 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.750
 there are car parts or bodywork 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.820
 cars in some nodes do not allow 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.850
 the steering shaft turns very much 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.130
 reliable good construction exactly what 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.790
 we can see here that is the coupling itself 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.580
 you would have done one part covering 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.290
 the steering shaft is made and blame the cups and in 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.220
 it is set the second part that is 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.969
 somehow crawl to shoot down 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.219
 clutches are almost impossible thereby 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:31.259
 not letting loosen loosen fasteners and 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.570
 add lubricants for 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.340
 easy rotation besides the pc and in 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.840
 locked state we have a castle we 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.920
 Now let's see it blocks completely 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.320
 fastener all all fasteners then 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.429
 there are screws with which happens 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.369
 tightening the lock securely closed 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.530
 directly pin means everything 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.600
 products made of hardened material 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.630
 that is, you work as a grinder there just 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.640
 Well, it will be unrealistic although in principle 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.569
 maybe we need to cut 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.130
 long time 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.700
 that is, the car owner comes out of 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.470
 car before going he 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.270
 sets pin and in general 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.970
 discovery you are not possible 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.640
 take now 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.150
 there the key is similar in profile and trying 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.140
 open this lock to give you have 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.030
 nothing fails this castle is not that 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.210
 there are both locks located in 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.700
 locked state 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.250
 let's see how you can 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.170
 quickly open this lock 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.150
 means used ultrasound suit 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.820
 directly castle larvae 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.220
 which are 5 pin 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.620
 locking mechanism 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.540
 flat key opening means 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.730
 the intruder in general has quite 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:59.320
 standard standard set 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:02.030
 I will now demonstrate the tools 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.040
 the possibility of hiding again I repeat 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.870
 not professional i mean i just have 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.600
 will go on this much longer time 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.000
 rather than a professional, that is, using 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.250
 special tool over there 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.150
 minutes 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:22.420
 one and a half there is a possibility that is not 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.420
 in this case 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.560
 knowing the working principle of the tool i am easy 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.560
 open the lock 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:44.269
 take 2 marry key from another lock with not 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.720
 other flat keys don't work either 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.720
 worked 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.330
 using a special tool 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:47.150
 all lock from to means I still have a master key 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.490
 stuck in the very larvae 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.680
 not scary the main castle is open here 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.650
 so we can have no problem 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.700
 quickly open almost any locks 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.940
 with a flat key 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.540
 so when choosing a lock on the steering shaft 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.540
 should carefully choose 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.590
 direct locking element to 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:14.340
 which rules the larva itself means 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.920
 if it is flat the usual 5 pins and 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.620
 key then data locks i am very 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.260
 do not recommend to use 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.550
 to protect the car from theft 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.550
 here thanks a lot of clearance
