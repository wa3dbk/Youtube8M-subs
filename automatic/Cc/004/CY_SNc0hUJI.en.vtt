 learn to do this 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.870
 The ball now goes because it matters here. 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.590

 good is not difficult for anyone 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.710
 Can you make it clear, do you need it? 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.350
 practice a little, then the first 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.379
 jazz to my meditation are you going 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.289
 need to hold the letter in this way 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.379
 middle finger is in the center of the load 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.329
 the thumb to stay on top also in the center 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.539
 of the letter with both fingers is in the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.369
 center of the capital is with the finger 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.380
 indicator is what makes the chart turn 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.750
 it gives an impulse to make the letter 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.720
 Turning Mayor makes solid indicator 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.610
 he makes this move and plays in a 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.680
 charter pulling the letter quite 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.610
 ahead and seek to leave only the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.530
 behind 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.560
 so that's what you're going to need to learn 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 doing is enough of the back 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.200
 good only this is clear that the letter will not 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.299
 turn 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.479
 It's good, you'll need to do this. 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.360
 play the card a lot when you play 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.530
 here I have to take the big toe out of 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.350
 the top of the box because it is because the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.860
 she needs to be free she can turn her 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.520
 middle finger down here only secret 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.950
 on here 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.030
 So when you play forward, you 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.160
 pull back and take it off 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.600
 ball forward pulls with the finger 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.410
 indicator down 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.160
 so shots is high mayor 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.640
 if you do not put your big toe 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.300
 letter is not how you run in letter 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.310
 sure you just need to put the truth into 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.500
 patient for you to give a 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.540
 forward momentum to give a boost 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.870
 you pull back 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.460
 towards precipice so that's hope there 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.620
 that you liked is very easy 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.530
 practice that soon you're perfect
