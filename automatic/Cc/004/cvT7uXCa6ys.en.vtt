00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.459
 Hello everyone and welcome back 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.199
 today I would like to talk about a topic that is very close to my heart 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.769
 the music 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.279
 I for years ooh sounds chiavator innervate local small Italy 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.180
 peak concertinos performances 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.539
 two things are always a state 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.990
 the first elah total lack of rest for the Italians 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.220
 but according to that music in Italy 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.620
 for what concerns 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.699
 the first thing is the sense of rhythm 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.400
 it is a fact that Italians 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.790
 we have little or no sense of rhythm 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.210
 the sense of time understood as I find it but which in general does not understand them 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.640
 a lot of music and music 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.030
 reminds me that time ago circulating on youtube it seems to me that there is still the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.410
 first video that the video of the first press conference delio berlusconi day 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.080
 after listening to mascia 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.600
 not that of the big brother that bearded purple bear 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.590
 and also that other one there that mare mandatori mail to salvatore purse in 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.330
 which he said his presence on the stage was not foreseen for gabriella pedals 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.610
 wetting with free citizenship 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.740
 technotalia also spoke the person responsible for the artistic part of the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.670
 demonstration 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.000
 and hear that concerts though 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.140
 stefano miani - symphonic forehead music 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.420
 as like how 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.869
 we hear again stefano ianne will bring back symphonic music in front of symphonic music 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:34.950
 leads 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.229
 let alone type of event 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.130
 but in front of you a million people bring us symphonic music provokes 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.310
 Italians do not distinguish a waltz from a tarantella you bring music 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.620
 symphonic causes 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.250
 but Italians should understand what symphonic music is and then what 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.730
 what is test music 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.130
 but because I did this little update so much this morning 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.930
 but the subject is very serious 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.270
 I occasionally public some more or less stupid crossroads is where I sing 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.640
 because I enjoy doing it 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.029
 emoticon authors ma 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.689
 you have talent you're good 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.479
 why don't you go harry x factor 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.309
 but to do what 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:18.029
 to be judged by simona ventura age mara mayors 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.869
 and bricks but look at that mara maionchi is the one who discovered tiziano ferro 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.439
 minchia dress phil collins 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.010
 for me beware tiziano ferro is to music as berlusconi is modest but 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.019
 these are tastes but the mass of Italians I'm not generalizing 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.260
 said the mass of Italians does not understand that football does not serve to 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.139
 make you become a singer 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.450
 but they only serve to make you become a fashionable phenomenon that allows 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.040
 to the production of the program of making money with the advertising of the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.359
 products you buy after looking at your ad 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.269
 Here I am 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.659
 what are these cuts shoes 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.560
 two out of all friends 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.750
 x factor 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.099
 rules long ago 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.659
 there may also be triumph operation 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.419
 now these gigantic assholes because this is something else not 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:14.719
 are that the television transposition of a poem by giacomo leopardi on Saturday 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.319
 of the village 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.919
 now tell me tutorials you get into things that don't compete for you no no 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.699
 quiet talk in this poem leopards who writes joy that the 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:30.589
 inhabitants of a small village feel good to wait for the day of celebration or rather 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:31.759
 Sunday 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:35.339
 in fact there are so many figures there is the figure of the little woman who comes 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:39.369
 from the dear harvested flowers campaign there are the old lady who is on 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:43.459
 stairs together with the care of bread while spinning and remembering the good times that 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.220
 they were 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.159
 Japan ceramics with a horse party 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.889
 the carpenter and the carpenter and other figures 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.810
 well of course it's not Sunday 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.420
 that the reason for such great joy maps themes as I said just now 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.269
 vitality 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.500
 that the villagers year in the hours before Sunday 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:07.099
 so much so that 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.130
 leopards 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.560
 towards the end is poetry 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.579
 writes 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.889
 this is the most enjoyable day 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.989
 in this theme and joy 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.009
 dimend dispensations we will deliver at the hours 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.620
 time labor each used his thought to return 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.530
 this perfectly applicable concept you promised 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.889
 what I am a singer after who won the tango is not important 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.550
 shoes but what the singer does during such shores is important 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:46.529
 seee dimanche boyfriend misses his mum always if I take spice if 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.569
 blasphemy gets hurt if he argues 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.169
 what the fuck you wanna do 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.210
 the fact shows you well 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.080
 that you all 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.710
 no one excluded 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.500
 all the talent show winners, mind you, I'm talking about talent shows that don't 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.729
 vi reality 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.990
 stefano all the same end 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.540
 they become meteors, they pass like my sheep 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.330
 but unlike the meteors of the 80s 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.130
 that we leave but also a legacy song 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.000
 these do not leave that bank 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.320
 and then two went to finish the various 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.379
 Lyreco 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:23.210
 dennis fantina giulia ottonello antonino spadaccino federico angelucci marco 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.880
 paper 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.879
 pietro a maida of triumph operation 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.469
 to me are 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.219
 they will be famous 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.159
 that's why they changed the name of the program from will be famous to friends 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.189
 because none of them became famous 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:38.900
 sure someone has touched 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.110
 the peak of the success but then it went down 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.259
 precipitevolissimevolmente 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.689
 but what I said the final dream matters to no one 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.839
 because Italians tend to want to be famous at any cost 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.279
 even without knowing how to do it. 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.279
 and programs like big brother proves it 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:03.389
 the saddest thing is that if they don't make it, the big ones can keep small 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:06.919
 with furniture delivery as I sing 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.279
 now I remember that he is 6 years old able to do this 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:24.979
 what a voice 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.599
 I knew how to do it 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.769
 but only to do it because still my voice was not well defined 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.309
 it was what music is called the white voice 

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:37.699
 ie that voice of a child who has not yet reached about a vowel 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.039
 which usually comes around the age of 13 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.460
 now I turn to children but above all to parents 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.490
 if you want your children to be singers 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.649
 do study 

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:55.119
 I couldn't do this crap 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:57.749
 because it happened for grape cultivation 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:00.469
 and above all in this era in which 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:03.129
 new things are always required 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:04.770
 in conclusion 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.479
 where I want to go with this video 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.069
 they are to make people understand that television is not life 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:16.169
 and that everything we have inside this magic box is fake 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.590
 the television stinks 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.699
 distract 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.869
 divert the reality of things 

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:25.990
 think about it 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.930
 thanks to all and see you soon 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.470
