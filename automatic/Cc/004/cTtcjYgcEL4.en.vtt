00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
off the defenders and quite occasionally

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.420 
off the defenders and quite occasionally
as<00:01:13.229> well<00:01:13.380> which<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.619> good<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.130> you'll

exactly breaking away with him he got

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.740 
exactly breaking away with him he got
the<00:01:20.880> finish<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.270> he's<00:01:21.390> finishing<00:01:21.659> his

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the finish and he's finishing his

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.240 
the finish and he's finishing his
finesse<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.320> pretty<00:01:22.530> damn<00:01:22.680> good<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.040> honest

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
finesse is pretty damn good to be honest

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
finesse is pretty damn good to be honest
when<00:01:23.670> his<00:01:24.000> shooting<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.420> general<00:01:24.780> isn't<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
when his shooting in general isn't that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.350 
when his shooting in general isn't that
powerful<00:01:25.680> which<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> bit<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.000> point<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
powerful which was a bit this point I

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
powerful which was a bit this point I
thought<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.600> gonna<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:27.930> powerful<00:01:28.110> but

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
thought was gonna be really powerful but

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.830 
thought was gonna be really powerful but
mainly<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.970> finesse<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.479> finesse<00:01:30.659> was

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
mainly it's finesse it's finesse was

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.660 
mainly it's finesse it's finesse was
pretty<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.229> got<00:01:31.619> no<00:01:31.829> complaints<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pretty good got no complaints about that

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.310 
pretty good got no complaints about that
long<00:01:33.240> shots<00:01:33.540> there<00:01:33.720> wasn't<00:01:33.960> really<00:01:34.049> an<00:01:34.229> issue

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
long shots there wasn't really an issue

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.260 
long shots there wasn't really an issue
they're<00:01:34.680> not<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.920> anything<00:01:35.369> spectacular<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
they're not like anything spectacular I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.880 
they're not like anything spectacular I
think<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.659> talented<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> shot<00:01:37.259> power<00:01:37.439> for

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
think that's talented a shot power for

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.920 
think that's talented a shot power for
them<00:01:38.009> he<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.340> hit<00:01:38.520> them<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.729> target<00:01:39.150> grit<00:01:39.780> run

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
them he will hit them on target grit run

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.270 
them he will hit them on target grit run

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
just wasn't as good as i was expecting I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.969 
just wasn't as good as i was expecting I
figure<00:02:09.869> hyped<00:02:10.080> him<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.319> too<00:02:10.470> much<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.739> my<00:02:10.770> head

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
figure hyped him up too much in my head

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.220 
figure hyped him up too much in my head
but<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.760> was<00:02:11.879> fun

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
but it was fun

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.110 
but it was fun
use<00:02:12.409> another<00:02:12.709> set<00:02:12.769> if<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.129> do<00:02:13.280> use<00:02:13.459> him<00:02:13.640> using

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
use another set if you do use him using

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.089 
use another set if you do use him using
the<00:02:14.239> two<00:02:14.390> strike<00:02:14.659> formation<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.379> haven't<00:02:15.920> spoke

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
the two strike formation I haven't spoke

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.800 
the two strike formation I haven't spoke
about<00:02:16.220> heading<00:02:16.549> yet<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.819> does<00:02:17.000> win<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.390> lot<00:02:17.629> of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
about heading yet it does win a lot of

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.420 
about heading yet it does win a lot of
headers<00:02:18.110> but<00:02:18.290> then<00:02:18.890> they're<00:02:19.159> not<00:02:19.280> very

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
headers but then they're not very

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.160 
headers but then they're not very
powerful<00:02:19.909> but<00:02:20.090> which<00:02:20.180> was<00:02:20.360> their<00:02:20.540> first<00:02:20.840> at

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
powerful but which was their first at

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.110 
powerful but which was their first at
this<00:02:21.319> point<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.739> see<00:02:21.799> six<00:02:22.129> foot<00:02:22.250> two<00:02:22.430> should<00:02:23.090> be

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
this point I see six foot two should be

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.610 
this point I see six foot two should be
scoring<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.510> few<00:02:23.659> more<00:02:23.780> headers<00:02:24.049> in<00:02:24.200> my<00:02:24.319> opinion

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
scoring a few more headers in my opinion

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.080 
scoring a few more headers in my opinion
and<00:02:25.010> he's<00:02:25.129> passing<00:02:25.400> he's<00:02:25.670> passing<00:02:25.879> is

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
and he's passing he's passing is

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.970 
and he's passing he's passing is
