Connor<00:01:27.950> nice<00:01:28.950> try

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.920 

for<00:01:32.100> women<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:32.760> think<00:01:32.790> she<00:01:33.120> represents<00:01:33.690> a<00:01:33.780> kind

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
for women I think she represents a kind

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.420 
for women I think she represents a kind
of<00:01:34.110> empowerment<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.920> yet<00:01:35.160> there's<00:01:35.370> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
of empowerment and yet there's a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
of empowerment and yet there's a
vulnerability<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:36.960> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
vulnerability there because that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
vulnerability there because that
strength<00:01:37.470> comes<00:01:37.800> out<00:01:37.980> of<00:01:38.070> price<00:01:40.580> how<00:01:41.580> can<00:01:41.880> you

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
strength comes out of price how can you
