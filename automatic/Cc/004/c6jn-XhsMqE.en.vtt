00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:01.990
Luke 1.46-55

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.590
Mary's Song of Praise : The Magnificat

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.990
My soul

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.390
doth magnify

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.180
the Lord : 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.510
and my

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.190
spirit hath

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.800
rejoiced

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.200
in God

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:28.490
my Saviour. 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.600
For he

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.190
hath regarded : 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.480
the lowliness

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.300
of his

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.270
handmaiden. 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.970
For behold,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.470
from henceforth : 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.790
all generations

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.670
shall call

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.180
me blessed. 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.670
For he that is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.970
mighty hath

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.400
magnified me : 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.660
and holy

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:26.890
is his Name. 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.670
And his mercy

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.760
is on them

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.580
that fear him : 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.570
throughout

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:09.780
all generations. 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.980
He hath shewed

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.490
strength

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.080
with his arm : 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.880
he hath scattered

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.970
the proud in the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.080
imagination

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.670
of their hearts. 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.470
He hath put

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.650
down the mighty

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.890
from their seat : 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:41.290
and hath exalted

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.680
the humble

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.870
and meek. 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.580
He hath filled

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.680
the hungry

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.590
with good things : 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.780
and the rich

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.090
he hath sent

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:17.280
empty away. 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.640
He remembering

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.580
his mercy

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.840
hath holpen

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.040
his servant

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.460
Israel : 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.060
as he promised

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:48.210
to our forefathers,

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.730
Abraham

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.740
and his seed

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:04.240
for ever. 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.500
Glory be to

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.550
the Father,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.200
and to the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.950
Son : 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.560
and to the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.010
Holy Ghost; 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.730
as it was

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.440
in the beginning,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.180
is now,

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.730
and ever

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.880
shall be : 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.530
world

00:04:33.530 --> 00:05:02.730
without end.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.730
Amen.
