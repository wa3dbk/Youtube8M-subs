00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:10.309
 my friend from the young pan final online 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.320
 week of huge tension for football 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.330
 very specifically for the 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.219
 corinthians corinthians com 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.680
 decide the world club with the 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.019
 chelsea gave after all everyone expected and 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.210
 after all, it makes good pro football corinthians 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.579
 he passed with difficulty on the island 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.839
 chelsea strolled against the monterrey more 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.089
 the moment the two meet 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.429
 different thing is logical that the chelsea 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.300
 has more money than 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.730
 corinthians 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.650
 this means more options for you 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.840
 mess with the players 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.240
 means greater tactical ease 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.200
 that you hire players with the profile 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.970
 what interests you 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.490
 but it is also true that rafa benítez and 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.290
 still looking for the ideal team of 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.790
 chelsea has repeatedly changed the way 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.860
 play in the match against the monterrey was 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.140
 almost a great training for him 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.720
 when this is a defined standard that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670
 may vary without striker was as 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.220
 he played in the final of the liberators but 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.620
 has two basic schemes and has no 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.420
 spare parts at the same level as the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.149
 chelsea that for example gives itself the luxury of 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.310
 leave the ramires on the reservation bank 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.920
 frank lampard are more money for 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.380
 chelsea but more tactical definition by 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.460
 chelsea's strength is 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.409
 indisputable 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.240
 I believe that Corinthians should wait 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.579
 a little adversary that even 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.380
 Are you more comfortable - pressed 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.759
 this in terms of world championship of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.429
 clubs and in the counter attack the corinthians 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.530
 can reach something he longs for 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.929
 we know how hard it is to get to 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.240
 goal of cassio as brand corinthians 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.399
 as well as complicated for any 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.530
 opponents make corinthians goals and 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.590
 expect the Corinthians to play with 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.579
 tranquility despite anxiety with 40 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.859
 games with coolness 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.939
 if this company can face the 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.969
 english team 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.749
 the English leave the slight favoritism only 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.639
 that 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.319
 but Corinthians are in a position to make 

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:56.209
 What São Paulo did was not 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.009
 favorite neither as liverpool nor 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.439
 against milan and against barcelona and 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.020
 managed to win the international 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.819
 that game against ronaldinho's team 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.829
 in barcelona ronaldinho was not 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.259
 favorite won with a gabiru goal the 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.900
 corinthians can do something similar and the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.739
 chelsea is a good team, it's just nothing 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.870
 from another world 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.200
 the young pan will show you everything and 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.629
 This will be the great 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.230
