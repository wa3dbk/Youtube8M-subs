00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Greetings, guys, I am the vine, God, Sunday. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.430
 of emblems and today we are going to make a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.430
 batman accompany me 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.970
 very well let's start with the emblem of 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.150
 batman 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:18.789
 let's start with a black square that 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.039
 occupy basically the whole screen 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.699
 and that same frame we're going to grab and 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.890
 let's have let's duplicate what 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.009
 we duplicate we put a red color like 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.529
 this a transparency like 2021 that 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:36.040
 what you want and we lower this 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.550
 so this same one we duplicated it and what 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.589
 we go down like this and apply it and see it and 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.790
 we do it like that another one because not like that and 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.700
 we leave this like this 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.980
 let's block all our layers 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.649
 since we block them 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.260
 let's put a red circle 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:02.129
 intense red 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.309
 there it is red and we put this one needs 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.509
 good yes 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.509
 if it is very nice 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.010
 let's put it more or less centered 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.950
 let's find the sheet 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.750
 is the black put the we noticed a 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.750
 little bit and we make it big like that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.729
 that there is not much curve from this part 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:37.860
 they see it very well so let's try 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:40.120
 this part so well more or less 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.240
 as we see 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.740
 very well there it looks very good we are going to 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.230
 look for the shape of the triangle there is 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.440
 that you have to do it to your size 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.430
 more or less that is made of the artist as 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.790
 around here and pointy 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.100
 so being the size we want 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.910
 we encourage you with these lines what 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.010
 we put on the line and put it 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.550
 black 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.250
 we duplicate it again and place it 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.800
 more or less around here 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.180
 yes very well and how is the left side 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.710
 as in the back we're going to do the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.280
 triangle a little smaller that 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.740
 then there is more or less the effect is seen 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.540
 of distance they see it if we do not lower it a 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.240
 little bit more a little bit more almost nothing 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.580
 Boys 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.580
 to see there is 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.110
 and now let's do the part of the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.700
 shoulder the name we do it with this 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.060
 eye tool we turn it this way 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.060
 colour 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.830
 in buscar this contabilidad gray 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.830
 if the second 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.670
 and we're going to tilt it a little bit not much 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.630
 and we open it has to be very big 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.510
 Boys 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.490
 is that it's the batman's shoulder what 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.490
 we duplicate what we put black 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.090
 blocking 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.800
 the layers that are using we lowered it a 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.140
 little we extend it from the sides a bit 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.950
 a little less a little less to 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.850
 to see this nice effect as you see 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.740
 as well as if it were light 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.590
 it looks very good 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.600
 now let's grab this little one is 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.840
 in the person environment the smiles 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.840
 we put black obviously we go down a 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.319
 little bit we tilt it and we do 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.280
 great very well we do it very well 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.930
 that looks more or less for it 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.930
 we change to this tool 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.940
 and we put it black 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.370
 we rotate it and that the tips are 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.890
 find in cells in guys there 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.120
 are the tips and now what we do 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.460
 is this good 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.760
 Well, it's not very nice, but 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.959
 journalist in addition or less to the matter that 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.840
 It is at the tips very well 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.690
 it does quite well then what are we going 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.610
 to do is that 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.249
 well treat me a little bit let's put it 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.860
 gray color the two 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.870
 very good of the same gray 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.449
 as we see a little more in front of 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.210
 is 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.830
 well what a nice curve then what 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:44.469
 let's do now is that we're going to put 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.469
 the tool of this wings 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:52.260
 this if we put in black 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:56.110
 but first let's make this happen 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.110
 aligned to more or less 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.530
 that are like the rays of the of the 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.530
 cap 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.060
 very well 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.320
 let's try to align it with the best 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.320
 we may not always be perfect 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.370
 it does not matter if they spread does not matter 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.490
 that is not perfect the effect is going to 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.490
 watch 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.590
 this if we put it black 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.310
 and what is the color of black we are going to put 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.850
 a square 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.850
 here 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:42.590
 that has a small angle 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.240
 and we're going to fill in all the space that 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.560
 we missed 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:53.080
 everything everything guys we put black what 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.080
 we put under the wing 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:01.600
 what good is going now we are going to put this 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:05.490
 tool here 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:09.330
 we put it gray we rotate it a bit 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:15.630
 and let's put it up to the plate 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:15.630
 here is the batman head light 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.190
 very good there it looks pretty good 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:27.120
 nothing else that has to go behind d 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:29.560
 from this little ear so let's do it 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.130
 here we go down 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.820
 but we also lower this hand sorry 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:40.389
 sorry was the other there is and look 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:44.680
 how the volume looks best and finally 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:49.360
 the eyes that are this tool let's 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.689
 to rotate it a bit we make it small no 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.300
 much 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:54.000
 ah 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.449
 but 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.949
 there we are duplicating it 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.949
 it looks really weird the batman there 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.880
 we do it the mirror effect what 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.780
 we turn again 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.520
 and the same reasoning of this thing of 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.030
 the farthest you have to do it more 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.030
 small 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:23.039
 more by a lot is little and well guys there 

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:26.540
 is basically what is the batman that 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:30.400
 they have asked, I hope you liked it a lot 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:33.009
 you can see that nothing is complicated 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.490
 we recorded it because if it is not lost and 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.490
 remember 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.980
 and use the guys impress their 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.020
 enemies with the knight of the night 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.300
 remember to visit social networks 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.730
 guys subscribe if they give away or like 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.530
