this<00:00:05.850> will<00:00:06.030> be<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.150> short<00:00:06.420> video<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.780> changing

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:07.380 
this will be a short video on changing

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.129 
this will be a short video on changing
the<00:00:07.470> gears<00:00:07.710> in<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.980> singer<00:00:08.570> 750<00:00:09.570> sewing<00:00:09.870> machine

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the gears in a singer 750 sewing machine

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.170 
the gears in a singer 750 sewing machine
it<00:00:10.290> goes<00:00:10.440> across<00:00:10.740> about<00:00:10.980> 50<00:00:11.430> different<00:00:11.580> models

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
it goes across about 50 different models

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.810 
it goes across about 50 different models
slight<00:00:13.080> modifications<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:14.070> another<00:00:14.430> model

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
slight modifications for another model

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.330 
slight modifications for another model
but<00:00:15.000> basically<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.020> gear<00:00:16.200> changing<00:00:16.680> process

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
but basically the gear changing process

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.040 
but basically the gear changing process
is<00:00:17.520> all<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> same<00:00:18.000> first<00:00:18.690> we're<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
is all the same first we're going to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.330 
is all the same first we're going to
take<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.410> covers<00:00:19.740> off<00:00:19.860> so<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
take the covers off so you have a

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.060 
take the covers off so you have a
fundamental<00:00:21.030> idea<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.900> how<00:00:22.019> to<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.500> this

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
fundamental idea on how to do that this

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.990 
fundamental idea on how to do that this
is<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.310> top<00:00:23.519> cover<00:00:23.849> one<00:00:24.509> screw<00:00:25.789> move<00:00:26.789> that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
is the top cover one screw move that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.220 
is the top cover one screw move that
down<00:00:28.339> take<00:00:29.339> it<00:00:29.490> off

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
down take it off

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.900 
down take it off
second<00:00:31.230> cover<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.949> face<00:00:32.160> cover<00:00:32.490> we're

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
second cover is the face cover we're

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.000 
second cover is the face cover we're
going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> take<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.450> off<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:34.500> need<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.860> in

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
going to take it off we need to get in

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.650 
going to take it off we need to get in
here<00:00:35.220> to<00:00:35.310> loosen<00:00:35.490> timing<00:00:36.030> belt<00:00:36.210> pulley<00:00:36.420> so

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
here to loosen timing belt pulley so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.490 
here to loosen timing belt pulley so
there's<00:00:36.840> no<00:00:37.940> strain<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.329> horizontal<00:00:40.289> gear

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
