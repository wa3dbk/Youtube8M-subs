00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.660
 hi the gamer it's hack so 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.780
 today I 'm going to make you a little 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.090
 computer tutorial so it's a small 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.520
 tutorial not very complicated but who will 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.140
 serve only a few people to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.960
 a person especially well targeted so my 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.820
 mate victor so I can not show you 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.949
 quickly how to properly clean a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.700
 computer on windows 8 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.290
 because we will say that windows 8 a little more 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.239
 boring that windows 7 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.210
 at least you see I reinstalled the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.070
 windows 7 bar but I'm lazy 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.140
 you how was 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.180
 complicated so I immediately have you 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 so start the first thing to have 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.430
 what is good to see is ccleaner 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.800
 so it's really a great thing for 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.289
 clean your computer from typing on you 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.870
 the nerves on your browser 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.090
 take a link and download it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.400
 via a drinking link it does not work 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.240
 take another nothing and his land is 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.000
 so what is in a program I believe 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.380
 that's all so you open it well 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.570
 sure my mouse do not want them 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.369
 if you have the cleaner so here you 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.040
 can check all the options that 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.720
 you want to erase or clean in 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.850
 your browser and windows explorer 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.600
 so checked what did you do well 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.400
 and not good 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 the nice ogc app wise and premiums 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.360
 also a lot of stuff so see 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.229
 so you do analyze it will analyze 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.600
 any case too much on your pc so 230 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.850
 emoa deleted it's already pretty good 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.000
 so it's a little too much oppressed of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.530
 tatts searches useless so that's okay 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.090
 not you take a lot of space in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.880
 more but it's already good 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.649
 so register here that saves you in 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 made the product errors of our 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.280
 computers so I advise you 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.130
 you checked all did search the is 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.590
 rare so me it's been a while 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.280
 the finer so here I have an error 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.079
 actually like I have no mistakes and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.079
 makes you correct them back so 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.509
 it's corrected with a tool you can d 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.039
 install programs so 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.170
 is always programmed for example I 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.790
 do not know if you install minecraft and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.909
 that you will like +1 you can all 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.069
 uninstall so you see so if 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.470
 you have stuff that does not serve you 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.530
 you can delete them but 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:31.530
 pay attention for example to while 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:34.440
 I find it very useful programs 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.000
 to pc like here nvidia all this if you 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.500
 delete it pulls out to do some 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.940
 small problems in your computer 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:46.290
 because ben is still the thing 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.340
 main so separately for example I 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.319
 can eat more need of 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.379
 staercke menu I click on I 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.349
 uninstalls and it's good so start 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.970
 English sacem that allows you to 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.590
 look at all the programs that are 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.239
 activated during startup you see 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.470
 I really do not have much 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.329
 I advise you to really uncheck 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.500
 all the programs that serve you to 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.049
 anything you see here I was 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.940
 deactivated I can even still news 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:16.160
 and that yes I can the news and that's it 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.569
 here 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.519
 the planned tasks good me I you 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.680
 advise to quibble not too much 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.400
 so as you have made it activated 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.930
 here it is here so there you see there will be 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.010
 far fewer programs activated at 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.720
 start up and that will allow you to win 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.550
 power and make me rowed 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.000
 your pc / mac pc restore 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.740
 I think it's for a bit 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.180
 reconfigure the computer in which 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.420
 phase hours of dif it's to remove 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.080
 all cases on otherwise the options I 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.370
 do not see too much apart 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.110
 some small cock settings and 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.940
 so that was so I have women 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.070
 who can ride so it's really not 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.770
 a big fat you turn but hey it's 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.150
 more for a little show you a little 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.740
 how do we clean just for a little 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.960
 make room and sometimes it can 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.950
 really help other people 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.650
 little things like that 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.690
 so now you go to make a 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.740
 little disk cleaning you go 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.000
 go on the file explorer you 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.100
 get off you go in the computer 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.840
 you take your drive is your has 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.230
 says what do you use you do 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.170
 disk cleanup property option 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.790
 so that's the difference I'm going to 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:33.330
 show that it takes a little time that 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.330
 his load 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.100
 so here you want I already have 1.3 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.900
 me it's not huge and so you checked 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.730
 all here you do 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.890
 ok that puts you deletes the files 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.020
 you did to remove it but chevry 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.970
 also a bunch of little useless things 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.280
 of course I do it almost all 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.770
 the days so so you make them a 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.630
 second time so and you go in 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.190
 you see 0 and delete 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.460
 you go in clean the files 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.900
 system so me it's going fast as I 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.700
 do it often but for the people who the 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.310
 do not often it can take a little 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.630
 more time so that's going to clean up the 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.910
 system files too as I'll you 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.770
 say I am not an expert in 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.169
 but it can sometimes help 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.730
 a few people at least that see a 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.290
 little how to clean the pc if it is 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.310
 really stuffed for people 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.960
 who do not know too much about 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.410
 data processing 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.700
 it's always interesting you see a 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.690
 4th in hockey I 'm caught but that's it 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.140
 she shows you after one last 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.140
 things to do 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.560
 so that's it's over 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.760
 so I can show you something else 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.250
 you go in your panel of 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.960
 control so here if you have the menu if 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.590
 never you have not you go here on 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.120
 your board tells you that it tells you 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.440
 somewhere here's a panel of 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.100
 configuration you type tools you 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.500
 click on it 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.200
 you are looking for fragmented and optimize 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.540
 the discs you can close the rest 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.860
 you took the relevant discs so 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.750
 i will take the us disk and you 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.270
 done analyze so that's going to take a 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.910
 little time to analyze 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.840
 that's where it's fragmented 0% but 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.760
 for people who really love 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.560
 a lot it could be fragmented to at 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.900
 10% 20% that's a lot 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.070
 so when it's up to 20% wise to put 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.050
 very long to do because already 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.230
 ate 5% it puts me blind 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.820
 so if I can for example realize my 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.400
 external hard drive even though I believe that 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.790
 it's going to do nothing at all so you 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.050
 see so here's doing it well and 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.490
 from time to time only make one 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.440
 once a month it can be useful 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.170
 no i think i did more or less 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.010
 the tour must of course remove 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:47.620
 the sound history of his browser 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.000
 corbeil and well thought out ath rivals 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.430
 little things no matter how 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.530
 to find your stuff and so on 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.140
 so I think that's all I 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.490
 bigger thing to tell you so 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.410
 I hope it helped you a few 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.450
 people so as I say I am 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.200
 not a computer pro but hey 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.360
 can always help 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:08.550
 so here is I tell you to the 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.550
 next and wear well
