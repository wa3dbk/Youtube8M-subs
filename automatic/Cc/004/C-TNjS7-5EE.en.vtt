00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
up there about a couple of different

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:54.649 
up there about a couple of different
cars<00:01:46.120> is<00:01:47.120> that<00:01:49.360> or<00:01:50.360> does<00:01:51.110> brake<00:01:51.440> release

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.620 

and<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.649> some<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.009> these<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:57.119> only<00:01:57.390> reason

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
and on some of these the only reason

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.789 
and on some of these the only reason
sometimes<00:01:57.930> I'm<00:01:58.079> pressing<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.710> not

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
sometimes I'm pressing it and it's not

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.889 
sometimes I'm pressing it and it's not
working<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.520> because<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.149> has<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.539> go<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
working is because it has to go to the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.710 
working is because it has to go to the
track<00:02:01.200> by<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.039> tracks<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.789> it<00:02:03.240> will

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
track by the tracks like this it will

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.249 
track by the tracks like this it will
sometimes<00:02:03.960> go<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.470> wrong<00:02:04.619> track<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
sometimes go to the wrong track the

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.199 
sometimes go to the wrong track the
frequency<00:02:07.259> or<00:02:07.320> whatever<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.099> five<00:02:08.640> credit<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
frequency or whatever and five credit to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.050 
frequency or whatever and five credit to
Idol

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.970 

so<00:02:16.060> that's<00:02:16.180> how<00:02:16.299> you<00:02:16.360> do<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.569> but<00:02:16.989> if<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.769> buy

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
so that's how you do that but if you buy

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.490 
so that's how you do that but if you buy
a<00:02:20.159> different<00:02:21.159> kind<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.879> engine<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.390> know

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
a different kind of engine you know

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.600 
a different kind of engine you know
Atlas<00:02:24.629> tato<00:02:25.739> rod<00:02:26.739> reel<00:02:26.920> imitated<00:02:27.340> one<00:02:27.519> of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
Atlas tato rod reel imitated one of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.720 
Atlas tato rod reel imitated one of
those<00:02:27.790> engines<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:28.690> sound<00:02:29.079> I<00:02:29.829> forgot<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
those engines with sound I forgot the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.080 
those engines with sound I forgot the
name<00:02:30.819> of<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.030> company<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:32.409> they<00:02:32.590> sell

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
name of a company but they sell

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.699 
name of a company but they sell
controllers<00:02:34.090> like<00:02:34.209> this<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.409> can<00:02:35.560> buy

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
controllers like this and you can buy

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.319 
controllers like this and you can buy
one<00:02:35.920> off<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.370> forgot<00:02:36.700> their<00:02:36.879> name<00:02:37.060> I

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
one off of that I forgot their name I

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.809 
one off of that I forgot their name I
think<00:02:37.989> we're<00:02:38.200> gonna<00:02:38.290> do<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.590> with<00:02:38.709> this<00:02:38.859> the

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
think we're gonna do that with this the

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.500 
think we're gonna do that with this the
spectrum<00:02:40.329> I'm<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.659> add<00:02:40.750> sound<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.170> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
spectrum I'm going to add sound to it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.069 
spectrum I'm going to add sound to it
and<00:02:43.829> isolation<00:02:45.269> with<00:02:46.269> isolating<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.930> could

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
and isolation with isolating you could

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.289 
and isolation with isolating you could
do<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.349> in<00:02:50.980> one<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.370> two<00:02:51.459> ways<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.120> isolate

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
do it in one of two ways you can isolate

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.559 
do it in one of two ways you can isolate
both<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.200> rails<00:02:53.579> but<00:02:54.579> that's<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.819> pain<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:55.540> I

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
both the rails but that's a pain so I

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.780 
both the rails but that's a pain so I
always<00:02:55.989> just<00:02:56.109> isolate<00:02:56.560> one<00:02:56.769> so<00:02:57.609> what<00:02:57.700> you're

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
always just isolate one so what you're

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.970 
always just isolate one so what you're
gonna<00:02:57.879> do<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.420> put<00:02:58.629> regular<00:02:58.959> couplers<00:02:59.319> on<00:02:59.650> one

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
gonna do is put regular couplers on one

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.660 
gonna do is put regular couplers on one
round<00:03:00.209> all<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.299> way<00:03:01.359> down<00:03:01.510> and<00:03:01.750> then<00:03:02.739> on<00:03:03.099> this

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
round all the way down and then on this

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.490 
round all the way down and then on this
rail<00:03:03.970> you're<00:03:04.420> going<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.599> isolation<00:03:05.170> what

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
rail you're going to isolation what

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.860 
rail you're going to isolation what
everyone<00:03:05.799> Eisley<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:07.180> have<00:03:07.299> to<00:03:07.389> put<00:03:07.540> one

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
everyone Eisley you have to put one

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.589 
everyone Eisley you have to put one
rubber<00:03:08.049> here<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.650> rubber<00:03:09.190> connector<00:03:09.519> go<00:03:10.420> down

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
rubber here a rubber connector go down

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.910 
rubber here a rubber connector go down
until<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.989> know<00:03:11.079> what<00:03:11.200> your<00:03:11.349> hobby<00:03:11.500> shop<00:03:11.769> and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
until you know what your hobby shop and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.099 
until you know what your hobby shop and
buy<00:03:12.010> rubber<00:03:12.250> connector<00:03:12.750> put<00:03:13.750> one<00:03:13.870> there<00:03:13.900> and

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
buy rubber connector put one there and

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.920 
buy rubber connector put one there and
then<00:03:14.680> however<00:03:15.639> far<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.090> want<00:03:16.209> isolator<00:03:16.720> like

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
then however far you want isolator like

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.210 
then however far you want isolator like
if<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.139> just<00:03:17.230> wanted<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.530> isolate<00:03:17.620> from<00:03:17.980> here<00:03:18.099> to

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
if I just wanted to isolate from here to

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.479 
if I just wanted to isolate from here to
there<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.579> I'd<00:03:18.940> pop<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.510> put<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.019> man<00:03:20.459> but<00:03:21.459> I

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
there and I'd pop this put one man but I

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.740 
there and I'd pop this put one man but I
put<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.849> all<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.030> way<00:03:22.120> down<00:03:22.150> here<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:22.629> this

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
put it all the way down here to this

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.759 
put it all the way down here to this
switch<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.349> all<00:03:23.560> this<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:23.859> isolated<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:26.650> can

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
switch so all this is isolated you can

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.670 
switch so all this is isolated you can
use<00:03:26.889> momentary<00:03:27.459> switches<00:03:27.730> or<00:03:28.329> you<00:03:29.169> can<00:03:29.379> use

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
use momentary switches or you can use

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.259 
use momentary switches or you can use
any<00:03:30.010> other<00:03:30.069> switch<00:03:30.519> but<00:03:30.699> I<00:03:30.730> just<00:03:30.910> use<00:03:31.060> light

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
any other switch but I just use light

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.479 
any other switch but I just use light
switches<00:03:31.540> but<00:03:32.470> if<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.829> use<00:03:32.949> light<00:03:33.190> switches

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
switches but if you use light switches

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.550 
switches but if you use light switches
you<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:34.239> only<00:03:34.599> do<00:03:34.840> one<00:03:34.870> because<00:03:35.379> there's

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
you have to only do one because there's

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.640 
you have to only do one because there's
only<00:03:35.650> two<00:03:36.190> screws<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.359> one<00:03:37.540> screw<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.410> have<00:03:38.530> to

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
only two screws in one screw you have to

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.670 
only two screws in one screw you have to
run<00:03:38.859> a<00:03:38.889> wire<00:03:39.220> from<00:03:39.340> your<00:03:39.549> transformer<00:03:40.680> and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
run a wire from your transformer and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.379 
run a wire from your transformer and
this<00:03:41.829> is<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.099> part<00:03:42.340> where<00:03:42.819> it<00:03:42.849> gets<00:03:42.940> tricky

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
this is the part where it gets tricky

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.589 
this is the part where it gets tricky
because<00:03:43.419> you<00:03:43.690> have<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:44.220> there's<00:03:45.220> two<00:03:45.599> screws

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
because you have to there's two screws

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.759 
because you have to there's two screws
on<00:03:46.780> your<00:03:46.930> transformer<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:50.530> run<00:03:50.739> the

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
on your transformer that you run the

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.800 
on your transformer that you run the
track<00:03:51.069> from<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.699> you<00:03:51.940> have<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.150> find<00:03:52.389> out<00:03:52.540> what

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
track from and you have to find out what

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.289 
track from and you have to find out what
screw<00:03:53.199> runs<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:53.859> track<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:54.909> you<00:03:55.030> have<00:03:55.150> to

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
screw runs to that track so you have to

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.399 
screw runs to that track so you have to
run<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.690> right<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:57.430> right<00:03:57.639> wire<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.319> one<00:03:59.319> of

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
run the right the right wire and one of

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.819 
run the right the right wire and one of
the<00:03:59.470> two<00:03:59.620> screws<00:03:59.949> to<00:04:00.250> your<00:04:00.879> track<00:04:01.239> or<00:04:02.139> no<00:04:02.260> no<00:04:02.799> I

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
the two screws to your track or no no I

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:03.569 
the two screws to your track or no no I
think<00:04:02.949> that<00:04:03.220> back

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
think that back

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.539 
think that back
one<00:04:03.970> other<00:04:04.090> year<00:04:04.329> you<00:04:04.750> do<00:04:04.959> one<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.310> has<00:04:06.370> to

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
one other year you do one but it has to

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.250 
one other year you do one but it has to
be<00:04:06.639> the<00:04:06.730> same<00:04:06.849> as<00:04:07.030> same<00:04:07.510> as<00:04:07.540> your<00:04:07.750> track<00:04:07.989> but

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
be the same as same as your track but

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.390 
be the same as same as your track but
you<00:04:08.290> run<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.859> wire<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.930> screw<00:04:11.379> one<00:04:12.310> of

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
you run the wire to this screw one of

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.399 
you run the wire to this screw one of
the<00:04:12.489> screws<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:13.060> then<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:13.959> run<00:04:14.139> the<00:04:14.260> other

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
the screws and then you run the other

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.039 
the screws and then you run the other
wire<00:04:14.739> from<00:04:15.220> your<00:04:15.430> track<00:04:15.699> to<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.539> other<00:04:16.720> screw

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
wire from your track to the other screw

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.319 
wire from your track to the other screw
so<00:04:17.260> you<00:04:17.289> have<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.680> wire<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.699> one<00:04:18.940> is<00:04:19.120> for<00:04:19.269> the

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
so you have to wire this one is for the

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.550 
so you have to wire this one is for the
transformer

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
transformer

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.040 
transformer
this<00:04:20.680> one<00:04:20.859> is<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.070> track<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:22.630> they're<00:04:22.870> off

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
this one is to the track so they're off

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.180 
this one is to the track so they're off
right<00:04:23.260> now<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:24.220> if<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:24.760> was<00:04:24.940> sure<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:25.780> one

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
right now and if I was sure this one

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.210 
right now and if I was sure this one
does<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.780> NS<00:04:28.780> SD<00:04:29.350> for<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:29.770> if<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.950> turn<00:04:30.130> it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
does and NS SD for you so if I turn it

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.300 
does and NS SD for you so if I turn it
on<00:04:32.880> they<00:04:33.880> start<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.240> go<00:04:34.590> if<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.710> turn<00:04:35.919> this<00:04:36.130> one

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
on they start to go if I turn this one

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.510 
on they start to go if I turn this one
on

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.100 

these<00:04:39.520> engines<00:04:39.730> start<00:04:40.150> come<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.810> that's<00:04:43.960> how

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
these engines start come so that's how

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.590 
these engines start come so that's how
you<00:04:44.169> do<00:04:44.320> that<00:04:44.470> if<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:44.740> have<00:04:44.830> any<00:04:45.010> questions

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
you do that if you have any questions

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.970 
you do that if you have any questions
and<00:04:46.600> don't<00:04:46.630> put<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.139> down<00:04:47.169> in<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.500> comments

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
and don't put it down in the comments

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.500 
and don't put it down in the comments
I'm<00:04:48.870> gonna<00:04:49.870> be<00:04:50.020> isolating<00:04:50.730> this<00:04:51.730> track<00:04:52.090> same

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
I'm gonna be isolating this track same

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.440 
I'm gonna be isolating this track same
as<00:04:52.660> I<00:04:52.750> did<00:04:52.810> those<00:04:53.440> NS<00:04:54.040> s<00:04:54.220> isolate<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.240> same

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
as I did those NS s isolate the same

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:02.909 
as I did those NS s isolate the same
track<00:04:56.940> just<00:04:57.940> had<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> derailment<00:05:00.930> this<00:05:01.930> Boxster

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
track just had a derailment this Boxster

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:11.370 
track just had a derailment this Boxster
or<00:05:03.190> this<00:05:03.460> hopper<00:05:03.850> came<00:05:04.030> on<00:05:05.729> put<00:05:06.729> that<00:05:06.790> back<00:05:07.120> on

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.020 

Oh<00:05:11.790> trying<00:05:12.790> to<00:05:12.910> think<00:05:13.150> what<00:05:13.300> else<00:05:15.030> probably

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
Oh trying to think what else probably
