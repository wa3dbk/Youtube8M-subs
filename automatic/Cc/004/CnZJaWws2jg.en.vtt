00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.030 
there is still grass is all the way down
there<00:01:40.540> which<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.200> know<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.590> reckon<00:01:41.920> I<00:01:41.980> could

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
there which I know I reckon I could

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.230 
there which I know I reckon I could
probably<00:01:42.280> see<00:01:42.490> down<00:01:42.640> there<00:01:42.790> of<00:01:42.880> my<00:01:43.000> SWAT

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
probably see down there of my SWAT

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.840 
probably see down there of my SWAT
lights<00:01:43.420> but<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.280> then<00:01:45.430> there's<00:01:45.610> obviously

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
lights but and then there's obviously

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.490 
lights but and then there's obviously
grass<00:01:46.120> here<00:01:46.330> but<00:01:46.540> that's<00:01:46.720> that's<00:01:46.960> kind<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.380> a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
grass here but that's that's kind of a

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.700 
grass here but that's that's kind of a
rock<00:01:47.680> wall<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:49.780> know<00:01:49.870> we'll<00:01:50.440> see<00:01:50.470> if

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
rock wall so I don't know we'll see if

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.280 
rock wall so I don't know we'll see if
we<00:01:50.830> see<00:01:51.010> anything<00:01:51.220> but<00:01:51.430> often<00:01:51.730> often<00:01:52.060> walk<00:01:52.510> the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
we see anything but often often walk the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.470 
we see anything but often often walk the
other<00:01:53.320> two<00:01:53.650> times<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.250> grass<00:01:54.430> has<00:01:54.700> been<00:01:54.760> cut<00:01:55.000> I

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
other two times the grass has been cut I

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.970 
other two times the grass has been cut I
haven't<00:01:56.080> seen<00:01:56.200> anything<00:01:56.440> for<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.800> while

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
haven't seen anything for a while

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.850 
haven't seen anything for a while
because<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.640> so<00:01:58.030> i<00:01:58.300> guess<00:01:59.080> i<00:01:59.230> can<00:01:59.410> probably

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
because of it so i guess i can probably

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.110 
because of it so i guess i can probably
sleep<00:02:00.100> better<00:02:00.130> for<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.580> next<00:02:00.610> few<00:02:00.970> months

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
sleep better for the next few months

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.530 
sleep better for the next few months
