00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
sticks out a little wider I think it's I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
sticks out a little wider I think it's I
think<00:00:57.090> it's<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.390> another<00:00:57.660> inch<00:00:58.079> inch<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
think it's like another inch inch and a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.420 
think it's like another inch inch and a
half<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:59.070> sticks<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:03.030> I'm<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.300> happy

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
half it sticks out so so I'm very happy

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.740 
half it sticks out so so I'm very happy
it'll<00:01:05.430> probably<00:01:05.519> handle<00:01:06.090> better<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.600> won't

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it'll probably handle better it won't

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.000 
it'll probably handle better it won't
flip<00:01:07.140> over<00:01:07.350> as<00:01:07.680> easy<00:01:09.170> even<00:01:10.170> though<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.530> stock

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
flip over as easy even though the stock

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.410 
flip over as easy even though the stock
version<00:01:11.280> didn't<00:01:12.000> flip<00:01:12.210> over<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.659> much<00:01:17.420> there

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
version didn't flip over as much there
