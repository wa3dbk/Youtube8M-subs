earlier that I was going to do that but
yeah<00:05:41.450> I<00:05:41.660> decided<00:05:42.140> to<00:05:42.380> change<00:05:42.620> things<00:05:42.740> up<00:05:43.100> so

yeah I decided to change things up so
I'm<00:05:44.060> just<00:05:44.270> kind<00:05:44.390> of<00:05:44.479> go<00:05:44.630> with<00:05:44.660> it<00:05:44.810> if<00:05:45.020> you<00:05:45.080> don't

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
I'm just kind of go with it if you don't

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.950 
I'm just kind of go with it if you don't
like<00:05:45.289> something<00:05:45.410> you<00:05:45.770> can<00:05:45.919> change<00:05:46.220> it<00:05:46.340> easily

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
like something you can change it easily

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.230 
like something you can change it easily
now<00:05:47.960> I'm<00:05:48.289> going<00:05:48.530> to<00:05:48.650> take<00:05:48.800> a<00:05:48.979> red<00:05:49.460> lip<00:05:49.940> liner

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.770 
it's more of a pinky red
I<00:05:54.160> decided<00:05:55.160> to<00:05:55.250> do<00:05:55.340> a<00:05:55.370> smaller<00:05:55.820> lip<00:05:56.180> shape<00:05:56.510> and

I decided to do a smaller lip shape and

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.200 
I decided to do a smaller lip shape and
it's<00:05:56.990> supposed<00:05:57.200> to<00:05:57.380> be<00:05:57.710> inspired<00:05:58.160> by<00:05:58.310> dollops

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
it's supposed to be inspired by dollops

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.650 
it's supposed to be inspired by dollops
so<00:05:59.780> I'm<00:06:00.710> not<00:06:01.010> going<00:06:01.370> to<00:06:01.490> line<00:06:01.760> my<00:06:01.790> entire<00:06:02.300> lip

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:11.830
