00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.810
 and hello everyone dear viewers and 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.270
 my channel followers 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.130
 many play kc go set like this 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.720
 How does this system work? 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.600
 ranks in counter strike 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.850
 there are already some theories in the community 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.990
 about this and now I will bring them 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.540
 you first theory is a general theory 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.130
 increase of ranks let's say you have a frame 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.229
 gimme a davit hitherto ver 3 you play 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.970
 against the same north you 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.850
 the next round you need to assume 100 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.430
 points for winning you earn 25 points 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.400
 which means you will be promoted 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.110
 need to win 4 such rollers in a row if 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.170
 you lose that total points 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.200
 25 points are taken away this explains what 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.140
 winning 10 rink in a row but losing 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.050
 in one rink you won't get your 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.440
 new rank i.e. you are charged 25 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.570
 points 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.400
 then taken away 25 then again 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.800
 waddled over then taken away again 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.570
 so in a circle so to quickly 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.050
 You can not upgrade your new rank 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.050
 lose 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.890
 2 cigarette theory bonus points 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.720
 it lies in the fact that if you 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.310
 win the match and play it on 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.500
 first place in the plus 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.310
 that is, it is about 30 heads 5 assists 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.100
 and 10 deaths 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.929
 then you bonus 25 charge 10 points 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.119
 There is generally he adds me 25 points 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.190
 deny it explains quickly and raise 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.350
 and ranks in some gorkom may be 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.200
 so you lost the rink from you shot 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.450
 not 25 points but also 10 but there are such 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.910
 cases when you have nothing you can 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.450
 as well as raise and lower it too 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.950
 explained by the theory of bonus points 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.410
 the third theory is this theory fast 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.390
 of august if you are silver and play party 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.400
 with friends Kalash or golden eagle mid u 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.100
 you can very quickly apnut to Kalash 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.110
 if you win all the rinks in a row 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.490
 and you will come first then you will be 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.580
 do not charge for 10 points 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.610
 default 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.740
 and let's say a pack of 30 and that means then 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.800
 what's one rink for you to brush on not 25 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.890
 points in as much as 55 that is just for 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.320
 two rollers you mark the whole rank 4 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.390
 theory is this theory of resetting the rank if you 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.370
 played sitting in the tub then all the points for 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.370
 won the game and will not be charged 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.470
 if the cheater was still with you in the lobby then 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.150
 if you raise this increased rank 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.040
 you will not be counted but maybe the opposite 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.470
 lower from the initial rank 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.880
 proof of that hint 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.890
 global and the next day its 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.360
 automatically made the second golden eagle we 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.050
 They said that lowered due to 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.280
 go was a cheater well and finally 5 theory 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.500
 this calibration theory 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.420
 as the max community says 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.700
 level after calibration the big star and 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.850
 let's let him get you 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.190
 you need to win 300 points in 10 games in 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.350
 Each victory will earn you 25 points and + 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.240
 bonus for the first place that means you 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.980
 need to win 10 rink in a row and be 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.450
 ten times in the first place after playing all 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.370
 10 how this theory ends 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.800
