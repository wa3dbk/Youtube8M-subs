00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
terms of auto focusing time as you can

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.719 
terms of auto focusing time as you can
imagine<00:01:26.869> but<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.189> really<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> type

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
imagine but this is not really the type

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
something like that you'd be much better

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.620 
something like that you'd be much better
off<00:01:36.990> using<00:01:37.829> something<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.610> something<00:01:39.540> like

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
off using something like something like

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.620

a<00:01:39.720> 24<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.350> 70<00:01:40.770> or<00:01:40.950> 72<00:01:41.729> 200<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.390> give<00:01:42.540> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
a 24 to 70 or 72 200 that will give you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.249 
a 24 to 70 or 72 200 that will give you
faster<00:01:42.960> focus<00:01:43.259> speed<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:45.119> course<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.960> all<00:01:46.140> of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
faster focus speed of course like all of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.950

it's<00:01:56.399> gonna<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.579> pretty<00:01:56.759> much<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.030> like

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
it's gonna be pretty much just like

it's gonna be pretty much just like
those<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.049> be<00:01:58.200> something

this lens doesn't focus quite as well

light conditions but once again you know

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.290 
light conditions but once again you know
low<00:02:40.990> light<00:02:41.200> focus<00:02:41.560> speed<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.970> more<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.240> a

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
low light focus speed this is more of a

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.270 
low light focus speed this is more of a
specialty<00:02:43.750> lens<00:02:43.990> this<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.200> not<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.010> sort<00:02:45.220> of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
specialty lens this is not the sort of

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.260 
specialty lens this is not the sort of
lens<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.670> would<00:02:45.760> use<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:47.040> extremely

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
lens that you would use for extremely

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.840 
lens that you would use for extremely
extremely<00:02:49.270> low<00:02:49.480> light<00:02:49.630> action<00:02:49.810> or<00:02:50.050> anything

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
and as I said before this isn't the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.890 
and as I said before this isn't the
sharpest<00:02:56.620> lens<00:02:56.860> but<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:58.030> bokeh<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:58.570> just

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
sharpest lens but that bokeh is just

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.330 
sharpest lens but that bokeh is just
outstanding

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
outstanding

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
it's not something you know I look at it

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.870 
it's not something you know I look at it
on<00:03:29.290> paper<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.920> honestly<00:03:30.400> I'm<00:03:30.550> not<00:03:30.730> that

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
on paper and honestly I'm not that

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.390 
on paper and honestly I'm not that
impressed<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.570> know<00:03:31.660> it's<00:03:31.840> it's<00:03:32.800> comprised

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
and of course just like all other lenses

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.170

let's<00:04:03.790> see<00:04:03.940> let's<00:04:04.150> go<00:04:04.510> ahead<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.780> look<00:04:04.840> a

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
let's see let's go ahead and look a

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.949 
let's see let's go ahead and look a
little<00:04:05.049> closer<00:04:05.320> here<00:04:05.650> so<00:04:06.630> there<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.690> have<00:04:07.780> it

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
little closer here so there you have it

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.699 
little closer here so there you have it
fairly<00:04:08.590> standard<00:04:09.070> fare<00:04:09.989> manual<00:04:10.989> -<00:04:11.170> automatic

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
fairly standard fare manual - automatic

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.860 
fairly standard fare manual - automatic
and<00:04:12.070> manual<00:04:12.160> focus<00:04:12.610> there

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.060 

it<00:04:16.470> has<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.949> larger<00:04:18.320> lineup<00:04:19.320> dot<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:19.859> like

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
it has the larger lineup dot just like

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.770 
it has the larger lineup dot just like
all<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.519> new<00:04:20.669> or<00:04:20.820> nikon<00:04:21.180> lenses<00:04:21.449> do<00:04:21.600> right

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
all the new or nikon lenses do right

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.090 
all the new or nikon lenses do right
there<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.530> course<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.830> has<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.949> little

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
there and of course it has a little

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.670 
there and of course it has a little
little<00:04:23.610> gasket<00:04:23.760> back<00:04:24.060> there<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:24.680> nothing

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
little gasket back there so nothing

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.659 
little gasket back there so nothing
particularly<00:04:26.130> special<00:04:27.949> but<00:04:28.949> yeah<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.340> using

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
particularly special but yeah and using

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.800 
particularly special but yeah and using
this<00:04:29.760> lens<00:04:30.000> more<00:04:30.330> today<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:32.490> know<00:04:32.610> for<00:04:33.570> still

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
this lens more today you know for still

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.050 
this lens more today you know for still
photographs<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:36.360> still<00:04:36.750> think<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:38.060> don't

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
photographs I I still think that I don't

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.000 
photographs I I still think that I don't
think<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.510> this<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.780> bad<00:04:40.139> lens<00:04:40.470> obviously

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
think that this is a bad lens obviously

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.469 
think that this is a bad lens obviously
I<00:04:41.690> just<00:04:42.690> think<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.199> the<00:04:43.860> 50<00:04:44.280> millimeter<00:04:44.490> 1.4

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
I just think that the 50 millimeter 1.4

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.689 
I just think that the 50 millimeter 1.4
just<00:04:46.350> happens<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.800> also<00:04:46.919> be<00:04:47.340> very<00:04:47.370> very

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
just happens to also be very very

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.450 
just happens to also be very very
impressive<00:04:48.120> as<00:04:48.389> well<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:49.770> just<00:04:50.039> so<00:04:50.130> happens

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
impressive as well and I just so happens

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.330 
impressive as well and I just so happens
that<00:04:50.520> it's<00:04:50.729> a<00:04:50.820> third<00:04:51.030> of<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.210> price<00:04:51.419> for<00:04:52.340> still

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
that it's a third of the price for still

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.439 
that it's a third of the price for still
photographs<00:04:53.820> in<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:55.620> center<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.460> 58<00:04:57.180> one

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
photographs in the center the 58 one

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.680 
photographs in the center the 58 one
four<00:04:57.810> is<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.169> little<00:04:58.740> bit<00:04:58.860> sharper<00:04:59.130> on<00:04:59.690> paper

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
four is a little bit sharper on paper

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.629 
four is a little bit sharper on paper
and<00:05:01.229> it's<00:05:01.919> something<00:05:02.220> that<00:05:02.340> you'd<00:05:02.550> be

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
and it's something that you'd be

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.060 
and it's something that you'd be
hard-pressed<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.180> notice<00:05:03.449> in<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.600> real<00:05:03.780> world

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
hard-pressed to notice in the real world

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.730 
hard-pressed to notice in the real world
obviously<00:05:05.729> background<00:05:06.300> bokeh<00:05:06.780> is<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.380> bit

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
obviously background bokeh is a bit

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.790 
obviously background bokeh is a bit
better<00:05:07.919> on<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.190> 58<00:05:09.020> for<00:05:10.020> me<00:05:10.139> this<00:05:10.380> really

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
better on the 58 for me this really

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.400 
better on the 58 for me this really
doesn't<00:05:11.270> end<00:05:12.270> up<00:05:12.389> being<00:05:12.660> as<00:05:12.870> big<00:05:13.139> of<00:05:13.169> a<00:05:13.229> deal

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
doesn't end up being as big of a deal

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.560 
doesn't end up being as big of a deal
for<00:05:13.440> shooting<00:05:13.860> still<00:05:14.070> photographs<00:05:14.460> but<00:05:15.270> as<00:05:15.419> I

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
for shooting still photographs but as I

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.680 
for shooting still photographs but as I
mentioned<00:05:15.630> before<00:05:16.550> it's<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.699> very<00:05:17.970> big<00:05:18.419> thing

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
mentioned before it's a very big thing

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.010 
mentioned before it's a very big thing
in<00:05:18.720> terms<00:05:18.960> of<00:05:19.139> video<00:05:19.440> so<00:05:20.280> if<00:05:20.550> you're<00:05:20.729> a<00:05:20.760> user

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
in terms of video so if you're a user

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.570 
in terms of video so if you're a user
and<00:05:22.020> you're<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.770> know<00:05:22.889> shooting<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.280> lot<00:05:23.520> of

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
and you're you know shooting a lot of

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.719 
and you're you know shooting a lot of
video<00:05:25.370> this<00:05:26.370> lens<00:05:26.820> makes<00:05:27.360> a<00:05:27.630> lot<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.050> sense<00:05:28.729> for

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
video this lens makes a lot of sense for

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.279 
video this lens makes a lot of sense for
me<00:05:29.849> since<00:05:30.120> I'm<00:05:30.270> still<00:05:30.419> primarily<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:31.020> still

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
me since I'm still primarily a still

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.279 
me since I'm still primarily a still
photographer<00:05:31.979> I<00:05:32.220> will<00:05:33.180> likely<00:05:33.450> stick<00:05:33.990> with

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
photographer I will likely stick with

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.820 
photographer I will likely stick with
the<00:05:35.240> 51.4<00:05:36.240> for<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.720> for<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.139> foreseeable

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
the 51.4 for the for the foreseeable

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:45.020 
the 51.4 for the for the foreseeable
future<00:05:38.539> I<00:05:41.750> definitely<00:05:42.750> feel<00:05:43.080> like<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.950> 58<00:05:44.400> 1.4

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
future I definitely feel like the 58 1.4

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.820 
future I definitely feel like the 58 1.4
is<00:05:45.150> a<00:05:45.210> sign<00:05:45.419> of<00:05:45.539> things<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:45.810> come<00:05:45.900> from<00:05:46.229> Nikon<00:05:46.590> I

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
is a sign of things to come from Nikon I

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.830 
is a sign of things to come from Nikon I
do<00:05:47.400> think<00:05:47.820> that<00:05:47.880> we're<00:05:48.120> going<00:05:48.270> to<00:05:48.360> see<00:05:48.570> a<00:05:48.599> lot

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
do think that we're going to see a lot

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.460 
do think that we're going to see a lot
more<00:05:48.870> lenses<00:05:49.380> that<00:05:50.479> have<00:05:51.479> certain<00:05:52.380> attributes

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
more lenses that have certain attributes

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.469 
more lenses that have certain attributes
that<00:05:53.099> lend<00:05:53.430> them<00:05:53.669> better<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:55.070> video<00:05:56.070> as<00:05:57.030> Nikon

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
that lend them better to video as Nikon

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:58.670 
that lend them better to video as Nikon
continues<00:05:57.900> to<00:05:58.020> get<00:05:58.169> more<00:05:58.320> serious<00:05:58.500> about

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
continues to get more serious about

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.779 
continues to get more serious about
video<00:05:59.270> if<00:06:00.270> you're<00:06:00.419> shooting<00:06:00.570> in<00:06:00.720> 1080p<00:06:01.789> you

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
video if you're shooting in 1080p you

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.510 
video if you're shooting in 1080p you
actually<00:06:03.180> don't<00:06:03.300> have<00:06:03.539> to<00:06:03.690> have<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:04.520> sharpest

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
actually don't have to have the sharpest

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.060 
actually don't have to have the sharpest
lens<00:06:05.760> you<00:06:06.660> know<00:06:06.780> so<00:06:07.080> it<00:06:07.349> makes<00:06:07.620> sense<00:06:07.919> that

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
lens you know so it makes sense that

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.300 
lens you know so it makes sense that
Nikon<00:06:08.580> would<00:06:08.970> go<00:06:09.270> on<00:06:09.510> to<00:06:10.099> improving<00:06:11.099> other

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
Nikon would go on to improving other

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.070 
Nikon would go on to improving other
characteristics<00:06:12.150> like<00:06:12.479> that<00:06:12.840> beautiful

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
characteristics like that beautiful

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.150 
characteristics like that beautiful
bokeh<00:06:13.470> and<00:06:14.780> yeah<00:06:15.780> so<00:06:16.169> I<00:06:16.199> think<00:06:16.380> that<00:06:16.800> that<00:06:16.979> is

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
bokeh and yeah so I think that that is

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.400 
bokeh and yeah so I think that that is
one<00:06:17.550> of<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:18.060> one<00:06:18.210> of<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:18.330> main<00:06:18.570> areas<00:06:18.990> where

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
one of the one of the main areas where

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.629
