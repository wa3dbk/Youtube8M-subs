to have but does really worked well with

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.570 
to have but does really worked well with
a<00:02:38.080> setup<00:02:38.410> currently<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.010> want<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> new

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580

a setup currently so I want to get a new
one<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.970> have<00:02:40.599> one<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:40.870> mind<00:02:41.140> but<00:02:41.440> it's<00:02:41.590> kind<00:02:41.800> of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
one I have one in mind but it's kind of

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.250 
one I have one in mind but it's kind of
expensive<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.760> we'll<00:02:42.940> see<00:02:43.209> if<00:02:43.599> it's<00:02:44.140> really

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
expensive so we'll see if it's really

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.979 
expensive so we'll see if it's really
worth<00:02:44.349> it<00:02:44.650> for<00:02:44.830> me<00:02:44.950> or<00:02:44.980> not<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:46.450> now<00:02:46.810> let's
