it or roll it most people just roll it
like<00:00:47.399> myself<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:48.649> popping<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
like myself because popping it is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.080 
like myself because popping it is
extremely<00:00:50.430> hard<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:50.700> you're<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.910> fast

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
