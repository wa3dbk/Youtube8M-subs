00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
you're gonna need is a cargobob if you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.530 
you're gonna need is a cargobob if you
don't<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> cargobob<00:00:36.120> i<00:00:36.180> made<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> video

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
don't know the cargobob i made a video

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.240 
don't know the cargobob i made a video
on<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.020> couple<00:00:37.050> days<00:00:37.350> ago<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:37.680> basically<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
on it a couple days ago but basically it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.160 
on it a couple days ago but basically it
is<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> transport<00:00:39.239> heli<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
is the transport heli the one that you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.170 
is the transport heli the one that you
can<00:00:40.320> actually<00:00:40.469> pick<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:40.980> cars<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.879> think

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
can actually pick up cars and I think

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.760 
can actually pick up cars and I think
you<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.570> around<00:00:42.960> level<00:00:43.110> 20<00:00:43.620> to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
you have to be around level 20 to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.400 
you have to be around level 20 to
actually<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.399> spawn<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.989> can

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
actually get it to spawn if not you can

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
actually get it to spawn if not you can
try<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> steal<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.340> from<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> military<00:00:48.030> base

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
try to steal one from the military base

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.840 
try to steal one from the military base
it<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:49.050> difficult<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.730> know

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
it is really difficult but just know

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
three stars usually works you want to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.620 
three stars usually works you want to
get<00:02:43.430> more<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.700> make<00:02:43.819> sure<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.030> tank<00:02:44.270> actually

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
get more to make sure the tank actually

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.390 
get more to make sure the tank actually
does<00:02:44.780> come<00:02:44.989> down<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.260> road<00:02:45.440> then<00:02:45.680> go<00:02:45.980> for<00:02:46.280> it

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
does come down the road then go for it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.850 
does come down the road then go for it
but<00:02:46.610> three<00:02:47.150> like<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.570> said<00:02:47.600> usually<00:02:47.959> works<00:02:48.410> now

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
but three like I said usually works now

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.380 
but three like I said usually works now
basically<00:02:49.070> all<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.700> want<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:49.910> do<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.330> the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
basically all you want to do and the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.850 
basically all you want to do and the
reason<00:02:50.660> why<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.840> can<00:02:50.989> eat<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> lot<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.470> ammo<00:02:51.709> and

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
reason why you can eat a lot of ammo and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.460 
reason why you can eat a lot of ammo and
a<00:02:52.130> lot<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.459> guns<00:02:52.700> are<00:02:53.090> really<00:02:53.660> good<00:02:53.930> guns<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.440> a

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
a lot of guns are really good guns and a

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.380 
a lot of guns are really good guns and a
lot<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.739> armor<00:02:55.040> or<00:02:55.220> some<00:02:55.400> decent<00:02:55.730> armor<00:02:55.940> it's

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
lot of armor or some decent armor it's

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.150 
lot of armor or some decent armor it's
because<00:02:56.810> you're<00:02:57.500> gonna<00:02:57.620> have<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.800> lot<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.040> guys

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
because you're gonna have a lot of guys

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.470 
because you're gonna have a lot of guys
shooting<00:02:58.400> at<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:58.910> when<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.150> military

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
shooting at you so when the military

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.030 
shooting at you so when the military
actually<00:02:59.720> starts<00:03:00.050> coming<00:03:00.320> they'll<00:03:00.440> ram<00:03:00.769> into

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
actually starts coming they'll ram into

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.199 
actually starts coming they'll ram into
the<00:03:01.130> fence<00:03:01.310> they<00:03:01.430> can't<00:03:01.670> go<00:03:01.760> through<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.030> cuz

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
the fence they can't go through it cuz

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.120 
the fence they can't go through it cuz
like<00:03:02.300> I<00:03:02.360> said<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.630> is<00:03:02.660> closed<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:03.709> they<00:03:03.860> can

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
like I said it is closed but they can

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.130 
like I said it is closed but they can
shoot<00:03:04.430> through<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.940> some<00:03:05.420> will<00:03:05.450> come<00:03:05.930> down

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
shoot through it and some will come down

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.720 
shoot through it and some will come down
this<00:03:06.260> road<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:06.920> gets<00:03:07.130> kind<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.580> tricky

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
this road so it gets kind of tricky

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.000 
this road so it gets kind of tricky
because<00:03:08.360> if<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.930> do<00:03:09.110> hide<00:03:09.350> in<00:03:09.470> that<00:03:09.500> room<00:03:09.830> they

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
because if you do hide in that room they

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.620 
because if you do hide in that room they
can<00:03:10.310> some<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.820> guys<00:03:10.970> from<00:03:11.150> behind<00:03:11.450> you're

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
can some of the guys from behind you're

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.090 
can some of the guys from behind you're
wound<00:03:11.900> up<00:03:12.019> shooting<00:03:12.140> through<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.440> door<00:03:12.500> since

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
wound up shooting through the door since

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.070 
wound up shooting through the door since
the<00:03:13.190> doors<00:03:13.430> open<00:03:13.820> so<00:03:14.330> that's<00:03:14.510> why<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.660> say<00:03:14.930> if

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
the doors open so that's why I say if

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.479 
the doors open so that's why I say if
you<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:15.290> more<00:03:15.470> than<00:03:15.560> one<00:03:15.709> person<00:03:15.890> here<00:03:16.220> it

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
you have more than one person here it

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.039 
you have more than one person here it
works<00:03:16.730> better<00:03:16.940> because<00:03:17.209> if<00:03:17.360> this<00:03:17.510> guy<00:03:17.690> dies

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
works better because if this guy dies

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.199 
works better because if this guy dies
then<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.100> tank<00:03:19.370> won't<00:03:19.489> actually<00:03:19.730> come<00:03:20.030> down

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
then the tank won't actually come down

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.509 
then the tank won't actually come down
the<00:03:20.329> hill<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:20.870> can't<00:03:21.739> get<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.160> so<00:03:22.340> that's

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
the hill and you can't get it so that's

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.009 
the hill and you can't get it so that's
why<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:22.880> guy<00:03:23.209> is<00:03:23.239> sort<00:03:23.630> of<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.840> most

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
why this guy is sort of the most

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.960 
why this guy is sort of the most
important<00:03:24.530> guy<00:03:24.650> that's<00:03:25.100> part<00:03:25.459> of<00:03:25.549> this<00:03:25.610> plan

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
important guy that's part of this plan

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.390 
important guy that's part of this plan
now<00:03:26.750> when<00:03:27.019> he<00:03:27.470> starts<00:03:27.769> shooting<00:03:27.890> you'll<00:03:28.190> see

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
now when he starts shooting you'll see

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.310 
now when he starts shooting you'll see
right<00:03:29.299> here<00:03:29.360> there's<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.870> bunch<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.230> different

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
right here there's a bunch of different

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.900 
right here there's a bunch of different
military<00:03:30.860> guys<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.340> they<00:03:31.400> don't<00:03:31.549> notice<00:03:31.700> me

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
military guys and they don't notice me

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.949 
military guys and they don't notice me
and<00:03:32.030> they're<00:03:32.150> not<00:03:32.239> even<00:03:32.510> gonna<00:03:32.600> notice<00:03:32.780> me

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
and they're not even gonna notice me

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.390 
and they're not even gonna notice me
when<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.140> walk<00:03:33.410> through<00:03:33.680> them<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.100> guess

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
when I walk through them so I guess

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.890 
when I walk through them so I guess
there's<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.640> certain<00:03:34.940> limit<00:03:35.239> in<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.480> military

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
there's a certain limit in the military

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.180 
there's a certain limit in the military
base<00:03:36.079> where<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.320> can<00:03:36.500> go<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.010> military

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
base where you can go in the military

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.100 
base where you can go in the military
guys<00:03:37.610> want<00:03:38.299> to<00:03:38.390> actually<00:03:38.510> start<00:03:38.690> attacking

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
another guy flying to the fence so the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.530 
another guy flying to the fence so the
third<00:04:00.650> guy<00:04:00.860> and<00:04:01.280> thank<00:04:01.459> God<00:04:01.610> we<00:04:01.640> had<00:04:01.970> them<00:04:02.120> he

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
can actually get me out of the base now

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.920 
can actually get me out of the base now
as<00:04:04.519> you<00:04:04.670> see<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:04.910> plan<00:04:05.120> worked<00:04:05.360> perfectly<00:04:05.840> and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
as you see the plan worked perfectly and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.690 
as you see the plan worked perfectly and
the<00:04:06.200> tank<00:04:06.470> is<00:04:06.650> rolling<00:04:06.829> down<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.250> hill<00:04:07.400> now<00:04:07.610> we

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
the tank is rolling down the hill now we

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.220 
the tank is rolling down the hill now we
did<00:04:07.850> notice<00:04:08.030> sometimes<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.780> tank<00:04:08.989> does

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
did notice sometimes that the tank does

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.140 
did notice sometimes that the tank does
not<00:04:09.470> roll<00:04:09.859> down<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:10.160> hill<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.549> you<00:04:10.850> may<00:04:11.120> just

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
not roll down the hill and you may just

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.789 
not roll down the hill and you may just
need<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.720> try<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.049> again<00:04:12.170> or<00:04:12.440> maybe<00:04:12.620> get

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
need to try it again or maybe get

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.080 
need to try it again or maybe get
somebody<00:04:13.100> else<00:04:13.280> to<00:04:13.370> go<00:04:13.519> back<00:04:13.670> in<00:04:13.850> there<00:04:14.060> and

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
somebody else to go back in there and

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.150 
somebody else to go back in there and
sort<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.480> lower<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.780> tank<00:04:15.140> down<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.440> hill<00:04:15.769> now

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
sort of lower the tank down the hill now

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.319 
sort of lower the tank down the hill now
basically<00:04:16.579> from<00:04:16.700> here<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.209> easy

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
basically from here this is the easy

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:17.710 
basically from here this is the easy
part

guys<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.680> military<00:04:22.039> guys<00:04:22.160> don't<00:04:22.310> even<00:04:22.490> bother

gonna go right around hop in and they're
not<00:04:30.110> even<00:04:30.260> gonna<00:04:30.470> notice<00:04:30.740> me<00:04:31.070> until<00:04:31.490> I<00:04:31.520> get

not even gonna notice me until I get
inside<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.570> actual<00:04:32.990> tank<00:04:33.140> as<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.380> see<00:04:33.500> I'm

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
inside the actual tank as you see I'm

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.810 
inside the actual tank as you see I'm
inside<00:04:33.830> of<00:04:33.950> it<00:04:34.040> now<00:04:34.220> they're<00:04:34.430> gonna<00:04:34.490> give<00:04:34.730> me

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
inside of it now they're gonna give me

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.370 
inside of it now they're gonna give me
now<00:04:35.240> this<00:04:35.390> is<00:04:35.540> where<00:04:35.660> things<00:04:35.900> got<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.080> little

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
now this is where things got a little

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.160 
now this is where things got a little
bit<00:04:36.470> tricky<00:04:36.800> because<00:04:36.920> right<00:04:37.340> here<00:04:37.780> we<00:04:38.780> had<00:04:38.990> the

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
bit tricky because right here we had the

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.600 
bit tricky because right here we had the
guy<00:04:39.260> try<00:04:39.500> to<00:04:39.560> hook<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.250> does<00:04:40.400> take<00:04:40.580> a

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
guy try to hook it and it does take a

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.610 
guy try to hook it and it does take a
little<00:04:40.820> bit<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.120> time<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.600> hook<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:41.960> tank<00:04:42.200> and

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
little bit of time to hook the tank and

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.260 
little bit of time to hook the tank and
as<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.830> see<00:04:42.980> there's<00:04:43.220> fences<00:04:43.700> here<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.240> is

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
as you see there's fences here so it is

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.240 
as you see there's fences here so it is
a<00:04:44.360> little<00:04:44.510> bit<00:04:44.660> tricky<00:04:45.020> here<00:04:45.380> we<00:04:45.830> wound<00:04:46.100> up

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
a little bit tricky here we wound up

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.130 
a little bit tricky here we wound up
actually<00:04:46.610> moving<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.330> helicopter<00:04:47.960> pads

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
actually moving to the helicopter pads

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.140 
actually moving to the helicopter pads
which<00:04:48.290> is<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.410> lot<00:04:48.680> easier<00:04:48.710> but<00:04:49.640> if<00:04:49.760> you<00:04:49.850> can't

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
which is a lot easier but if you can't

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.700 
which is a lot easier but if you can't
get<00:04:50.240> out<00:04:50.330> right<00:04:50.480> here<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:50.720> just<00:04:51.230> suggested

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
get out right here I just suggested

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.230 
get out right here I just suggested
because<00:04:51.860> then<00:04:52.160> sometimes<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:52.820> may<00:04:53.000> have<00:04:53.150> to

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
because then sometimes you may have to

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.790 
because then sometimes you may have to
deal<00:04:53.450> with<00:04:53.570> other<00:04:53.870> tanks<00:04:54.320> inside<00:04:54.680> the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
deal with other tanks inside the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.470 
deal with other tanks inside the
military<00:04:55.220> base<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.610> other<00:04:56.090> people<00:04:56.300> shooting

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
military base and other people shooting

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
military base and other people shooting
at<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:56.810> it<00:04:56.900> just<00:04:56.960> gets<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.230> little<00:04:57.290> bit

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
at you and it just gets a little bit

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.050 
at you and it just gets a little bit
more<00:04:57.590> complicated<00:04:57.980> so<00:04:58.250> if<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.610> can't<00:04:58.880> get<00:04:59.000> out

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
more complicated so if you can't get out

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.000 
more complicated so if you can't get out
right<00:04:59.240> here<00:04:59.420> I<00:04:59.600> would<00:04:59.900> recommend<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.530> but<00:05:00.710> it

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
right here I would recommend it but it

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.140 
right here I would recommend it but it
is<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.190> little<00:05:01.340> bit<00:05:01.490> more<00:05:01.580> difficult<00:05:02.030> because

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
is a little bit more difficult because

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.820 
is a little bit more difficult because
there's<00:05:02.540> the<00:05:02.690> fences<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:03.170> stuff<00:05:03.380> as<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.710> saw

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
there's the fences and stuff as you saw

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.290 
there's the fences and stuff as you saw
here<00:05:04.040> I'm<00:05:04.160> also<00:05:04.310> gonna<00:05:04.490> shoot<00:05:04.760> my<00:05:04.910> helicopter

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
here I'm also gonna shoot my helicopter

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.060 
here I'm also gonna shoot my helicopter
the<00:05:05.810> first<00:05:06.020> one<00:05:06.230> so<00:05:06.470> we're<00:05:06.590> going<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.830> need<00:05:06.950> to

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
the first one so we're going to need to

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.650 
the first one so we're going to need to
unfortunately<00:05:07.700> call<00:05:07.880> in<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.150> second<00:05:08.540> area

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
unfortunately call in the second area

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.880 
unfortunately call in the second area
which<00:05:08.840> will<00:05:09.020> actually<00:05:09.380> get<00:05:09.470> caught<00:05:09.710> on<00:05:09.830> the

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
which will actually get caught on the

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.350 
which will actually get caught on the
fence<00:05:10.070> and<00:05:10.340> he'll<00:05:10.490> wind<00:05:10.670> up<00:05:10.820> going<00:05:10.940> down<00:05:11.090> so

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
fence and he'll wind up going down so

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.300 
fence and he'll wind up going down so
like<00:05:11.420> I<00:05:11.540> said<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.780> third<00:05:11.960> one<00:05:12.200> does<00:05:12.860> save<00:05:13.130> us

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
like I said the third one does save us

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.800 
like I said the third one does save us
and<00:05:13.610> that's<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.030> one<00:05:14.180> thing<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:14.450> don't<00:05:14.690> want

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
and that's the one thing you don't want

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.450 
and that's the one thing you don't want
to<00:05:14.960> do<00:05:15.050> is<00:05:15.170> get<00:05:15.350> stuck<00:05:15.650> in<00:05:15.800> here<00:05:15.980> with<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.250> tank

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
to do is get stuck in here with the tank

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.700 
to do is get stuck in here with the tank
because<00:05:16.790> then<00:05:17.030> it's<00:05:17.690> gonna<00:05:17.900> be<00:05:18.020> crazy<00:05:18.350> because

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
because then it's gonna be crazy because

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.900 
because then it's gonna be crazy because
you<00:05:18.860> got<00:05:19.010> other<00:05:19.160> things<00:05:19.250> shooting<00:05:19.700> actually

at the military shooting actually they

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.360 
at the military shooting actually they
may<00:05:21.140> even<00:05:21.290> get<00:05:21.440> jets<00:05:21.770> shooting<00:05:21.920> at<00:05:22.100> you<00:05:22.220> I

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
may even get jets shooting at you I

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.440 
may even get jets shooting at you I
don't<00:05:22.550> know<00:05:22.640> whether<00:05:22.790> they're<00:05:22.910> gonna<00:05:23.000> release

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
don't know whether they're gonna release

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.840

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
easy enough that the tanks don't really

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.830 
easy enough that the tanks don't really
go<00:05:43.610> over<00:05:43.850> there<00:05:44.000> there's<00:05:44.240> sometimes<00:05:44.480> some

whatever<00:05:57.200> you<00:05:57.470> want<00:05:57.740> but<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.490> one<00:05:58.670> thing<00:05:58.850> that

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
whatever you want but the one thing that

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.700 
whatever you want but the one thing that
does<00:05:59.060> kind<00:05:59.300> of<00:05:59.360> suck<00:05:59.570> and<00:05:59.840> I<00:05:59.930> did<00:06:00.140> try<00:06:00.320> it<00:06:00.440> is

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
does kind of suck and I did try it is

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.070 
does kind of suck and I did try it is
you<00:06:01.310> can't<00:06:01.580> store<00:06:01.850> this<00:06:02.000> in<00:06:02.180> your<00:06:02.300> garage<00:06:02.480> so

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
you can't store this in your garage so

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.140 
you can't store this in your garage so
unfortunately<00:06:03.860> you're<00:06:04.250> only<00:06:04.490> gonna<00:06:04.730> have<00:06:05.000> it

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
unfortunately you're only gonna have it

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.670 
unfortunately you're only gonna have it
until<00:06:05.360> it<00:06:05.900> does<00:06:06.050> blow<00:06:06.290> up<00:06:06.410> because<00:06:06.560> these

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
until it does blow up because these

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.260 
until it does blow up because these
things<00:06:06.860> do<00:06:07.100> eventually<00:06:07.430> blow<00:06:07.850> up<00:06:08.030> I<00:06:08.210> don't

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
things do eventually blow up I don't

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.940 
things do eventually blow up I don't
know<00:06:08.420> how<00:06:08.480> many<00:06:08.750> bullets<00:06:09.290> or<00:06:09.560> whatever<00:06:09.830> it

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
know how many bullets or whatever it

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.100 
know how many bullets or whatever it
takes<00:06:10.190> but<00:06:10.730> like<00:06:10.910> I<00:06:10.970> said<00:06:11.030> they<00:06:11.480> will<00:06:11.690> blow<00:06:11.900> up

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
takes but like I said they will blow up

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.540 
takes but like I said they will blow up
so<00:06:12.380> if<00:06:12.440> that<00:06:12.560> doesn't<00:06:12.830> happen<00:06:12.890> unfortunately

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
so if that doesn't happen unfortunately

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.470 
so if that doesn't happen unfortunately
you<00:06:13.610> don't<00:06:13.670> have<00:06:13.820> to<00:06:13.880> do<00:06:13.970> this<00:06:14.030> all<00:06:14.210> over<00:06:14.360> again

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
you don't have to do this all over again

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.870 
you don't have to do this all over again
but<00:06:14.810> this<00:06:15.050> is<00:06:15.110> pretty<00:06:15.620> simple<00:06:16.100> and<00:06:16.340> we<00:06:16.670> keep

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
but this is pretty simple and we keep

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.640 
but this is pretty simple and we keep
doing<00:06:16.940> it<00:06:17.270> and<00:06:17.450> we<00:06:17.720> keep<00:06:17.870> getting<00:06:18.020> things<00:06:18.410> so

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
doing it and we keep getting things so

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.110 
doing it and we keep getting things so
once<00:06:19.160> you<00:06:19.280> do<00:06:19.370> it<00:06:19.460> enough<00:06:19.670> times<00:06:19.700> you'll

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
once you do it enough times you'll

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.850 
once you do it enough times you'll
actually<00:06:20.330> master<00:06:20.930> it<00:06:21.050> and<00:06:21.230> you're<00:06:21.380> good<00:06:21.650> a

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
actually master it and you're good a

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.500 
actually master it and you're good a
couple<00:06:22.340> other<00:06:22.430> little<00:06:22.520> things<00:06:22.940> to<00:06:23.120> know<00:06:23.270> once

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
couple other little things to know once

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.480 
couple other little things to know once
you're<00:06:23.630> hooked<00:06:23.810> with<00:06:23.930> a<00:06:23.990> cargobob<00:06:24.620> you<00:06:25.190> can't

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
you're hooked with a cargobob you can't

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.910 
you're hooked with a cargobob you can't
actually<00:06:25.760> aim<00:06:26.450> where<00:06:27.110> you're<00:06:27.290> shooting<00:06:27.590> at<00:06:27.710> I

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
actually aim where you're shooting at I

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.140 
actually aim where you're shooting at I
don't<00:06:28.100> know<00:06:28.220> I<00:06:28.250> haven't<00:06:28.580> really<00:06:28.820> figured<00:06:28.970> it

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
don't know I haven't really figured it

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.640 
don't know I haven't really figured it
out<00:06:29.270> but<00:06:29.480> you<00:06:29.510> can<00:06:29.750> only<00:06:29.900> shoot<00:06:30.170> in<00:06:30.440> one

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
out but you can only shoot in one

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.170 
out but you can only shoot in one
direction<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:31.280> it's<00:06:31.550> not<00:06:31.700> even<00:06:31.820> the<00:06:32.030> one

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180
