00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.290 

work<00:00:20.090> better<00:00:20.330> lower<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.110> temperature<00:00:22.300> 20

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300

work better lower the temperature 20
below<00:00:30.700> just<00:00:31.700> drive<00:00:31.910> right<00:00:31.939> through<00:00:32.440> that<00:00:33.440> was

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
below just drive right through that was

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:46.180 
below just drive right through that was
our<00:00:34.250> plan<00:00:37.269> to

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:56.959 

Mason

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:15.770 

devotees

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.649 

by<00:01:16.320> more<00:01:16.590> than

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.120 

I<00:01:18.719> mean<00:01:19.560> yeah<00:01:19.829> it<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.249> close<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.060> all

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:39.450 

the<00:01:31.789> more<00:01:32.789> important<00:01:33.179> thing<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.409> faster

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.360 

business<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.609> eat<00:01:40.729> before

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.570 

but<00:01:43.970> are<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.270> little<00:01:44.450> bit<00:01:44.630> sooner

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.420 

well<00:01:51.580> part<00:01:51.820> of<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.940> reason<00:01:51.970> take<00:01:52.390> a<00:01:53.430> cemetery

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
well part of the reason take a cemetery

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.710 
well part of the reason take a cemetery
so<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:57.640> get<00:01:57.790> some<00:01:57.940> people<00:01:58.210> returning<00:01:58.509> next

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
so we get some people returning next

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:34.540 
so we get some people returning next
year

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:45.990 

41

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.200 

let's<00:02:46.570> go<00:02:46.960> first<00:02:47.320> in<00:02:47.530> an<00:02:47.650> hour<00:02:47.890> yeah<00:02:48.850> that's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
let's go first in an hour yeah that's

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.850 
let's go first in an hour yeah that's
the<00:02:49.330> center<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.110> remap<00:02:50.470> back<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.800> the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
the center but a remap back to the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.830 
the center but a remap back to the
center<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.370> back<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.820> start<00:02:52.060> yes<00:02:54.840> it's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
center I back to the start yes it's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.480 
center I back to the start yes it's
still<00:02:55.960> mapping<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:56.740> just<00:02:56.920> mapped<00:02:57.100> out<00:02:57.280> that

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
still mapping it's just mapped out that

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.550 
still mapping it's just mapped out that
block<00:02:57.760> right<00:02:58.330> there<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:59.230> then<00:02:59.290> I'll<00:02:59.410> go<00:02:59.530> back

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
block right there and then I'll go back

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.160 
block right there and then I'll go back
to<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.860> center<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.660> take<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> shortest<00:03:01.990> path

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
to the center and take the shortest path

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:16.500 
to the center and take the shortest path
from<00:03:02.320> here<00:03:02.940> are<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.090> sodium<00:03:14.640> st<00:03:15.640> slow<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:16.330> they

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
from here are the sodium st slow so they

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.780 
from here are the sodium st slow so they
pulled<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.959> out<00:03:17.250> don't<00:03:18.250> think<00:03:18.520> we'd<00:03:18.610> make<00:03:18.640> it

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
pulled it out don't think we'd make it

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:37.140 
pulled it out don't think we'd make it
back<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.270> middle

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.059 

take<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:37.720> right<00:03:37.930> now<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.500> should<00:03:38.680> take<00:03:38.829> the

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
take that right now it should take the

00:03:39.069 --> 00:04:44.110 
take that right now it should take the
rather<00:03:39.459> just<00:03:39.700> eats<00:03:39.879> metal<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.510> shorter

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:05:02.800
