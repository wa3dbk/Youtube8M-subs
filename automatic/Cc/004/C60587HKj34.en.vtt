00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 ah 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.789
 exists I think in the lack of clarity 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.180
 about the role of the judge nor what it is 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.180
 the judge 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.559
 put a horse in here and see 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.199
 How long it lasts is he dies 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.199
 crazy support urp what humans 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.159
 we have the third population 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.540
 incarcerated in the world one exceeded only 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.540
 by china for the united states 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.369
 now the question why do we 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.110
 we arrest does not work 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.539
 there would be another justice is clear 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.979
 justice that is from the judgment to justice 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.360
 The truth has nothing to do with this 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.929
 feeling of revenge that deep down is 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.929
 a great injustice 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.670
 we live in a situation of violence 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.490
 unprecedented from the point of view of 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.569
 the number of people who are victims of 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.830
 fatal violence the declared war is 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.239
 declared war 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.890
 Save yourself if you can and now you're in. 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:55.929
 of our business is being accused of 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.090
 trafficking in drugs 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.770
 You're not supposed to answer. 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.530
 can even remain silent 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.300
 not the lady's right you prefer 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.300
