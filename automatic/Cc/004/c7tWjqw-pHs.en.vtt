00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
 you never know blue anymore and the first chance through the blows 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.400
 However, there are many gaps and India has been pushed 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.799
 in the seventh minute 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.799
 but of course for the Berlin the 0 2 1 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.449
 Softball does not quite believe the opposing striker in the first league 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.399
 then the deductions minute free kick for blue-white the basis had something 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.399
 this position against Fridingen 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.890
 or this time, the ball fit 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.559
 the 1 2 1 but maybe competitor Hella photo AFP update 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.760
 that was a joke the FDP chooses to think of 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.350
 Whatever the game we are well equipped and 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.230
 45 minutes of play 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.850
 a head shot from Frontzeck the 1 0 2 at this time a bit unhappy 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.950
 for the Berliners 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.850
 and supports the whole covenant given you see is the stage 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.489
 out 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.440
 and then becomes a middle class 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.510
 Therefore, I am 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.670
 blue-white Soest feared only praise in the second half 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.690
 the accusations 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.130
 turbulent scenes Guttenberg or raging support for Brent Crude Oil Future 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.600
 11 points minimized 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.320
 and before that 5 5 have included of course has judges 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.520
 already whistled 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.880
 have the Ã¶bb 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.619
 London big for the biggest of the Gladbacher and Hyundai Steel Mill 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.430
 the looks are mistakes 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.840
 to show everyone 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.659
 a mushroom 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.660
 whether he was already born a child but 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.880
 a free kick already gone 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.790
 Highlights in the conclusion no other substitute 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.590
 paralyzed 19 Tel 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.780
 the cheers are great because he has gotten his second hit in total 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.970
 transfer 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.230
 Minute again Kloten with 4 0 by 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.190
 again about suicide was in October white hope to the point 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.109
 the winners 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.109
 where you want to go even two 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.530
 A man named can give you proof of the decisive hit 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.350
 Torriecher 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.100
 but the important NASA takes exactly knew the replacement of the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.140
 Sniper clear federal board food 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.680
 the boy was after a great fighting performance 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.550
 understandable 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.950
 you should not close your eyes to that blue-and-white before 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.539
 almost e-mail strothoff 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.779
 in four scenes around the 70 minute, the renowned opponent would have the game 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.509
 several times decisive 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:19.099
 At this time, the Greens scented Gladbacher with two to one 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.780
 but the green turns itself National players have the goal 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.560
 the former number one in blue and white Carsten Reinhardt lean 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.200
 in front of which surely the victory bonus but the exploit failed Holger Gehrke 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.849
 new probably with mixed feelings 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.849
 starts again 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.579
 right there offensive defender Kraus she should be at the shotgun 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.229
 again resisted 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.779
 It was a bit of a shiver for Blue White right from the start 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:55.909
 especially Captain Peter made it strong with the number 6 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.539
 Here ran the ball loses 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:04.040
 and we absolutely hurt gold on the penalty box Gallen Brands lays 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:06.479
 started well in Dresen 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.779
 a great hit, but when did you already have room to look for 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:17.029
 the sympathetic Peterstal before apparently managed by his Lapsus sustainable 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.579
 many assumptions that missed at this time were the consequences 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.299
 and such unnecessary ball losses compelling a whole crew then in 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.749
 exhausting backward march on 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.299
 Apart from the other possibilities, thank you 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.299
 to have 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.590
 although the defense again showed weaknesses so had the man-decker 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:41.619
 tanner 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.799
 and right here their opponents are stuck Intel 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.489
 Professionals of midfield player discarded doubted exclusive Feilzer 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.479
 discussed 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.879
 now waived 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.549
 he is now playing the ball played a little more inconspicuous as well as Hermann without 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.129
 disappoint 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.759
 after all, this passage clarifies the print of the blue and white 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.759
 finally in the Prospect Scheffer 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.289
 Pass by Bill Field Force of Frontzeck handfester 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.759
 two specialists a day 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.969
 the artists could transform the degrading ones into a free-kick 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.079
 Mind Maps 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.840
 Accident happened 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.809
 the one to one in the 18 minutes 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.910
 it was the keeper's corner flew to the front men 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.910
 contributed to irritations 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:42.319
 In the consequence distributed play Lowe it was often too much by the middle Gladbach 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.990
 here with Frontzeck 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.300
 and the other fullback Kraus with pronounced then wing play 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.159
 a lot of space to flank 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.159
 and a scrawled header is coming to a close 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.340
 Heinze two in the 45 minute 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.250
 the repetition makes it clear that Dierkes undecided 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.439
 Gladbacher hit favored 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.439
 In reverse, you can not react well 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:16.479
 shortly after restart then a beautiful direct combination of 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.699
 host 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.699
 so you can run an app for 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.479
 unfortunately stood by Ford right on the edge of this pass from Herrmann 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:28.979
 in the offside 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.770
 and also in the middle of some blue-white right failed 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.770
 Referee Neuner this recognition the recognition 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.279
 blue-white stormed round play like a test Ruppelt countered cool 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.279
 at least until 2 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.610
 It was the initial situation Prof Boris is simple for example this 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.379
 Dropping and Baltic Sea 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.129
 Rebeaud Haller grabs in the other half in the empty 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.849
 Dance teacher live as a tactical mistake 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.759
 and suddenly the West Germans outnumber those 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.960
 It's the Opelaner game like in training 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.960
 only the goal shooting is obviously not so easy to learn 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:10.119
 Surprisingly, Robert Girke did not lower his ball in the distance 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:12.360
 advanced in the position in love 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.539
 in my opinion blue-white had opened a little too early 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.249
 a one to four as against Kaiserslautern would have been possible 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:21.990
 but it happened differently 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.990
 they already know these scenes 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.229
 many of the text Augsburger scored the winner against Kaiserslautern 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:32.680
 would have 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.469
 came for the battered Pfizer 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:38.800
 had not disappointed Schweeger previously replaced and the senses worked out 

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:39.370
 tie 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.120
 Robert did not defy the two camps at first 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.740
 later pharmacist only 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.119
 slowed down by foul 

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:49.589
 and this time was now about to stand 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:53.489
 Secondly, a serious mistake by Tostedt favored that because I was lying 

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:56.400
 seven minutes in the 81 minutes 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.899
 after his substitution 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.369
 but not only coaches and photographers had a good nose 

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:05.639
 when all seemed to have resigned themselves to the draw 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.229
 her objectives on that corner kick in the ninetieth minute Riedle behind 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:11.550
 Shot on and with momentum from the back room 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.439
 Roland Haefeli that many had 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:14.930
 but enthusiastic 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.400
 even if Gladbach coach after the 2 2 3 is stunned
