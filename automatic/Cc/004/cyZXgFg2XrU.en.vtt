00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:11.639
 I'll show you a couple more chips residents 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:15.470
 between us are going to the landfill I hope that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.510
 don't start with the first zombie could not 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.970
 a zombie can't knock a wooden door 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.410
 if the door is on some blocks 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.310
 higher than zombies kills the upper part they 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.740
 don't try to jump knock out but not 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.329
 get now need to use 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 iron doors . 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.329
 only hardcore and principle on this all 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:56.989
 You can go to the second chips here it is 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:56.989
 is next to brother do not clap 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.629
 interfere with the Orsk fence and wooden not 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.570
 connects and appears between them 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.000
 such a small space through which 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.119
 Basically, we can go through the number pig 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.189
 cows and sheep they can as well as zombies 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.189
 also will not be able to pass and principle is 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.240
 can use trap style in what 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.659
 you are more comfortable or that you have 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.939
 brutally brain will come up with a fence stuck 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.939
 Well, Nitsche norms in these next 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.100
 through the lamp 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.119
 Of course we can not watch we so 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.810
 look nothing but if we put 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.740
 ice blocks 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 then we will be able to observe or what 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.509
 going on through lava it sure bang 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.579
 because in life we ​​can't 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.909
 watch what happens through funny 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.909
 you 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.690
 two witches here they really we them 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.010
 We see pretty good tank can be 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.020
 use it on the cards is incomprehensible 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.810
 where are they of course looking but it doesn't matter 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.130
 we have already considered this bug 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.850
 go to the next 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.700
 the music starts playing with us right now 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.420
 the next tank will come too we have a bug 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.170
 with infinite throw or rather with 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:37.140
 infinite trolley network set fire here 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.290
 here and lower the court trolley and by it 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.420
 explodes but what we see now from 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.920
 it falls out 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.240
 trolley throw now we can 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.670
 make another bomb and basically so 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.300
 you can do endlessly why I said 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.420
 basically it's really infinite 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.030
 Here are few of the chips showed but better 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.340
 than nothing so what if you liked 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:09.450
