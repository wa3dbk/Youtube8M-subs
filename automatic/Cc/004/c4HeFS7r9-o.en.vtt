this because I want you to be able to
see<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:35.349> changes<00:02:35.859> we<00:02:36.579> also<00:02:36.760> get<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.269> brick<00:02:37.689> when

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
see the changes we also get a brick when

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.039 
see the changes we also get a brick when
we<00:02:38.290> do<00:02:38.439> this<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:39.159> allows<00:02:39.549> us<00:02:39.579> to<00:02:40.000> adjust<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
we do this that allows us to adjust the

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.440 
we do this that allows us to adjust the
intensity<00:02:41.170> in<00:02:41.919> the<00:02:42.069> detail<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.239> course

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
intensity in the detail and of course

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.959 
intensity in the detail and of course
the<00:02:43.569> radius<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.260> how<00:02:44.889> much<00:02:45.219> the<00:02:45.489> adjustment

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:45.969 
the radius is how much the adjustment

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.629 
the radius is how much the adjustment
affects<00:02:46.359> outside<00:02:47.109> of<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:47.560> pixel<00:02:47.919> how<00:02:48.340> far

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
affects outside of the pixel how far

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.879 
affects outside of the pixel how far
does<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.849> radiate<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:50.169> let's<00:02:50.409> just<00:02:50.590> do<00:02:50.859> a

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
does it radiate so let's just do a

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.409 
does it radiate so let's just do a
little<00:02:51.250> smoothing<00:02:51.669> right<00:02:52.000> now

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:52.419

and so forth so now we've cleaned that
all<00:03:41.409> up<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.979> do<00:03:42.939> a<00:03:42.970> little<00:03:43.180> bit<00:03:43.329> more<00:03:43.359> right<00:03:43.720> here

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
all up I do a little bit more right here

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.649 
all up I do a little bit more right here

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
to stay away from the lips the Chin's

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.020 
to stay away from the lips the Chin's
fine<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.259> we<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.799> do<00:03:47.919> just<00:03:48.159> a<00:03:48.370> real<00:03:48.729> quickie

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
fine and we can do just a real quickie

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.689 
fine and we can do just a real quickie
little<00:03:49.419> right<00:03:49.599> there<00:03:49.810> if<00:03:49.900> we<00:03:49.989> want<00:03:50.229> and<00:03:50.699> maybe

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
little right there if we want and maybe

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.689 
little right there if we want and maybe
just<00:03:51.909> a<00:03:52.060> little<00:03:52.090> bit<00:03:52.389> more<00:03:52.599> right<00:03:52.810> here<00:03:53.199> I

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
just a little bit more right here I

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.679 
just a little bit more right here I
think<00:03:54.699> we're<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.090> pretty<00:03:55.239> good<00:03:55.419> shape

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
think we're in pretty good shape

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.990 
think we're in pretty good shape
now<00:03:56.199> if<00:03:56.379> I<00:03:56.500> want<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:57.009> I<00:03:57.250> can<00:03:57.459> play<00:03:57.699> with<00:03:57.879> the

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
now if I want to I can play with the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.030 
now if I want to I can play with the
intensity<00:03:58.509> of<00:03:58.719> my<00:03:58.870> adjustment<00:03:59.469> by<00:03:59.650> going<00:03:59.949> down

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
intensity of my adjustment by going down

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.849 
intensity of my adjustment by going down
to<00:04:00.099> this<00:04:00.400> brick<00:04:00.639> and<00:04:00.669> just<00:04:00.969> moving<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.479> slider

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
to this brick and just moving the slider

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.879 
to this brick and just moving the slider
and<00:04:02.859> you<00:04:02.979> see<00:04:03.219> you<00:04:03.939> can<00:04:04.150> go<00:04:04.359> way<00:04:04.900> too<00:04:04.959> far<00:04:05.379> very

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
and you see you can go way too far very

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.009 
and you see you can go way too far very
fast<00:04:06.129> with<00:04:06.430> this<00:04:06.639> we<00:04:07.239> definitely<00:04:07.389> want<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.900> do

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
fast with this we definitely want to do

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.050 
fast with this we definitely want to do
that<00:04:08.199> and<00:04:08.500> if<00:04:08.979> we<00:04:09.099> move<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.459> intensity<00:04:09.879> all

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
that and if we move the intensity all

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.520 
that and if we move the intensity all
the<00:04:10.209> way<00:04:10.299> back<00:04:10.509> it's<00:04:10.780> like<00:04:10.840> we<00:04:11.049> didn't<00:04:11.349> do<00:04:11.409> the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
the way back it's like we didn't do the

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.099 
the way back it's like we didn't do the
adjustment<00:04:12.069> at<00:04:12.189> all<00:04:12.370> we<00:04:13.180> can<00:04:13.359> see<00:04:13.509> the<00:04:13.629> pore<00:04:13.870> so

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
adjustment at all we can see the pore so

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.050 
adjustment at all we can see the pore so
it's<00:04:14.379> usually<00:04:14.560> somewhere<00:04:15.189> in<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.579> middle<00:04:15.879> and

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
it's usually somewhere in the middle and

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.539 
it's usually somewhere in the middle and
all<00:04:16.840> we<00:04:16.959> want<00:04:17.139> to<00:04:17.229> do<00:04:17.349> is<00:04:17.469> just<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.919> little<00:04:18.400> bit

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
all we want to do is just a little bit

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.819 
all we want to do is just a little bit
of<00:04:18.789> enhancement<00:04:19.719> we<00:04:20.079> don't<00:04:20.259> want<00:04:20.409> to<00:04:20.500> get<00:04:20.650> rid

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
of enhancement we don't want to get rid

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.709 
of enhancement we don't want to get rid
of<00:04:20.859> everything<00:04:21.219> I<00:04:21.609> think<00:04:22.240> that's<00:04:22.389> a<00:04:22.479> pretty

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:22.719 
of everything I think that's a pretty

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:25.230 
of everything I think that's a pretty
nice<00:04:22.960> adjustment<00:04:23.740> right<00:04:24.039> there<00:04:24.340> I'll<00:04:24.789> go

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
nice adjustment right there I'll go

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.080 
nice adjustment right there I'll go
ahead<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.630> close<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:26.430> we<00:04:27.430> can<00:04:27.610> turn<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.940> off

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
ahead and close this we can turn it off

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.350 
ahead and close this we can turn it off
and<00:04:28.300> on<00:04:28.449> by<00:04:28.750> clicking<00:04:29.169> right<00:04:29.289> here

and on by clicking right here

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.120 
and on by clicking right here
so<00:04:31.360> there<00:04:31.600> is<00:04:31.810> our<00:04:32.050> before<00:04:32.229> our<00:04:32.590> adjustment

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
so there is our before our adjustment

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.379 
so there is our before our adjustment
and<00:04:34.080> there<00:04:35.080> is<00:04:35.260> afterwards<00:04:35.740> we<00:04:36.550> can<00:04:36.729> always<00:04:37.120> go

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
and there is afterwards we can always go

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.719 
and there is afterwards we can always go
back<00:04:37.419> and<00:04:37.720> do<00:04:38.199> more<00:04:38.410> brushing<00:04:38.949> if<00:04:39.100> we<00:04:39.250> want<00:04:39.490> by

bring that back up and we can continue
working<00:04:44.490> now<00:04:45.490> I'm<00:04:45.580> gonna<00:04:45.729> go<00:04:45.970> ahead<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:46.210> zoom

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
working now I'm gonna go ahead and zoom

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.629 
working now I'm gonna go ahead and zoom
out<00:04:46.780> I'm<00:04:47.110> gonna<00:04:47.229> hit<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.650> z<00:04:47.830> key<00:04:48.130> again<00:04:48.370> to

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
out I'm gonna hit the z key again to

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.180 
out I'm gonna hit the z key again to
pull<00:04:48.850> this<00:04:48.940> back<00:04:49.000> out<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:50.040> there's<00:04:51.040> our

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
pull this back out and there's our

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.340 
pull this back out and there's our
adjustments<00:04:51.639> so<00:04:51.699> we<00:04:51.729> did<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.000> nice<00:04:52.449> subtle

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
adjustments so we did a nice subtle

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.650 
adjustments so we did a nice subtle
portrait<00:04:54.340> adjustment<00:04:54.850> but<00:04:55.090> if<00:04:55.270> we<00:04:55.419> made<00:04:55.630> a

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
portrait adjustment but if we made a

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.990 
portrait adjustment but if we made a
print<00:04:56.050> or<00:04:56.290> if<00:04:56.889> you<00:04:57.160> looked<00:04:57.400> at<00:04:57.550> this<00:04:57.729> in<00:04:57.910> the

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
print or if you looked at this in the

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.390 
print or if you looked at this in the
large<00:04:58.240> view<00:04:58.479> you<00:04:58.690> would<00:04:58.960> be<00:04:59.500> able<00:04:59.770> to<00:04:59.919> tell<00:05:00.220> the

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
large view you would be able to tell the

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.760 
large view you would be able to tell the
difference<00:05:00.430> and<00:05:01.060> when<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:01.900> client<00:05:02.350> sees<00:05:02.560> it

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
difference and when the client sees it

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.279 
difference and when the client sees it
it<00:05:03.160> looks<00:05:03.490> natural<00:05:03.789> so<00:05:04.479> she's<00:05:04.720> not<00:05:04.870> gonna<00:05:05.050> go

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
it looks natural so she's not gonna go

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.379 
it looks natural so she's not gonna go
wow<00:05:05.530> what<00:05:05.560> did<00:05:05.889> you<00:05:06.039> do<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.430> me<00:05:06.610> other<00:05:07.000> than
