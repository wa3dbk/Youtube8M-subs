00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:12.019
 why because this is champion 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.900
 ah ah ah ah 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.039
 at the time I found the marginal 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.190
 under this one it will keep flashing from here 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.150
 line already paid here there is plenty of reservation but 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.150
 can give 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.369
 it is 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.470
 That's it guys, this is the indian channel. 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.530
 do a test drive here 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.290
 try to feel the bike 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.210
 I hope I'm still on the way. 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.210
 right 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.800
 The bike is different different from what 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.800
 we are accustomed 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:12.320
 For those who did not realize we 're here. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.320
 with bmw f 800 r 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.840
 It's very different the played is different 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.370
 O 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:50.790
 the difference of that of the four cylinders 2 is 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.370
 brutal 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.090
 The bike finally completes the engine very 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.090
 fast 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:08.500
 everything a checked here is all ok and 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.030
 another focused totally different from 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:17.910
 motinha is going a week to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.910
 get accustomed but she has a nice touch 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.610
 it's hi 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.180
 cool cool, very cool 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.970
 It's all a matter of getting accustomed right. 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:55.330
 The pedal position is 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:04:01.860
 what's cool is a different business is 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.860
 This one that we 're walking is a 2012 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:11.650
 that has not changed practically anything 2013 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:15.070
 only the color of the painting changed so 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:20.730
 that you no longer have to see better in this 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.730
 they separate for the same test-drive and 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.800
 put liked most deserving direction 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.550
 abs 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.140
 both front and rear 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:38.160
 it is not combined it is independent of 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.160
 independently 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.069
 very cool motoca saw it very cool 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.069
 same 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.150
 is 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.270
 very cool motinho 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.870
 she has a footprint on the way out too 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.870
 aggressive 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:31.990
 for people who are not used to 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:39.340
 She is very different and a good bike. 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:41.650
 shorter in the short in the sense of 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.510
 relationship or perhaps on account of 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.800
 its two cylinders it grows a lot 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.480
 It does not work fast and it does not 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.520
 a bike that gives you the touch too 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.300
 quite comfortable she is not a baita 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.220
 one on a motorcycle that trembles a lot for 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.070
 have two cylinders only to those who are 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.760
 always accustomed to the four are 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.760
 very smooth 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.210
 the list is not 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.280
 It's very cool. 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:42.090
 a little bit of it is very tasty is 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.090
 very nice with this bike is very good 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.229
 It's giving you to listen. 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.240
 is 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.409
 It's what I said, the bike is great. 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.740
 played totally different than the 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:09.619
 people had with xj6 also with the ninja 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.800
 zx 9 and the other motorcycles that we are 

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:16.629
 used to walking but it's a bike 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.629
 quite nice 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:22.839
 it's very cool 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.839
 I like it too much, let's see what we 

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:29.779
 that happens even more if you stay as the 

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:35.330
 dream 

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:38.149

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.099
