00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.290 
the camera and they've got a spot here
where<00:02:06.719> they've<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.619> clear<00:02:07.920> area<00:02:08.300> where

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
where they've it's a clear area where

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.140 
where they've it's a clear area where
they<00:02:09.450> expose<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.920> area<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.520> speaker<00:02:12.000> so

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
they expose the area for the speaker so

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.980 
they expose the area for the speaker so
you<00:02:12.239> don't<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.480> any

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
you don't have any

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.280 
you don't have any
offering<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.500> sound<00:02:14.190> quality<00:02:14.820> at<00:02:15.030> all<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.750> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
offering of sound quality at all on the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.230 
offering of sound quality at all on the
new<00:02:16.410> outer<00:02:16.590> box<00:02:16.920> now<00:02:17.640> I'm<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.970> open<00:02:18.060> up

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
new outer box now I'm going to open up

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.090 
new outer box now I'm going to open up
the<00:02:18.390> back<00:02:18.570> here<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.260> used<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.590> be<00:02:19.740> actually<00:02:20.070> a

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
the back here this used to be actually a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.710 
the back here this used to be actually a
slide-out<00:02:20.490> P<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.330> actually<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.600> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
slide-out P so this is actually not a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.280 
slide-out P so this is actually not a
piece<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:22.130> foam<00:02:23.130> rubber<00:02:23.840> that's<00:02:24.840> actually<00:02:25.020> got

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
piece of foam rubber that's actually got

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.080 
piece of foam rubber that's actually got
a<00:02:26.090> polycarbonate<00:02:28.430> underside<00:02:29.430> here<00:02:29.460> so<00:02:29.940> this

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
a polycarbonate underside here so this

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.720 
a polycarbonate underside here so this
is<00:02:30.180> actually<00:02:30.270> stuck<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.200> rubber<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> to

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
is actually stuck to the rubber so to

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.640 
is actually stuck to the rubber so to
speak<00:02:33.000> but<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.750> actually<00:02:33.900> close<00:02:34.350> this

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
speak but you can actually close this

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.900 
speak but you can actually close this
completely<00:02:35.570> these<00:02:36.570> actually<00:02:36.960> will

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
completely these actually will

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.310 
completely these actually will
essentially<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:40.770> know<00:02:40.890> stick<00:02:41.280> in<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.660> you

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
essentially you know stick in and you

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.020 
essentially you know stick in and you
can<00:02:43.470> actually<00:02:43.620> pull<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.130> rubber<00:02:44.430> flap<00:02:44.760> out

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
can actually pull this rubber flap out

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.960 
can actually pull this rubber flap out
and<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.420> will<00:02:45.540> expose<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.430> charging

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
and that will expose the the charging

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.610 
and that will expose the the charging
mechanism<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.660> don't<00:02:48.840> have<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.020> ever<00:02:49.170> pull

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
mechanism so you don't have to ever pull

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.610 
mechanism so you don't have to ever pull
this<00:02:49.770> outer<00:02:50.010> box<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:51.330> ipad<00:02:51.690> ab<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.140> otterbox

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
this outer box the ipad ab the otterbox

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.530 
this outer box the ipad ab the otterbox
case<00:02:52.980> which<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.340> pretty<00:02:53.550> nice<00:02:53.790> as<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.240> can<00:02:54.390> see

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
case which is pretty nice as you can see

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.890 
case which is pretty nice as you can see
just<00:02:54.570> like<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.020> old<00:02:55.170> otterbox<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:57.360> control

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
just like the old otterbox the control

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.270 
just like the old otterbox the control
mechanisms<00:02:58.610> for<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.880> volume<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.050> also<00:03:01.950> for

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
mechanisms for the volume and also for

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.740 
mechanisms for the volume and also for
the<00:03:02.490> this<00:03:02.910> orientation<00:03:03.450> walk<00:03:04.460> /<00:03:05.570> but<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the this orientation walk / but the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.330 
the this orientation walk / but the
other<00:03:06.870> function<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.530> uses<00:03:07.740> i<00:03:07.980> think<00:03:08.190> was

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
other function that it uses i think was

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.820 
other function that it uses i think was
the<00:03:08.760> mute<00:03:09.180> button<00:03:09.380> which<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.680> select

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
the mute button which you can select

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.400 
the mute button which you can select
from<00:03:11.130> in<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.610> software<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.110> fully

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
from in the software is it fully

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.780 
from in the software is it fully
accessible<00:03:13.830> from<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.250> case<00:03:14.550> of<00:03:15.270> course<00:03:16.790> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
accessible from the case of course the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.520 
accessible from the case of course the
top<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.420> otterbox<00:03:20.030> functions<00:03:21.380> just<00:03:22.380> like

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
top of the otterbox functions just like

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.490 
top of the otterbox functions just like
it<00:03:22.770> did<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.370> previous<00:03:23.640> model<00:03:24.230> but<00:03:25.230> one<00:03:25.410> of

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
it did in the previous model but one of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.320 
it did in the previous model but one of
the<00:03:25.560> nice<00:03:25.740> things<00:03:25.770> about<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:26.760> i'll<00:03:27.300> show

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
the nice things about it and i'll show

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.080 
the nice things about it and i'll show
you<00:03:27.540> here<00:03:27.840> from<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.140> picture<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:29.700> said<00:03:29.880> you

this this stand open right but now i can
really<00:03:36.300> do<00:03:36.420> one<00:03:36.810> hand<00:03:37.020> i<00:03:37.080> slide<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.770> over<00:03:37.980> like

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
really do one hand i slide it over like

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.150 
really do one hand i slide it over like
that<00:03:38.370> right<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.450> now<00:03:40.020> i<00:03:40.080> can<00:03:40.410> just<00:03:40.650> put<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.010> IE

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
that right and now i can just put the IE

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.410 
that right and now i can just put the IE
ipad<00:03:42.230> either<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.470> way<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.760> though<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.210> got

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
ipad either this way so though it's got

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.690 
ipad either this way so though it's got
a<00:03:45.450> nice<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:46.620> can<00:03:46.710> actually<00:03:47.010> type<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.490> way

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
a nice you can actually type this way

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.950 
a nice you can actually type this way
which<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:47.940> kind<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.210> cool<00:03:48.270> because<00:03:48.480> it's<00:03:48.720> on<00:03:48.810> an

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
which is kind of cool because it's on an

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.890 
which is kind of cool because it's on an
angle<00:03:49.140> so<00:03:50.130> it's<00:03:50.520> got<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.670> good<00:03:50.940> viewing<00:03:51.390> angle

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
angle so it's got a good viewing angle

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.420 
angle so it's got a good viewing angle
as<00:03:52.050> well<00:03:52.080> as<00:03:52.500> being<00:03:52.710> able<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> use<00:03:53.010> this<00:03:53.250> for

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
as well as being able to use this for

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.360 
as well as being able to use this for
typing<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.900> if<00:03:55.020> you<00:03:55.170> look<00:03:55.350> at<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.860> it's<00:03:56.220> about

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
typing so if you look at the it's about

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.300 
typing so if you look at the it's about
a<00:03:56.900> look<00:03:57.900> about<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.170> thirty<00:03:58.560> percent<00:03:59.010> great

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
a look about a thirty percent great

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.760 
a look about a thirty percent great
angle<00:03:59.730> here<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.630> this<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.960> nice<00:04:01.140> for<00:04:01.350> taking<00:04:01.680> on

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
angle here so this is nice for taking on

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.650 
angle here so this is nice for taking on
a<00:04:01.800> trip<00:04:02.100> if<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.370> don't<00:04:02.520> want<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.820> have<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.480> deal

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
a trip if you don't want to have to deal

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.510 
a trip if you don't want to have to deal
with<00:04:03.780> like<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.960> keyboard<00:04:04.800> or<00:04:04.890> anything<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.370> you

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
with like a keyboard or anything but you

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.490

one hand I don't feel like it's going to

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.680 
one hand I don't feel like it's going to
fall<00:04:30.720> out<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:31.050> my<00:04:31.199> hand<00:04:31.530> it's<00:04:31.740> got<00:04:31.949> good<00:04:32.250> grip

fall out of my hand it's got good grip

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.180 
fall out of my hand it's got good grip
it<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.840> of<00:04:34.050> course<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.470> same<00:04:34.680> price<00:04:34.949> as<00:04:35.160> the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
it is of course the same price as the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.020 
it is of course the same price as the
previous<00:04:35.669> model<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:37.350> is<00:04:37.380> not<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.919> cheek<00:04:38.430> case<00:04:38.729> by

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
previous model it is not a cheek case by

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.580 
previous model it is not a cheek case by
any<00:04:39.180> stretch<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.660> imagination<00:04:39.720> but<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.530> do

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
any stretch of the imagination but I do

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.040 
any stretch of the imagination but I do
think<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.010> is<00:04:41.040> when<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.460> best<00:04:42.050> protective

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
think it is when the best protective

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.620 
think it is when the best protective
hard<00:04:43.350> shell<00:04:43.800> cases<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.970> can<00:04:45.000> buy<00:04:45.270> for<00:04:45.330> the

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
hard shell cases you can buy for the

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.050 
hard shell cases you can buy for the
ipad<00:04:46.020> i<00:04:46.050> mean<00:04:46.410> it'll<00:04:46.560> handle<00:04:46.860> any<00:04:47.250> normal

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
ipad i mean it'll handle any normal

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.350 
ipad i mean it'll handle any normal
daily<00:04:48.570> knocks<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.199> bumps<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.710> stuff<00:04:50.360> and

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
daily knocks and bumps and stuff and

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.719 
daily knocks and bumps and stuff and
again<00:04:51.930> it's<00:04:52.139> a<00:04:52.290> fully<00:04:52.650> enclosed<00:04:53.010> case

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729
