00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.320
 here I finished the first round is 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.809
 important that I tell them how to start 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.180
 the how to finish and how to climb 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.430
 second round in the case of the point of 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.770
 visa that was the point we saw there is 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.780
 very weird that we use a second 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.570
 returns but 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.730
 the same is going to be here look at the technique 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.000
 let's say it's the same what you have to 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.250
 to know is how many chains we need 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.980
 lift the spin we said that with two 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.330
 so here I am going to weave two chains 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.570
 a two after knitting he grabbed my 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.090
 tissue and look at this is the right side 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.160
 of tissue the tissue always has a 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.420
 reverse and a right this is the side 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.120
 right we hit it now this one 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.790
 he appreciates on the wrong side like here 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.150
 we are knitting let's say that this weave 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.890
 is going to be with two views or is going to see 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.170
 same on the one hand for the other because 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.260
 we are weaving one lap up 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.570
 for the right and one turn for the reverse 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.340
 then already the two chains woven this 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.770
 as I was saying is what gives us height 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.420
 but this defines as a point like 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.820
 then here as we are saying the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.860
 half a point we are giving height with the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.340
 two chains and these count as if 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.159
 out a point so these two chains 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.080
 come out of this last point do you mean 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.590
 that this last point 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.810
 we are only going to weave if I put here the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.880
 hook and I knit a point nor that I woven 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.740
 will start to grow then not 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.390
 we want that right now we will not talk 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.730
 of increases or decreases 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.100
 we're just going to talk about a fabric 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.400
 straight 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.080
 ok now to continue let's weave in 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.600
 This is not because we already said that this one 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.850
 corresponds to this one in which he is still here 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.850
 It is very easy to see where each point goes 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.049
 because look at each hole counts as 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.600
 one here we put the easy hook goes 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.640
 alone without biting on the strand but 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.450
 I want you to see that in the part of 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.709
 two centuries remain on the hook 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.629
 ok since we had it we took the room 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.959
 we take out we have already there the two centuries 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.739
 we take the room and we go back to draw another 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.980
 once we put the hook here we take the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.840
 room 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.950
 we change our fingers our 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.299
 position and now if we have another thrown 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.299
 taking out the last 2 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.220
 that's how we're getting this second 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:50.069
 back I will knit all these points 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.220
 to see how it ends or should 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.160
 finishing the round is also important 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.390
 that they know how to finish it when 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.569
 they have a return of the points because 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.810
 the finished in chains and points is 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.120
 different so that you know how 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.459
 you see the fabric at the end and where 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.360
 where to finish and what are the points 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.180
 so 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.850
 is the penultimate point if it is fixed you see 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.270
 very well defined we put leave 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.200
 our half point now this that you see 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.300
 here as a knot 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.600
 these are the two chains that we made to you 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.520
 in a beginning to give height to the return 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.480
 so here what we are going to do is 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.150
 take this little chain here look they look 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.700
 these two little tricks those are the ones we 're going 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.330
 to take me here I'm going to help with 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.330
 these fingers 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.620
 they are fixed 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.830
 sometimes it does not happen then 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.599
 sometimes it does not go in then then but here 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.610
 for example if you grab a single 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.890
 thread is also valid but it depends 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.930
 of what they are weaving then here 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:05.650
 I try to find 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.750
 well and there are the centuries that are the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.359
 that remain above the hook took the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.840
 Sala saco and I have here my two threads 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:17.500
 again he took the room and pulled out here I already 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:21.130
 I finished my tour and I want you to see that 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.889
 It looks even on one side and on the other ok 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.520
 to start the third round is to weave 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:31.419
 again two chains we flipped the fabric 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:35.110
 and we like to jump this and in this 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:38.169
 follow and we continue our means 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.680
 points in these videos I'm just 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:44.380
 talking about each specific point 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.750
 this is so that they know very well these 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.740
 points and already known we'll see 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:55.210
 triangular decreases increases 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.680
 circular this is then basically 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.550
 this is what I wanted you to 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.590
 see and you will see that with these three points 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.620
 that we have learned that is the point 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.240
 chain point of visa and half a point with 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.960
 these you are going to have a great 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.180
 Advance 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.460
 in his knowledge in crochet 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.460
 with these three points you can already 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.340
 weave something complete I hope it is 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.500
 very useful thank you for being here and so 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.020
 do not hesitate to subscribe for free to 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.020
 be fine until the next
