of what's been going on with the me3
first<00:01:05.170> off<00:01:05.379> pretty<00:01:06.160> much<00:01:06.310> everything<00:01:06.729> that

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
first off pretty much everything that

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.520 
first off pretty much everything that
wasn't<00:01:07.000> on<00:01:07.149> the<00:01:07.180> Black<00:01:07.450> Mamba<00:01:07.690> is<00:01:07.899> now<00:01:08.140> on<00:01:08.410> the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
wasn't on the Black Mamba is now on the

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.260 
wasn't on the Black Mamba is now on the
me3<00:01:09.180> we've<00:01:10.180> got<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.420> Hobby<00:01:10.600> wing<00:01:11.550> 60s<00:01:12.550> C<00:01:13.000> and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
me3 we've got the Hobby wing 60s C and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.669 
me3 we've got the Hobby wing 60s C and
then<00:01:14.050> we<00:01:14.110> got<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.380> newer<00:01:14.560> 3900<00:01:15.399> kV<00:01:16.679> updated

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
then we got the newer 3900 kV updated

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.510 
then we got the newer 3900 kV updated
the<00:01:17.770> fan<00:01:18.039> on<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.420> 60<00:01:19.420> amp<00:01:19.599> hobby<00:01:20.440> wing<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:21.280> the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
the fan on the 60 amp hobby wing to the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.040 
the fan on the 60 amp hobby wing to the
12<00:01:22.119> volt<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.679> watch<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.099> video<00:01:25.000> 51<00:01:25.899> miles

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
12 volt if you watch the video 51 miles

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.960 
12 volt if you watch the video 51 miles
an<00:01:26.200> hour<00:01:26.380> video<00:01:26.500> you'll<00:01:27.310> see<00:01:27.399> that<00:01:27.550> I<00:01:27.729> had<00:01:27.940> a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
an hour video you'll see that I had a

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.320 
an hour video you'll see that I had a
thermal<00:01:28.300> shutdown<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.789> was<00:01:30.970> mainly

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
thermal shutdown and that was mainly

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.779 
thermal shutdown and that was mainly
because<00:01:31.599> the<00:01:32.050> II<00:01:32.080> got<00:01:32.740> too<00:01:32.920> hot<00:01:33.130> because<00:01:33.369> there

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
because the II got too hot because there

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.660 
because the II got too hot because there
was<00:01:33.910> only<00:01:34.179> like<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.890> seven<00:01:35.890> point<00:01:36.039> four<00:01:36.340> volt

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
was only like a seven point four volt

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.240 
was only like a seven point four volt
cooling<00:01:37.630> fan<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.170> so<00:01:38.770> now<00:01:38.890> I've<00:01:39.009> got<00:01:39.160> the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
cooling fan on it so now I've got the

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.919 
cooling fan on it so now I've got the
new<00:01:39.420> 12<00:01:40.420> volt<00:01:40.599> fan<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.209> I<00:01:43.270> need<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.569> fan

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
new 12 volt fan not that I need the fan

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.550 
new 12 volt fan not that I need the fan
on<00:01:44.229> the<00:01:44.590> 3900<00:01:45.280> kV<00:01:45.880> motor<00:01:46.090> but<00:01:46.899> I<00:01:47.200> went<00:01:47.470> ahead

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
on the 3900 kV motor but I went ahead

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.850 
on the 3900 kV motor but I went ahead
and<00:01:47.739> put<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:47.950> on<00:01:48.039> there<00:01:48.340> because<00:01:49.500> I'm<00:01:50.500> gonna<00:01:50.679> be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
and put it on there because I'm gonna be

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.830 
and put it on there because I'm gonna be
putting<00:01:51.130> some<00:01:51.280> years<00:01:51.580> on<00:01:51.880> here<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.539> know<00:01:52.569> that

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
putting some years on here you know that

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.050 
putting some years on here you know that
are<00:01:52.959> probably<00:01:54.090> way<00:01:55.090> over<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:56.080> creek<00:01:56.380> amended

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
are probably way over the creek amended

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.290 
are probably way over the creek amended
efficiency<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.179> that<00:01:58.209> motor<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.340> don't<00:02:01.179> want

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
efficiency of that motor so I don't want

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.570 
efficiency of that motor so I don't want
to<00:02:01.360> just<00:02:01.569> blow<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.959> up<00:02:02.050> just<00:02:02.590> in<00:02:02.709> one<00:02:02.920> shot<00:02:03.190> so<00:02:03.550> I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
to just blow it up just in one shot so I

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.330 
to just blow it up just in one shot so I
put<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.000> put<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.390> fan<00:02:04.599> on<00:02:04.720> there<00:02:04.899> for<00:02:05.050> that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
put the put the fan on there for that

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.070 
put the put the fan on there for that
but<00:02:06.340> also<00:02:06.369> as<00:02:07.209> you<00:02:07.360> can<00:02:07.390> see<00:02:07.569> right<00:02:07.720> here<00:02:07.780> we've

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
but also as you can see right here we've

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.260 
but also as you can see right here we've
got<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.470> B<00:02:08.950> EC<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:10.450> there<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:12.120> pretty<00:02:13.120> much

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
got the B EC right there and pretty much

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.330 
got the B EC right there and pretty much
it's<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.750> like<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.290> Mamba<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.650> it's<00:02:18.099> just<00:02:18.220> a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
it's is like the Mamba but it's just a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.130 
it's is like the Mamba but it's just a
little<00:02:18.459> different<00:02:18.790> basically<00:02:19.480> what<00:02:19.780> what

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
little different basically what what

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.700 
little different basically what what
you're<00:02:20.290> looking<00:02:20.560> at<00:02:20.710> is<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.780> nitro<00:02:22.780> Rustler

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
you're looking at is a nitro Rustler

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.020 
you're looking at is a nitro Rustler
just<00:02:25.190> convert<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:26.350> mid-engine<00:02:28.030> right

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
just convert it to the mid-engine right

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.440 
just convert it to the mid-engine right
in<00:02:29.180> here<00:02:30.220> made<00:02:31.220> into<00:02:31.490> a<00:02:31.520> slash<00:02:31.880> because

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
in here made into a slash because

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.120 
in here made into a slash because

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
everything is pretty much the nitro

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.200 
everything is pretty much the nitro
