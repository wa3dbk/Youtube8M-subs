section<00:00:47.109> nice<00:00:47.260> they<00:00:47.440> don't<00:00:47.680> need<00:00:47.769> to<00:00:47.890> brief

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
section nice they don't need to brief

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.259 
section nice they don't need to brief
the<00:00:48.129> sails<00:00:48.339> but<00:00:48.550> this<00:00:48.699> is<00:00:48.850> part<00:00:49.119> of<00:00:49.210> the

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
the sails but this is part of the

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.529 
the sails but this is part of the
concept<00:00:49.570> so<00:00:50.229> he'd<00:00:51.190> sell<00:00:51.399> this<00:00:51.579> filled<00:00:51.879> up<00:00:52.119> if

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
concept so he'd sell this filled up if

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.719 
concept so he'd sell this filled up if
you<00:00:52.629> take<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:52.839> look<00:00:53.019> at<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.350> sheet<00:00:53.949> here<00:00:54.280> it's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
you take a look at the sheet here it's

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:56.369 
you take a look at the sheet here it's
kinda<00:00:54.909> at<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.059> wrong<00:00:55.210> angle<00:00:55.420> because<00:00:56.260> the

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
kinda at the wrong angle because the

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.319 
kinda at the wrong angle because the
sails<00:00:56.589> are<00:00:56.799> filled<00:00:57.010> so<00:00:57.579> really<00:00:57.940> what<00:00:58.059> we<00:00:58.180> want

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
sails are filled so really what we want

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:59.609 
sails are filled so really what we want
to<00:00:58.390> do<00:00:58.510> is<00:00:58.659> we<00:00:58.780> want<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:58.960> be<00:00:59.049> able<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.260> move<00:00:59.379> the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:00:59.619 
to do is we want to be able to move the

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.029 
to do is we want to be able to move the
car<00:00:59.859> forward<00:01:00.479> but<00:01:01.479> you<00:01:02.469> can't<00:01:02.680> really<00:01:02.799> do<00:01:03.010> that

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
car forward but you can't really do that

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.710 
car forward but you can't really do that
cuz<00:01:03.399> there's<00:01:03.549> tension<00:01:03.760> on<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.299> line<00:01:04.420> here

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
cuz there's tension on the line here

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.840 
cuz there's tension on the line here
well<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.289> lot<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:05.950> tension<00:01:06.100> today<00:01:06.310> but<00:01:06.580> most<00:01:06.759> the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
well a lot of tension today but most the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.460 
well a lot of tension today but most the
time<00:01:06.940> you<00:01:07.330> can't<00:01:07.569> move<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.259> car<00:01:08.440> forward

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
time you can't move the car forward

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.690 
time you can't move the car forward
because<00:01:08.860> there's<00:01:09.009> so<00:01:09.069> much<00:01:09.190> tension<00:01:09.399> on<00:01:09.610> the

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.790 
look at that we've made the lazy sheet
into<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:57.849> working<00:01:58.300> sheet<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:59.289> now<00:01:59.500> we<00:01:59.560> can

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
into a working sheet so now we can

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.710 
into a working sheet so now we can
release<00:02:00.160> I<00:02:01.440> can<00:02:02.440> come<00:02:02.619> back<00:02:02.709> here<00:02:02.769> and<00:02:03.099> release

release I can come back here and release

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.229 
release I can come back here and release
off<00:02:04.720> on<00:02:04.989> the<00:02:05.170> working<00:02:05.739> sheet<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.940> we're<00:02:07.090> still

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239 
off on the working sheet and we're still

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:11.420 
off on the working sheet and we're still
sailing<00:02:07.539> along<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.950> now<00:02:09.399> there's<00:02:09.640> no<00:02:09.670> tension

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
