00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.340
 Become a red Audi AG 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.640
 I asked him to let us know something 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.329
 but something to drink 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:11.979
 increasingly in the limelight 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:14.979
 not because you have salary 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
 how did you do what he wanted 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.220
 so i dont place to abuse 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.990
 you can find it for every situation 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.990
 Perhaps not statistically speaking, they are currently in the room 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.280
 fleet determination of the Federation has brought unprecedented successes 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.490
 no other choice 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.650
 I think I can result in the procedure that the cash 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.570
 neither the computer nor the provisions have been for years 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.230
 maybe not right that he is not doing better but that the best 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.580
 Card action maybe not but I know that I am the capital 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.100
 have a lot to offer this year but hardly come 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.190
 I bought yes 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.080
 de Kok today handed over to Munster is a great deal to create but commanded 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.880
 for Apple's iPad via Micro InterScan is the lightest I have no privilege 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.290
 the space travel at the same time have worked very hard 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.430
 8 years the bishoprics came 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.260
 what would the local sheep have stolen or you just full of garbage freighters 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
 with garbage he set on Iceland 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.860
 if she can not stand any fun 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 that's enough to get to know it 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 In the interest of completeness, I would suggest peer pressure 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.680
 I was sure to bid with you and I wanted to work as well 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.080
 Weather satellite monitoring 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.820
 the spacemen are the more complex this is 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.210
 completely stopped this year 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.000
 Thank you 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.380
 nice young 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.500
 But I really want to be able to totally my opinion if you 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.239
 Skills the community has to eat with is the teams 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.689
 only logical answer Jan Dehner necessarily 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.139
 and get this foreigner
