00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
time still on the top but that must mean

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.770 
time still on the top but that must mean
that<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.899> only<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.890> four<00:00:44.250> twos<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:45.239> since<00:00:45.719> I

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
only have four cards wrong actually I

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.790 
only have four cards wrong actually I
have<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> ten<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> deck<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.750> well<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:49.710> the
