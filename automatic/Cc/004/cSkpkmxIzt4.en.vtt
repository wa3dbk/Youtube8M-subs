00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.660
 obviously I have to thank you that I 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.550
 followed by jim between 60 therefore from the epoch 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.199

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.029

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.210
 it will also happen to you to have one 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.520

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.930
 the other and enjoy full veil though 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.700
