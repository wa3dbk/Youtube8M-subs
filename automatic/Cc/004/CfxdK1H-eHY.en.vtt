 the possibility of bending to form 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.899
 the strength of a modern noble material

 observing the objects that surround us 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.750
 we find out that aluminum is a day that is not re

 with the most varied forms for the most diverse uses 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.910
 we use it to protect our food and our park
