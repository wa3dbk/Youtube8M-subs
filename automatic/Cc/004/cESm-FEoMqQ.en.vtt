00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.970 

as<00:01:31.850> time<00:01:32.180> went<00:01:32.300> on<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:33.080> fisheries<00:01:33.470> changed

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
as time went on the fisheries changed

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.450 
as time went on the fisheries changed
the<00:01:34.190> fish<00:01:34.370> to<00:01:34.520> begin<00:01:34.820> being<00:01:35.810> further<00:01:36.110> out<00:01:36.460> the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
the fish to begin being further out the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.980 
the fish to begin being further out the
fisheries<00:01:37.790> were<00:01:37.910> getting<00:01:38.120> fished<00:01:38.330> out<00:01:38.510> the

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
fisheries were getting fished out the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.210 
fisheries were getting fished out the
boats<00:01:39.170> had<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.410> go<00:01:39.500> farther<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:39.830> farther<00:01:40.040> out

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
boats had to go farther and farther out

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.070 
boats had to go farther and farther out
obviously<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.120> smaller<00:01:41.240> boats<00:01:41.660> we're<00:01:41.870> having

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
obviously the smaller boats we're having

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.310 
obviously the smaller boats we're having
a<00:01:42.140> harder<00:01:42.380> time<00:01:42.410> making<00:01:42.830> that<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.730> travel

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
a harder time making that that travel

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.990 
a harder time making that that travel
also<00:01:45.320> as<00:01:45.530> time<00:01:45.740> went<00:01:45.890> on<00:01:45.980> and<00:01:46.520> just<00:01:46.730> became

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
also as time went on and just became

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.450 
also as time went on and just became
bigger<00:01:47.270> more<00:01:47.570> powerful<00:01:47.620> technology<00:01:48.620> a<00:01:48.800> lot<00:01:49.340> of

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
bigger more powerful technology a lot of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.370 
bigger more powerful technology a lot of
fishermen<00:01:49.640> opted<00:01:50.120> for<00:01:50.300> bigger<00:01:50.600> operations<00:01:51.200> to

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
fishermen opted for bigger operations to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:11.600 
fishermen opted for bigger operations to
make<00:01:51.530> more<00:01:51.680> money

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.640 

so<00:02:12.610> these<00:02:13.090> being<00:02:13.330> would<00:02:13.570> eventually<00:02:14.380> they

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
so these being would eventually they

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.830 
so these being would eventually they
started<00:02:14.950> rotting<00:02:15.250> away<00:02:15.280> wood<00:02:15.820> rocks<00:02:16.030> you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
started rotting away wood rocks you

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.050 
started rotting away wood rocks you
don't<00:02:17.020> take<00:02:17.170> care<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.620> it's<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.190> 24/7<00:02:18.850> job

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
don't take care of it it's a 24/7 job

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.110 
don't take care of it it's a 24/7 job
taking<00:02:19.570> care<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.780> what<00:02:19.900> we<00:02:19.930> both

fishermen<00:02:21.930> who<00:02:22.019> started<00:02:22.319> neglecting<00:02:22.470> these

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
fishermen who started neglecting these

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.289 
fishermen who started neglecting these
boats<00:02:23.040> began<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.549> see<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.790> boats<00:02:23.970> rotting

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
boats began to see the boats rotting

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.080 
boats began to see the boats rotting
away<00:02:25.129> deteriorating<00:02:26.129> sinking<00:02:26.610> getting<00:02:26.909> cut

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
away deteriorating sinking getting cut

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.430

up<00:02:27.140> little<00:02:28.140> by<00:02:28.349> little<00:02:29.599> boats<00:02:30.599> were<00:02:30.720> gone<00:02:30.870> now

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
up little by little boats were gone now

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.229 
up little by little boats were gone now
today<00:02:31.799> pretty<00:02:32.129> much<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:32.970> biggest

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
today pretty much this is the biggest

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.869 
today pretty much this is the biggest
