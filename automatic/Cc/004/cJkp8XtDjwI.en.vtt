00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 service and joy of gambling cordially 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.130
 Welcome to a new must 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.940
 imagination today there is one for you 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:16.500
 unhealthy new holland telescopic loader from 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:20.220
 free the holland dlc pack yes there is 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.020
 to the child than I pc-version to my 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.420
 It does not take long to find out 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.820
 that is a risk, however, very much 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.760
 very horny risks couple things are 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:36.149
 Otherwise, I'll show you the james cook 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.040
 means 536 point 70 agri exactly I would 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.540
 let's get the new holland 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.620
 and we can do it a bit 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.379
 compare what you naturally to each 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.969
 sure , the tires are different 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.750
 we'll see that right now , we say 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.570
 always put it in a row and 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.219
 look at what the mature 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.359
 yes 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.260
 These are the ones after all 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.180
 are a bit different 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.220
 You can say that I can find here 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.200
 These are, for example, those of the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.920
 choppers have 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.409
 steeper edges or whatever you call it 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.900
 fall or somehow the advice 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.479
 distance is pretty much the same 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.650
 Generally we have to go here 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.610
 Textures look and it is actually 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.500
 the madness 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.189
 that could really be original jesse 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.520
 like its so good the texture is like this 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.310
 good are the rims so is the substructure 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.540
 And also in the rear area of ​​this sticker 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.049
 high-resolution so that's not so 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.640
 high resolution but I will be times 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.860
 exactly say the quality of giants 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 that's usually why it fits 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.290
 good it is not about perfect but it 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.320
 is very very good and I think so 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.479
 You can definitely see it here 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.579
 me as an alternative really nice really good 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.770
 Compared to the new holland what we 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.490
 changed here is very funny and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.219
 Although it is here 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.700
 this never holland logo that one 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.890
 apparently not get away that sort of 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.330
 firmly anchored to the model is and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.170
 they have the principle remedy 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.620
 created and have 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.840
 made that easy here in front 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.760
 the logo somehow works out then 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.060
 it's just just a smooth one 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.530
 Of course, surface is not even even 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.300
 if he still has a game in front or 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.220
 that would have gone well, too 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.150
 I say 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.739
 otherwise, as I said, not much 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.020
 otherwise we can test times briefly 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.610
 but otherwise top speed is 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.220
 I think that would have to be forty 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.090
 his or her 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.519
 otherwise the same one can yes 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.010
 the same tools for the front look 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.470
 So you have everything right there 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 40 top speed and easy 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.550
 blinker everything works but for it 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.920
 that this again chelsea risks so 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.840
 looks great there are five of me here 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.670
 Just do not forget the stars 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.610
 in the side is that chelsea below in 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.840
 the door inside great it is the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.840
 others on it too nerstedt me on it 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.890
 somewhere else a logo good roof 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.450
 anyway, this grid is clear here, too 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.280
 that's basically the same in principle 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.569
 Of course you have the color here 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.780
 done differently here in front 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.920
 this black area is here 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.670
 was also in yellow and scanned 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.970
 otherwise, as I said, yes 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.350
 nothing what would otherwise find 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.700
 but as I said this version visually 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.489
 simply much more appealing and much 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.230
 horny and respect that of the 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.299
 texture so good so 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.150
 High resolution water with this 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.250
 short crisp mod showing in the shop 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.489
 Take a quick look and you'll have to pay us 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.930
 the 58 1300 euro you see here the the 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.430
 holland is 2 ps more and more of your performance 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.840
 the cost is less the picture 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.760
 Absolutely okay with the logo, too 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.040
 perfect what more could you want 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.890
 and I think the lok would have 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.430
 actually almost certainly bug-free 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.739
 his 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.090
 that 's her, that's wonderful too 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.620
 I say goodbye to these words 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.620
 makes good service
