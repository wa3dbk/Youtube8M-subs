00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the computer to reset so that when we

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.849 
the computer to reset so that when we
get<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> new<00:00:21.510> exhaust<00:00:21.810> system<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.740> will

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
get the new exhaust system on it will

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.590 
get the new exhaust system on it will
reconfigure<00:00:23.250> itself<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> new<00:00:24.300> exhaust

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
reconfigure itself to the new exhaust

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.179 
reconfigure itself to the new exhaust
and<00:00:25.109> then<00:00:25.230> we'll<00:00:25.350> go<00:00:25.439> under<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> vehicle<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and then we'll go under the vehicle and

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.400 
and then we'll go under the vehicle and
start<00:00:26.460> disconnecting<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.029> old<00:00:27.210> exhaust<00:00:27.449> this

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
start disconnecting the old exhaust this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.109 
start disconnecting the old exhaust this
is<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> catback<00:00:29.010> system<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.730> we're<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.060> be

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
is a catback system so we're going to be

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
is a catback system so we're going to be
moving<00:00:30.449> from<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.840> exhaust<00:00:31.349> tips<00:00:31.679> all<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.160> way

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
moving from the exhaust tips all the way

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.970 
moving from the exhaust tips all the way
up<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> disconnect<00:00:33.930> point<00:00:34.170> behind<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
up to the disconnect point behind the

up to the disconnect point behind the
catalytic<00:00:35.370> converter<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.780> need<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> unbolt

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
catalytic converter so we need to unbolt

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.010 
catalytic converter so we need to unbolt
the<00:00:37.770> flange<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.760> from<00:00:39.239> these<00:00:39.329> two<00:00:39.540> bolts<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
hangers because we're going to be

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.840 
hangers because we're going to be
reusing<00:01:00.000> those<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.420> their<00:01:00.539> reinstallation

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
reusing those for their reinstallation

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.060 
reusing those for their reinstallation
and<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.359> also<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.650> forward<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and then also here just forward of the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
and then also here just forward of the
main<00:01:05.250> exhaust<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> disconnect<00:01:06.720> each

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
main exhaust we want to disconnect each

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.609 
main exhaust we want to disconnect each
round<00:01:07.560> wire<00:01:07.740> off<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.240> motor<00:01:09.240> scooter<00:01:09.619> we

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
round wire off of the motor scooter we

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.929 
round wire off of the motor scooter we
can<00:01:10.740> go<00:01:10.830> ahead<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.010> start<00:01:11.189> disassembling<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
can go ahead and start disassembling it

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.730 
can go ahead and start disassembling it
but<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> definitely<00:01:12.510> recommend<00:01:12.720> spraying<00:01:13.619> down

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
but I definitely recommend spraying down

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.039 
but I definitely recommend spraying down
all<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> bolts<00:01:14.310> first<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> lubricant

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
all the bolts first with a lubricant

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.710 
all the bolts first with a lubricant
like<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.200> wd-40<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:17.729> they're<00:01:18.450> likely

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
like a wd-40 because they're likely

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
like a wd-40 because they're likely
going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.990> rusted<00:01:19.200> they'll<00:01:20.100> help<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> ease

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
going to be rusted they'll help to ease

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.270 
going to be rusted they'll help to ease
and<00:01:20.729> removal<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> nuts

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.460 

next<00:01:28.280> we're<00:01:28.370> to<00:01:28.430> go<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.820> flange<00:01:29.290> just<00:01:30.290> rear

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
next we're to go to the flange just rear

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.500 
next we're to go to the flange just rear
rid<00:01:30.590> of<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.770> exhaust<00:01:31.090> we're<00:01:32.090> go<00:01:32.150> ahead<00:01:32.390> remove
