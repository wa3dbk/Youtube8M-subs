00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.340
 all this breaks my head with a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:16.560
 puzzle and look and ready and that I 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.949
 I found I really won to swim with 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.949
 the tubes 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 welcome aboard 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.070
 Welcome to the small port of Villamil 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.960
 on the isabela island place from where 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.660
 we left to go in search of a 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.350
 desolate island that is replete with 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.350
 sharks 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.110
 During the trip we have the luck of 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.500
 a very unusual company and that's why a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.500
 playtime 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.680
 the almost extinct hawksbill turtle 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.289
 pursued to turn it into combs or 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.049
 eyeglasses very rarely about these 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.509
 islands and although their sizes smaller than that of 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.250
 any species in Galapagos is one of 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.250
 the most beautiful in the world 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.479
 the recess is over and we continue our trip 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.479
 because the sky is about to fall 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.659
 the weather is not promising but we are 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.149
 we just have to cross some 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.569
 volcanic reefs and if we get it 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.380
 let's get to the dark island of 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.380
 the Sharks 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.369
 we disembark and it is very important 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.369
 combine to be picked up 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.799
 Ready my problem 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.530
 no no no 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.150
 do not worry, good, stay calm 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.110
 do not give thanks 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.110
 do not forget to look for us 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.209
 the boat is going and will not come back but that 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.819
 history comes later for now so 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.500
 we were left alone on the island of 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.620
 the Sharks 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.630
 ayayay the island is totally 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.760
 uninhabited by man and there is no 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.030
 wired or signal to communicate with 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.810
 nobody is just a piece of lava in the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.810
 middle of nowhere 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.620
 walking is very difficult because lava is 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.730
 bankruptcy and we are making way because 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.370
 nobody before I floor all this this short 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.760
 a lot but I assure you that much more than 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 a silhouette 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.430
 surrounded by the Pacific Ocean and in 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.290
 company of some sea lions that 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.400
 very well 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.400
 we did not fall 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.030
 and it's better not to bother them because they have 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.030
 very good memory 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.890
 let's go to the water 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.810
 all right 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.940
 with the legs inside the things that 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.420
 they recommended us not to enter just in case 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.460
 first we lower the little water chamber and 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.660
 this way we see if there are sharks without 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.660
 risk too much 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.010
 there are sharks and they are not few if 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.200
 you think too much you do not come 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.350
 Join us because alone we are not going to 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.350
 to put 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.250
 the background is very irregular for a moment 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.250
 it came down and suddenly an abyss appears 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.470
 as the sharks moved away a little 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.770
 maybe to study they appeared to us 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.120
 two wolves and guess who was he if the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.860
 that on the shore he ran away angry 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.500
 but underwater if they keep coming 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.010
 those of us who are going to run away are 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.010
 we 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.720
 to older 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.240
 the female is in heat and for that reason 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.400
 the male if we get too close we 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.400
 we could see but we are at risk 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.130
 because it pays very rarely 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.639
 sees a mating of sea lions in 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.639
 freedom 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.100
 for me 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.660
 I do not know if he screams with happiness or why 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.570
 culini is falling nice but 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.570
 have a bad thing couple do not 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.930
 they say that everything arrives and it is true that 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.930
 the moment of revenge 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.710
 never 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.540
 with the sky totally closed and the 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.760
 water a little more cloudy this is our 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.970
 last chance to see if we have 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.210
 the bad luck of meeting the 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.110
 sharks 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.150
 and 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.000
 and when we thought that they were not going to 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.120
 appear we realized that we were 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.120
 wrong 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.100
 the sharks of the isabela island are 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.590
 carnivores and although they are not as aggressive 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.510
 like white we understood why not 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.510
 they wanted us to get into this pit 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.740
 quite scary not only because it 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.660
 they got too close but because every time 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.660
 They were more and larger 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.690
 ah 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.819
 and well we are in the sanctuary of the 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.979
 sharks I tell you the truth I do not know that 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:55.610
 you will be thinking but it seems to me that 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:58.569
 it's a good time to hit the turn 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.569
 and go out
