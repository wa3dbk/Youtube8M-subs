twos<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.430> very<00:01:53.850> similar<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:55.520> can<00:01:56.520> do<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> brow

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
twos is very similar I can do a brow

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.120 
twos is very similar I can do a brow
tutorial<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.899> these<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.829> but

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
tutorial with these if you want but

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.039 
tutorial with these if you want but
basically<00:01:59.700> what<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> brow

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
basically what I do with the brow

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.870 
basically what I do with the brow
pencils<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.770> use<00:02:01.950> them<00:02:02.130> every<00:02:02.399> day<00:02:02.430> I

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
pencils because I use them every day I

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.969 
pencils because I use them every day I
use<00:02:03.360> them<00:02:03.630> mainly<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> bottom<00:02:04.710> I'll<00:02:04.860> do

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
use them mainly on the bottom I'll do

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.130 
use them mainly on the bottom I'll do
one<00:02:05.159> darker<00:02:05.610> color<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> bottom<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.110> a

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
one darker color on the bottom to get a

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.690 
one darker color on the bottom to get a
nice<00:02:07.350> crisp<00:02:07.680> line<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.310> then<00:02:08.399> I'll<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.670> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
nice crisp line and then I'll do a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.150 
nice crisp line and then I'll do a
lighter<00:02:09.149> color<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> taupe<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:11.039> to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
lighter color like a taupe just to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.890 
lighter color like a taupe just to
feather<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.849> top<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.450> me<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> looks<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
feather in the top for me it looks a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.370 
feather in the top for me it looks a
little<00:02:12.989> bit<00:02:13.170> more

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
little bit more

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.440 
little bit more
my<00:02:13.770> brows<00:02:13.950> are<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.550> point<00:02:14.580> today<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.120> don't

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
my brows are not on point today so don't

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.060 
my brows are not on point today so don't
study<00:02:15.690> my<00:02:15.840> brows<00:02:16.020> too<00:02:16.260> closely<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.710> should<00:02:16.980> be

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
study my brows too closely I should be

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.860 
study my brows too closely I should be
like<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.910> for<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.270> whole<00:02:18.300> video<00:02:18.570> I'm<00:02:18.720> like

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
like this for the whole video I'm like

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.460 
like this for the whole video I'm like
don't<00:02:18.990> look<00:02:19.140> at<00:02:19.230> my<00:02:19.290> brows<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:21.060> I'm<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.930> like

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
don't look at my brows but I'm I like

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.370 
don't look at my brows but I'm I like
using<00:02:22.710> brow<00:02:22.950> pencils<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.550> lot<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.630> formula<00:02:25.170> is

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
using brow pencils a lot the formula is

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.790 
using brow pencils a lot the formula is
very<00:02:25.710> consistent<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.820> let<00:02:26.970> me<00:02:27.090> draw<00:02:27.360> them<00:02:27.570> on

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
very consistent so let me draw them on

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.370 
very consistent so let me draw them on
side-by-side<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.070> guys<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:31.080> NYX

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
side-by-side so you guys can see the NYX

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.310 
side-by-side so you guys can see the NYX
ones<00:02:31.940> they<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:33.120> eight<00:02:33.360> colors<00:02:33.870> instead<00:02:34.230> of

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
ones they have eight colors instead of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.890 
ones they have eight colors instead of
nine<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.770> got<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.130> one<00:02:35.370> at<00:02:35.520> Ulta<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.210> it's<00:02:36.390> 999

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
nine I got this one at Ulta and it's 999

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.930 
nine I got this one at Ulta and it's 999
but<00:02:37.200> they<00:02:37.680> had<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:37.950> buy<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.400> get<00:02:38.550> one<00:02:38.610> half<00:02:38.910> off

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
but they had a buy one get one half off

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.420 
but they had a buy one get one half off
so<00:02:39.870> basically<00:02:40.410> you're<00:02:40.650> paying<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:41.040> seven

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
so basically you're paying like seven

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.800 
so basically you're paying like seven
dollars<00:02:41.520> for<00:02:41.730> each<00:02:42.030> one<00:02:42.270> which<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.630> really

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
dollars for each one which is really

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.870 
dollars for each one which is really
good<00:02:42.960> they<00:02:43.050> always<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.500> sales<00:02:43.740> at<00:02:43.920> Ulta<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
good they always have sales at Ulta the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.760 
good they always have sales at Ulta the
drugstores<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.540> think<00:02:45.720> target<00:02:46.110> has<00:02:46.260> these<00:02:46.470> now

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
drugstores I think target has these now

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.140 
drugstores I think target has these now
but<00:02:47.610> um<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.480> formula<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.590> slightly<00:02:50.340> dry<00:02:50.730> it's

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
but um the formula is slightly dry it's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.960 
but um the formula is slightly dry it's
very<00:02:51.540> very<00:02:51.840> pigmented<00:02:52.320> it's<00:02:52.950> not<00:02:53.550> super

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
very very pigmented it's not super

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.340 
very very pigmented it's not super
creamy<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:54.570> that's<00:02:54.750> what<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.960> want<00:02:55.200> with<00:02:55.320> a

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
creamy but that's what you want with a

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.020 
creamy but that's what you want with a
brow<00:02:55.590> pencil<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:56.130> it's<00:02:56.250> too<00:02:56.460> creamy<00:02:56.730> it's

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
brow pencil if it's too creamy it's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.910 
brow pencil if it's too creamy it's
going<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.270> slide<00:02:57.600> especially<00:02:58.230> when<00:02:58.350> it's<00:02:58.470> hot

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
going to slide especially when it's hot

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.470 
going to slide especially when it's hot
as<00:02:59.100> hell<00:02:59.280> like<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.730> here<00:02:59.940> in<00:03:00.030> Sacramento

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
as hell like it is here in Sacramento

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360 
as hell like it is here in Sacramento
it's<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:00.750> hot<00:03:00.990> right<00:03:01.110> now<00:03:01.290> everything<00:03:02.100> melts

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
it's so hot right now everything melts

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.160 
it's so hot right now everything melts
off<00:03:02.460> my<00:03:02.670> face<00:03:02.880> my<00:03:03.120> brows<00:03:03.360> go<00:03:03.630> first<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.050> don't

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
off my face my brows go first I don't

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.200 
off my face my brows go first I don't
know<00:03:04.230> what<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.620> my<00:03:05.340> eyeshadows<00:03:05.910> my<00:03:06.030> lips

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
know what it is my eyeshadows my lips

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.490 
know what it is my eyeshadows my lips
everything<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.600> be<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.750> place<00:03:06.960> but<00:03:07.170> my<00:03:07.290> brows

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
everything can be in place but my brows

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.380 
everything can be in place but my brows
will<00:03:07.830> be<00:03:07.920> down<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.250> my<00:03:08.370> chin<00:03:08.610> by<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:09.150> end<00:03:09.270> of

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
will be down to my chin by the end of

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.840 
will be down to my chin by the end of
the<00:03:09.450> day<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:09.830> just<00:03:10.830> try<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.130> get<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.520> drier

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
the day so just try to get a drier

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.520 
the day so just try to get a drier
formula<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.810> stays<00:03:12.990> in<00:03:13.020> place<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.320> little

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
formula so it stays in place a little

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.330 
formula so it stays in place a little
bit<00:03:13.740> more<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.580> M<00:03:14.730> Stasia<00:03:15.060> one<00:03:15.740> same<00:03:16.740> formula

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
bit more the M Stasia one same formula

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.730 
bit more the M Stasia one same formula
it<00:03:17.490> feels<00:03:17.730> exactly<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.870> same<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.350> me<00:03:19.530> it's

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
it feels exactly the same to me it's

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.370 
it feels exactly the same to me it's
just<00:03:20.070> as<00:03:20.250> pigmented<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.720> formula<00:03:22.200> is

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
just as pigmented so the formula is

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.820 
just as pigmented so the formula is
exactly<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.980> same<00:03:23.190> now<00:03:23.520> from<00:03:24.300> my<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:25.080> don't<00:03:25.740> say

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
exactly the same now from my I don't say

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.050 
exactly the same now from my I don't say

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
to see where it is made it gives you a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.590 
to see where it is made it gives you a
very<00:03:37.770> strong<00:03:37.890> clue<00:03:38.490> as<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.790> what<00:03:39.120> products<00:03:39.480> are

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
very strong clue as to what products are

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.840 
very strong clue as to what products are
made<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.080> same<00:03:40.260> place<00:03:40.320> so<00:03:40.980> for<00:03:41.280> example

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
made in the same place so for example

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.960 
made in the same place so for example
let's<00:03:42.120> start<00:03:42.330> with<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> Anastasia<00:03:43.050> wine<00:03:43.970> made

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
let's start with the Anastasia wine made

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.220 
let's start with the Anastasia wine made
in<00:03:45.000> Korea<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.860> NYX<00:03:47.550> Micra<00:03:48.090> one<00:03:48.270> made<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:48.990> South

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
in Korea the NYX Micra one made in South

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.880 
in Korea the NYX Micra one made in South
Korea<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:51.000> highly<00:03:51.510> likely<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.170> it's<00:03:52.680> the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
Korea it is highly likely that it's the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.510 
Korea it is highly likely that it's the
same<00:03:53.220> exact<00:03:53.910> lab<00:03:54.360> making<00:03:54.959> both<00:03:55.440> because<00:03:56.010> the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
same exact lab making both because the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.550 
same exact lab making both because the
likelihood<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.180> them<00:03:57.390> having<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.900> exact<00:03:58.290> same

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
likelihood of them having the exact same

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.550 
likelihood of them having the exact same
components<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.490> same<00:03:59.760> formula<00:04:00.350> made<00:04:01.350> in

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
components the same formula made in

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.590 
components the same formula made in
basically<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.160> same<00:04:02.490> country<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.480> these

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
basically the same country that these

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.720 
basically the same country that these
are<00:04:03.780> made<00:04:03.900> at<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.140> exact<00:04:04.440> same<00:04:04.680> lab<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.580> is

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
are made at the exact same lab so it is

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.810 
are made at the exact same lab so it is
the<00:04:05.940> same<00:04:06.620> product<00:04:07.620> what<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.130> are<00:04:08.250> paying<00:04:08.550> for

exact same lab so save yourself from
some<00:05:11.260> money<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.650> get<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.280> next<00:05:12.430> one<00:05:12.550> instead
