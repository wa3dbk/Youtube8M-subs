the<00:02:12.790> first<00:02:13.060> thing<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:13.420> we<00:02:13.510> should<00:02:13.540> mention

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
the first thing that we should mention

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.179 
the first thing that we should mention
is<00:02:13.989> that<00:02:14.019> it's<00:02:14.230> quite<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.409> big<00:02:14.590> hit<00:02:14.769> on<00:02:14.920> your<00:02:15.040> FPS

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
is that it's quite a big hit on your FPS

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.399 
is that it's quite a big hit on your FPS
so<00:02:15.879> if<00:02:15.969> you<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.180> barely<00:02:16.359> run<00:02:16.569> Skyrim<00:02:17.019> as<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.290> is

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
so if you can barely run Skyrim as it is

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.020 
so if you can barely run Skyrim as it is
then<00:02:17.620> it's<00:02:17.739> probably<00:02:17.859> isn't<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:18.730> if

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
then it's probably isn't for you but if

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.490 
then it's probably isn't for you but if
you<00:02:19.120> do<00:02:19.299> try<00:02:19.569> out<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:19.989> do<00:02:20.140> experience

you do try out and you do experience

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.349 
you do try out and you do experience
slight<00:02:20.799> FPS<00:02:21.219> issues<00:02:21.400> they<00:02:21.819> can<00:02:21.969> easily<00:02:22.090> be
