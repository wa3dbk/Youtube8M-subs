00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
this is a chelating shampoo and then I

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.229 
this is a chelating shampoo and then I
deep<00:00:46.449> conditioned<00:00:47.109> I<00:00:47.559> did<00:00:48.489> everything<00:00:48.789> in

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
those five sections so I just kept it

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.610 
those five sections so I just kept it
really<00:00:51.699> separate<00:00:52.269> and<00:00:52.480> even<00:00:53.199> though<00:00:53.320> I<00:00:53.350> have

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
really separate and even though I have

really separate and even though I have
relaxed<00:00:54.100> hair<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.670> I<00:00:54.730> would<00:00:54.910> like<00:00:55.000> straight<00:00:55.420> I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
was able to keep the suction separate by

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.790 
was able to keep the suction separate by
twisting<00:00:58.149> them<00:00:58.359> after<00:00:59.109> I<00:00:59.140> was<00:00:59.320> finished<00:00:59.350> and

standards anyway and obviously it's

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.510 
standards anyway and obviously it's
impossible<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.620> go<00:01:38.740> through<00:01:38.950> each<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.280> every

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
impossible to go through each and every

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.550 
impossible to go through each and every
strand<00:01:39.790> but<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.030> did<00:01:40.240> pull<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.630> couple<00:01:40.870> out<00:01:41.260> here

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
strand but I did pull a couple out here

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.650 
strand but I did pull a couple out here
and<00:01:41.710> there<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.100> they<00:01:42.910> did<00:01:43.120> have<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.480> white

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
and there and they did have the white

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.480 
and there and they did have the white
bulb<00:01:43.960> on<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.200> tip<00:01:44.560> which<00:01:44.740> means<00:01:45.040> that<00:01:45.160> it<00:01:45.310> is

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
bulb on the tip which means that it is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.970 
bulb on the tip which means that it is
shed<00:01:45.820> hair<00:01:46.060> versus<00:01:46.480> broken<00:01:46.900> hair<00:01:47.110> so
