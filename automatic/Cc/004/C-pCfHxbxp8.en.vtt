stabilizer is called we don't have the
pop-up<00:00:44.940> things<00:00:45.359> I've<00:00:45.600> lost<00:00:45.839> everything<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.920> do

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980

the<00:00:47.609> the<00:00:47.690> stabilizer<00:00:48.690> has<00:00:48.899> been<00:00:49.050> fine-tuned<00:00:49.499> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the the stabilizer has been fine-tuned a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.979 
the the stabilizer has been fine-tuned a
little<00:00:49.800> bit<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.100> means<00:00:50.339> that<00:00:50.609> it<00:00:50.789> will

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
little bit which means that it will

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.450 
little bit which means that it will
ignore<00:00:52.940> excessive<00:00:53.940> vibrato<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.769> certain

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
ignore excessive vibrato and a certain

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.579 
ignore excessive vibrato and a certain
degree<00:00:56.609> pitch<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.210> pitch<00:00:57.600> drift<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.170> well<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
degree pitch a pitch drift as well so

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.439 
degree pitch a pitch drift as well so
that<00:00:58.769> you'll<00:00:59.010> stay<00:00:59.429> on<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.819> note<00:01:00.059> instead<00:01:00.329> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that you'll stay on one note instead of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.970 
that you'll stay on one note instead of
jumping<00:01:00.629> back<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> forest<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.800> your

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
jumping back to the forest if your

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.739 
jumping back to the forest if your
intonation<00:01:02.339> is<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> little<00:01:02.999> bit<00:01:03.120> off<00:01:03.269> sometimes

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
intonation is a little bit off sometimes

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
which mine is also I feel the major

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.810 
which mine is also I feel the major
improvement<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.360> time<00:01:06.570> around<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
improvement this time around is the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.550 
improvement this time around is the
expression<00:01:08.820> mode<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.440> demonstrate

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
expression mode and just to demonstrate

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
expression mode and just to demonstrate
this<00:01:11.100> I've<00:01:11.280> been<00:01:11.370> playing<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.360> quite<00:01:12.780> a

in<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.439> because<00:01:31.590> they<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> lot<00:01:32.310> of

layering they have a lot of different

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.440

dynamic<00:01:34.530> layers<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.039> there<00:01:35.210> which<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.299> feel

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
dynamic layers in there which I feel

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.569 
dynamic layers in there which I feel
works<00:01:36.689> really<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.110> well<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
works really really well with that

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.639 
works really really well with that
expression<00:01:38.939> control<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.899> very<00:01:40.590> very

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
expression control and it just very very

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.859 
expression control and it just very very
intuitive<00:01:41.219> so<00:01:41.430> without<00:01:41.759> further<00:01:41.969> ado<00:01:42.329> let's
