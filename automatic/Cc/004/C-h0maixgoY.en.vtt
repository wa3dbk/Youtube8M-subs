00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.840
 welcome to gallery nights tv today 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.890
 we present a plastic artist as 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:35.820
 like to be called a painter and it's the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:40.430
 gabriel saints not being an artist for me is 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.310
 do not trade my time my life my 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.360
 my ideals the things that I like for 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.360
 earn my livelihood 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.280
 good more than a decade ago living in 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.230
 the patagonia and working of other things 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.170
 I kept painting all the time 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.930
 I used to spend my free time painting and 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.290
 one moment I realized that it was now or 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.160
 never and quit my job and I came 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.229
 to buenos aires to try to be an artist 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.520
 plastic and we will try to live on my 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.380
 painting and it was a very important moment 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.800
 good luckily things came out 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.800
 fairly good 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.490
 here 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.590
 to work I do not need anything 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.400
 especially because 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.630
 work is an activity 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.700
 basic of my life then 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.250
 and everything that happens to me in other areas 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.070
 be watch movies listen to a phrase 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.409
 read a book or something everyday in the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.189
 warehouse is translated after the painting of 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.189
 some way 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.069
 in the early morning I come to the workshop 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.569
 without previous ideas usually but 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.940
 with the burden of what was lived 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.410
 book movies that I read last night some 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.870
 personal experience and all that and 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.690
 started to paint on the canvas without knowing 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.140
 where I'm going but with some element 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.140
 that incites me and then it's chaos and a 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.940
 this succession of ideas that go 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.230
 showing up but there's no previous plan nor 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.230
 sketch in my case 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.800
 good if there is a unifying feature in my 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.410
 work 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.070
 I would say it's the absence did not paint what 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:57.170
 that I do not have what I no longer have or what 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:00.230
 I would like to have be affected scenes is 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.700
 sublimated and transformed but places 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.700
 but it is always the absence 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.550
 two 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.410

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.100

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.100

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.320
