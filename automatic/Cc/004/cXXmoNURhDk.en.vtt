today<00:00:15.540> what<00:00:15.690> we're<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.470> we're

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
today what we're going to do is we're

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.900 
today what we're going to do is we're
actually<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.130> one<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> webcams

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
actually going to do one of the webcams

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.420 
actually going to do one of the webcams
so<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> feel<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.260> this<00:00:19.470> really<00:00:19.619> does<00:00:20.010> make<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
so I feel like this really does make you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.620 
so I feel like this really does make you
kind<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> pervert<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:21.390> whatever

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
kind of like a pervert or whatever

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.700 
kind of like a pervert or whatever
because<00:00:21.720> you're<00:00:21.840> watching<00:00:22.170> other<00:00:22.289> people<00:00:22.560> but

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
because you're watching other people but

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.349 
because you're watching other people but
I<00:00:22.949> guess<00:00:23.369> that's<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:23.789> we're<00:00:23.910> supposed<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.180> do

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
I guess that's what we're supposed to do

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.939 
I guess that's what we're supposed to do
so<00:00:24.630> yeah<00:00:24.750> let's<00:00:24.930> go<00:00:25.050> ahead<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.289> intrude<00:00:25.920> here

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
so yeah let's go ahead and intrude here

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.580 
so yeah let's go ahead and intrude here
and<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.369> one's<00:00:26.580> not<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:26.910> complicated<00:00:27.590> though

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
and this one's not as complicated though

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.429 
and this one's not as complicated though
who<00:00:29.340> actually<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.119> didn't<00:00:30.539> realize<00:00:30.779> okay<00:00:31.380> so

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
who actually I didn't realize okay so

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.569 
who actually I didn't realize okay so
these<00:00:31.619> are<00:00:31.769> these<00:00:31.890> little<00:00:34.100> little<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.520> guess

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
these are these little little I guess

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.950 
these are these little little I guess
how<00:00:35.850> should<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.180> say<00:00:36.920> little<00:00:38.660> puzzles<00:00:39.660> to

how should you say little puzzles to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.340 
how should you say little puzzles to
actually<00:00:40.290> help<00:00:41.540> figure<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:44.239> how<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.350> get

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350

certain things you get hacked that makes

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.729 
certain things you get hacked that makes
any<00:00:48.660> sense<00:00:48.780> probably<00:00:49.230> doesn't<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.559> that's

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
any sense probably doesn't but that's

by<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:58.280> there's<00:02:58.400> multiple<00:02:58.760> stores

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
by that so but there's multiple stores

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.670 
by that so but there's multiple stores
like<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.360> round<00:02:59.690> I<00:02:59.900> mean<00:03:00.050> that's<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.500> train

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
like this round I mean that's a train

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.350 
like this round I mean that's a train
station<00:03:00.800> known<00:03:01.160> on<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.400> time<00:03:01.640> out<00:03:01.880> there's<00:03:02.300> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
station known on the time out there's a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.910 
station known on the time out there's a
business<00:03:02.570> you<00:03:02.870> could<00:03:02.990> buy<00:03:03.110> like<00:03:03.350> focusing

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
business you could buy like focusing

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.480 
business you could buy like focusing
Aidan's<00:03:04.340> on<00:03:04.490> that<00:03:04.670> but<00:03:05.600> I've<00:03:05.720> yet<00:03:06.020> to<00:03:06.050> see<00:03:06.490> yet

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
Aidan's on that but I've yet to see yet

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.110 
Aidan's on that but I've yet to see yet
though<00:03:07.850> is<00:03:08.710> something<00:03:09.710> for<00:03:10.250> because<00:03:10.790> when<00:03:11.000> you

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
though is something for because when you

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.360 
though is something for because when you
go<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.480> crafting<00:03:12.020> you<00:03:12.800> have<00:03:13.010> all<00:03:13.250> these

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
go to the crafting you have all these

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.870 
go to the crafting you have all these
components<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.210> have<00:03:15.880> dangerous

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
components so you have dangerous

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.790 
components so you have dangerous
component<00:03:17.240> explosive<00:03:18.080> components<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.710> all

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
component explosive components and all

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.650 
component explosive components and all
that<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:19.490> I<00:03:19.550> guess<00:03:19.730> now<00:03:19.910> with<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.120> explosive

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
that but I guess now with the explosive

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.950 
that but I guess now with the explosive
components<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:21.380> should<00:03:21.830> allow<00:03:22.430> me<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:23.690> take

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
components that should allow me to take

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.140 
components that should allow me to take
that<00:03:24.020> to<00:03:24.800> that<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:25.160> ok<00:03:25.430> sweet<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.790> got<00:03:25.970> plenty

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
that to that is ok sweet so I got plenty

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.910 
that to that is ok sweet so I got plenty
of<00:03:26.300> regular<00:03:27.080> aims<00:03:29.410> for<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.590> I'm<00:03:30.740> actually

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
of regular aims for that I'm actually

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.700 
of regular aims for that I'm actually
going<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.190> use<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:32.180> takes<00:03:32.840> two<00:03:33.200> of<00:03:33.380> it<00:03:33.500> that's

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
going to use that takes two of it that's

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.590 
going to use that takes two of it that's
crazy<00:03:34.040> yeah<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:34.730> like<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.060> blackout<00:03:35.390> this<00:03:35.510> is

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
i haven't really had a time to actually

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.830 
i haven't really had a time to actually
use<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.620> jam<00:03:39.800> communications<00:03:40.520> so<00:03:41.240> i<00:03:41.570> don't

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
use the jam communications so i don't

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.510 
use the jam communications so i don't
really<00:03:41.900> find<00:03:42.500> it<00:03:42.680> necessary<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.430> the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
not sure what you if you would have got
