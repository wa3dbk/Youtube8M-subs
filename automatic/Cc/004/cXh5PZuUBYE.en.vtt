00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello to yourself for the funkta gta online and in 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.890
 this video will show you glich salad personally 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.690
 money also this glitch will work 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
 like copying a friend's car 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.750
 after update 1.26 dlc 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.260
 nothing has changed in this 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.140
 glitchy 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.810
 he is already old u did not spread on the channel 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.960
 because it really turned out very 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.490
 bad for next-gen but basically now 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.820
 everything works fine 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.840
 that he needs to buy a garage in 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.940
 this place it is cheap to take 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 here, in principle, the garage should work 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.370
 in any garage and an apartment where there is no 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.079
 it is the garage that I think will fit in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.239
 Marietta folds where I shot the past 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.120
 video on the transfer of cars for the plan 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.090
 online mode what do you need if you 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 do sola here you have to wait 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.079
 the threshold is 45 minutes since it is faster 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.239
 time you do not sell the car 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.750
 if you copy a car from a friend then 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.760
 you do not need a threshold in general 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.640
 your car so that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.680
 clamp two doors to fit another 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.590
 city ​​car and pinch her door 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.350
 put the car in this place closer to 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.570
 the plate I remember earlier was heating 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.150
 near the trash and here it does not work 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.880
 best article so that 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.840
 you turned out bilich for sure 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.270
 next you find cars one more 3 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.090
 urban and put it like this 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.040
 way click here touchpad i 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.290
 so that the car did not come to him in the garage 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.590
 also in the garage you should have a minimum 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.479
 one free space after which you 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.329
 insert the car in this way and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.330
 get out of the car here is the touchpad 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.580
 can shoot best before glitch 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.790
 vanity lester u and make you for 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.490
 private police that transferred to 3 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.110
 minutes she is given 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.270
 because of what it is better to do because 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.260
 when you drive in city cars 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.110
 you will be 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.390
 time to warm up for now if they kill you 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.550
 or else something will happen then the machine 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.850
 just these city will disappear and you 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.050
 will do it all over again in general 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.960
 take chase 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.590
 or some other ways and so 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.050
 same shoot his car best with 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.330
 a weapon with a silencer as when you 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.760
 shoot with a silencer cops for you not 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.280
 chase here is a very important moment 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.620
 because of what turns out glitchy because of what 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.140
 I can't do it then 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.360
 give all the time I say because here 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.890
 all important to understand the very way of this 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.560
 arson car you press shoot 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.030
 and as long as the car is already normal 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.360
 light up better than a mixture 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.100
 distance is enough 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.570
 shoot saw that he caught fire just 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.840
 press stick sits down 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.239
 We saw the card card will blink blink 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.250
 go to glass mode on the car forward 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.410
 click the rectangle as you can see 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.840
 times when we got into armored already 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.090
 lancer card blinked again which means 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.980
 everything worked out if she didn't blink then 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.380
 most likely you are simply not here for 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.540
 remember in this garage like u say what 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.489
 threshold of 45 minutes you will not go around but you 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.850
 you can safely copy cars 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:21.610
 friends as well if you have no money 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.590
 you had better go to 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.510

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.880

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.840

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.720
 set on fire

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.450
