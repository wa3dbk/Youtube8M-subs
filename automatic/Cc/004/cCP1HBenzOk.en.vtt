00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
definitely noticed that there is a

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.570 
definitely noticed that there is a
upgrade<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.870> animation<00:03:56.530> maybe<00:03:57.220> they<00:03:57.400> got<00:03:57.519> a

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
upgrade and animation maybe they got a

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.100 
upgrade and animation maybe they got a
higher<00:03:57.820> budget<00:03:58.060> when<00:03:58.450> they<00:03:58.540> realized<00:03:58.959> that

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
higher budget when they realized that

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.160 
higher budget when they realized that
the<00:03:59.260> show<00:03:59.470> is<00:03:59.500> taking<00:04:00.010> off<00:04:00.160> anyway<00:04:00.820> so<00:04:01.390> five

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
the show is taking off anyway so five

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.990 
the show is taking off anyway so five
starts<00:04:02.769> with<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:03.010> nice<00:04:03.160> big<00:04:03.400> battle<00:04:03.820> and

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
starts with a nice big battle and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.530 
starts with a nice big battle and
bloodshed<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.410> bad<00:04:05.590> guys<00:04:05.860> retreat<00:04:06.580> so<00:04:07.480> I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
bloodshed and the bad guys retreat so I

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.449 
bloodshed and the bad guys retreat so I
guess<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.840> band<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.260> hawk<00:04:08.440> is<00:04:08.769> welcomed

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459
