00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.170
 to a strange situation to which 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.289
 it happened in the warm stadium in behind 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.570
 the goal of toluca the a broad sector 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 where the fans got really hard 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.619
 with willow cirilo despite being one of 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.119
 the leaders of the fundamental team in the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.269
 championship of the players more 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.949
 regular the public did not forgive and about 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.449
 this spoke fernando maple that is not 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.070
 showed nothing happy with what 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.420
 happened to his partner because if I 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.180
 it seems very unfair I think that people 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.860
 he forgets very quickly the points that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.120
 has decided the championship that has 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.790
 given also because it was a goal 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.910
 fundamental and we can not play anyone by 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.010
 a single action like that is that today 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.629
 reprehensible what our 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.579
 hobby it seems that if we want to be the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.260
 best hobby of mexico in the good and 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.760
 in the bad we have to support each 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.969
 one of his players we have them 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.559
 to care for them is to play or they give 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.490
 life inside the court for a city 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 for an institution and today it seems to me that 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.700
 that have been exceeded by what he has 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.070
 gone and this does not deserve this 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.580
 player who has given us so much is part 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.010
 of football accidents mistakes 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.500
 I'm wrong with the first goal 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.930
 and then I receive many samples of 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.680
 I support what 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.410
 when things are not right or one 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.770
 think that they are not right you change everything 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.600
 then I thank not only güemes 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.940
 güemes was a great detail what he did 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.700
 urgently the rostrum also encouraged me 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.460
 Zermeño was the first to do so 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 who took the good 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.700
 and I hope that people do not happen again 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.290
 can do what you want like you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.090
 you know not from your experience that you can 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.520
 pass this on any computer in 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.820
 any type 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.800
 and that's if you know what the position is 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.330
 when one makes a mistake it 's a goal so 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.550
 I really appreciate the samples of 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.800
 support and think about what's coming today was 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.360
 a very important triumph we take three 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.910
 fundamental points and we continue in the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.010
 fight for qualification leaving a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.200
 side this strange situation and the balance 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.700
 of the people of tijuana you win and you 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.650
 they keep in the fight to qualify in 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.240
 the league and also obviously trying to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.070
 to launch the league final of 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.230
 concacaf champions if the truth that 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.530
 pleased with the result of the team 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.180
 He deserved to win but good at the end 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.890
 have found that picture and that style and 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.230
 the results are occurring in all 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.900
 the tastes good concentration because the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.490
 team we are seeing more the ball there 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.590
 much more movement from the top 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.470
 and lots of marking and as well that gives 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.270
 tranquility for water and we knew that 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.340
 it was a very important game we did not leave 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.830
 spend more points than up to the straight 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.540
 final and we wait for the group then 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.920
 we knew it was important to get the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.170
 three points and the team remained 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.790
 kept on that line I think we went 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.370
 day by day we were working what we 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.750
 ask the teacher then now now 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.250
 we are talking very loudly let's hope 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.260
 that helps us to be well 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.470
 one line 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.549
 now that today is the game very well 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.829
 forceful I think it was one of the 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.810
 best complete matches of all 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.700
 the team the team during the tournament 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.680
 you can local showed very good facet 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.519
 but today I think it showed during the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.230
 90 minutes 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.090
 that was to put a missing state that 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.010
 today I think it was a round game and 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.900
 It serves to keep on being there in 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.579
 the to enter the league that we 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.620
 you can say of cristian and crisis that 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.480
 you're how you saw it happening right I saw it 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.670
 well as in the whole team triangulating 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.400
 perfect with the last play that was 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.379
 that lucky one was I felt a nuisance 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.780
 back how good the truth is true 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.459
 now it is very hasty that what 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.840
 I wanted to study tomorrow and I hope that 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.519
 something is because if something for each the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.739
 group sports chain my friends what 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.739
 I say but on these tiles and I'm 7 as
