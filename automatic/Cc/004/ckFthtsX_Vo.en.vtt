00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.130 
stuff so I've been slowly as in once
every<00:05:12.680> two<00:05:12.860> weeks<00:05:12.890> usually<00:05:13.930> taking<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:14.960> bits

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
every two weeks usually taking a bits

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.290 
every two weeks usually taking a bits
and<00:05:15.290> pieces<00:05:15.620> and<00:05:15.770> moving<00:05:16.070> it<00:05:16.220> and

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
and pieces and moving it and

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.070 
and pieces and moving it and
categorizing<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:17.420> but<00:05:17.600> it's<00:05:17.750> been<00:05:17.870> slow

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
categorizing it but it's been slow

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.930 
categorizing it but it's been slow
because<00:05:18.290> I<00:05:18.620> work<00:05:18.890> about<00:05:19.130> 30<00:05:19.340> hours<00:05:19.400> a<00:05:19.610> week<00:05:19.670> now

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
because I work about 30 hours a week now

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.790 
because I work about 30 hours a week now
plus<00:05:20.150> go<00:05:20.300> to<00:05:20.390> school<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:20.870> it's<00:05:21.620> summer

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
plus go to school and it's summer

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.620 
plus go to school and it's summer
classes<00:05:22.280> so<00:05:22.430> their<00:05:22.580> accelerated<00:05:23.060> essentially

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
classes so their accelerated essentially

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.840 
classes so their accelerated essentially
which<00:05:24.590> means<00:05:24.830> I<00:05:24.980> have<00:05:25.010> assignments<00:05:25.370> due<00:05:25.640> every

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
which means I have assignments due every

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.900 
which means I have assignments due every
single<00:05:26.450> Tuesday<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:27.560> Thursday<00:05:27.920> joy<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.820> the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
single Tuesday and Thursday joy and the

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.140 
single Tuesday and Thursday joy and the
program<00:05:29.650> it's<00:05:30.650> two<00:05:30.770> classes<00:05:31.220> so<00:05:31.430> there's<00:05:32.090> a

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
program it's two classes so there's a

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.330 
program it's two classes so there's a
lot<00:05:32.330> going<00:05:32.360> on

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
lot going on
