00:00:01.259 --> 00:00:04.259
 So 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:09.149
 here 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:14.349
 xx 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.349
 also 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.550
 not 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.369
 not 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.569
 let's show it as if 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.720
 I think that this conflict 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.300
 before becoming 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.620
 he 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.360
 not 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.610
 like 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.610
 that's so popular 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
 my way 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.880
 for the amount of 1 0 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 up to 1 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.690
 failed 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.870
 banks 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.320
 favorable 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 possibly 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.250
 as im 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.330
 true 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
 So 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.770
 not 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.720
 so 3 this year 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.820
 duck 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.320
 no m3
