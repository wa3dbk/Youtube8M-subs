00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
have this dynamic looking fly wire but

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.950 
have this dynamic looking fly wire but
it's<00:01:10.960> made<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.939> kind<00:01:13.149> of<00:01:13.240> like<00:01:13.360> first<00:01:13.689> gen

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
it's made in that kind of like first gen

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.020 
it's made in that kind of like first gen
fly<00:01:14.259> wire<00:01:14.500> fashion<00:01:15.040> where<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.610> fly<00:01:15.729> wires

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
fly wire fashion where to fly wires

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.399 
fly wire fashion where to fly wires
within<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:16.630> fuse<00:01:18.870> so<00:01:19.870> hopefully<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.229> can<00:01:20.290> see

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
within the fuse so hopefully you can see

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.430 
within the fuse so hopefully you can see
that<00:01:20.560> here<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.900> can<00:01:23.020> see<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.260> mesh

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
that here and then you can see the mesh

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.010 
that here and then you can see the mesh
that<00:01:23.830> is<00:01:23.970> underneath<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:27.510> there's<00:01:28.510> a<00:01:28.630> look<00:01:28.840> at

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
that is underneath and there's a look at

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.320 
that is underneath and there's a look at
the<00:01:30.360> tongue<00:01:31.360> their<00:01:32.790> qualities<00:01:33.790> alright<00:01:34.150> it's

there's no flaws or anything like that

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.270 
there's no flaws or anything like that
this<00:01:43.690> is<00:01:43.750> not<00:01:44.049> carbon<00:01:44.380> fiber<00:01:44.590> by<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:44.890> way<00:01:45.100> it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
this is not carbon fiber by the way it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.620 
this is not carbon fiber by the way it
looks<00:01:45.490> like<00:01:45.640> carbon<00:01:45.940> fiber<00:01:45.970> but<00:01:46.390> it's<00:01:46.540> just

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
looks like carbon fiber but it's just

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.830 
looks like carbon fiber but it's just
TPU<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.380> then<00:01:48.159> it's<00:01:48.340> it's<00:01:49.030> like<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.420> got<00:01:49.690> like

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
TPU and then it's it's like I got like

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.480 
TPU and then it's it's like I got like
this<00:01:50.020> overlay<00:01:50.650> on<00:01:50.799> it<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.040> make<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.190> look<00:01:51.369> like

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
this overlay on it to make it look like

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.200 
this overlay on it to make it look like
carbon<00:01:51.850> fiber

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
carbon fiber

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.450 
carbon fiber
kind<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.170> reminds<00:01:53.409> me<00:01:53.500> of<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.680> Kaos<00:01:54.010> colorway

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460

stuff

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
stuff

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.719

opinion<00:02:09.189> so<00:02:09.369> whatever<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.819> normally<00:02:09.970> wear<00:02:10.299> in

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
opinion so whatever you normally wear in

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.570 
opinion so whatever you normally wear in
a<00:02:10.479> kobe<00:02:10.750> shoe<00:02:10.959> that's<00:02:11.739> what<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:11.950> would<00:02:12.129> wear<00:02:12.310> and

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
a kobe shoe that's what I would wear and

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.089 
a kobe shoe that's what I would wear and
these<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:14.140> far<00:02:14.290> as<00:02:14.409> tech<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.739> concerned

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
these as far as tech is concerned

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.640 
these as far as tech is concerned
besides<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.670> fly<00:02:15.909> wire<00:02:16.120> infuse<00:02:16.540> upper<00:02:16.870> you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
besides that fly wire infuse upper you

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.190 
besides that fly wire infuse upper you
have<00:02:17.680> an<00:02:17.890> XDR<00:02:18.340> outsole<00:02:18.849> with<00:02:19.480> Nikes<00:02:19.930> blade

have an XDR outsole with Nikes blade

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.449 
have an XDR outsole with Nikes blade
traction<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.609> you<00:02:21.760> can<00:02:21.909> see<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.389> it<00:02:22.510> is

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
traction and you can see that it is

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.809 
traction and you can see that it is
labeled<00:02:24.459> right<00:02:24.760> there<00:02:24.999> as

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
labeled right there as

my<00:02:26.360> keyblade<00:02:26.720> traction<00:02:27.140> that's<00:02:27.379> just<00:02:27.680> their

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
my keyblade traction that's just their

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.130 
my keyblade traction that's just their
outdoor<00:02:28.099> specific<00:02:28.640> pattern<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.420> also<00:02:29.540> have<00:02:29.900> a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
outdoor specific pattern you also have a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.710 
outdoor specific pattern you also have a
TPU<00:02:31.069> shank<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:32.840> can<00:02:32.989> see<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.739> goes

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
TPU shank you can see it goes

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.569 
TPU shank you can see it goes
cross-country<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:37.069> medial<00:02:37.430> to

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
cross-country like that the medial to

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.690 
cross-country like that the medial to
lateral<00:02:37.760> side<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.390> then<00:02:38.980> cushion<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.430> just

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
lateral side and then cushion it's just

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.690 
lateral side and then cushion it's just
a<00:02:40.849> four<00:02:41.150> foot<00:02:41.390> zoom<00:02:41.629> unit<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.409> I<00:02:42.950> believe<00:02:43.310> I

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
a four foot zoom unit and I believe I

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.819 
a four foot zoom unit and I believe I
can't<00:02:44.150> lift<00:02:44.629> this<00:02:44.810> insole<00:02:45.230> out<00:02:45.349> this<00:02:45.530> thing<00:02:45.709> is

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
can't lift this insole out this thing is

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.530 
can't lift this insole out this thing is
glued<00:02:46.129> in<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:46.310> like<00:02:46.670> with<00:02:46.970> cement<00:02:47.360> or

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
glued in there like with cement or

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.020 
glued in there like with cement or
something<00:02:47.870> like<00:02:47.989> it's<00:02:48.170> ridiculous<00:02:48.970> but<00:02:49.970> I

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
something like it's ridiculous but I

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.690 
something like it's ridiculous but I
believe<00:02:50.360> it's<00:02:50.569> a<00:02:50.890> regular<00:02:51.890> sized<00:02:52.099> zoom<00:02:52.400> unit

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
believe it's a regular sized zoom unit

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.949 
believe it's a regular sized zoom unit
because<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.090> way<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.359> the<00:02:53.450> Flex<00:02:53.690> grooves

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
because of the way that the Flex grooves

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.319 
because of the way that the Flex grooves
are<00:02:54.230> positioned<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.340> have<00:02:55.579> one<00:02:55.790> here<00:02:56.150> and

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
are positioned so you have one here and

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.149 
are positioned so you have one here and
one<00:02:56.450> here<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:57.079> then<00:02:57.319> in<00:02:57.530> between<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.920> would

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
one here and then in between you would

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.460 
one here and then in between you would
have<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.489> regular<00:02:58.760> full-size<00:02:59.239> unit<00:02:59.840> instead

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
have that regular full-size unit instead

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.009 
have that regular full-size unit instead
of<00:03:00.590> that<00:03:00.709> little<00:03:01.040> small<00:03:01.519> rectangle<00:03:02.120> as<00:03:02.540> far<00:03:02.870> as

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
of that little small rectangle as far as

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.199 
of that little small rectangle as far as
will<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.409> perform<00:03:04.190> well<00:03:04.340> indoors<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:05.000> don't

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
will this perform well indoors I don't

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.640 
will this perform well indoors I don't
know<00:03:05.389> I<00:03:05.420> do<00:03:05.659> plan<00:03:05.959> on<00:03:06.019> playing<00:03:06.379> in<00:03:06.500> these

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
know I do plan on playing in these

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.550 
know I do plan on playing in these
indoors<00:03:07.579> and<00:03:07.879> outdoors<00:03:08.329> just<00:03:08.930> to<00:03:09.079> kind<00:03:09.409> of<00:03:09.470> get

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
indoors and outdoors just to kind of get

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.869 
indoors and outdoors just to kind of get
a<00:03:09.620> feel<00:03:09.829> for<00:03:09.859> both<00:03:10.159> I'll<00:03:10.370> start<00:03:10.609> with<00:03:10.730> them

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
a feel for both I'll start with them

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.699 
a feel for both I'll start with them
indoors<00:03:11.209> just<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.659> see<00:03:11.810> how<00:03:11.959> they<00:03:12.109> how<00:03:12.500> they<00:03:12.530> do

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
indoors just to see how they how they do

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.890 
indoors just to see how they how they do
and<00:03:13.220> then<00:03:13.459> I'll<00:03:13.579> move<00:03:13.700> on<00:03:13.879> to<00:03:13.909> outdoors<00:03:14.329> which

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
and then I'll move on to outdoors which

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.740 
and then I'll move on to outdoors which
is<00:03:15.019> pretty<00:03:15.200> much<00:03:15.319> what<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.530> do<00:03:15.620> anyways<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.480> and

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
is pretty much what I do anyways so and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.250 
is pretty much what I do anyways so and
then<00:03:17.870> as<00:03:18.530> far<00:03:18.829> as<00:03:18.950> like<00:03:19.510> it's<00:03:20.510> like<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:21.019> guess

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
then as far as like it's like I guess

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.680 
then as far as like it's like I guess
pliability<00:03:22.159> or<00:03:22.760> if<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:23.420> pliable<00:03:23.810> or<00:03:23.930> not<00:03:24.280> and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
pliability or if it's pliable or not and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.330 
pliability or if it's pliable or not and
it<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.230> is<00:03:27.379> a<00:03:27.409> little<00:03:27.620> bit<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.190> that

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
it is it is a little bit so I think that

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.189 
it is it is a little bit so I think that
this<00:03:28.430> might<00:03:28.639> perform<00:03:29.180> well<00:03:29.420> inside<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.109> then

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:30.199 
this might perform well inside and then

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.069 
this might perform well inside and then
you<00:03:30.290> got<00:03:30.440> like<00:03:30.470> texture<00:03:31.040> here<00:03:31.989> hopefully<00:03:32.989> you

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
you got like texture here hopefully you

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.610 
you got like texture here hopefully you
can<00:03:33.169> see<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:34.419> so<00:03:35.419> I<00:03:35.449> think<00:03:35.510> it'll<00:03:35.840> play<00:03:36.049> ok

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
can see that so so I think it'll play ok

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.860 
can see that so so I think it'll play ok
indoors<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.280> then<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:38.239> know<00:03:38.329> we'll<00:03:38.480> find<00:03:38.690> out

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
indoors and then you know we'll find out

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.860 
indoors and then you know we'll find out
of<00:03:39.709> course<00:03:40.099> afterwards<00:03:40.519> when<00:03:41.000> I'm<00:03:41.090> done<00:03:41.239> so

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
of course afterwards when I'm done so

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.250 
of course afterwards when I'm done so
yeah<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.129> that's<00:03:43.370> pretty<00:03:43.639> much<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:44.000> now<00:03:44.569> one

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
yeah and that's pretty much it now one

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.569 
yeah and that's pretty much it now one
thing<00:03:45.410> that<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.590> wanted<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:45.889> say<00:03:46.069> too<00:03:46.129> is<00:03:46.280> it

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
thing that I wanted to say too is it

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.490 
thing that I wanted to say too is it
like<00:03:46.699> the<00:03:46.819> collar<00:03:47.060> here<00:03:47.359> I<00:03:47.540> don't<00:03:48.319> know<00:03:48.410> if

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
like the collar here I don't know if

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.869 
like the collar here I don't know if
it's<00:03:48.590> because<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:49.040> shoes<00:03:49.250> nowadays<00:03:49.699> don't

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
it's because the shoes nowadays don't

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.879 
it's because the shoes nowadays don't
really<00:03:50.150> come<00:03:50.359> padded<00:03:50.900> very<00:03:51.290> well<00:03:51.500> but<00:03:51.709> like

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
really come padded very well but like

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.699 
really come padded very well but like
the<00:03:52.010> collar<00:03:52.220> here<00:03:52.400> feels<00:03:52.669> awesome<00:03:53.379> it<00:03:54.379> feels

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
the collar here feels awesome it feels

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.650 
the collar here feels awesome it feels
like<00:03:54.829> memory<00:03:55.160> foam<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.639> doubt<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.449> it<00:03:56.540> is

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
like memory foam I doubt that it is
