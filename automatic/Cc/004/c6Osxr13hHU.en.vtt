00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.880
 there was no vain comment that the person engaged in the federal university 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.349
 fluminense 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.349
 I am clinical director of the cardiac hospital 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.859
 is worked with sinop research 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.919
 in this area of ​​heart failure with normal action fraction 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.269
 well we're here to talk about an extremely important subject that he 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.039
 heart failure with normal ejection fraction 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.110
 we have been working on this subject in the last decade 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.900
 through research on the federal cross-border sales 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.100
 and also in the pro-cardiac we have noticed the increase 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.700
 in the number of cases 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.090
 of people affected by murder 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.980
 after corrected it has the classic signs of souza that it needs 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.860
 heart fatigue says fernando 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.210
 shortness of breath 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.650
 graffiti on the lower limbs 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.650
 had normal cardiac function 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.990
 recently 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.990
 we publish the Brazilian cardiology files 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.790
 were almost 70% of patients admitted to the family medical program in Niterói 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.620
 were carriers of the 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.340
 and who are interested 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.780
 it is a third of the staff that the generalists 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.490
 I had a heart failure syndrome with a fraction of the action 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.170
 normal in niterói 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.980
 even because we have done from there 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.210
 we have 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.679
 natalie given 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.150
 in clinical practice 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.560
 along with doctor antónio nogueira 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.810
 land the new guidelines worse the fish over heart failure or 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.780
 normal action fraction 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.690
 be it 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.830
 we began to incorporate into our work 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.820
 the event had the fabric at 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.520
 today's tool 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.710
 abelão 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.780
 the delete confirmation 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.650
 of this clinical syndrome 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.230
 which is on one condition 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.069
 who frequently followed others 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.729
 the woman 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.189
 hypertensive 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:13.689
 and often sister venice 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.529
 in the office with the complaint of tiredness 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:18.219
 with a little facts 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.909
 and that often makes the clinical diagnosis the cardiologist 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.329
 the difficult geriatrician 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.329
 therefore whatever our work has been 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.569
 demystify that this condition 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.479
 it is not so relevant here in our midst 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.899
 some people 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.489
 still the brothers 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.400
 that this condition is frequent 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.339
 I can tell you 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.239
 he is very frequent 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.429
 in patients' offices 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:48.339
 and has become adult 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.509
 a model that in the pro-cardiac 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:54.129
 reaches almost 40% of those admitted 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.420
 with the floor that is used acute cardiac in the institution 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.919
 from that keitel job in the fall like a war we are doing 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.269
 validate this guideline in the environment and 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.680
 we collect all this set of experiences from ufrgs 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.379
 of pro-cardiac 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.440
 we performed a book called that made heart failure do it 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.769
 already normal 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.479
 the situation now launched by the Athenaeum 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.010
 and with certainty 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.099
 the fruit of this work 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.959
 we have not only 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.939
 an experience in 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.969
 to work in offices with net 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:35.389
 recognizes 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.509
 also now 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.440
 I say our hand of this tool that is the double tissue 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.359
 and also of what they wanted cerebral athletic 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.849
 called ticket 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.049
 a protein expressed in the heart 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.519
 myocardial insufficiency 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.949
 We got 12 years out. 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.649
 and we have observed that those individuals 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:57.299
 that presented 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.949
 levels of me 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.949
 above him 50 grams per deciliter 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.309
 picchetti are ceded pervades the office 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.529
 it's the group 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:08.349
 at where 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.239
 we have a great chance to be watching 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.239
 the heart failure and do normal action 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.459
 this book also 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.079
 behind what is important in the prevention of this disease 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:24.210
 then this is a problem that traffic defederico in our environment 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.210
 and how to prevent it from controlling blood pressure very well 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.319
 and the jurors 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.240
 I represent the medicines that the most important event are capable of 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.990
 to prevent 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.509
 the emergence 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.360
 induced to the elderly 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.039
 in this condition 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.259
 and on the other hand draws attention 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.259
 of the lack of new medicines 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.449
 this week's treatment 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.249
 the only remedy that 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:55.009
 next to the diuretic is able to bring a symptomatic improvement 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:55.990
 and also 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.699
 the impact 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.710
 reducing hospitalization mortality 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.400
 It's through a donkey. 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.389
 again because of the evil 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.309
 beta blocker 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:09.270
 that is being released in Brazil 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.270
 based on the serious study is able to reduce by 21% compared to 21% 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:16.339
 the reduction 

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.429
 of morbimortality in this cinema 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.749
 in short 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:23.449
 I hope to see you 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.039
 the reader 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.809
 from this book 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.860
 to interact with us 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.789
 mosaics 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.050
 and also 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.050
 making their criticisms since this editorial project 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.189
 suitor modified with interaction 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:43.219
 with our readers 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.899
 and to finish the clinical cases of the champion's open lesson 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.469
 in our book 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.389
 land him too 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.580
 an instrument of learning fixation 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.199
 so we hope to be somehow helping clinicians 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.999
 generalists 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.159
 cardiologists and that policy makers 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.279
 the importance of this syndrome 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.569
 day in and day out 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.779
 the growth potential 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.269
 against this accelerated until our population's decision
