00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello and welcome to the weather 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.509
 on youtube yes guests was still the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.790
 excuse that I no longer have the video 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.160
 it could be dark and it was dark 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.200
 snowing and today it is also dark and 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.120
 but it is snowing twice in a row 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.369
 I did not bring and also 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.770
 just a bit and I have too 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.470
 my lamp and therefore sounds 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.279
 Everything and it is an exciting week 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.289
 in that one for a short time 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.000
 the west wind has slipped through and that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.189
 always means stormy in the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.329
 northern half of germany above all and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.160
 also a very changeable one 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.140
 snowfall boundary depending on whether straight 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.290
 the warm front is through or the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.180
 cold front is through and is appropriate 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.710
 It almost to the flatlands and so 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.719
 the danger of road slippery and then 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.570
 it goes back up to 800 to 1000 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.039
 meter also means that just for 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.289
 the middle mountains but also for the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.719
 northern side of the Alps at the end of the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.690
 week but a few inches of fresh snow 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.640
 will be been added that is still 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.239
 not the gigantic blanket you look at 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.979
 Wish for the Christmas business 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.439
 but it is at least an initial start 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.360
 after one yes at zero more or 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.670
 Less needs to be done in contrast to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.470
 south of the alps where everything is deep 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.619
 snow is present through the events 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.939
 a few weeks 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.380
 what is still open, of course, how 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.360
 There are tree itself is 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.700
 everything is still too far away 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.070
 conceivable 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.670
 between warm and cold and snow and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.500
 no snow 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.240
 usually is always in the flat country 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.189
 that's the long-standing average he has 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.900
 no snow but as I said that 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.700
 always decides on the first 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.740
 Last meters and that is also this 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.820
 probably not different and year 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.229
 as soon as they can be really sure 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.700
 that you can say they will 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.710
 learn first here or on 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.780
 twitter @ kachelmann or facebook 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.579
 tachelmann weather on twitter you can 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.380
 also best individual questions 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.110
 get rid of that if them a bit 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.240
 To sum up what she was on twitter 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.939
 or have seen facebook 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.159
 that's the fight for that 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.370
 The typhoon at the Philippines is not up 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.860
 the philippines to guest 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.060
 all or almost all journalists want 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.970
 keep writing that 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.010
 that is very terribly full post 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.170
 First of all , I know journalism 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.000
 these things the philippines taifun the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.860
 moved at eleven twelve miles per hour 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.720
 hour eleven to twelve kilometers per hour 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.520
 hour so that's it when she is 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.670
 then they can run fast 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.850
 already in this area 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.920
 Racing is certainly different and the other 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.690
 That's why the typhoons are like that 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.450
 dangerous and exhausting and demanding 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.060
 Many people live because they do so 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.040
 slowly, reign journalists 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.950
 mark you but at some point the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.600
 the problem is not that they race and 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.850
 the wind speed is too high 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.820
 problem is with island countries above all 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.400
 that they are so infinitely slow and 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.400
 that just a wind speed the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.030
 would kill it carefully or 20 or 30 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.940
 150 160 kilometers per hour on it can 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.860
 you can prepare yourself if no things 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.050
 you will fly through the area 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.870
 not die but the problem is that 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.660
 She can spend hours and hours for hours 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.850
 the water build up that more because 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.610
 always the wind from the same direction 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.090
 because just because the mighty typhoon so 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.760
 slow is just this huge 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.370
 flood these high waves and these 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.400
 huge rainfall because he is so slow 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.440
 the dangerous is not the race 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.010
 the wind's wind speed 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.290
 but the dangerous thing is when it comes to 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.440
 island states, the slow is going on 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.420
 They usually do not sneak around 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.580
 more so dramatically wind speeds 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.380
 so long and you just die 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.989
 Mostly not there by the wind 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.780
 directly but by the sea and the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.420
 The sea is so high because the wind is so 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.090
 long from the same direction blowing and 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.290
 already relatively strong but it is 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.610
 pointless I 've got that I think so 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.830
 I often say I have it 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.810
 tried didactically for the 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.890
 average dork journalists 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.200
 to explain but it is likely 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.360
 senseless the next typhoon will be 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.730
 race again and everything is as always 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.970
 okay it was again a try thank you 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.200
 to watch and see you soon 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.340
 They press the button their big one 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.340
 bye bye bye
