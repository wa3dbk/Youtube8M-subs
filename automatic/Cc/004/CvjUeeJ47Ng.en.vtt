00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.200
 install windows 8 on your computer 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.110
 mac 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.660
 the version you have that is not 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.990
 using the boot camps is going to be a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.910
 application then first thing you're going to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.039
 have to do is download this 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.449
 application 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.779
 that is called for the text I'm going to 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.380
 leave you the links in the video and also 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.300
 you will have to download 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.590
 the windows 8 the professional all the more 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.790
 new 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.670
 I 'm really going to put the link 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.000
 Y 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.160
 when I finish down I know that they are more 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.329
 new ones like 4 gigas 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.260
 We continue with the following steps 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.739
 good since you downloaded your 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.000
 files what we are going to do is open 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.000
 the father of the text 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.620
 good they are going to give him to install here I 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.440
 I'm going to stop the recording because if I go to 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.610
 take about 5 minutes you can install 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.120
 current current 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.120
 Y 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.730
 good now we put what of him 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.970
 the key and all that 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.970
 let me stop this 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.140
 once the program was installed 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.140
 we are going to open them 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.210
 and here we are going to say that we want 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.620
 install 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.909
 from an image file 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.380
 here we will choose our file 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.380
 what is going to be windows 8 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.500
 then we give it 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.810
 the iso file is the one that they have to 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.810
 choose 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.969
 and good to continue 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.140
 and the program automatically goes to 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.140
 read as if it were 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.400
 you can invent with the letters and here 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.650
 gives you two options here you can put 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.890
 all the windows of the windows are gone 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.890
 open as if they were small eyelashes 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.450
 to open it as if it were a program 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.650
 totally separated then then to me 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.650
 I like it a lot more like that 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.370
 where the files are going to fall very well 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.370
 and then 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.950
 it may take a while 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.400
 is being installed 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.680
 about 25 minutes 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.319
 but 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.390
 there was not much to do anymore 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.390
 alone it restarted and 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.870
 because it grows 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.870
 I install and here it is 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:02.350
 and well, it would be a matter of what 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.350
 you understand a little 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.320
 and so 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.530
 that was the video I hope you liked it 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.690
 I hope you have served them 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.690
 and I'll be doing more videos 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.919
 that they can learn new things 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.480
 thank you very much
