00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.429
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.840
 new video destiny bungie has his 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.790
 live stream just ended circa 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.799
 one and a half hours went the rest 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.660
 each stream went about an hour 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.850
 Let's summarize what we do 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.770
 could see there was presented 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.760
 new arena mode many have it yes 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.189
 already noticed 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.279
 this new mode is supposed to be the old raid 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.560
 to replace activity in the future one plans 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.289
 while continuing to program the race 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.059
 but then for later dlc it should be 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.850
 We'll stay out of here now 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.890
 first at arena mode in the new reef 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 we can see that there are five new ones 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.540
 focal points are once in the middle 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.730
 Central the new called where we are then 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.520
 actually be able to fly in there 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.260
 for example , ex was to visit or 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.629
 also to the whole for examinations of the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.430
 osiris there we can clean that is 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.469
 yes , you can already say the new goals 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.750
 then we continue to see the right 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.129
 new four arena level these are 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 namely, according to difficulty level 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.689
 ordered that starts at level 28 then 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.270
 32 then 34 and 35 the higher the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.860
 difficulty the better blood 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.979
 it should also be the end we give 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.760
 have seen the level 34er arena mode 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.500
 in the live stream 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.650
 but of course there are also as I said 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.360
 more of the 35 will always exist 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.600
 stay that will always be the same 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.799
 also the value for 28 always the same 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.490
 but for 32 and 34 is from week to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.040
 week to change the reset come 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.869
 we now the actual arena mode that 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.640
 whole is very exciting like 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.860
 an arena so how do you look at the whole 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.140
 many opponents horden the in front 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.790
 certain cases you go off you go 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.009
 but must these waves exist 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.259
 complete certain things, and at the very 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.299
 At the end you get a key 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.159
 which gives you access to a whole 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.470
 given place you can then 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.350
 even after you get the load 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.149
 at ex was the whole against armor parts 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.110
 For example, an exchange is a whole 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.880
 interesting thing 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.920
 but there are not too many 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.870
 We are now coming to the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.360
 important information these 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.730
 We would explicitly have to make the mode explicit 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.610
 namely a few rand info the whole 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.680
 That is about five round hand that is 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.140
 from the moment you start you have to 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.720
 five full rounds exist at the end 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.450
 Your invited to get each one 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.440
 round but has again three own 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.300
 waves 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.950
 they have to be passed one 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.370
 For example, wave can be that you 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.660
 ab and c must defuse that are 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.580
 then like him then have such a 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.620
 countdown where you can see how 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.420
 long the thing is still active if that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.800
 Everything goes down to zero 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.200
 and you start from scratch 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.760
 the world but not completely again to 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.400
 thrown back at the beginning then there is 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.020
 internal checkpoints but not 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.420
 can be passed that is quite 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.700
 interesting that means when you're up 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.870
 you played for round 3 then go out 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.400
 and you think so I'll do it 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.250
 Sometime further, then you catch 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.020
 again at round one at me 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.570
 now times with this so-called wave 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.330
 because every round of these five has yes 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.460
 Three so-called choose a wave 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.440
 for example, just said that 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.850
 mines are defused, but there are still 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.270
 other activities such as 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.850
 kill the vip box that comes out then 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.739
 Run out of a door and you have to 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.330
 then as soon as possible kill all 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.620
 then in three waves and if you do that 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.170
 then you have a round 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.450
 won first comes in arena 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.390
 he probably still has a new one 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.040
 map, for example, we have a kind 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.440
 Cabaret then we have too 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.380
 a sharp web and the whole thing is on 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.150
 the respective species is based on one 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.430
 can already see if you are there at the chance 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.010
 then you have a certain feeling of 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.810
 the sharp as soon as you complete a complete 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.090
 won round you come back in 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.830
 the spawn area where you started 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.480
 then comes through another door is coming 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.489
 on a new map because you too 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.480
 choose these three then create 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.910
 he comes back in the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.050
 sports area and that said five times 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.730
 The whole thing will be a bit 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.780
 complicated because there multipliers 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.880
 are active 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.890
 For example , you know from dusk 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.560
 Strikes There is also a juggler 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.650
 For example, we have active this here 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.959
 also or arcus harm or is over 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.390
 Do more harm with primary weapons at night 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.549
 or you do more damage in close combat 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.459
 or there are also modifications 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.620
 For example, no health 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.259
 regeneration has but as a player 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.569
 a much better health sign the 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:30.150
 the health is not so strong down 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.879
 So the whole thing can be shot by 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.220
 vary game by game and depending on 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:38.159
 from week to week also very strong 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.530
 vary because we have two arena mode 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:43.590
 constantly changed gets from week to 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.659
 week with the weekly reset many have 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.310
 It was already expected from the outset 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.050
 we come to have an arena there 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.449
 enemy waves kill these and whoever 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.500
 the longest holds out at the end of the 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.479
 invited here we have four 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.330
 difficulty levels the higher the 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.430
 difficulty level the better the charged 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.659
 here is a very important edge info 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.979
 the 28er difficulty mode becomes 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:06.690
 Matchmaking means that if you 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:11.190
 going in alone will automatically take you 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:13.139
 two players assigned but only in the 28er 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.599
 he then needs everything else for everything else 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.360
 friends who come to go in to her with as 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.580
 We invited you to the big ones 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.560
 then packed five rounds then 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.630
 you get a so-called key 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.150
 You can use this key 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.800
 that you are in a lower area of ​​the 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.050
 arena can come to spawn 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.669
 area then opens something there 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.680
 He comes down then what is on us 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.210
 You do not know yet when she is lurking 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.279
 we should find out for ourselves but 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.620
 we already know one or the other 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:43.050
 invited that will be legendary among other things 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.750
 item is strange coins 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.120
 dimmer light particle is this way 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.909
 called armor cores give with the 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.490
 then you can also upgrade all items 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.409
 besides, there are supposed to be exotic ones 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.090
 we are very excited oh yes for the 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.190
 people who thought that on this 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.750
 photo here just a rocket launcher 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.120
 you can actually see them 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.949
 that's right, but it's not normal 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.259
 item we can carry that is more 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.960
 a relic that in different waves 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.430
 then being teleported by barricks 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.370
 us that we can take that then 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.529
 such as the shield or the 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.990
 sword from the raid that is then asks 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:21.960
 me here now the counterpart in the 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.490
 new arena mode okay people that would be it 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.130
 then first we hope that this 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.750
 video informative if so is the 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.800
 like a thumbs up there to us 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.980
