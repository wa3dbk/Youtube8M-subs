00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.540
 we had to finish a conversation with salomon kalou 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.059
 We headed out to the trail that offers so counted for a press conference 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.299
 Ivorian team 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.050
 unfortunately for us it can't do it 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.050
 but this year it went where it sits behind a table 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.650
 When the press conferences are over it goes the Ivorian press chief and for us 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.979
 looking 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.160
 he seems to be untraceable 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.570
 eventually you go better and detect yourself 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.150
 We are especially curious about his opinion about why African football players are up 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.300
 Right now so successful at the larger the European clubs where does that come from 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.500
 golden generation african soccer player 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.360
 Yes but 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.070
 I think and 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.740
 both for 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.980
 for the items for sale but also by jumbo 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.090
 You can do apple here in the jungle year because that is your chin if I agree with you 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.500
 especially on profit 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.600
 everyone again to play up the third goal for orange 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.800
 this because he is fat little boy 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.770
 want to be then 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.840
 been on the map for ages 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.360
 think h after dry after which the authorities participate more than I play 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.210
 not on 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.560
 dekker mind ring 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.000
 what should happen to african football 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.930
 want to produce african world champion 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.140
 are you thinking from the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.100
 the champion and the Africans 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 an agent saw start than planned 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.570
 if I don't train for a year 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.810
 the latest news 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.110
 but i think i'm here 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.730
 like all others 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.010
 a few 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.010
 I do not know anymore 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410
 the concentration and w 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.650
 in variant 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.009
 I really help 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.350
 that most of the Ivorian players do not play at a top European club 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:05.250
 Kennedy to take that experience into the team 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.980
 7 to this message 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.489
 pray when you look 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.399
 and that 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.749
 the photos I did not say product 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.650
 according to plan and now when playing with more a garden in beijing 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:19.419
 play at controlled the match and 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.859
 4 you can play a player in that time and run at the club 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.599
 primera make sure that more goods are in the pool 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.269
 it always better 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.189
 the match is the time that 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.579
 he denies that 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.489
 because if you can people with bad luck 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.489
 2 mdp the player who plays 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:41.569
 that is not true 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.979
 I think so 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:45.349
 good for trust 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.459
 for that 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.039
 play the game after an hour 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.039
 do you have a message to me i have too 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.099
 to be 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.249
 the empire must get rid of it 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.949
 again at twente greta arn 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.739

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.799

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.349

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:17.460
 everybody is happy 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.549
 that afterwards better for your chance 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.279
 the attack involving this 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:24.289
 not a good choice for her 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.239
 and with it my support 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 therefore also a good choice 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.419
 so no actions phone with but maybe 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.419
