00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.009
Dude, in order for you to get your Spiral correctly
The first thing you have to think about is to not put so much strength in your arm

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:47.009
Else you're going to spin outside the line axis and it's not going to be cool  :p

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:48.009
Else you're going to spin outside the line axis and it's not going to be cool  :p

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:55.009
Your body is here, if you do this with your hand, 
your body will go there and you will land outside the line

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:13.009
You may notice I don't even use my arm to spin
I can do it like 'no hands'

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.009
Your arm barely pushes your body

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.009
And another one ...

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.309
If you push it too much you will end up landing vertically with your body...

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:45.509
You will end up getting any trick but the Spiral.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.409
It's also very important that the arm that doesn't hold the line ...

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.509
Throw your shoulder backwards, the same time you twist your waist (with a kick)

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:05.509
So you can spin faster, stronger
Like this you won't need too much height and you won't escape your spin axis

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.509
Another very important thing so you can land it safely is:

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.009
This leg (the one in the line) won't leave the line too far

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:19.509
You should pressure it against the line...
So you won't need to pressure your arms too much

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.509
But this foot won't leave the line, at least your toes should be close enough ...

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.509
Look at it again

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.009
Stick a shorter one...

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:55.000
Could you see it?
The leg doesn't leave the line too much so I don't go off the axis ...

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.500
So I don't land on the other side ...

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:08.000
Another very important thing in the Spiral is 
to pressure your chestbounce knee forcing it down

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
To push your body higher to compensate the boost you should not do with your arm, so you do it with your knee

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It's also important that the other leg ...
Kick your body up ... like the 'boneless', but not sideways, upwards!

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.500
So you can keep your axis

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Look this leg right here...

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.500
What makes you spin is your kick and your shoulder move... 
You should look up your shoulders

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.000
Throw it and tuck it ...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:18.300
And then, at the end of your spin, push your body FAST towards the line, it should grab the line before you land the chestbounce

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:30.000
The more you do it, the easier it will be for you to grab the line with your hand in the right momentum before landing the chestbounce

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
For you to do the spiral ...

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
cut ...

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
record it again...

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Dude, for you to "record" the spiral ... 
For you to "get" the spiral ...
