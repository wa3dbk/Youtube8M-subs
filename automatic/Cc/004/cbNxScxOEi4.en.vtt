00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
Diamandis and Steven Colter and it's all

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.929 
Diamandis and Steven Colter and it's all
about<00:01:58.079> inspiring<00:01:58.409> entrepreneurs<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
about inspiring entrepreneurs in the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.230 
about inspiring entrepreneurs in the
tech<00:02:00.299> sector<00:02:00.630> especially<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.649> they<00:02:02.610> talk

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
tech sector especially and they talk

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.410 
tech sector especially and they talk
about<00:02:03.270> something<00:02:03.540> called<00:02:04.189> exponential

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
about something called exponential

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.459 
about something called exponential
technologies<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.719> what<00:02:07.200> they're<00:02:07.320> referring

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
technologies and what they're referring

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.249 
technologies and what they're referring
to<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.640> technology<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.599> time

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
to is not just a technology but a time

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.690 
to is not just a technology but a time
and<00:02:10.590> space<00:02:10.950> where<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.150> industry

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and space where the industry

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.410 
and space where the industry
is<00:02:12.760> ripe<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.770> massive<00:02:14.770> rapid<00:02:15.520> growth<00:02:16.060> hence

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
is ripe for massive rapid growth hence

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.229 
is ripe for massive rapid growth hence
the<00:02:16.540> term<00:02:16.750> exponential<00:02:17.590> technologies<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.030> for

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
the term exponential technologies so for

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.390 
the term exponential technologies so for
example<00:02:19.300> Facebook<00:02:20.170> wouldn't<00:02:20.950> have<00:02:21.099> been

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
example Facebook wouldn't have been

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.330 
example Facebook wouldn't have been
possible<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.420> launch<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.959> 1995<00:02:23.769> even<00:02:24.220> though

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340

the internet was up there was the

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.680 
the internet was up there was the
infrastructure<00:02:26.620> available<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:28.000> really<00:02:28.300> scale

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
infrastructure available to really scale

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.410 
infrastructure available to really scale

that<00:02:33.819> Instagram<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.720> another<00:02:35.080> example

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
that Instagram is another example

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.460 
that Instagram is another example
Instagram<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.610> basically<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.360> photo<00:02:37.989> app<00:02:38.230> with

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
Instagram is basically a photo app with

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.960 
Instagram is basically a photo app with
filters<00:02:38.890> at<00:02:39.099> least<00:02:39.250> that's<00:02:39.459> what<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.700> was<00:02:39.819> when

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
filters at least that's what it was when

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.150 
filters at least that's what it was when
it<00:02:40.030> first<00:02:40.150> came<00:02:40.480> out<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.290> 18<00:02:41.650> months<00:02:41.799> it

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
it first came out and in 18 months it

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.780 
it first came out and in 18 months it
was<00:02:42.700> sold<00:02:43.030> for<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.330> billion<00:02:43.930> dollars<00:02:44.470> with<00:02:45.340> no

was sold for a billion dollars with no

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.809 
was sold for a billion dollars with no
revenue<00:02:46.540> model<00:02:46.870> crazy<00:02:47.590> that's<00:02:48.190> an<00:02:48.310> example<00:02:48.580> of

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
revenue model crazy that's an example of

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.210 
revenue model crazy that's an example of
exponential<00:02:49.569> technologies<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.410> what<00:02:51.040> we're

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
exponential technologies and what we're

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.880 
exponential technologies and what we're
looking<00:02:51.519> at<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.849> a<00:02:51.880> point<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.720> time<00:02:52.750> where<00:02:53.709> it's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
looking at is a point in time where it's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.550 
looking at is a point in time where it's
perfectly<00:02:54.400> ripe<00:02:54.760> for<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> technology<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.260> just

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
perfectly ripe for a technology to just

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.979 
perfectly ripe for a technology to just
explode<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:57.730> first<00:02:58.060> there<00:02:58.540> has<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
explode but first there has to be the

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.990 
explode but first there has to be the
infrastructure<00:02:59.470> that's<00:02:59.680> available<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.819> how

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
infrastructure that's available so how

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.170 
infrastructure that's available so how
does<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.180> relate<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.660> uncle<00:03:02.500> Sammy<00:03:02.920> well<00:03:03.880> I

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
does this relate to uncle Sammy well I

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.720 
does this relate to uncle Sammy well I
think<00:03:04.540> Samsung<00:03:05.230> has<00:03:05.440> got<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> look<00:03:05.980> at<00:03:06.190> what

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
think Samsung has got a look at what

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.789 
think Samsung has got a look at what
their<00:03:06.880> advantages<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.630> if<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.410> look<00:03:08.590> in<00:03:08.769> my

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
their advantages is if you look in my

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.800 
their advantages is if you look in my
house<00:03:09.130> here<00:03:09.459> we<00:03:09.579> have<00:03:09.790> multiple<00:03:10.420> Samsung

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
why I bought an ipad because my iPad

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.780 
why I bought an ipad because my iPad
connects<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.829> communicates<00:03:51.280> with<00:03:51.639> my
