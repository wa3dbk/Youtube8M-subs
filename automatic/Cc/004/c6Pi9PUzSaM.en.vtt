00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.260
 From somewhere, the spring breeze 

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:28.050
 Put a new color on this road that you often walk through 

00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:37.438
 Whether it is happiness or sadness, it belongs to the past season. 

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:47.128
 We will embark on a new road 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.858
 Cherry blossoms are imprints 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:05.746
 The face of a friend emerges in the palm of your hand 

00:01:05.747 --> 00:01:13.860
 Cherry blossoms are the mark of tears 

00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:26.400
 Itâ€™s like reminding us not to forget the precious moment... 

00:01:35.775 --> 00:01:44.825
 If you look up at the sky, you will know 

00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:53.522
 How huge is this road 

00:01:53.524 --> 00:02:02.851
 Whether it is sunny or rainy, tomorrow will come tomorrow. 

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:12.533
 We smile and take the initial step 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:21.301
 Cherry blossom is the mark of the future 

00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:31.099
 I will remember that dream one day. 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.205
 Cherry blossom is the mark of hope 

00:02:39.206 --> 00:02:51.876
 Open this new page instead of giving up. 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:12.028
 Cherry blossom is the mark on the heart 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:21.888
 How dazzling the radiance of the shining youth leaves 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.885
 Cherry blossoms are the mark of the day 

00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:42.550
 Let everyone not forget the dream of blooming 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
