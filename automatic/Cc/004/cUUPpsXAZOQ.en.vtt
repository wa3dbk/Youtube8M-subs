always buy it but I try to buy it when I
can<00:05:20.140> and<00:05:20.560> when<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.800> place<00:05:20.980> is<00:05:21.190> not<00:05:21.340> too<00:05:21.580> bad

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
can and when the place is not too bad

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.790 
can and when the place is not too bad
and<00:05:23.800> as<00:05:23.980> far<00:05:24.130> as<00:05:24.250> there<00:05:24.400> being<00:05:24.430> a<00:05:24.730> difference

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
and as far as there being a difference

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.340 
and as far as there being a difference
you<00:05:26.800> wouldn't<00:05:27.160> know<00:05:27.480> or<00:05:28.480> understand<00:05:29.140> it

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
you wouldn't know or understand it

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.340

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
unless you've tried it

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.940 
unless you've tried it
because<00:05:32.350> there<00:05:33.160> is<00:05:33.340> a<00:05:34.020> overall<00:05:35.020> difference<00:05:35.380> in

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
because there is a overall difference in

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.650 
because there is a overall difference in
your<00:05:36.250> health<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.820> your<00:05:36.940> energy<00:05:37.360> and<00:05:37.390> your

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
whatever when you switch over to organic

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.140 
whatever when you switch over to organic
it's<00:05:41.740> just<00:05:42.160> that's<00:05:42.670> just<00:05:42.940> how<00:05:43.330> it<00:05:43.510> is<00:05:43.920> and<00:05:45.150> and
