on tour I just want to learn how to hit
and<00:00:17.460> my<00:00:17.640> answer<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> them<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.660> order<00:00:18.810> to

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and my answer to them is in order to

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.390 
and my answer to them is in order to
learn<00:00:19.080> how<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.289> hit<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.560> ball<00:00:19.830> straight<00:00:19.859> you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
learn how to hit the ball straight you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.250 
learn how to hit the ball straight you
need<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.640> be<00:00:20.760> able<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.240> learn<00:00:21.539> how<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.869> curve

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
need to be able to learn how to curve

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.990 
need to be able to learn how to curve
the<00:00:22.410> ball<00:00:22.529> left<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.010> curveball<00:00:23.490> right<00:00:23.519> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the ball left and curveball right and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.279 
the ball left and curveball right and
somewhere<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.449> between<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.930> obviously

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
somewhere in between is obviously

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.560 
somewhere in between is obviously
straight<00:00:25.699> it's<00:00:26.699> important<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> understand

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
straight it's important to understand

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.800 
straight it's important to understand
that<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.500> order<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.830> hit<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> ball<00:00:29.340> straight

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
that in order to hit the ball straight

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.179 
that in order to hit the ball straight
you<00:00:30.810> need<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.050> hit<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.260> middle<00:00:31.650> third<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you need to hit the middle third of the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.700 
you need to hit the middle third of the
ball<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.510> look<00:00:33.750> at<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> golf<00:00:34.170> ball<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.500> three

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
ball so I look at a golf ball in three

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.680 
ball so I look at a golf ball in three
parts<00:00:34.950> let's<00:00:35.309> say<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> Titleist<00:00:36.030> logo<00:00:36.420> here

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
parts let's say the Titleist logo here

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.540 
parts let's say the Titleist logo here
is<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.079> middle<00:00:37.380> third<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> ball<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.489> is

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
is the middle third of the ball this is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.639 
is the middle third of the ball this is
the<00:00:38.790> outside<00:00:39.210> part<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> ball<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the outside part of the ball and this is

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.979 
the outside part of the ball and this is
the<00:00:40.770> inside<00:00:41.070> part<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> ball<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> when

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
the inside part of the ball so when

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
the inside part of the ball so when
you're<00:00:43.079> hitting<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.379> ball<00:00:43.559> straight<00:00:43.710> obviously

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you're hitting a ball straight obviously

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.000 
you're hitting a ball straight obviously
the<00:00:44.760> clubface<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.600> hitting<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> middle<00:00:46.710> part

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the clubface is hitting the middle part

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.680 
the clubface is hitting the middle part
of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> golf<00:00:47.340> ball<00:00:47.430> well<00:00:48.149> what<00:00:48.300> would<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.450> take

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
of the golf ball well what would it take

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.630 
of the golf ball well what would it take
to<00:00:48.840> make<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> ball<00:00:49.289> curve<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> left<00:00:49.890> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
to make the ball curve to the left you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.100 
to make the ball curve to the left you
would<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> flat<00:00:51.420> surface<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
would have the flat surface of the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.750 
would have the flat surface of the
clubface<00:00:52.350> coming<00:00:53.070> around<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.460> hitting<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
clubface coming around and hitting the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490 
clubface coming around and hitting the
outside<00:00:54.329> part<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> ball<00:00:54.809> imparting

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
outside part of the ball imparting

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.220 
outside part of the ball imparting
right-to-left<00:00:56.010> spin<00:00:57.079> conversely<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
right-to-left spin conversely if you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.959 
right-to-left spin conversely if you
want<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> hit<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> fade<00:00:58.920> you'd<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> hit<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
want to hit a fade you'd have to hit the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.060 
want to hit a fade you'd have to hit the
inside<00:01:00.480> part<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> ball<00:01:01.079> producing

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
inside part of the ball producing

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.020 
inside part of the ball producing
left-to-right<00:01:02.550> spin

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
left-to-right spin

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.490 
left-to-right spin
there's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.390> misconception<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
there's a misconception out there that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
there's a misconception out there that
you<00:01:04.769> hit<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> draw<00:01:05.280> or<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> right-to-left<00:01:06.060> shot

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you hit a draw or a right-to-left shot

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.080 
you hit a draw or a right-to-left shot
by<00:01:07.049> hitting<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.979> inside<00:01:08.430> part<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> ball

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
by hitting the inside part of the ball

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.359 
by hitting the inside part of the ball
now<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> path<00:01:10.260> may<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.590> coming<00:01:11.040> from<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
now the path may be coming from the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.490 
now the path may be coming from the
inside<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> clubface<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.960> actually

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
inside but the clubface is actually

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.480 
inside but the clubface is actually
closed<00:01:14.030> imparting<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.090> right-to-left<00:01:15.689> spin

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
closed imparting that right-to-left spin

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.649 
closed imparting that right-to-left spin
in<00:01:17.490> order<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> learn<00:01:18.060> how<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.299> shape<00:01:18.630> your

I'm<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> come

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
I'm going to do is I'm going to come

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.639 
I'm going to do is I'm going to come
around<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.040> hit<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.700> outside<00:01:47.970> part<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
impact bag and you can see Ivan parted

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.760 
impact bag and you can see Ivan parted
right-to-left<00:01:52.619> spin<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:54.350> if<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.470> want<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
right-to-left spin on that if I want to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.730 
right-to-left spin on that if I want to
fade<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.540> I'm<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> hit<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> inside<00:01:58.469> part

fade it I'm going to hit the inside part

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380 
fade it I'm going to hit the inside part
of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> bag<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.729> how<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> put

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
of the bag and you can see how I put

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.530 
of the bag and you can see how I put
left-to-right<00:02:01.020> spin<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
left-to-right spin on that

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.080 
left-to-right spin on that
and<00:02:03.200> if<00:02:03.410> we're<00:02:03.560> trying<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.860> find<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.550> straight

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
and if we're trying to find a straight

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.880 
and if we're trying to find a straight
ball<00:02:05.300> we're<00:02:05.900> just<00:02:06.110> going<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.320> go<00:02:06.470> ahead<00:02:06.560> and

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
ball we're just going to go ahead and

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.260 
ball we're just going to go ahead and
hit<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.160> middle<00:02:07.430> part<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.790> impact<00:02:08.090> bag

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
hit the middle part of the impact bag

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.700 
hit the middle part of the impact bag
you<00:02:08.390> can<00:02:08.570> see<00:02:08.750> I've<00:02:08.869> just<00:02:09.050> moved<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.470> thing

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
you can see I've just moved that thing

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.460 
you can see I've just moved that thing
straight<00:02:10.400> ahead<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.990> it's<00:02:12.110> important<00:02:12.440> to

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
straight ahead so it's important to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.920 
straight ahead so it's important to
understand<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.520> golf<00:02:14.090> club<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.600> flat

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
understand that a golf club is a flat

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.610 
understand that a golf club is a flat
surface<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.710> we<00:02:16.670> have<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.850> round<00:02:17.120> ball<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.530> as

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
surface and we have a round ball so as

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.620 
surface and we have a round ball so as
far<00:02:18.800> as<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> geometry<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.550> concerned<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:20.270> you

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
far as the geometry is concerned if you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.710 
far as the geometry is concerned if you
hit<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> outside<00:02:21.050> part<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:23.420> got<00:02:23.660> a

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
hit the outside part of it it's got a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.360 
hit the outside part of it it's got a
spin<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.320> left<00:02:24.350> if<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.830> hit<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.070> inside

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
spin to the left if you hit the inside

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.070 
spin to the left if you hit the inside
part<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.850> it's<00:02:26.240> got<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.630> spin<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.050> right

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
part of it it's got to spin to the right

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.360 
part of it it's got to spin to the right
and<00:02:27.380> if<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.530> get<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.740> middle<00:02:27.890> part<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.220> it

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
and if you get the middle part of it

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.690 
and if you get the middle part of it
it's<00:02:28.820> going<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.120> go<00:02:29.240> straight<00:02:30.400> it's<00:02:31.400> really

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
it's going to go straight it's really

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.790 
it's going to go straight it's really
that<00:02:31.850> simple

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
that simple

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.020 
that simple
