00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:08.029
 Yes it is now only a little today anymore 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:11.480
 It after the training today is such training 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:16.640
 I think that I want to get used to the beginning a little from drying 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.250
 To long ago I it's 4 years Hey I entered the industry of this fit is of sound trainer 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.820
 but 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:27.880
 It is said to correct it in those strange fitness 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:33.879
 The more you do training in the form, the more you gob 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:39.579
 Correct form Hey I tried various things in the form as the textbook but everything 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.329
 I was also doing Toka I voxy tool to not go well but also to say that the competition force 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.110
 Something 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 I like to go in more and more decision but muscle is strapping 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.890
 There was Meiji 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.789
 I the truth of Tteyuu before entering ne industry of this trainer in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:59.789
 I was training freely, regardless of the form 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:05.070
 Deliberately Toka only wearing the far has been abandoned of I Toka movement of various ne left and right non-symmetrical Sports 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.250
 Ne I think that if you take an unstable state and demonstrate explosive power, such training 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.960
 I had a lot 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:16.890
 But when you enter the trainer industry it's all at once 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:21.870
 I started to receive an indication such as a form that seems to be incorrect or something 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:27.270
 Well, I said that kind of thing little by little 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:32.940
 I That's right, even our customers's 3 feel that is said to be correct in the really ne fitness 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.010
 It is true that there is no form, but I may not be injured, but my body balance and 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.270
 Hey 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:44.000
 I will feel going worse I eye performance web that was seen 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.190
 More you are free, there are people in nature and it is not just this pond 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.570
 It will be covered 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:56.060
 You that I think you can lot of movement to be rounding 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:59.020
 I really and are just another robot like a movement I ignore all this 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:05.170
 I think it will become unusable 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:08.080
 I may not be injured at first, but I am going to break the balance a little other than this 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.730
 If you decide to give it up 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.590
 Nee places that are not trained to one side with the burden 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.720
 It becomes dirty 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:24.280
 And of course it is not possible to say that this form is a competitive ability . 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:29.080
 I do not know what to do I demonstrate whether the force stick with one foot Birds 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:34.660
 Such practice is really important and should be separated 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:40.530
 I think that it is good to play competitive power with keedola gold, but by all means 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:45.959
 There were also many athletes who put too much weight on muscle training and fail 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:50.940
 Also in regard to the general people a only after all it only covers with muscle 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:54.510
 I think that I feel cool if I feel easy or I can't move 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.670
 The area is various 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.550
 It is dependent on the opinion I wish I thought that myself go this home and I do try to do with it 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.170
 think 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.130
 So if you go and verify 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.780
 I think this will be born with really good training 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:17.480
 I'm not free anymore I'm thinking too I can do it all the time 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.370
 I think it's in a better shape now, but now I notice that 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.190
 Now other I Nde better was 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.190
 Return to the old days and train freely in it 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.180
 But I do it while being careful not to pass 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.040
 I think this is important 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:39.170
 I Come Nde I also after this training I was too little explanation long 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.500
 I also I you through the first time to do I try I thought it be nice 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:47.330
 This is do I think that good if you do not do it If you thought that Akan 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.950
 I think it would be nice if you could enjoy watching it with that kind of feeling 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.950
