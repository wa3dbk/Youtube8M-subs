00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 today the world water day is celebrated and 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.549
 here in snail news and we start with 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.950
 a series of special reports on 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.780
 the state of that vital fluid in 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.700
 our country in this first delivery 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.950
 dollar blood man takes us to the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.360
 páramo of sumapaz also known as 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.760
 the water factory 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.280
 At first glance it is difficult to notice the 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.170
 secrets that this landscape contains 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.780
 it's about the páramo of sumapaz the most 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.480
 world's largest and one of 34 complexes 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.400
 of páramo in colombia 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.590
 you have to look in detail to 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.270
 discover how your vegetation is dedicated to 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.730
 the important task of storing water 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.890
 that leaves the clouds more than 3000 meters 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.280
 above sea level are gothic 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.550
 small water they are sticking to 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.920
 the surfaces to the flora to the ground are 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.910
 they have sticking to the rocks they condense 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.769
 they join and form the streams 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.940
 streams that are just the beginning of 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.190
 a long journey 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 I find three thousand seven hundred 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.449
 twenty meters above sea level what 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 incredible is that the water that collects this 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.470
 vegetation empties into the sea in the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.960
 Atlantic ocean had already the river 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.090
 Orinoco or the Magdalena River but first 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.560
 they must cross the Andean forest where 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.690
 those waters face a problem 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.430
 environmental according to the teacher of the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.950
 university of the andes german andrade 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.840
 the challenge is cultural we have always been 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.940
 a culture that limits the earth 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.799
 to farm to put livestock and 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.840
 clean the earth is just the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.429
 problem and that is the misuse of the forest 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.530
 Andean prevents the soil and 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.960
 vegetation absorb the water that comes 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.759
 of the páramo which affects the quality and 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.399
 the amount of liquid that arrives 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.860
 eventually to the rivers and the sea with 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.470
 sediment causing water problems 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.950
 down 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.480
 in the winter waves because it floods this 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.180
 map of the institute alexander von 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.490
 humboldt points one million 930 hectares 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.320
 of páramo in the country although together with the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.900
 Ministry of the Environment evaluate a 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.880
 new map that would declare 2 million 900 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.580
 hectares of páramo surrounded by 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.290
 3,500,000 of forest 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.480
 both ecosystems are exposed to 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.940
 deforestation for is agriculture 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.009
 livestock or mining josé yunís 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.740
 representative of the nation conserves and 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.380
 proposes more control in the case of 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.850
 Andean forest really does work 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.810
 from the point of education for a 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.730
 side but there must also be 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.410
 much stronger government programs 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.540
 as payments for environmental services 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 where there are resources that the government 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.520
 intended to protect those ecosystems 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.709
 take care of the forests and páramos protects the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.600
 water and guarantees that generations 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.810
 future have access to that resource 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.170
 vital 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.239
 having clean water has been an illusion 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.819
 for the inhabitants of carmen de bolívar 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.980
 for eight decades the different 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.270
 governments have broken this promise 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.980
 to the point that today they continue 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.989
 crying out for this basic service 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.690
 the last of the 5 inaugurations of the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.690
 aqueduct was in 2003 and had a 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.909
 burlesque pomp the water gushed out of this 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.950
 sink but it came from the cistern of a 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.110
 neighboring house and not the home network 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.660
 as the ruler of 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.670
 turn is a bit is that there are so many 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.220
 buffoons and multi-million dollar investments 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.950
 for 80 years at the expense of an aqueduct 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.720
 nonexistent they undermined the credibility and 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.370
 illusion of the carmeros here never 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.440
 excites the conta cynically when 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.590
 comes the president who put him in the 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.390
 square its about 80 thousand inhabitants are 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.670
 They used to quench their thirst with water 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.160
 who trade in tank trucks or extract 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.140
 of puddles pools and the downpours 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.140
 sporadic rain 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.160
 due to the continued theft and the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.629
 inoperability of the aqueduct 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.480
 superintendence of public services 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.030
 he has been involved for 4 years 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.340
 this intervening entity announced that 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.200
 the product will stop being a mirage and 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.480
 drinking water will finally reach the 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.900
 houses we connect the system and we can in 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.269
 next month and deliver the water 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.459
 domiciled but accustomed to 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.319
 false promises and an eternal emergency 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.480
 health the carmeros believe that it 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.489
 is another chimera and what awaits you 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.489
 many years of thirsting agony
