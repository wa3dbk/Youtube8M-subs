ram<00:00:25.050> pack<00:00:25.460> asks<00:00:26.460> why<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:27.000> my<00:00:27.269> bandit<00:00:27.570> pull-ups

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
ram pack asks why are my bandit pull-ups

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.870 
ram pack asks why are my bandit pull-ups
not<00:00:28.050> translating<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.710> real<00:00:28.920> pull-ups<00:00:29.310> I've

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
not translating to real pull-ups I've

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.400 
not translating to real pull-ups I've
been<00:00:30.060> decreasing<00:00:30.390> my<00:00:30.630> number<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.960> bands<00:00:31.199> but

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
been decreasing my number of bands but

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.520 
been decreasing my number of bands but
I'm<00:00:31.529> stuck<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> smallest<00:00:32.579> one<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> anytime

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
I'm stuck on the smallest one so anytime

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.400 
I'm stuck on the smallest one so anytime
that<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.730> better<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.030> anything

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
that we want to get better at anything

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.180 
that we want to get better at anything
any<00:00:37.410> type<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> training<00:00:39.649> you<00:00:40.649> want<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> more

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
any type of training you want it more

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.930 
any type of training you want it more
variety<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.000> drive<00:00:42.950> adaptation<00:00:43.950> quicker<00:00:44.250> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
variety to drive adaptation quicker so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.119 
variety to drive adaptation quicker so
you're<00:00:45.510> basically<00:00:45.629> using<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.649> way<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you're basically using one way of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.369 
you're basically using one way of
getting<00:00:47.190> better<00:00:48.030> at<00:00:48.270> something<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.930> banded

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
getting better at something so banded

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.400 
getting better at something so banded
pull-ups<00:00:50.030> also<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.300> reducing<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.079> lot<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
pull-ups also it's reducing a lot of the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
pull-ups also it's reducing a lot of the
load<00:00:52.620> at<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.829> bottom<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.460> band<00:00:53.640> pull<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
load at the bottom of a band pull up and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.760 
load at the bottom of a band pull up and
then<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> load<00:00:54.840> becomes<00:00:55.170> heavier<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.649> get

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
then the load becomes heavier as you get

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
then the load becomes heavier as you get
to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> top<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.879> may<00:00:57.270> be<00:00:57.329> getting

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to the top so you may be getting

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.479 
to the top so you may be getting
stronger<00:00:57.989> at<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.230> top<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.620> pull-up<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.430> you

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
stronger at the top of a pull-up but you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.010 
stronger at the top of a pull-up but you
may<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.969> increasing<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.629> strength<00:01:00.750> as

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
may not be increasing your strength as

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.510 
may not be increasing your strength as
much<00:01:01.199> at<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> bottom<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> pull-up<00:01:02.160> even

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
much at the bottom of the pull-up even

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.619 
much at the bottom of the pull-up even
though<00:01:02.670> you're<00:01:02.879> getting<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> thinner<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
though you're getting the thinner and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.280 
though you're getting the thinner and
thinner<00:01:03.660> bands<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:06.210> couple<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> ways

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
thinner bands so a couple of the ways

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.630 
thinner bands so a couple of the ways
that<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.680> train<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> just

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
that you can train and I like to just

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.630 
that you can train and I like to just
rotate<00:01:09.180> these<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.540> people<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.640> doing

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
rotate these with people is doing

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
rotate these with people is doing
negatives<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.659> eccentric<00:01:13.170> pull-ups<00:01:13.619> or

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
negatives so eccentric pull-ups or

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
negatives so eccentric pull-ups or
they're<00:01:14.130> also<00:01:14.250> called<00:01:14.490> negatives<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
they're also called negatives that is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.210 
they're also called negatives that is
start<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.500> chin<00:01:16.680> over<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> bar<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
start with your chin over the bar and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.700 
start with your chin over the bar and
then<00:01:17.310> let<00:01:17.580> yourself<00:01:17.970> down<00:01:18.090> slowly<00:01:18.560> for<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
then let yourself down slowly for that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
then let yourself down slowly for that
one<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> don't<00:01:20.159> want<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> ton<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> reps<00:01:21.060> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
one you don't want to do a ton of reps I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.600 
one you don't want to do a ton of reps I
wouldn't<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.930> than<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> total<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.130> 20

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
wouldn't do more than a total of like 20

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.719 
wouldn't do more than a total of like 20
to<00:01:23.729> 25<00:01:24.119> reps<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.350> single<00:01:25.770> training<00:01:26.130> day<00:01:26.280> for

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to 25 reps in a single training day for

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.480 
to 25 reps in a single training day for
that<00:01:26.850> i<00:01:27.030> would<00:01:27.240> start<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.200> nice<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
that i would start you know nice and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.160 
that i would start you know nice and
nice<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> low<00:01:29.850> rep<00:01:30.060> range<00:01:30.299> maybe<00:01:30.479> total<00:01:30.840> 15

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
nice and low rep range maybe total 15

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.050 
nice and low rep range maybe total 15
reps<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.100> would<00:01:32.220> split<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.490> up<00:01:32.670> into<00:01:32.759> three

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
reps so you would split it up into three

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.730 
reps so you would split it up into three
sets<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.360> five<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:33.900> five<00:01:34.079> sets<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.409> three<00:01:34.619> or

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
sets of five or five sets of three or

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.069 
sets of five or five sets of three or
something<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.780> plenty<00:01:36.990> of

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
something like that so and get plenty of

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.050 
something like that so and get plenty of
rest<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.409> between<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:38.430> those<00:01:38.549> e<00:01:38.670> centric

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
rest in between with those e centric

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060 
rest in between with those e centric
pull-ups<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.560> people<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:40.920> as

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
pull-ups I like for people to get as

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.219 
pull-ups I like for people to get as
high<00:01:41.310> as<00:01:41.369> they<00:01:41.579> possibly<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:42.240> because<00:01:42.840> it's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
high as they possibly can because it's
