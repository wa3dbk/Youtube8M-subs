00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
touching the camera itself you want to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.900 
touching the camera itself you want to
make<00:00:22.560> sure<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:23.130> some<00:00:23.369> ESD<00:00:23.880> protection

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
make sure you use some ESD protection

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.570

if<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.600> use<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> tweezer<00:01:58.670> make<00:01:59.670> sure<00:01:59.880> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
if you do use a tweezer make sure you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.940 
if you do use a tweezer make sure you
look<00:02:00.240> at<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> clamp<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.259> lifting<00:02:01.500> it

look at the clamp as you're lifting it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.910 
look at the clamp as you're lifting it
to<00:02:02.159> make<00:02:02.520> sure<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:03.719> are<00:02:03.810> no<00:02:03.930> bins<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.799> are

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to make sure there are no bins that are

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.089 
to make sure there are no bins that are
happening<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:06.390> best<00:02:06.810> way<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.170> prevent<00:02:07.799> any

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
happening the best way to prevent any

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.910 
happening the best way to prevent any
damage<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.690> pull<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.410> cable<00:02:10.800> out

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
damage is to just pull the cable out

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.870 
damage is to just pull the cable out
without<00:02:11.430> lifting<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.970> clamp

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
without lifting the clamp

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.360 
without lifting the clamp
that<00:02:13.510> way<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:14.680> don't<00:02:14.890> risk<00:02:15.100> any<00:02:15.310> damage<00:02:15.900> and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
that way you don't risk any damage and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.850 
that way you don't risk any damage and
then<00:02:18.370> once<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.700> cable<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.120> out<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:19.870> lift

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
then once the cable is out you can lift

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.580 
then once the cable is out you can lift
the<00:02:21.070> clamp<00:02:21.340> with<00:02:21.640> ease

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the clamp with ease

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.530 
the clamp with ease
okay<00:02:23.590> enough<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:23.980> all<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.300> let's<00:02:25.300> go<00:02:25.510> ahead

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
okay enough of all that let's go ahead

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.460 
okay enough of all that let's go ahead
and<00:02:25.870> continue<00:02:26.110> disassembling<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.390> h7t<00:02:28.470> next

that are holding the lens flex cables in

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.090 
that are holding the lens flex cables in
place<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.690> said<00:03:01.900> before<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.500> easiest<00:03:02.980> way

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
place like I said before and easiest way

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.640 
place like I said before and easiest way
to<00:03:03.130> do<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.850> just<00:03:04.050> grab<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.260> cable

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
to do this is to just grab the cable

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.400 
to do this is to just grab the cable
with<00:03:05.910> flat-head<00:03:06.910> tweezer<00:03:07.570> or<00:03:08.790> pliers<00:03:09.790> and

with flat-head tweezer or pliers and

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.320 
with flat-head tweezer or pliers and
pull<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.560> flex<00:03:11.830> cable<00:03:11.920> out<00:03:12.340> without<00:03:12.580> raising

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
pull the flex cable out without raising

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:21.600 
pull the flex cable out without raising
the<00:03:13.360> clamps<00:03:19.350> now<00:03:20.350> as<00:03:20.560> far<00:03:20.770> as<00:03:20.920> installing<00:03:21.280> the

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
the clamps now as far as installing the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.690 
the clamps now as far as installing the
Flex<00:03:21.940> cables<00:03:22.120> back<00:03:22.540> into<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.960> clamps<00:03:23.550> keep<00:03:24.550> in

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
Flex cables back into the clamps keep in

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.120 
Flex cables back into the clamps keep in
mind<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.390> Flex<00:03:26.020> cables<00:03:26.230> do<00:03:26.560> not<00:03:26.710> go<00:03:26.860> in

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
mind that the Flex cables do not go in

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.510 
mind that the Flex cables do not go in
that<00:03:27.760> far<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.500> make<00:03:29.680> sure<00:03:29.710> you<00:03:30.040> review<00:03:30.220> the

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
that far so make sure you review the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.600 
that far so make sure you review the
pictures<00:03:30.910> out<00:03:31.710> what<00:03:32.710> it<00:03:32.830> looks<00:03:33.070> like<00:03:33.310> when

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
pictures out what it looks like when

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.730 
pictures out what it looks like when
it's<00:03:33.760> inserted<00:03:34.330> into<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.780> clamp<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.560> can

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
it's inserted into the clamp so you can

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.700 
it's inserted into the clamp so you can
see<00:03:35.950> exactly<00:03:36.130> how<00:03:36.640> far<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:37.000> goes<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.710> before

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
see exactly how far it goes in before

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:48.420 
see exactly how far it goes in before
you<00:03:38.860> clamp<00:03:39.160> down<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.520> clamps
