00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.979 

November<00:00:50.089> I<00:00:50.120> does<00:00:50.390> have<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.660> fairly

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
November I does have a fairly

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.660 
November I does have a fairly
interesting<00:00:51.589> and<00:00:51.739> futuristic<00:00:52.339> kind<00:00:52.519> of

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
interesting and futuristic kind of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.640 
interesting and futuristic kind of
design<00:00:52.970> some<00:00:53.750> of<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:53.960> might<00:00:54.140> look<00:00:54.379> a<00:00:54.500> little

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
design some of it might look a little

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.100 
design some of it might look a little
awkward<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.309> weird<00:00:55.339> at<00:00:55.970> front<00:00:56.269> but<00:00:56.600> you<00:00:56.989> know

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
awkward and weird at front but you know

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.140 
awkward and weird at front but you know
the<00:00:57.230> overall<00:00:57.710> shape<00:00:57.739> is<00:00:58.250> very<00:00:58.309> unique<00:00:58.850> and

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
the overall shape is very unique and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.700 
the overall shape is very unique and
that's<00:00:59.360> what<00:00:59.659> Toyota<00:00:59.930> really<00:01:00.350> wants<00:01:00.620> to

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
that's what Toyota really wants to

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.860 
that's what Toyota really wants to
highlight<00:01:00.890> with<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:01.699> design<00:01:02.000> bring<00:01:02.659> in<00:01:02.750> that

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
highlight with the design bring in that

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.689 
highlight with the design bring in that
element<00:01:03.230> of<00:01:03.559> being<00:01:03.920> different<00:01:04.339> this<00:01:04.549> is<00:01:04.610> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
element of being different this is the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.850 
element of being different this is the
fuel<00:01:04.909> cell<00:01:05.119> technology<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.409> design<00:01:06.680> is

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
fuel cell technology and the design is

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.280 
fuel cell technology and the design is
incorporated<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:07.820> that<00:01:07.970> as<00:01:08.210> much<00:01:08.510> air<00:01:08.689> gets<00:01:09.140> in

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
incorporated so that as much air gets in

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.280 
incorporated so that as much air gets in
from<00:01:09.830> every<00:01:10.310> element<00:01:10.610> of<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:10.909> design<00:01:11.290> what

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
from every element of a design what

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.960 
from every element of a design what
strikes<00:01:12.560> is<00:01:12.710> from<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:13.130> front<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.520> most<00:01:13.760> are

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
strikes is from the front the most are

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.420 
strikes is from the front the most are
these<00:01:14.240> big<00:01:14.600> grills<00:01:14.960> fairly<00:01:15.740> big<00:01:15.950> grills<00:01:16.220> on

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
these big grills fairly big grills on

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.280 
these big grills fairly big grills on
either<00:01:16.640> side<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.060> bumper<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.780> idea<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.200> to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
either side of the bumper the idea is to

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.490 
either side of the bumper the idea is to
let<00:01:18.650> in<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.340> air<00:01:19.900> streamlined<00:01:20.900> well<00:01:21.140> into<00:01:21.409> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
let in the air streamlined well into the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.770 
let in the air streamlined well into the
fuel<00:01:21.740> cells<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:22.250> getting<00:01:22.759> as<00:01:22.880> much<00:01:23.030> air<00:01:23.210> tools

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
fuel cells and getting as much air tools

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.830 
fuel cells and getting as much air tools
generate<00:01:24.650> that<00:01:24.799> much<00:01:24.860> more<00:01:25.280> power<00:01:25.720> also<00:01:26.720> the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
generate that much more power also the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.870 
generate that much more power also the
overall<00:01:27.200> shape<00:01:27.229> is<00:01:27.740> kind<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.310> water<00:01:28.549> drop

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
overall shape is kind of a water drop

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.140 
overall shape is kind of a water drop
design<00:01:29.330> in<00:01:29.780> line<00:01:30.200> with<00:01:30.500> what<00:01:30.820> Toyota<00:01:31.820> wants<00:01:32.090> to

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
design in line with what Toyota wants to

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.310 
design in line with what Toyota wants to
talk<00:01:32.329> about<00:01:32.479> with<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.900> fuel<00:01:33.110> cell

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
talk about with the fuel cell

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.390 
talk about with the fuel cell
technologies

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.650 

so<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.490> mirror<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.760> design<00:01:40.120> is<00:01:40.300> not<00:01:40.480> for

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
so the mirror I design is not for

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.390 
so the mirror I design is not for
everyone<00:01:40.960> especially<00:01:41.230> with<00:01:41.980> its<00:01:42.130> slightly

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
everyone especially with its slightly

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.430 
everyone especially with its slightly
awkward<00:01:42.760> proportions<00:01:43.540> but<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.110> interior

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
awkward proportions but the interior

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.430 
awkward proportions but the interior
will<00:01:44.770> give<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.040> something<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.520> smile<00:01:45.760> about

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
will give you something to smile about

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.170 
will give you something to smile about
it<00:01:47.440> looks<00:01:47.650> more<00:01:47.950> futuristic<00:01:48.400> than<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.820> prius

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
it looks more futuristic than the prius

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.910 
it looks more futuristic than the prius
with<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.390> couple<00:01:49.690> of<00:01:49.750> black<00:01:50.080> touch<00:01:50.620> screen

so<00:04:21.180> we<00:04:21.450> really<00:04:21.600> need<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:21.989> test<00:04:22.230> that<00:04:22.410> out<00:04:22.470> how

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
so we really need to test that out how

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.040 
so we really need to test that out how
responsive<00:04:23.670> it<00:04:23.700> is<00:04:23.790> at<00:04:24.030> higher<00:04:24.330> speeds<00:04:24.750> but

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
responsive it is at higher speeds but

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.660 
responsive it is at higher speeds but
the<00:04:25.260> engine<00:04:25.530> does<00:04:25.740> feel<00:04:25.950> fairly<00:04:26.190> powerful

also<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.330> do<00:04:27.570> have<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.810> option<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:29.120> getting

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
also you do have the option of getting

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.060 
also you do have the option of getting

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
which gets into the electric motor so

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.660 
which gets into the electric motor so
