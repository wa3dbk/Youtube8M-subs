00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
wig I don't think that you need to do

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.970

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
any extra tweaking or anything like that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.040 
any extra tweaking or anything like that
another<00:02:58.730> thing<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.180> love<00:02:59.330> about<00:02:59.390> this<00:02:59.780> wig

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
another thing that I love about this wig

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.320 
another thing that I love about this wig
is<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.860> fact<00:03:01.100> that<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.370> has<00:03:01.520> different<00:03:02.060> hair

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
is the fact that it has different hair

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.199 
is the fact that it has different hair
textures<00:03:02.810> different<00:03:03.170> curl<00:03:03.739> patterns<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
textures different curl patterns in the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.960 
textures different curl patterns in the
wig<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.720> in<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.590> back<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.190> has<00:03:07.340> more<00:03:07.640> of<00:03:07.700> a

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
wig and in the back it has more of a

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.630 
wig and in the back it has more of a
kinky<00:03:08.330> coily<00:03:08.600> texture<00:03:09.380> more<00:03:09.980> like<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.220> for

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
kinky coily texture more like a for

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.449 
kinky coily texture more like a for
category<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.630> in<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.500> front<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:12.980> has<00:03:13.190> more

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
category and in the front it has more

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.930 
category and in the front it has more
like<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.760> three<00:03:14.299> category<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.709> that's<00:03:16.700> great

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
like a three category so that's great

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.940 
like a three category so that's great
because<00:03:17.060> that's<00:03:17.630> how<00:03:17.810> most<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.290> us<00:03:18.440> are<00:03:18.650> we

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
because that's how most of us are we

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.070 
because that's how most of us are we
have<00:03:19.130> different<00:03:19.610> textures<00:03:19.910> on<00:03:20.330> our<00:03:20.600> head<00:03:20.840> so

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
have different textures on our head so

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.570 
have different textures on our head so
it<00:03:21.200> definitely<00:03:21.709> gives<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.130> more<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.549> natural

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
it definitely gives it more of a natural

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.150 
it definitely gives it more of a natural
effect<00:03:23.360> because<00:03:24.230> all<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.620> curls<00:03:24.860> are<00:03:24.980> not

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
effect because all the curls are not

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.820 
effect because all the curls are not
uniform<00:03:25.700> because<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:26.150> doubt<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.810> there's<00:03:27.380> one

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
uniform because I doubt that there's one

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.190 
uniform because I doubt that there's one
natural<00:03:28.400> out<00:03:28.580> there<00:03:28.850> who<00:03:29.090> has<00:03:29.269> like<00:03:29.540> uniform

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
natural out there who has like uniform

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.070 
natural out there who has like uniform
curls<00:03:30.680> all<00:03:30.950> over<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:31.760> um<00:03:31.910> that's<00:03:32.450> another<00:03:32.780> plus

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
curls all over so um that's another plus

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.289 
curls all over so um that's another plus
about<00:03:33.440> it<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.920> I<00:03:34.370> just<00:03:34.580> love<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.850> fact<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:35.180> I

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
about it and I just love the fact that I

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.930 
about it and I just love the fact that I
could<00:03:35.480> just<00:03:35.630> make<00:03:35.810> it<00:03:35.840> big<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.650> huge<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.549> it

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
could just make it big and huge and it

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.390 
could just make it big and huge and it
looks<00:03:38.150> like<00:03:38.239> my<00:03:38.540> hair<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:39.080> do<00:03:39.380> prefer<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.190> over

the<00:03:57.590> fact<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:58.010> this<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:58.970> lace<00:03:59.239> front<00:03:59.510> and

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
the fact that this is a lace front and

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.289 
the fact that this is a lace front and
the<00:04:00.530> fact<00:04:00.769> that<00:04:00.860> I'm<00:04:01.040> wearing<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.580> as<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.880> lace

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
the fact that I'm wearing this as a lace

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.780 
the fact that I'm wearing this as a lace
front<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.260> am<00:04:03.739> very<00:04:03.920> comfortable<00:04:04.370> with

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
front so I am very comfortable with

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.759 
front so I am very comfortable with
wearing<00:04:05.150> this<00:04:05.269> as<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.480> lace<00:04:05.720> front<00:04:05.959> only

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
wearing this as a lace front only

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.600 
wearing this as a lace front only
because<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.459> her<00:04:08.239> techniques

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
because of her techniques

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.730 
because of her techniques
but<00:04:10.000> if<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.330> wasn't<00:04:10.690> for<00:04:10.810> her<00:04:10.960> techniques<00:04:11.530> I

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
but if it wasn't for her techniques I

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.950 
but if it wasn't for her techniques I
probably<00:04:12.340> would<00:04:12.730> make<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.090> into<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.450> Hathway

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
probably would make this into a Hathway

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.110 
probably would make this into a Hathway

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
tight it's a bit small it is so if you

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.960 
tight it's a bit small it is so if you
have<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.590> really<00:05:11.980> big<00:05:12.190> head<00:05:12.430> then<00:05:12.700> it<00:05:12.790> may<00:05:12.940> be

have a really big head then it may be

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.620

too<00:05:13.330> tight<00:05:13.600> for<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:14.550> but<00:05:15.550> it's<00:05:16.180> pretty<00:05:16.540> snug

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
too tight for you but it's pretty snug

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.360 
too tight for you but it's pretty snug
it's<00:05:17.110> not<00:05:17.290> snug<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:17.860> point<00:05:18.100> where<00:05:18.250> it's

it's not snug to the point where it's

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.390 
it's not snug to the point where it's
uncomfortable<00:05:18.960> for<00:05:19.960> me<00:05:20.169> but<00:05:20.440> I've<00:05:20.830> seen<00:05:21.100> some

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.250 
uncomfortable for me but I've seen some
reviews<00:05:21.790> where<00:05:22.150> one<00:05:22.419> of<00:05:22.450> the<00:05:22.600> complaints<00:05:23.140> is
