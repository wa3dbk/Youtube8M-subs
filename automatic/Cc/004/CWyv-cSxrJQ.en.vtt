 two hundred artists nearly 45,000 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.830
 spectators 13 representations in total 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.980

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.560
 2014 is launched the card this year 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.930
 still dreaming between the big cats 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.510
 tom dieck juniors aerobatics numbers 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.939
 aerial the equilibrists the magician 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 hans klok the competition for 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.529
 getting gold clowns from silver and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 of bronze promises to be disputed 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.630
 more than for the big families of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.210
 circus 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.340
 these awards are similar to the Oscars 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.170
 for cinema it's really the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 this year's theme is that the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.980
 famines of circle oil since 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 generations and generations 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.160
 so I think it's important in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.809
 the circus world today of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.550
 show down who still has famine who 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.180
 perpetuates the circus tradition 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.380
 traditional and who are there 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.350
 it in the parents and grandparents 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.940
 have come here so that's I think that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.370
 it was important for the festival 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.510
 just to show his form to a lot 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.920
 novelties also at the level of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.410
 Chinese that surprises us every time 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.240
 still with their inventions and the 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.729
 risk they take in their number 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.619

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.960
