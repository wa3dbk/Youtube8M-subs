00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hi everyone is welcome on my 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.609
 channel today I'm doing a video of 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 my collection pet shop on me asked 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.450
 so I'm doing a little update 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.980
 because I had made storage and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.490
 I will show you in detail so my 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 collection 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.330
 I will start by showing you the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.910
 wall of pet shop that are not open 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.890
 so solo so I'm going to show you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.850
 slowly every character like the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.850
 video and that pet shop 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.780
 so that's the recent ones it's not 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.550
 the older generation that I kept 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.030
 packaged to put at best because 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.650
 I really like to keep them like that 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.720
 like them to lead them the new ones 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.280
 design in fact but I also like 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.080
 many old ones I prefer when 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.430
 even the elders are much more 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.200
 cute but those there I find them cool 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.200
 still are a little more design 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.340
 that's old ones that I kept in 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:14.300
 down people is not much by 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:19.340
 versus packaged compared to the new there 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.830
 even older so that's it for the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.260
 wall of pet shop 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.300
 so I'll start with shelves here 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.600
 so there I have others packed so 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.300

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.080

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.080
