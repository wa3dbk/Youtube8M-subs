will have to get some different country
from<00:04:02.159> the<00:04:02.280> nav<00:04:02.599> some<00:04:03.599> service<00:04:03.989> history<00:04:04.200> in

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:04.469 
from the nav some service history in

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.020 
from the nav some service history in
there<00:04:04.650> obviously<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:05.159> gloveboxes<00:04:05.819> with<00:04:06.000> a

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
there obviously to gloveboxes with a

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.809 
there obviously to gloveboxes with a
pajero<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:08.069> let<00:04:08.579> me<00:04:08.700> just<00:04:08.879> turn<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.329> down

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
pajero so let me just turn that down

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.129 
pajero so let me just turn that down
wine<00:04:11.819> down<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.150> windows<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.689> give<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.930> rib

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
wine down the windows and give it a rib

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:24.590 
wine down the windows and give it a rib
so<00:04:13.859> you<00:04:13.919> can<00:04:14.040> have<00:04:14.159> a<00:04:14.189> listen<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.609> it

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.790 

doesn't<00:04:25.350> miss<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.500> beat<00:04:26.060> 3.5<00:04:27.060> liter<00:04:27.330> engine

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
doesn't miss a beat 3.5 liter engine

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:43.290 
doesn't miss a beat 3.5 liter engine
plenty<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.890> torque<00:04:29.220> carry<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.120> lot<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.300> people

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.909 

just<00:04:43.810> get<00:04:44.050> this<00:04:44.170> cook

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
just get this cook

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.029 
just get this cook
so<00:04:46.430> you<00:04:46.550> can<00:04:46.699> see<00:04:46.939> it's<00:04:47.120> all<00:04:47.300> very<00:04:47.659> clean<00:04:48.050> just

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
so you can see it's all very clean just

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.460 
so you can see it's all very clean just
stand<00:04:49.340> back<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.550> bit

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
stand back a bit

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.250 
stand back a bit
a<00:04:51.500> little<00:04:52.100> bit<00:04:52.190> hard<00:04:52.750> obviously<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:53.870> see<00:04:54.050> down

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
a little bit hard obviously to see down

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.360 
a little bit hard obviously to see down
there<00:04:54.410> but<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.680> think<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.950> best<00:04:55.130> way<00:04:55.340> is

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
there but I think the best way is

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.110 
there but I think the best way is
probably<00:04:55.700> to<00:04:55.940> listen<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:58.640> see<00:04:58.700> it's<00:04:59.030> all

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
probably to listen and see it's all

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.640 
probably to listen and see it's all
ticking<00:04:59.510> away<00:04:59.600> nicely

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.430 

so<00:05:05.650> there<00:05:05.800> you<00:05:05.889> have<00:05:05.919> it<00:05:06.180> beautiful

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.900 
range just so you can see that that's
all<00:05:30.340> working<00:05:34.979> see<00:05:35.979> that's<00:05:36.160> all<00:05:36.340> locking<00:05:36.580> in

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
all working see that's all locking in

ones that's ultra low you see that's all

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:03.629 
ones that's ultra low you see that's all
driving<00:05:55.750> nicely

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:17.870 

you<00:06:04.639> have<00:06:04.730> to<00:06:04.850> push<00:06:05.060> this<00:06:05.270> down<00:06:05.510> to<00:06:06.320> move<00:06:06.530> it

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.100 

like<00:06:18.880> ice<00:06:19.000> wine<00:06:19.240> down<00:06:19.420> the<00:06:19.540> windows<00:06:19.870> a<00:06:19.900> little

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
like ice wine down the windows a little

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.050 
like ice wine down the windows a little
bit<00:06:20.350> so<00:06:20.530> we<00:06:20.650> can<00:06:20.830> try<00:06:21.580> and<00:06:21.670> have<00:06:21.820> a<00:06:21.850> little

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
bit so we can try and have a little

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:31.460 
bit so we can try and have a little
listen<00:06:22.210> to<00:06:22.450> the<00:06:22.540> engine

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.870 

beautiful<00:06:32.470> engines<00:06:32.800> plenty<00:06:33.160> of<00:06:33.280> power<00:06:33.460> plenty

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
beautiful engines plenty of power plenty

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:46.120 
beautiful engines plenty of power plenty
of<00:06:33.970> torque

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.650 

obviously<00:06:47.130> I<00:06:47.160> can't<00:06:47.550> go<00:06:47.760> too<00:06:47.820> fast<00:06:48.300> but<00:06:48.540> I

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 
obviously I can't go too fast but I

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.180 
obviously I can't go too fast but I
think<00:06:48.840> you<00:06:48.930> can<00:06:49.080> see<00:06:49.320> that<00:06:49.470> that's<00:06:49.590> changing

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
think you can see that that's changing

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.740 
think you can see that that's changing
through<00:06:50.430> all<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:50.670> gears<00:06:50.880> nicely<00:06:51.540> and<00:06:51.690> the

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
through all the gears nicely and the

00:06:51.750 --> 00:07:17.969 
through all the gears nicely and the
gearbox<00:06:51.990> works

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:17.979 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.159 

so<00:07:18.490> there<00:07:18.639> you<00:07:18.729> have<00:07:18.789> it<00:07:18.909> as<00:07:19.270> you<00:07:19.449> can<00:07:19.569> see<00:07:19.780> it's

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.169 
so there you have it as you can see it's

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.110 
so there you have it as you can see it's
all<00:07:20.289> running<00:07:20.469> beautifully<00:07:21.030> thanks<00:07:22.030> for
