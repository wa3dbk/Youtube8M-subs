00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.910
 this is the choice he had to make 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.010
 savings luis I'll tell you everything 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.349
 just worse you look you were 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.240
 in football that's where it's in 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.769
 spain it's italy it's 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.690
 Germany in all these 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.039
 country there are always big clubs 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.720
 and we try to stay the longest 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.850
 possible at the top of the form 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.490
 we try to set up we try 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.350
 to structure two years at which club 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.539
 pass as if you make me by the real where 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.010
 I 'm leaving, I make you be the van a 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.340
 compared to lyon is one of these clubs 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.600
 since jean michel aulas and is 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.280
 returned to this club he managed to him 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.750
 give a human dimension to him 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320
 bring something different 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.370
 is that Lyon at the top is 175 million 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.570
 euros of budget while the real 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 is that one day this role in this sense 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 what is the downside of the clubs? 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.520
 about every time when we talk about it 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.079
 it's payroll but say that the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.149
 recruitment when you buy when you 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.559
 sell know how to do it and try to 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.670
 know the super class and trunk can 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.350
 to be but there were still some 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.359
 choice you have to know how to assume it wants 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.500
 to say that today you find yourself in 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.850
 another strategy 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.760
 that is to say, you find yourself in a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 strategy in the obligation to sell and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.390
 to bring up young people from the center of 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.180
 training for them to be able to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.189
 pull the cart out to try to 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 keep this club as high as possible 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.670
 asks young people who were there 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.990
 some time and six months stretching 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.119
 do not know and now that you 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.650
 asks them to spend detours from 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.780
 champions league on time but we're going 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.799
 where there are shutters me put me that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.720
 last year they are still in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.090
 deficit of 19 million but this difficult 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.829
 today Algeria site why 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.900
 that's where this deficit comes from 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.369
 reasons wait you can not you can 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.380
 not tell me to me that is to say that there is 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.360
 had made mistakes to say that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.909
 when we make mistakes we pay them 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.689
 his setbacks when you pay you assume who 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.250
 assume his choices 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.930
 maybe sometimes you do not have them 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 you did not make the right choices 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.619
 maybe if you have pope you have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540
 share of responsibility because you have 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.130
 may have decided to do this 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.470
 while authors had to do differently 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.180
 because you have to know how to think about a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.009
 future anticipate on a future 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.750
 and that's very important and that's 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.250
 France we have leaders who do not know 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.780
 not do it and when you go in 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.189
 england continent in spain that you 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 have in these peoples and big clubs 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.590
 which are remarkably well structured 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.860
 we do not have all the pubs in germany to 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.720
 clubs but it's normally 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.270
 medion normally in this championship 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.310
 de france should be one of these clubs 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.170
 lighthouses like it was like 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.820
 Saint-Etienne was like Marseille 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.270
 has been as it is that French have it 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.790
 been coming with this big stadium because we 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.500
 is waiting to report between 30 and 40 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.090
 millions of euros every year I him 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.380
 wish i wish them the olympic 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.790
 is not it a sailor and 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.530
 I hope for them that they will come back 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.880
 it's true that yesterday when I look at the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.010
 match it does not miss much 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.620
 this champions league round is 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.270
 so first and offensive efficiency 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.830
 you make the first 20 minutes where you can 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.000
 score in the first leg you lose to 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.570
 home you lose against the real 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.860
 sociedad 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.870
 it's not a big budget the real 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.220
 sociedad at and 25 million and then 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.900
 that's why there is something that 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.100
 is certainly well done on one side 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.550
 then on the other side east it's less 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.440
 well done after we are wrong we try 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.530
 to attempt costs and costs 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.670
 not work it does not work then there 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.050
 you do not speak lyon lyon 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.980
 today because lyon is eliminated 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.020
 of the league of champions 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.610
 we talk about lyon because lyon since 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.470
 some time it's a little bit more 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.470
 hard it's hard
