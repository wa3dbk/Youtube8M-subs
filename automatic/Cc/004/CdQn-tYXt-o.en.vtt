in wine so this is my footage in the
background<00:02:27.410> and<00:02:28.730> I'm<00:02:29.730> get<00:02:29.940> rid<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.360> it's

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
background and I'm get rid of that it's

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.930 
background and I'm get rid of that it's
in<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.090> I'm<00:02:33.090> gonna<00:02:33.360> extrude<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.489> this<00:02:35.489> is<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
in so I'm gonna extrude it this is the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.210 
in so I'm gonna extrude it this is the
text<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:36.900> are<00:02:37.050> extruding

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
text that we are extruding

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.699 
text that we are extruding
I<00:02:39.080> would<00:02:40.080> just<00:02:40.200> take<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.680> second<00:02:41.160> right<00:02:42.709> then

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
I would just take a second right then

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.740 
I would just take a second right then
when<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.860> add<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.430> material<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.599> he's

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
when I add a material so he's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.559 
when I add a material so he's
appreciated<00:02:46.650> materials<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.489> paid<00:02:47.879> for<00:02:48.180> about

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
appreciated materials I paid for about

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.660 
appreciated materials I paid for about
sixty<00:02:49.019> quid<00:02:49.170> if<00:02:49.500> you're<00:02:49.650> interested<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> so

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
sixty quid if you're interested in it so

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.759 
sixty quid if you're interested in it so
I<00:02:51.209> did<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.660> kind<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.989> Matt<00:02:52.290> Lee<00:02:52.470> grunge

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
I did this kind of Matt Lee grunge

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.850 
I did this kind of Matt Lee grunge
texture<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:55.620> then<00:02:55.950> we<00:02:56.069> know<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.400> environment

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
texture and then we know the environment

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.470 
texture and then we know the environment
at<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.190> now<00:02:59.459> watch<00:03:00.209> here<00:03:00.540> watch<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.319> text

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
at this now watch here watch the text

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.449 
at this now watch here watch the text
boom<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:04.050> takes<00:03:04.349> on<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> texture<00:03:05.159> in<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
boom it takes on the texture in the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.140 
boom it takes on the texture in the
reflection<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:07.650> gives<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.129> read<00:03:08.760> from

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
reflection and it gives it a read from

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.170 
reflection and it gives it a read from
the<00:03:09.420> map<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.819> am

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the map I am

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.780 
the map I am
I'm<00:03:12.780> gonna<00:03:12.900> quit<00:03:13.080> okay<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.400> could<00:03:14.670> have

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
I'm gonna quit okay just I could have

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.050 
I'm gonna quit okay just I could have
done<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.300> next<00:03:15.599> part<00:03:15.840> there<00:03:16.170> at<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.769> time<00:03:17.060> but

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
done the next part there at the time but

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.360 
done the next part there at the time but
to<00:03:18.599> make<00:03:18.959> things<00:03:19.170> less<00:03:19.349> confusing<00:03:19.890> we're

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
to make things less confusing we're

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.229 
to make things less confusing we're
gonna<00:03:20.459> do<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:20.879> so<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.980> got<00:03:23.099> a<00:03:23.239> particular

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
gonna do this so you got a particular

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.850 
gonna do this so you got a particular
look<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.140> tip<00:03:26.069> size<00:03:26.400> down<00:03:26.730> but<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.180> was<00:03:27.360> warm

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
look and tip size down but it was warm

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.949 
look and tip size down but it was warm
doesn't<00:03:28.860> really<00:03:29.010> matter<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.659> I'm<00:03:30.659> only<00:03:30.870> doing

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
doesn't really matter and I'm only doing

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.140 
doesn't really matter and I'm only doing
one<00:03:31.379> frame<00:03:31.860> in<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.190> I'm<00:03:32.610> not<00:03:32.730> worrying<00:03:33.000> about

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
one frame in this I'm not worrying about

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.000 
one frame in this I'm not worrying about
like<00:03:33.569> actually<00:03:33.959> making<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.290> am<00:03:34.379> washing<00:03:34.590> track

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
like actually making it am washing track

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.449 
like actually making it am washing track
and<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.319> have<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.680> where<00:03:37.830> you<00:03:37.950> want

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
and so I have it where you want

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.630 
and so I have it where you want
maybe<00:03:38.819> rotate<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.510> bit<00:03:39.540> whatever<00:03:40.349> I<00:03:40.799> thought<00:03:41.430> I

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
maybe rotate a bit whatever I thought I

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.600 
maybe rotate a bit whatever I thought I
could<00:03:41.879> do<00:03:42.120> we've<00:03:43.040> rotating<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.400> could

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
could do we've rotating that could

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.330 
could do we've rotating that could
become<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.150> what<00:03:45.989> was<00:03:46.080> that<00:03:46.290> done<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.190> of

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
become that what was that done it of

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.270 
become that what was that done it of
course<00:03:47.580> he<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.700> lot<00:03:47.849> wrong<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.360> like<00:03:49.230> either<00:03:49.409> yeah

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
course he a lot wrong I like either yeah

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.720 
course he a lot wrong I like either yeah
just<00:03:50.640> here<00:03:50.849> I<00:03:51.200> think<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:55.590> looks<00:03:55.980> more

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
just here I think just it looks more

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.880 
just here I think just it looks more
like<00:03:57.090> it's<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:58.280> ground<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.760> stuff<00:04:00.890> I'm

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
like it's in the ground and stuff I'm

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.009 
like it's in the ground and stuff I'm
tradition<00:04:02.519> not<00:04:02.730> again<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> bit<00:04:03.330> more<00:04:03.569> maybe

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
tradition not again a bit more maybe

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:11.570 
tradition not again a bit more maybe
actually<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:07.849> little<00:04:08.849> bit<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:10.519> you<00:04:11.519> know

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
actually a little bit and you know

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.600 
actually a little bit and you know
whatever<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.799> we're<00:04:13.799> took<00:04:14.040> multi-object

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
whatever and we're took multi-object

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.719 
whatever and we're took multi-object
because<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.299> makes<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.629> so<00:04:15.870> much<00:04:16.019> better

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
because this makes it so much better

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:23.600 
because this makes it so much better
rotation<00:04:17.729> random<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:20.459> rotate<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.299> bit<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:23.430> it

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
rotation random and rotate a bit so it

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.250 
rotation random and rotate a bit so it
kind<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:24.680> gives<00:04:25.680> off<00:04:25.860> cool<00:04:26.220> effect

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
kind of gives off cool effect

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.980 
kind of gives off cool effect
then<00:04:29.260> we<00:04:29.470> get<00:04:29.680> rid<00:04:29.830> of<00:04:29.860> Group<00:04:30.130> 1<00:04:30.840> when<00:04:31.840> we<00:04:31.930> were

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
then we get rid of Group 1 when we were

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.950 
then we get rid of Group 1 when we were
to<00:04:32.140> render<00:04:32.350> settings<00:04:32.860> ambient<00:04:33.790> inclusion<00:04:34.450> SS

wish<00:04:39.820> or<00:04:40.090> decrease<00:04:40.780> like<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.020> shadow<00:04:41.380> effect

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
wish or decrease like a shadow effect

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.210 
wish or decrease like a shadow effect
inside<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.670> text<00:04:43.680> then<00:04:44.680> we<00:04:44.710> can<00:04:44.920> get<00:04:45.040> rid<00:04:45.160> of

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
inside the text then we can get rid of

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.820 
inside the text then we can get rid of
luck<00:04:45.570> I'm<00:04:46.570> gonna<00:04:46.690> seem<00:04:47.680> self<00:04:47.950> again<00:04:49.650> wait<00:04:50.650> for

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
luck I'm gonna seem self again wait for

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.300 
luck I'm gonna seem self again wait for
it<00:04:50.920> to<00:04:51.100> load<00:04:51.340> this<00:04:55.260> all<00:04:56.260> right<00:04:56.440> it's<00:04:57.130> still

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
it to load this all right it's still

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.820 
it to load this all right it's still
loading<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.730> model<00:04:58.000> uh<00:04:58.030> but<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:59.080> kind<00:04:59.530> of<00:04:59.560> done

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
loading the model uh but I kind of done

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.770 
loading the model uh but I kind of done
it<00:05:00.720> primitive<00:05:01.720> it's<00:05:01.960> got<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.140> plane<00:05:02.560> in<00:05:02.800> there<00:05:03.040> I

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
it primitive it's got a plane in there I

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.180 
it primitive it's got a plane in there I
should<00:05:04.780> I<00:05:04.930> don't<00:05:04.990> run<00:05:05.260> them<00:05:05.440> texture<00:05:05.890> to<00:05:06.040> it<00:05:06.070> so

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
should I don't run them texture to it so

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.940 
should I don't run them texture to it so
now<00:05:06.460> let's<00:05:07.060> put<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.390> in<00:05:07.480> group<00:05:07.780> two<00:05:08.230> so<00:05:08.770> make

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
now let's put it in group two so make

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.790 
now let's put it in group two so make
sure<00:05:09.690> got<00:05:10.690> only<00:05:10.840> got<00:05:11.100> number<00:05:12.100> two<00:05:12.130> selected

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
sure got only got number two selected

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.590 
sure got only got number two selected
it's<00:05:14.800> all<00:05:14.920> loading<00:05:15.370> you<00:05:15.520> can<00:05:15.550> kind<00:05:16.030> of<00:05:16.150> see<00:05:16.330> got

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
it's all loading you can kind of see got

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.480 
it's all loading you can kind of see got
a<00:05:16.630> group<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:18.000> particular<00:05:19.000> look<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:20.490> replicate

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
a group to particular look and replicate

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.990 
a group to particular look and replicate
and<00:05:22.270> then<00:05:22.690> it's<00:05:22.900> rotating<00:05:23.710> quickly<00:05:24.190> on<00:05:24.460> the

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
and then it's rotating quickly on the

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.070 
and then it's rotating quickly on the
x-axis<00:05:25.450> and<00:05:28.140> and<00:05:29.140> then<00:05:30.070> I<00:05:30.510> kind<00:05:31.510> of<00:05:31.570> position

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
x-axis and and then I kind of position

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.520 
x-axis and and then I kind of position
it<00:05:32.230> right<00:05:32.530> so<00:05:33.010> it's<00:05:33.160> in<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.550> middle<00:05:34.260> sort<00:05:35.260> of

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
it right so it's in the middle sort of

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.550 
it right so it's in the middle sort of
and<00:05:35.830> down<00:05:36.430> just<00:05:37.060> see<00:05:37.210> clips<00:05:37.840> off<00:05:38.080> a<00:05:38.110> bit<00:05:38.410> of<00:05:38.440> the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
and down just see clips off a bit of the

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.230 
and down just see clips off a bit of the
bottom<00:05:39.040> text<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:41.220> I<00:05:42.220> think<00:05:42.520> that<00:05:42.910> I'll<00:05:43.060> be

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
bottom text and I think that I'll be

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.290 
bottom text and I think that I'll be
okay<00:05:43.570> so<00:05:43.960> now<00:05:44.080> I<00:05:44.550> try<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.610> get<00:05:45.760> that<00:05:45.910> more<00:05:46.180> in

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
okay so now I try and get that more in

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.880 
okay so now I try and get that more in
the<00:05:46.390> center<00:05:48.630> right<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:49.840> then<00:05:50.110> lettuce<00:05:50.500> I<00:05:50.650> feel

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
the center right and then lettuce I feel

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.690 
the center right and then lettuce I feel
a<00:05:51.160> lot<00:05:52.080> because<00:05:53.080> what<00:05:53.350> you<00:05:53.440> need<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.680> do<00:05:53.830> right

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
a lot because what you need to do right

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.500 
a lot because what you need to do right
about<00:05:55.150> this

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
about this

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.090 
about this
good<00:05:56.130> go<00:05:57.130> back<00:05:57.400> into<00:05:57.730> scene<00:05:58.060> so<00:05:58.800> make<00:05:59.800> sure<00:05:59.830> you

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
good go back into scene so make sure you

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.270 
good go back into scene so make sure you
get<00:06:00.280> your<00:06:00.430> plane<00:06:00.760> selected<00:06:01.890> you<00:06:02.890> should<00:06:03.070> see

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
get your plane selected you should see

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.420 
get your plane selected you should see
it<00:06:03.370> in<00:06:03.760> a<00:06:03.850> second<00:06:04.240> when<00:06:04.450> it<00:06:04.570> loads<00:06:04.810> okay<00:06:05.590> can

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
it in a second when it loads okay can

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.100 
it in a second when it loads okay can
you<00:06:06.460> go<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.670> material<00:06:07.390> so<00:06:07.690> these<00:06:07.810> are<00:06:08.020> the

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
you go to material so these are the

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.840 
you go to material so these are the
default<00:06:08.590> material<00:06:09.270> my<00:06:10.270> shadow<00:06:10.950> okay<00:06:11.950> and

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
default material my shadow okay and

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.650 
default material my shadow okay and
you'll<00:06:13.300> have<00:06:13.540> a<00:06:13.570> shadow<00:06:13.900> over<00:06:14.790> so<00:06:15.790> if<00:06:16.180> we<00:06:16.450> go<00:06:16.630> to

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
you'll have a shadow over so if we go to

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.330 
you'll have a shadow over so if we go to
full<00:06:17.110> quality

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.510 

I'm<00:06:21.340> boom<00:06:21.730> a<00:06:22.120> girl<00:06:22.540> you<00:06:22.690> have<00:06:22.870> a<00:06:22.900> shadow<00:06:23.520> looks

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
I'm boom a girl you have a shadow looks

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.440 
I'm boom a girl you have a shadow looks
like<00:06:24.670> it's<00:06:24.880> in<00:06:25.090> the<00:06:25.120> whole<00:06:26.400> footage<00:06:27.400> and<00:06:27.820> say

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
like it's in the whole footage and say

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.150 
like it's in the whole footage and say
if<00:06:28.570> it's<00:06:28.750> not<00:06:28.990> exactly<00:06:29.380> how<00:06:29.560> you<00:06:29.590> wanted<00:06:29.980> it

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
if it's not exactly how you wanted it

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.730 
if it's not exactly how you wanted it
you<00:06:30.400> can<00:06:31.390> always<00:06:31.510> tweet<00:06:32.230> things<00:06:32.530> really

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
you can always tweet things really

you can always tweet things really
easily<00:06:32.950> if<00:06:33.310> I<00:06:33.490> can<00:06:33.700> group<00:06:33.880> two<00:06:34.150> if<00:06:34.570> I<00:06:34.750> wanted

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
easily if I can group two if I wanted

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.650 
easily if I can group two if I wanted
more<00:06:35.410> of<00:06:35.470> it<00:06:35.680> in<00:06:35.830> the<00:06:35.860> ground<00:06:36.190> I<00:06:36.580> can<00:06:37.510> just

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
more of it in the ground I can just

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.860 
more of it in the ground I can just
raise<00:06:38.040> on<00:06:39.040> the<00:06:39.450> position

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
raise on the position

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.230 
raise on the position
how<00:06:41.320> far<00:06:41.590> I<00:06:41.620> want<00:06:41.860> it<00:06:42.160> in<00:06:42.430> like<00:06:42.820> the<00:06:42.940> ground

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
how far I want it in like the ground

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.240 
how far I want it in like the ground
it's<00:06:43.420> literally<00:06:43.840> eating<00:06:44.200> it<00:06:44.320> and<00:06:45.040> it<00:06:45.130> all

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
it's literally eating it and it all

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.810 
it's literally eating it and it all
looks<00:06:45.490> the<00:06:45.580> same

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.750 

so<00:06:48.820> yeah<00:06:49.060> that's<00:06:49.860> honestly<00:06:50.860> as<00:06:51.190> easy<00:06:51.400> as<00:06:51.640> it<00:06:51.730> is

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
so yeah that's honestly as easy as it is

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.190 
so yeah that's honestly as easy as it is
and<00:06:52.300> I<00:06:53.080> said<00:06:53.950> I'm<00:06:54.040> not<00:06:54.070> gonna<00:06:54.280> make<00:06:55.150> it<00:06:55.540> look

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200 
and I said I'm not gonna make it look

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.600 
and I said I'm not gonna make it look
like<00:06:56.410> a<00:06:56.440> proper<00:06:57.780> washing<00:06:58.780> track<00:06:59.410> today<00:07:00.010> but

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
like a proper washing track today but

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.300 
like a proper washing track today but
you<00:07:01.210> can<00:07:01.360> perfect<00:07:01.660> it<00:07:01.840> as<00:07:01.990> you<00:07:02.140> want<00:07:02.410> and

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
you can perfect it as you want and

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.370 
you can perfect it as you want and
basically<00:07:03.580> just<00:07:03.790> make<00:07:03.970> sure<00:07:04.180> the<00:07:04.480> shadow

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
basically just make sure the shadow

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.150 
basically just make sure the shadow
follows<00:07:05.920> the<00:07:06.250> marching<00:07:06.640> track<00:07:06.940> and<00:07:08.160> by

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
follows the marching track and by

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.150 
follows the marching track and by
keyframe<00:07:09.640> in<00:07:09.790> its<00:07:09.940> positions<00:07:10.740> and<00:07:11.740> that's<00:07:11.920> it

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
keyframe in its positions and that's it

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.590 
keyframe in its positions and that's it
you<00:07:12.730> gotta<00:07:12.910> be<00:07:13.120> picky<00:07:13.450> with<00:07:13.660> it<00:07:13.870> anything<00:07:14.230> and

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 
you gotta be picky with it anything and

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.970 
you gotta be picky with it anything and
I<00:07:16.600> say<00:07:17.910> get<00:07:18.910> put<00:07:19.180> pro<00:07:19.600> shaders<00:07:20.020> if<00:07:20.260> you<00:07:20.500> want<00:07:20.620> to

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:20.980 
I say get put pro shaders if you want to

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.560 
I say get put pro shaders if you want to
come<00:07:21.250> up<00:07:21.310> with<00:07:21.400> an<00:07:21.520> effect<00:07:21.850> like<00:07:22.000> this<00:07:22.240> I<00:07:22.360> guess

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.570 
come up with an effect like this I guess

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.350 
come up with an effect like this I guess
because<00:07:22.810> of<00:07:22.960> the<00:07:23.350> actual<00:07:24.150> textures<00:07:25.150> are

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
because of the actual textures are

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.730 
because of the actual textures are
really<00:07:25.390> nice<00:07:25.810> and<00:07:27.180> but<00:07:28.180> using<00:07:28.660> the<00:07:29.290> render

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
really nice and but using the render

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.790 
really nice and but using the render
settings<00:07:29.980> on<00:07:30.610> the<00:07:31.060> inclusion<00:07:31.540> which<00:07:32.380> makes<00:07:32.650> it

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
settings on the inclusion which makes it

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.950 
settings on the inclusion which makes it
everything<00:07:33.220> and<00:07:33.540> without<00:07:34.540> the<00:07:34.660> ongoing

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
everything and without the ongoing

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.660 
everything and without the ongoing
inclusion<00:07:35.470> you<00:07:35.650> don't<00:07:35.860> get<00:07:35.980> the<00:07:36.100> shadow<00:07:36.340> in

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:36.670 
inclusion you don't get the shadow in
