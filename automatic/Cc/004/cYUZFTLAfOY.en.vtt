00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.779 
we're trying something a little inspired
by<00:00:14.389> something<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.480> saw<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.139> vision<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.490> what

by something we saw in a vision so what

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.570 
by something we saw in a vision so what
we're<00:00:17.940> doing<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.690> i<00:00:18.930> think<00:00:19.050> we're<00:00:19.320> calling

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
we're doing is i think we're calling

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.450 
we're doing is i think we're calling
spinderella<00:00:20.580> after<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:22.460> cargobob

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
spinderella after the cargobob

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.000 
spinderella after the cargobob
spinderella<00:00:23.880> after<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.650> metal<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.769> same

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
spinderella after the metal of the same

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.179 
spinderella after the metal of the same
name<00:00:26.220> essentially<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.779> here<00:00:28.230> in

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
name essentially we have just in here in

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.900 
name essentially we have just in here in
a<00:00:29.580> carved<00:00:30.480> rat's<00:00:30.810> fly<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.700> Brad's<00:00:32.700> gonna

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
a carved rat's fly and Brad's gonna

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.430 
a carved rat's fly and Brad's gonna
pivot<00:00:33.090> him<00:00:33.300> back<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.660> forth<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.079> launch<00:00:34.230> him

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
pivot him back and forth and launch him

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.139 
pivot him back and forth and launch him
and<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.590> idea<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> CM<00:00:35.370> spins<00:00:35.730> barrel

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
and the idea is the CM spins barrel

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.420 
and the idea is the CM spins barrel
rolls<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.510> flips<00:00:36.780> he<00:00:36.930> does<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.309> gonna

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
rolls and flips he does and all gonna

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.180 
rolls and flips he does and all gonna
have<00:00:38.550> different<00:00:38.640> point<00:00:39.000> values<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.770> think

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
have different point values and I think

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.350 
have different point values and I think
we're<00:00:41.309> doing<00:00:41.430> flips<00:00:41.670> over<00:00:41.820> worth<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> most

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
we're doing flips over worth the most

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
we're doing flips over worth the most
followed<00:00:42.750> by<00:00:42.840> spins<00:00:43.230> followed<00:00:43.649> by<00:00:43.739> barrel

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
followed by spins followed by barrel

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040 
followed by spins followed by barrel
rolls<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> most<00:00:45.750> points

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
rolls and if it's with the most points

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.090 
rolls and if it's with the most points
