00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.069
 So now it's a bit and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.650
 baron and maastricht first a bit 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.030
 the calm of hd resp 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.890
 first time the dimensionally accurate you are doing 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.260
 I only have two pages 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.230
 which I consistently used on the one hand 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.019
 it is the side that is here bit more 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.750
 for caster adesso for it becomes the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.210
 example or for a bit of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.009
 crack point that I instead of ex cologne 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.440
 editorial and that I have the two 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.480
 space yes but as it is in reading and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.469
 blade reading and then stop it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.540
 played role 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.190
 soon it will be nice, for example 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.320
 because you anyway to not so much but 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.210
 first with nice the blade infiniti and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.770
 yes the customer's editorial right helps you 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.930
 can argue about whether taxi now 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.879
 he tells better but I like that 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.910
 pretty good and also dangerous game 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.260
 I think it works extremely because like 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140
 is often in a game somehow 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.680
 We will play in the game 1.256 Bettina 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.600
 steps 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.339
 but never realistically 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.299
 Five of the missing lives can be on everyone 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.640
 case it can be decisive 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.020
 I live 50 or more of his lake game 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.260
 if you really have very little life 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.540
 and yes, that is as often as it is 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.299
 want 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.210
 lucien sometimes on corp but yes 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.500
 Actually, it always only works 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.400
 Israel is more so a bit 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.080
 special page and the dev team 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.420
 actually less self-explanatory 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.060
 damage of champions so less 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.939
 Driving is even less of a hassle 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.430
 champions generally have erik hp flats and 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.020
 hp maximum just around helsinki on the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.729
 to be world more pressure to plug in 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.470
 can drive better to be able to do better 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.570
 to be able to learn 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.610
 You can also play deeper in youtube 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.000
 but that's very risky and you can 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.350
 I'm a little wrong times with the devteam 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.689
 then we come for the second time street 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.299
 actually that's the standard measure 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.090
 You can really kickin on every hd 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.740
 play without having any losses 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.579
 is not really the 90th 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.579
 used percentage of time 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.520
 quite standard, everything played the only one 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.709
 difference is that I do not have a fourth 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.650
 point in four so have no point in 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.390
 the textile sat and thus on 124 text 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.860
 renounced and just again 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 because I have the dangerous game 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.360
 opinion is that dangerous game and five 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.310
 percent of the missing admonisher and life 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.180
 can be significantly more decisive 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.920
 and also are as 1 256 bit that is 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.150
 My opinion and that's why I play 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.650
 that's the way I like it already has me 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.660
 several times saved the ass really 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.360
 that I then eg the last tick 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.850
 have considered or so and yes I think 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.989
 it is not bad you can optional 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.489
 really easy here the fourth 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.769
 you can not do it that way either 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.069
 Some people are also wrong 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:51.120
 you can play the northbridge you can 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:54.000
 also go but personally i want that 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.010
 Do not take risk because it is him 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.540
 really holds double-edged sword 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.610
 As the name says, it makes me seem 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.989
 collects more damage it has a risk 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.720
 and I do not know I do not think so 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.760
 is necessarily the world and yes im 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.440
 deb-team also standard again the nine 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.530
 become easy and grandson and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.320
 to take more on the rest 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.350
 and that was actually it to the 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.820
 man to the must of course all this 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.209
 comes to unrest 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.500
 I have a few more and I have one 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.109
 the number 5 so here on the one hand the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.150
 standard the page here too is it 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.940
 again with this kind the side one can 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 Actually, every adi carey can really 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.720
 you play every adi carey and you have one 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.640
 not really losses so you will 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.900
 never lose a game and say it afterwards 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.820
 human I would have better round 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.900
 had this high side playing 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:52.260
 tells ex offers three texts in the audimax 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.060
 on the ear four cupids and five hp goals 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.700
 just because hp in the early one 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.380
 bit stronger and season with maggi 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.850
 really just as much money as 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.889
 possible to have just about the few 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.660
 fans to come and then I have just 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.430
 twelve flat magix is ​​here too 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.900
 again on the length of the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.470
 tristan anna name etc 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.840
 to collect as little as possible and yes 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.160
 that is the usual rest page 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.810
 currently for all abs 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.760
 alternatively there are a few others 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.530
 living here for example is that 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.480
 the same page just one instead of flat 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.520
 Magix is ​​more here this time 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.650
 just do it when you're in the late game 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.210
 think that you have a lot of magic already 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.840
 happen what for example ferrari or 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:36.040
 but so on the ley relatively little danger 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.450
 can be booked by abo 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.330
 For example, you play against something like who 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.130
 not to be late or so so ne 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.230
 na.de actually not a magic of 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.000
 man makes and a supporter of now 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.410
 also does not make the biggest match or 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.610
 if you are safe on the lane you are there 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.880
 but in the late give 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.320
 but a bit of medicus then need 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.520
 but instead of third round side complete 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.610
 without managers 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.790
 we have a bit of marek here for that 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.290
 and five editorial 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.510
 For example, I play this sometimes 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.950
 s game but also it is lucene 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.840
 possible which is already a very 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.220
 special round side I tell me so 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.400
 a lot of his blood picture I thought it because 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.630
 I'm more without four games is unique 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 is not much but it is still one 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.510
 Helpful and it should be 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.000
 really only play but not none 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.100
 manage this needs and only on 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.120
 something like it wants or nüsschen 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.730
 maybe even on korpi but rather 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.390
 less the fourth page is already there 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.090
 a little different 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.260
 it's almost like the first round page 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.690
 with the difference that we enter here 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.340
 little less medical system and 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.500
 just a lot of text offers four text 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.690
 Check yet it is not much, it is 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:47.110
 three percent expeed more or 2.5 or so 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:49.030
 it really is not much but if you are 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.280
 ne na.de plays the relatively safe is 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.020
 something more interesting or something and think 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.250
 that you really little magic of that 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.390
 this is really not enough cash 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.010
 damage must then stop against 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.169
 with landspiels you actually even 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.610
 can not attack then you and 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.340
 should not be bad and I am just 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.600
 also very often five majors is doing 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.200
 already a small difference but two 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.150
 lyrics that's really minimal it is 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.100
 really minimal from page one actually 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.240
 very often and our four when I think 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.440
 yes I'm a little bit more 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.310
 I have to hurt and for that I have one 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.470
 little bit less server mobility 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.360
 but yes as I said with the inside 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.120
 You really can not go wrong here 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.700
 also no magic and he sideways against 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.480
 everything prepared 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.850
 I have a fifth round here 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.660
 my dogs are up 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.360
 the game 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:39.450
 Here I have attacks in the 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.100
 I have essences live style simply because 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.560
 I on trejbal find this constant 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.320
 enough texted celik and w and 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.940
 eventual textbook and yes easily 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.770
 is easy to find very effective 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.350
 because if for example a million 10 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.180
 hp and you have the normal hd as well 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.180
 example after astana autotxt there make 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.210
 You 70 years, for example, and heals for 70 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.890
 with james but so if you have mini 10 off 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.190
 150 knots then you have yourself 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:08.730
 so much for 150 years and so 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.590
 since lifestyle of trading very good and 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.350
 Also , a petit is not one more 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.690
 strong item early and straight up 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.880
 james lifestyle early very effective 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.070
 because of that a small compromise one 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.560
 has just with duran at the same time the high 7% 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.700
 lifestyle which is definitely in any case 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.590
 it helps a lot to live 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.450
 Furthermore, I have one here 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.280
 mix of flat manager sam mendes is 

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.230
 my level here too is just it again 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.910
 just really just want a bit 

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.560
 more honestly so does the gpm or 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.710
 keep games ability mounted 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:41.090
 from both little bit and yes that 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:45.470
 are actually the 50 pages you 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:47.550
 on one can really use 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:51.120
 and yes I hope it has you 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:53.450
 bit helped and stays on top of everyone 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.450
 fall off
