00:05:57.929 --> 00:05:57.939 
that's that's a significant problem the

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:00.989 
that's that's a significant problem the

people<00:06:01.449> in<00:06:01.599> these<00:06:01.749> areas<00:06:02.259> is<00:06:02.680> that<00:06:03.610> some

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
people in these areas is that some

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.209 
people in these areas is that some
nylons<00:06:05.020> are<00:06:05.319> not<00:06:05.469> up<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.860> it

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:06.219 
nylons are not up to it

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.379 
nylons are not up to it
my<00:06:06.610> problem<00:06:07.259> begins<00:06:08.259> when<00:06:08.800> people<00:06:09.370> create<00:06:09.969> a

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
my problem begins when people create a

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.799 
my problem begins when people create a
system<00:06:11.349> that<00:06:11.620> is<00:06:11.740> totally<00:06:12.370> dependent<00:06:13.029> on<00:06:13.300> them

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:13.809 
system that is totally dependent on them

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:17.480 
system that is totally dependent on them
I<00:06:14.050> think<00:06:14.949> there<00:06:15.189> is<00:06:15.279> an<00:06:15.399> ongoing<00:06:15.550> concern<00:06:16.139> that

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
I think there is an ongoing concern that

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.369 
I think there is an ongoing concern that
Australian<00:06:18.490> not<00:06:18.729> be<00:06:19.210> heavy-handed<00:06:19.749> in<00:06:20.289> the

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:20.379 
Australian not be heavy-handed in the

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.670 
Australian not be heavy-handed in the
region<00:06:20.800> and<00:06:21.009> that<00:06:21.610> it<00:06:21.729> not<00:06:21.939> just<00:06:22.210> voice

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
region and that it not just voice

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
solutions if you will on to Solomon

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.639 
solutions if you will on to Solomon
Islands<00:06:26.680> to<00:06:27.159> ensure<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:27.789> it<00:06:28.149> avoids<00:06:29.110> just
