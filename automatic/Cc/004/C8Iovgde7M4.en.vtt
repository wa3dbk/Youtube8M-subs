00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.519
 hello hello to all hunter friends 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.349
 and I 'm not here today to introduce you 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.360
 this step here than I have it 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.789
 invented myself 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.680
 is a revised product is already 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.920
 existing product 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.420
 American since it is very difficult 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.860
 find on the market 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.100
 I did it and today I show you that 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.350
 what can you do with ammunition joke 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.750
 is nothing but a 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.300
 a triangle connected by a gradation 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.440
 with smoke like that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.390
 on the trunk of the tree 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.100
 freezes and we use to keep us at 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.680
 the whole world 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.949
 very light and equally practical not 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.280
 busting now I get to see business with 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.120
 we start small then we said 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.890
 now I'll show you in detail 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.140
 assembly and disassembly then 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.970
 important that the rope passes under the 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.360
 two triples therefore below here so 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.909
 through a trick around the ready 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.700
 then we always pass under the 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.909
 curve and inside the mouth 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:28.009
 we turn through the crossbar of the 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:32.780
 step we come below let's create this 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:36.080
 wolf here and send us back inside this is 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.789
 the knot then we have to find the right one 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.140
 distance and tension of the step raise 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.590
 slightly so that it comes to 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.020
 create this corner here between the rope 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.020
 behind the stem and the tip of the step 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.970
 and fold down 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.960
 here is how you see the agreement now beautiful 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.050
 straight vasconi we mounted as I have you 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.470
 already explained the step works through 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.480
 the traction that I'm around the stem 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.630
 of the tree with this rope but it is loaded 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.140
 of real breaking that it supports 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.670
 the step is not on the pure in this 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.200
 wire case used a rope to one 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.910
 low braided territory in the demetri 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.040
 breaking load cone always a couple 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.860
 we have more than enough because in 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.500
 step loading phase the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.820
 load is not supported by the rope but 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.450
 from the step itself that you go to 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.750
 stab wounds 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:44.690
 through the tip of the abo on too 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:48.410
 you often see very stable 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.790
 I took about 67 68 kg 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.110
 anyway how many try to my friend 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.110
 that this 130 kg 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.500
 for disassembly 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.030
 it is enough that we simply close 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:25.700
 from the bottom upwards ok no 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:27.620
 a way will then come mounted 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.120
 dismantle we do nothing but 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:36.140
 dissolve our way that will be 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:39.830
 logically a little tight here it is to 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.569
 place this is another type of 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.580
 step 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.870
 always during tree classes 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.040
 practically a screw and folded 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.870
 being a life and to assemble it ourselves 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.019
 we must forcefully throw to the trunk 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.120
 of the plant not too nice thing 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.880
 not even if they came into contact 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.019
 with guards of the guards 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.959
 foresters and hunting guards 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.780
 surely they would do the verbal or 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.079
 in the weights as weights we therefore this 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.590
 should weigh negatively 350 grams 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.239
 this almost 270 is very little 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.440
 difference 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.150
 the difference is that on these 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.829
 surely they came higher than that 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.930
 with these and then we don't create anyway 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.970
 no damage to plants and impact 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.710
 on the tree as you see here is where before 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.870
 we mounted our step 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.830
 we have that in just barked 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:37.669
 the tree is not that it has no impact 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:42.190
 but surely it is much less impactful 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.190
 of a step of this type here 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.800
 as you see here to install it 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.720
 we are not just my name 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.750
 bark we also put the stem of 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.750
 plant 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.430
 Well, we definitely do them 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.470
 hole 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.870
 where they can go to undermine it 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.370
 any pests or at least also 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.140
 simply entering the water 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.170
 could cause the stem of the 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.170
 plant 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.100
 but what 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.790
 I hope you enjoyed the video and that 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.870
 may be useful to you 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.870
 thanks to all of you next time
