00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.550
 I spent quite a doctor angel olive 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:14.990
 I can hardly say the same thing 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.120
 [Music] 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.600
 and look 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.380
 but again 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.380
 if we go let's go 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.920
 [Music] 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.580
 that my father 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.560
 Y 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.350
 He does not want anything but yes 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.010
 dominating 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.600
 [Music] 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:51.090
 we do not talk about 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.090
 [Music] 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.769
 the failure that I have been 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.849
 [Music] 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.429
 why 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.780
 in general 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.060
 [Music] 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.060
 no no 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.620
 no no no 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 but 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:59.620
 [Music] 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.539
 it really tells me nothing 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:07.210
 [Music] 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.210
 no no 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:16.040
 [Music] 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:19.209
 I think a human like us 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.209
 and nothing more 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.900
 also the design 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.870
 early 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.870
 for that we are not talking 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.349
