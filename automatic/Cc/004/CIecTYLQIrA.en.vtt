took my tape and measured it the bull
basically<00:00:28.559> has<00:00:30.349> 18-inch<00:00:31.349> g1<00:00:31.919> g2<00:00:32.250> g3<00:00:32.460> s<00:00:33.270> he's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
basically has 18-inch g1 g2 g3 s he's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.960 
basically has 18-inch g1 g2 g3 s he's
got<00:00:33.719> 21<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.350> think<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.130> 22<00:00:35.730> inch

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970

he's<00:00:37.560> got<00:00:37.770> 12<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> 13<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> 12<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
he's got 12 this is a 13 and a 12 and a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.240 
he's got 12 this is a 13 and a 12 and a
half<00:00:40.020> inch<00:00:40.910> g5<00:00:41.940> he's<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.600> 53<00:00:43.290> inch<00:00:43.560> main<00:00:43.890> beans

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
half inch g5 he's got 53 inch main beans

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.290 
half inch g5 he's got 53 inch main beans
I<00:00:45.350> estimated<00:00:46.350> his<00:00:46.620> spread<00:00:47.130> which<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.060> credit

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
I estimated his spread which the credit

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.810 
I estimated his spread which the credit
would<00:00:48.570> basically<00:00:49.230> come<00:00:49.770> from<00:00:50.040> here<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.550> here

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
would basically come from here to here

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.590 
would basically come from here to here
to<00:00:51.060> be<00:00:51.180> 35<00:00:51.750> inches<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.670> fool<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.300> right

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to be 35 inches so this fool is right

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.390 
to be 35 inches so this fool is right
out<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.380> a<00:00:55.410> 370<00:00:56.340> Bowl<00:00:57.500> he<00:00:58.500> came<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.950> came<00:00:59.070> up

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
out about a 370 Bowl he came I came up

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.540 
out about a 370 Bowl he came I came up
with<00:00:59.510> 335<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:00.960> added<00:01:01.290> 35<00:01:01.890> inches<00:01:02.280> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
with 335 and then added 35 inches of

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910 
with 335 and then added 35 inches of
spread<00:01:03.180> credit<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.690> he's<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.409> 70

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
spread credit so he's right out to be 70

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.969 
spread credit so he's right out to be 70
he's<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> real<00:01:06.090> nice<00:01:06.330> beautiful<00:01:06.930> Bowl<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
when your field judging a point length

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.180 
when your field judging a point length
is<00:01:35.940> your<00:01:36.120> number<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.810> concern<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.800> want<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
straight the more curve and the more

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.400 
straight the more curve and the more
belly<00:01:47.160> to<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.640> points<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.420> more<00:01:48.600> belly<00:01:48.990> here

belly to the points the more belly here

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.590 
belly to the points the more belly here
the<00:01:50.070> longer<00:01:50.610> they<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.210> shortest

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the longer they are the shortest

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.270 
the longer they are the shortest
distance<00:01:52.080> between<00:01:52.140> two<00:01:52.710> points<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
distance between two points is a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.120 
distance between two points is a
straight<00:01:53.400> line<00:01:53.730> you<00:01:54.300> want<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.350> curvature

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
straight line you want to have curvature

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.630 
straight line you want to have curvature
you<00:01:56.370> want<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:58.050> third<00:01:58.470> for<00:01:58.950> my<00:01:59.130> taste

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you want to have this third for my taste

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.240 
you want to have this third for my taste
could<00:01:59.790> even<00:01:59.880> flare<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.450> more<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.650> as<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
could even flare out more and as it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.130 
could even flare out more and as it
bellies<00:02:02.700> out<00:02:02.910> you're<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.690> inches

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
bellies out you're going to get inches

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.000 
bellies out you're going to get inches
okay<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.270> you've<00:02:06.540> got<00:02:06.570> point<00:02:07.080> Li<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.530> main

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
okay so you've got point Li and main

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.070 
okay so you've got point Li and main
being<00:02:08.369> main<00:02:08.729> beam<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.240> your<00:02:09.420> second<00:02:09.899> most

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
being main beam is your second most

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
being main beam is your second most
important<00:02:10.740> aspect<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.610> bolt<00:02:11.850> point<00:02:12.210> length

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
important aspect of a bolt point length

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.500 
important aspect of a bolt point length
is<00:02:12.570> one<00:02:12.840> main<00:02:13.440> beam<00:02:13.740> is<00:02:13.920> two<00:02:14.190> then<00:02:14.910> your<00:02:15.240> mass

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
is one main beam is two then your mass

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.780 
is one main beam is two then your mass
measurements<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.410> your<00:02:16.680> spread<00:02:17.070> come<00:02:17.460> third

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
measurements and your spread come third

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.110 
measurements and your spread come third
and<00:02:18.030> fourth<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:19.230> heavy<00:02:19.860> Bowl<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.370> always<00:02:20.760> great

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and fourth a heavy Bowl is always great

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.199 
and fourth a heavy Bowl is always great
but<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.450> would<00:02:21.600> rather<00:02:22.020> have<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.440> bowl<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.610> has

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
but I would rather have a bowl that has
