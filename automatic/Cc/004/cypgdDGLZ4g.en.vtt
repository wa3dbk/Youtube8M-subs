00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello to all dota lovers with you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 kurosaki today i will talk about things in 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.150
 dota who run into each other and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.929
 stack up with other things because 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.670
 few know what bashir is acceptable and or 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.369
 something else stacks with something and that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.150
 then with something that does not begin to start with 1 ton m 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.550
 it's a battlefury 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 if you take two battles, she wo n't 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.029
 run heroes ranged and splash 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.680
 there will be no attack in any way but 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.390
 battlefury co equals each other 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.900
 other if this fury is used 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.790
 melee character and targets 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.800
 which are next to 3 four 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.140
 Battlefury destroyer same damage before 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.230
 sleepers even more than the main goal 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.530
 here please shows splash 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.539
 the attack is very huge further we have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.989
 is to post on this what of skadi 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.420
 of skadi slows attack speed and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.579
 speed of movement 2nd of skadi they 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.899
 will not increase in any way 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.050
 the slowdown will be the same as 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.629
 1st skadi astana among themselves in any way 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.949
 how I will not become the price 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.930
 Wonderful thing, what a mjölnir 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.060
 mjölnir is a wonderful thing because 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.250
 she stacks with all the things that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.750
 there is a dota that is a primer we can 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.450
 read this unique modifier 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.189
 attacks which tries with all the others 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 unique attack modifiers that is 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.840
 the world will stack up at all whether 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.020
 satanic be it scudi be it desolator 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.659
 yes even before the idol completely uniform stacks 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.579
 if we take the three worlds we will increase 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.000
 chance of falling lightning and significantly 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.740
 increase our attack rate on crit say 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.740
 does not crash with almost every hit 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.189
 So 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.100
 I want to demonstrate further 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.770
 with an insulator one thing with one 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.710
 insulator we get minus 7 armor 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.110
 the enemy and 60 damage to us if we take 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.540
 two desolator and we will have 120 damage 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.310
 on minus armor will still be -7 this 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.040
 for those who did not know 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.470
 if two desolator assemble so don't 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.540
 I see sense to collect tarot and desolator 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:12.000
 after say 1 million workbench and quite 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.280
 as I said the next pace is 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.090
 mkb mkb she gives mini mills he gives 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.690
 such minis there headset type still take 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.250
 3 mb 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.040
 and places but with almost every 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.220
 blow as you see the minister at every 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.250
 at each stroke the impact locations i.e. 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.470
 mkb with each other they repent they 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:41.670
 joined are joined with each other microbarn 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:44.100
 so on I want to tell more about 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.130
 satanic satanic what he gives us will be 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.100
 gives us vampirism to forgive this my 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.470
 side was drunk as the satanic gives 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.130
 vampirism i mean i have something now 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.480
 I'll try 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.700
 Aksuat beat sniper poor so 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.489
 please don't u beat satanic he gives 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.769
 vampirism if we take even two 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.480
 Satanica or even 3 will not be in this 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.239
 no point because vampirism 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.600
 goes one from one satanic that's how 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.370
 we can observe we take even 3 satanic and 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.580
 vampirism goes the same if we turn on 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.440
 satanic without PTF and then when will all 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.900
 satanic is not only one that is satanic 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.400
 we do not stack but satanic 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.920
 wonderful thing there because he 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.269
 stacks advice skadi and still im younger 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.660
 that is, exit if you play for 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.830
 the sniper is wonderful satanic will 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.680
 Sakat union skadi i.e. he will 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:42.500
 how to demonstrate it to you now 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.050
 that is, we have get rid of the effect on the enemy 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.160
 also we them or msi that is but not 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.160
 stacks with ah ask them so please 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.030
 so on, I would like to tell 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.580
 about bashir and bashir and this is a separate topic 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.860
 because bashar and they are not each other 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.830
 in no way stacks 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.520
 because here we have 6 bashar ulyana she 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.490
 only 10 percent of the camp beat me 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.890
 and bashir does not stack then 10 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.420
 percent chance to be not 20 30 he is so 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.820
 and there will be bashir with each other 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.330
 Bashir stacks and will judge 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.500
 percent chance that stun will fly 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.860
 Bashir and in no way does not 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.730
 fits mkb stacks it turns out bashir 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.540
 and in no way stacks 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.590
 next we have such a wonderful 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:36.050
 thing like daedalus daedalus he tries 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.980
 if we take one daedalus and we will 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.900
 shoot at the enemy 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.940
 we will have here aks it 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.000
 will lead us to a certain crit 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:48.200
 look at this crit she should fly 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.230
 Here you are 500 5004 504 Here we take 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:56.960
 two eat up hidden will be 691 take 3 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:59.510
 daedalus a 883 4 daedalus a crit under you 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.550
 forces under 1000 already crashes crit that is 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.940
 Crita crashes under a thousand that is 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.760
 daedalus with each other are stacked and this 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.980
 even very well that is, we can 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.780
 make some sniper in leyte 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.910
 it's not just a sniper even us 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.980
 in advance on all the characters that is, we 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.790
 let's say we can safely know that if we 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:23.210
 take daedalus kb 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:26.410
 satanic of skadi and mjolnir then this is all 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.600
 everything will be stacked there will be lightning 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.780
 vampirism creed mills and it will all be 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.910
 hire all stacks Well Well okay 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.070
