00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello, today we have a phone 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.490
 and smartphone processor mtk 1 hertz and 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.620
 touch just a keyboard on 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.219
 keyboard in principle characters a bit 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.929
 the display here is one inch but bark well 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.670
 Do not be confused by the Internet 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 you do not hurt to use 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 because the Internet is not here and except 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
 everything else in this phone in general 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.820
 function not much much let's 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:34.610
 let's look at the menu first and here 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.750
 we leaf through what is there in principle I tell you 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.000
 demonstrate fully the sub 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.760
 I will not be here everything is standard 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 mundanely and i think is not difficult 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 just two seconds to figure out 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.610
 there will be a phone in your hands now what 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.440
 regards how to use it 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.170
 I think it can be worn as 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.440
 spare backup 2 3 player seats or 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.140
 just rarely use the phone 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 by the way it easily turns on and off 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.030
 blocked here we have shutdown 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.470
 and you can wear it on a string in your wallet 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.860
 in stocking even wearing a hat 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.320
 considering the weight of 35 grams will not hamper 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.320
 you even when engaged in controversy and looks 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.439
 He can be seen that no more than usual 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 plastic bank card either 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.990
 business card 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 thickness slightly thicker course well 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.240
 it is clear all the same phone six with 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 half millimeter battery here 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.220
 380 milliamps per hour is enough for you 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.759
 about two and a half days average 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.979
 workload either it's four days in 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.930
 standby and maybe three or four 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.060
 two hours of talk time 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.280
 full-size slat works 2 sim 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.590
 cards almost simultaneously here 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.170
 slot for maximum 8 gigabytes transflash 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.060
 you can listen to micro sd 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.970
 the music here will also work the radio in 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.110
 in principle, I think enough of you 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.390
 this phone will 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.899
 the speaker here is also quality you for 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.320
 by me he is conversationally present vibro 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.530
 also quite tangible and here we are 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.759
 microphone brought front panel 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.369
 interlocutor on you for sound quality too 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.539
 all is not offended well enough 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.979
 only from frontal hard 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.129
 button as I said 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.470
 and here we have the bottom as seen for 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.280
 connecting attaching rather strap 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.860
 and here is a micro sd micro usb ethernet connector 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.569
 for connecting a headset either for 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.700
 connecting a computer or charging and 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.890
 button for rather 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.519
 rocker to quickly turn off the phone 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.500
 all off in principle on the phone all 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:39.590
 Now a few words about picking here 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:43.290
 he has such a hard package 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.200
 inside, I said to connect 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.150
 to charge the computer itself years of charging and 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.859
 This is a headset with a micro connector and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.400
 beat on this perhaps all thanks for 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.400
