00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.090
 I decided to diversify him a little 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.220

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.290

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.250
 inform the hair be very careful 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.630

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.700
 that's all i wanted to tell you and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.590
 let's see how I did it when 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.810
 I always paint colored roofs 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.680
 black t-shirt color paint not 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.659
 ruin her 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.790
 and it will be enough just once and and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.680
 wash and before dyeing myself 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.820
 I checked on hide and seek successfully 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.300
 picked up the colors 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.600
 divide hair by 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.480
 two parts carefully comb from lobes 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.930
 ear goes blue on blue and 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.800
 then purple is my favorite 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.750
 colors 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.470
 wear gloves and take blue paint 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:20.230
 I start to bring it approximately from a lobe 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.210
 ear thoroughly coat the same 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.580
 do with the second part of the hair is necessary 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.180
 follow the symmetry of the application 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.130
 paints 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.500
 next I take the blue tonic and balm 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.600
 mix them with a special whisk for 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.390
 paint blue tonic one right after 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.670
 blue paint slightly smooth transition 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.400
 this way we check everything 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.270
 it was painted the same thing we do with the second 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.760
 part of hair 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.630
 watch for symmetry and then we 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.290
 purple paint will go put it on 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.300
 tip 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.760
 carefully promazyvaya and smooth the transition 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.700
 marks 30 minutes that's such a beauty 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.870
 I got to wash my hair 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.870

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.770
