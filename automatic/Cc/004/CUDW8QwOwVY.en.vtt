this<00:01:01.770> board<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.399> actually<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:03.149> right<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
this board to actually be right in the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.570 
this board to actually be right in the
middle<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> boards<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.280> are<00:01:05.369> being

middle of all the boards that are being

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
middle of all the boards that are being
released<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.689> pretty<00:01:06.900> good<00:01:07.110> stuff

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
released so that's pretty good stuff

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020 
released so that's pretty good stuff
because<00:01:07.770> their<00:01:07.950> guys's<00:01:08.250> prices<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.729> entry

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
because their guys's prices are entry

out about the audio on here is that I

out about the audio on here is that I
know<00:05:18.860> that<00:05:19.250> when<00:05:19.370> you're<00:05:19.490> using<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:20.240> HDMI<00:05:20.410> or

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
know that when you're using the HDMI or

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.200 
know that when you're using the HDMI or
you're<00:05:21.590> using<00:05:21.770> DisplayPort<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:22.610> can<00:05:22.880> get<00:05:23.120> the

you're using DisplayPort you can get the

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.640 
you're using DisplayPort you can get the
sound<00:05:23.479> coming<00:05:23.840> through<00:05:24.140> it<00:05:24.260> but<00:05:24.410> you<00:05:24.560> were

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650
