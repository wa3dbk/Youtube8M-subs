00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.020 
tropical islands well it's not quite
clear<00:02:27.380> why<00:02:27.950> there<00:02:28.160> are<00:02:28.250> such<00:02:28.400> battles<00:02:28.819> for<00:02:29.000> a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
clear why there are such battles for a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.000 
clear why there are such battles for a
small<00:02:29.360> island<00:02:29.570> with<00:02:29.870> three<00:02:30.140> palm<00:02:30.380> trees<00:02:30.740> but

small island with three palm trees but

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.960 
small island with three palm trees but
that's<00:02:31.190> beside<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.580> point

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
that's beside the point

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.700 
that's beside the point
