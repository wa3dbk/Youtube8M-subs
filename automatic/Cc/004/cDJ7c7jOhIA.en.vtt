quite smooth and reliable and if you
have<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.860> look<00:02:44.980> at<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.280> reel<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.700> I've

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
have a look at this reel that I've

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.570 
have a look at this reel that I've
pulled<00:02:46.120> up<00:02:46.269> with<00:02:46.480> mono<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.709> line<00:02:47.950> lay<00:02:48.250> is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
pulled up with mono the line lay is

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.660 
pulled up with mono the line lay is
really<00:02:49.180> really<00:02:49.480> neat<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.080> even<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:54.489> once

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
really really neat and even so once

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.520 
really really neat and even so once
again<00:02:54.819> I<00:02:55.090> think<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.390> Sigma<00:02:55.750> reels<00:02:55.989> are<00:02:56.380> going

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
again I think the Sigma reels are going

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.440 
again I think the Sigma reels are going
to<00:02:56.590> be<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.739> real<00:02:57.069> hit<00:02:57.459> for<00:02:58.470> 2013<00:02:59.470> and<00:03:00.459> that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
to be a real hit for 2013 and that

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.580 
to be a real hit for 2013 and that
