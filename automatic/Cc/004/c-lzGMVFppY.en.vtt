00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
designed because when I first got this

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.280 
designed because when I first got this
tool<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.910> held<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.269> every<00:00:12.510> which<00:00:12.660> way<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:13.080> right

what<00:00:46.889> we're<00:00:47.010> talking<00:00:47.159> about<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.729> little<00:00:48.089> guy

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
what we're talking about this little guy

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.629 
what we're talking about this little guy
teeny<00:00:48.600> tiny<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.199> have<00:00:49.889> to<00:00:50.039> say<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> hardly<00:00:50.549> use

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:50.639 
teeny tiny I have to say I hardly use

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:52.399 
teeny tiny I have to say I hardly use
this<00:00:50.969> moment<00:00:51.389> it<00:00:51.539> might<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.049> shallow

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
this moment it might are it's shallow

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.109 
this moment it might are it's shallow
and<00:00:52.799> it<00:00:52.889> doesn't<00:00:53.159> have<00:00:53.280> much<00:00:53.429> fabric<00:00:53.879> at<00:00:53.999> all

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:54.119 
and it doesn't have much fabric at all

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.569 
and it doesn't have much fabric at all
but<00:00:54.420> imagine<00:00:54.959> that<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.109> had<00:00:55.499> just<00:00:56.309> cotton

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
but imagine that you had just cotton

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
but imagine that you had just cotton
that<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.089> wanted<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> work<00:00:57.569> with<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.989> this

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that you wanted to work with and this

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.289 
that you wanted to work with and this
one<00:00:58.289> would<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.589> fine<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.159> even<00:01:00.089> when<00:01:00.209> I'm

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
one would be fine for that even when I'm

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:01.789 
one would be fine for that even when I'm
just<00:01:00.569> doing<00:01:00.869> cotton<00:01:01.199> though<00:01:01.319> I<00:01:01.350> tend<00:01:01.619> to<00:01:01.709> use

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
just doing cotton though I tend to use

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.500
