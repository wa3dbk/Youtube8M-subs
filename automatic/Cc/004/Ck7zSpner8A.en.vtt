00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
counters those so what are the

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.800 
counters those so what are the
weaknesses<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.160> type<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.430> deck<00:03:11.760> well<00:03:12.510> the

main weakness is I can see your

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.040 
main weakness is I can see your
opponents<00:03:14.760> with<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> lot<00:03:15.270> of<00:03:15.420> spells<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.810> need

to<00:03:16.140> be<00:03:16.170> countered<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:17.010> typically<00:03:17.489> these<00:03:17.640> are

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
to be countered but typically these are

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.600

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
up an effective creature defense he

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.180 
up an effective creature defense he
could<00:05:27.720> find<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.080> very<00:05:28.320> difficult<00:05:28.500> to<00:05:28.740> win<00:05:28.919> I

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
could find it very difficult to win I

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.219 
could find it very difficult to win I
think<00:05:29.639> a<00:05:29.700> hurricane<00:05:30.180> or<00:05:30.300> two<00:05:30.450> could<00:05:30.750> go<00:05:30.870> a<00:05:30.900> long

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
think a hurricane or two could go a long

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.260 
think a hurricane or two could go a long
ways<00:05:31.500> than<00:05:31.740> this<00:05:31.860> type<00:05:32.070> of<00:05:32.099> deck<00:05:32.340> another

ways than this type of deck another

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.400 
ways than this type of deck another

his critical creature defense spells are
the<00:06:11.580> wrath<00:06:11.880> of<00:06:12.030> God<00:06:12.150> and<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.419> ice<00:06:12.539> manipulator

if<00:06:13.260> Bert<00:06:14.039> Ron<00:06:14.220> can<00:06:14.430> come<00:06:14.699> up<00:06:14.820> fast<00:06:15.060> and<00:06:15.449> maybe

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
if Bert Ron can come up fast and maybe

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.300 
if Bert Ron can come up fast and maybe
cast<00:06:15.930> Armageddon<00:06:16.500> it'll<00:06:17.010> be<00:06:17.099> to<00:06:17.190> his

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.129 
cast Armageddon it'll be to his
advantage<00:06:17.340> but<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.300> game<00:06:18.510> starts<00:06:18.840> to<00:06:18.930> stretch

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
advantage but the game starts to stretch

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:21.020 
advantage but the game starts to stretch
out<00:06:19.349> long<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:19.860> think<00:06:20.310> Lokhande<00:06:20.669> is<00:06:20.760> gonna<00:06:20.910> have

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
out long I think Lokhande is gonna have

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.540 
out long I think Lokhande is gonna have
yet<00:06:21.320> all<00:06:22.320> right<00:06:22.560> thanks<00:06:22.889> a<00:06:22.949> lot<00:06:23.099> Henry<00:06:23.280> for
