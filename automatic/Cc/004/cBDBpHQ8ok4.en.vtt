back and ask for more and then this guy
should<00:04:05.010> make<00:04:05.400> them<00:04:09.050> I'm<00:04:10.050> not<00:04:10.830> too<00:04:11.280> sure<00:04:11.550> but<00:04:11.580> I

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
should make them I'm not too sure but I

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.010 
should make them I'm not too sure but I
think<00:04:11.880> they<00:04:12.600> work<00:04:13.050> in<00:04:13.320> like<00:04:14.810> how<00:04:15.810> many<00:04:18.020> that's

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
think they work in like how many that's

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.979 
think they work in like how many that's
kind<00:04:19.290> of<00:04:19.320> hard<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.530> explain<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:19.920> I<00:04:20.010> think<00:04:20.520> they

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
kind of hard to explain but I think they

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.980 
kind of hard to explain but I think they
work<00:04:21.989> as<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:23.700> know<00:04:23.820> called<00:04:24.180> as<00:04:24.360> much<00:04:24.540> faster

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
work as you know called as much faster

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.080 
work as you know called as much faster
than<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.820> am

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
than I am

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.490 
than I am
I<00:04:27.120> mean<00:04:27.690> Gold's<00:04:28.020> much<00:04:28.200> faster<00:04:28.770> than

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:55.010 

why'd

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.610 

so<00:04:56.020> yes<00:04:56.289> they<00:04:56.469> do<00:04:56.529> get<00:04:56.770> back<00:04:57.009> this<00:04:58.439> which<00:04:59.439> is

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
so yes they do get back this which is

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.399 
so yes they do get back this which is
kind<00:04:59.770> of<00:04:59.949> a<00:05:00.069> office<00:05:00.580> anyway

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
kind of a office anyway

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.790 
kind of a office anyway
yeah<00:05:03.249> they<00:05:03.460> clear<00:05:03.819> out<00:05:03.849> a<00:05:03.999> lot<00:05:04.389> and<00:05:04.800> the

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
yeah they clear out a lot and the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.110 
yeah they clear out a lot and the
brilliant<00:05:06.069> thing<00:05:06.159> is<00:05:06.279> about<00:05:06.430> this<00:05:06.669> is<00:05:06.909> that

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
brilliant thing is about this is that

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.799 
brilliant thing is about this is that
everything<00:05:07.659> they<00:05:07.870> mine<00:05:08.169> comes<00:05:08.949> back<00:05:09.219> to<00:05:09.460> you

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:09.809 
everything they mine comes back to you

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:14.040 
everything they mine comes back to you
for<00:05:10.809> example<00:05:11.289> I'm<00:05:11.889> gonna<00:05:12.430> go<00:05:12.669> show<00:05:12.939> you<00:05:13.050> one

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
for example I'm gonna go show you one

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.989 
for example I'm gonna go show you one
that<00:05:14.229> was<00:05:14.490> that's<00:05:15.490> still<00:05:15.729> being<00:05:15.819> created

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:15.999 
that was that's still being created

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:18.149 
that was that's still being created
actually<00:05:16.389> but<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.169> started<00:05:17.560> create<00:05:17.830> being

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
actually but it started create being

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.159 
actually but it started create being
created<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.580> little<00:05:18.699> bit<00:05:18.819> earlier<00:05:20.520> yeah<00:05:21.779> and<00:05:22.779> he

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
created a little bit earlier yeah and he

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.189 
created a little bit earlier yeah and he
came<00:05:23.349> back<00:05:23.409> up<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:23.919> me<00:05:24.039> early<00:05:24.839> and<00:05:25.839> this<00:05:26.080> is

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
everything that he made out of the first

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.510 
everything that he made out of the first
little<00:05:28.659> shop<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:29.139> he<00:05:29.199> dug<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:30.400> he's

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
little shop that he dug and he's

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.350 
little shop that he dug and he's
currently<00:05:30.819> working<00:05:30.999> on<00:05:31.300> 49<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.199> and

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
currently working on 49 of that and

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.700 
currently working on 49 of that and
these<00:05:34.360> are<00:05:34.569> all<00:05:34.659> the<00:05:34.779> materials<00:05:35.259> that<00:05:35.379> he

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
these are all the materials that he

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.769 
these are all the materials that he
gathered<00:05:36.159> while<00:05:36.430> mining<00:05:39.419> I'm<00:05:40.419> gonna<00:05:40.629> quickly

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
gathered while mining I'm gonna quickly

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:45.360 
gathered while mining I'm gonna quickly
show<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:41.050> what<00:05:41.139> the<00:05:41.319> shot<00:05:41.529> looks<00:05:41.710> like<00:05:44.370> the

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
show you what the shot looks like the

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.850 
show you what the shot looks like the
shaft<00:05:45.610> basically<00:05:46.300> he<00:05:46.779> digs<00:05:47.110> down<00:05:47.409> to<00:05:47.830> a

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
shaft basically he digs down to a

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.739 
shaft basically he digs down to a
certain<00:05:48.039> level<00:05:48.249> levels<00:05:49.060> off<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.449> comes

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:49.749 
certain level levels off and comes

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.159 
certain level levels off and comes
walking<00:05:50.020> down<00:05:50.289> here<00:05:50.560> and<00:05:51.689> goes<00:05:52.689> down<00:05:52.899> all<00:05:53.110> the

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
walking down here and goes down all the

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.529 
walking down here and goes down all the
way<00:05:53.259> to<00:05:53.319> the<00:05:53.469> air21<00:05:54.310> 21<00:05:54.819> blocks<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:55.389> then

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
way to the air21 21 blocks and then

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.510 
way to the air21 21 blocks and then
comes<00:05:55.689> back<00:05:55.779> and<00:05:56.289> goes<00:05:56.800> up<00:05:57.009> to<00:05:57.039> the<00:05:57.129> surface

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
comes back and goes up to the surface

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.659 
comes back and goes up to the surface
then<00:05:58.300> he<00:05:58.389> comes<00:05:58.569> back<00:05:58.659> down<00:05:59.139> and<00:05:59.550> carries<00:06:00.550> on

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
then he comes back down and carries on

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:06.520 
then he comes back down and carries on
mining<00:06:01.029> done<00:06:01.209> yeah

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.860 

so<00:06:07.530> it<00:06:07.620> carries<00:06:07.889> on<00:06:08.069> mining<00:06:08.370> and<00:06:08.600> also<00:06:09.600> if<00:06:09.750> he

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
so it carries on mining and also if he

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.290 
so it carries on mining and also if he
sees<00:06:10.139> any<00:06:10.440> holes<00:06:10.860> in<00:06:11.039> the<00:06:11.099> wall<00:06:11.340> he<00:06:11.669> will<00:06:11.819> cover

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
sees any holes in the wall he will cover

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.309 
sees any holes in the wall he will cover
them<00:06:12.479> up<00:06:12.599> for<00:06:13.349> example<00:06:13.500> if<00:06:13.830> I<00:06:13.919> do<00:06:13.979> that<00:06:15.319> nice

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
them up for example if I do that nice

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.309 
them up for example if I do that nice
big<00:06:16.800> hole<00:06:17.069> over<00:06:17.099> here<00:06:17.610> there<00:06:18.300> we<00:06:18.360> go<00:06:18.509> covers<00:06:19.229> it

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
big hole over here there we go covers it

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.210 
big hole over here there we go covers it
up<00:06:19.470> um<00:06:20.900> so<00:06:21.900> that's<00:06:22.319> a<00:06:22.440> nice<00:06:22.590> little<00:06:22.740> feature<00:06:22.949> as

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
up um so that's a nice little feature as

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.059 
up um so that's a nice little feature as
well<00:06:23.930> so<00:06:24.930> that<00:06:25.050> your<00:06:25.259> tunnels<00:06:25.710> don't<00:06:25.949> get

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
well so that your tunnels don't get

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.070
