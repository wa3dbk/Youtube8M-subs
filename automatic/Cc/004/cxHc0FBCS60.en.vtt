like
that<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> nail<00:01:35.700> see<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> nail<00:01:36.720> art<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
that is a nail see that as a nail art I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.710 
that is a nail see that as a nail art I
think<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> really<00:01:37.740> pretty<00:01:38.369> color<00:01:38.659> do<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
think is a really pretty color do you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.060 
think is a really pretty color do you
not<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.259> agree<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.680> looks<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.920> bit<00:01:40.950> like

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
not do you agree it looks a bit like

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.010 
not do you agree it looks a bit like
slime<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.100> silvery<00:01:44.689> color<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
slime so this is just a silvery color a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.370 
slime so this is just a silvery color a
little<00:01:46.950> bit<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.659> there<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:49.290> I'll

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
little bit of that in there that I'll

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.510 
little bit of that in there that I'll
probably<00:01:49.500> make<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:50.009> bit<00:01:50.130> more<00:01:50.250> shiny

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
probably make it a little bit more shiny

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.950 
probably make it a little bit more shiny
