00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
light but but easy you might say kid

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.010

friendly<00:02:58.700> or<00:02:59.000> student<00:02:59.510> friendly<00:02:59.810> um<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:02.020> would

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
friendly or student friendly um I would

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.480 
friendly or student friendly um I would
probably<00:03:04.690> know<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.960> would<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.710> scale<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.100> one

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
probably know I would on a scale of one

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.870 
probably know I would on a scale of one
to<00:03:07.520> ten<00:03:08.380> between<00:03:09.380> mellow<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.830> bright<00:03:10.130> i<00:03:10.430> would

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
to ten between mellow and bright i would

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.400 
to ten between mellow and bright i would
say<00:03:12.790> 55<00:03:13.790> i<00:03:14.090> was<00:03:14.330> going<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.540> say<00:03:14.600> six<00:03:15.020> but<00:03:15.230> no<00:03:15.380> i

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
say 55 i was going to say six but no i

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.810 
say 55 i was going to say six but no i
think<00:03:15.680> five<00:03:15.830> is<00:03:15.890> right<00:03:18.520> same<00:03:19.520> thing<00:03:19.670> for<00:03:19.760> the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
think five is right same thing for the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.880 
think five is right same thing for the
touch<00:03:20.000> actually<00:03:20.480> it's<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.200> right<00:03:21.440> there<00:03:21.650> in

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
touch actually it's it's right there in

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.970 
touch actually it's it's right there in
that<00:03:21.920> really<00:03:22.460> comfortable<00:03:22.990> middle<00:03:23.990> zone<00:03:24.260> on<00:03:24.860> a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
that really comfortable middle zone on a

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.460 
that really comfortable middle zone on a
scale<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.340> 1<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.700> 10<00:03:25.730> 5<00:03:26.360> would<00:03:26.630> be<00:03:26.660> would<00:03:27.440> be

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
scale of 1 to 10 5 would be would be

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.910 
scale of 1 to 10 5 would be would be
right<00:03:27.770> so<00:03:28.240> five<00:03:29.240> and<00:03:29.420> five<00:03:29.600> touching<00:03:30.470> tone<00:03:30.680> is

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
right so five and five touching tone is

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.520 
right so five and five touching tone is
what<00:03:31.280> i<00:03:31.310> would<00:03:32.240> characterize<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.900> piano<00:03:33.320> as

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
what i would characterize this piano as
