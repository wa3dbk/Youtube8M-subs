00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
ascend d1 quad XL as the name says it's

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.950 
ascend d1 quad XL as the name says it's
a<00:00:07.560> quad-core<00:00:07.919> processor<00:00:08.849> was<00:00:09.500> 1.4<00:00:10.639> gigahertz

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
a quad-core processor was 1.4 gigahertz

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.880 
a quad-core processor was 1.4 gigahertz
it's<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.080> same<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:15.379> this<00:00:16.379> one<00:00:16.590> over

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
it's the same with the this one over

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.510 
it's the same with the this one over
here<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.250> samsung<00:00:17.789> galaxy<00:00:18.109> s3<00:00:19.109> but<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.310> one

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
here the samsung galaxy s3 but this one

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.300 
here the samsung galaxy s3 but this one
is<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:21.000> way<00:00:21.180> processor<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.800> one<00:00:23.039> is

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
is one way processor and in this one is

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.470 
is one way processor and in this one is
a<00:00:23.689> samsung<00:00:24.689> processor<00:00:25.500> both<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.490> one

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
a samsung processor both have one

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.950 
a samsung processor both have one
gigabyte<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.619> ram<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.150> should<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.750> same

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
gigabyte of ram so it should be the same

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.860 
gigabyte of ram so it should be the same
in<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.390> circumstances<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.630> as

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
in the in the circumstances but as

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.620 
in the in the circumstances but as
benchmarks<00:00:34.590> told<00:00:35.100> me<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.239> little<00:00:36.480> bit

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
benchmarks told me it's a little bit

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.869 
benchmarks told me it's a little bit
different<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.739> come<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.250> later<00:00:38.579> on

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
different but we come to this later on

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.420 
different but we come to this later on
please<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.290> bit<00:00:40.590> patient<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.129> by

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
please be a little bit patient and by

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.380 
please be a little bit patient and by
the<00:00:41.460> way<00:00:41.579> let's<00:00:42.570> compare<00:00:43.079> both<00:00:43.379> from<00:00:44.309> sizes<00:00:44.879> so

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the way let's compare both from sizes so

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.979 
the way let's compare both from sizes so
the<00:00:46.280> s3<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.579> little<00:00:47.850> bit<00:00:47.940> brighter<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the s3 is a little bit brighter it's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.549 
the s3 is a little bit brighter it's
about<00:00:49.579> six<00:00:50.579> millimeters<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.480> over<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
about six millimeters and over here you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.470 
about six millimeters and over here you
can<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> little<00:00:53.610> bit<00:00:53.850> higher<00:00:54.120> with

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
can see it's a little bit higher with

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.529 
can see it's a little bit higher with
seven<00:00:54.809> millimeters<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.530> its<00:00:55.739> way<00:00:56.340> thinner<00:00:56.940> we

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
seven millimeters but its way thinner we

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
seven millimeters but its way thinner we
have<00:00:57.719> eight<00:00:58.109> point<00:00:58.590> seven<00:00:58.980> millimeters<00:00:59.699> here

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
have eight point seven millimeters here

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.969 
have eight point seven millimeters here
and<00:01:00.590> 11.5<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> squat<00:01:03.210> excel<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and 11.5 with a squat excel and the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.219 
and 11.5 with a squat excel and the
white<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:06.020> 145<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.580> 133<00:01:08.580> grams<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
white is 145 to 133 grams so it's a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.399 
white is 145 to 133 grams so it's a
totally<00:01:11.159> different<00:01:11.720> feeling<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
totally different feeling if we have it

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.539 
totally different feeling if we have it
in<00:01:13.530> your<00:01:13.680> palm<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.570> this<00:01:15.570> plane<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.159> IPS<00:01:17.159> so

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
in your palm and this plane is IPS so

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.510 
in your palm and this plane is IPS so
you<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> really<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.890> viewing<00:01:19.890> angle

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you have a really good viewing angle

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.300 
you have a really good viewing angle
especially<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.630> you're<00:01:21.780> outside<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.040> have

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
especially if you're outside now we have

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.179 
especially if you're outside now we have
these<00:01:23.990> reflections<00:01:24.990> over<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:25.979> that's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
these reflections over here but that's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.520 
these reflections over here but that's
kind<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.119> realistic<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.229> lacked

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
kind of realistic if you have lacked

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.310 
kind of realistic if you have lacked
those<00:01:29.250> days<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> Sun<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.600> will<00:01:31.049> have

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
those days to see the Sun I will have

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.300 
those days to see the Sun I will have
the<00:01:31.500> same<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.820> reflecting<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:33.900> all

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
the same so it's a reflecting as all

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.580 
the same so it's a reflecting as all
smartphone<00:01:35.310> displays<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:37.170> least<00:01:37.380> you

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
smartphone displays do but at least you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.469 
smartphone displays do but at least you
can<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:38.520> quite<00:01:38.909> great<00:01:39.630> quite<00:01:40.560> well<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.479> it's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
can see quite great quite well so it's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.240 
can see quite great quite well so it's
all<00:01:42.990> right<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.560> all<00:01:45.140> thumbs<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.320> containing

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
all right it's all thumbs up containing

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.240 
all right it's all thumbs up containing
this<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.680> smaller

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
this but as you can see it's a smaller

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
this but as you can see it's a smaller
display<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.149> 4.5<00:01:52.340> versus<00:01:53.340> 4.8<00:01:55.579> inches<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
display it's 4.5 versus 4.8 inches and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.060 
display it's 4.5 versus 4.8 inches and
you<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.170> same<00:01:58.469> number<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.610> pixels<00:01:59.969> it's

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
you have the same number of pixels it's

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.170 
you have the same number of pixels it's
722<00:02:02.600> 1280<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.899> both<00:02:04.229> devices<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:05.939> have<00:02:06.149> a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
722 1280 on both devices so we have a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.719 
722 1280 on both devices so we have a
little<00:02:06.570> bit<00:02:06.719> more<00:02:07.670> pixel<00:02:08.670> density<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
little bit more pixel density on the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.199 
little bit more pixel density on the
d1<00:02:11.120> quad<00:02:11.390> then<00:02:11.989> on<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.530> s3<00:02:13.010> but<00:02:13.730> as<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.060> can

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
d1 quad then on the s3 but as you can

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.630 
d1 quad then on the s3 but as you can
see<00:02:14.390> over<00:02:14.629> here<00:02:14.659> I'm<00:02:15.080> assuming<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:16.190> little<00:02:16.489> bit

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
see over here I'm assuming a little bit

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.619 
see over here I'm assuming a little bit
that<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.480> compare<00:02:18.349> those<00:02:19.299> those<00:02:20.299> lines

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
that you can compare those those lines

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.649 
that you can compare those those lines
over<00:02:21.110> here<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.830> can<00:02:22.069> read<00:02:22.549> very<00:02:23.000> well<00:02:23.120> both

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
over here you can read very well both

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.930 
over here you can read very well both
they<00:02:24.349> are<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.560> little<00:02:24.950> bit<00:02:25.159> bigger<00:02:25.370> over<00:02:25.730> here

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
they are a little bit bigger over here

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.190 
they are a little bit bigger over here
on<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.269> s3<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.590> build<00:02:27.920> smaller<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.450> very

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
on the s3 and build smaller but a very

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.690 
on the s3 and build smaller but a very
crisp<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.860> we're<00:02:31.099> clear<00:02:31.670> but<00:02:32.150> it's<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.720> kind<00:02:33.110> of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700

concerning<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.910> battery<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.209> this<00:03:02.840> one<00:03:03.079> over

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
concerning the battery and this one over

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.930 
concerning the battery and this one over
here<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:04.040> can<00:03:04.780> go<00:03:05.780> like<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.370> put<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.519> off

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
here you can go like this put this off

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.979 
here you can go like this put this off
and<00:03:08.480> tada<00:03:09.440> here<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:10.519> go<00:03:10.670> as<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.390> can<00:03:11.540> see<00:03:11.780> it's

and tada here we go as you can see it's

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.500 
and tada here we go as you can see it's
not<00:03:12.260> removable<00:03:12.829> maybe<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.819> can<00:03:14.000> be<00:03:14.150> move<00:03:14.359> it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
not removable maybe you can be move it

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.569 
not removable maybe you can be move it
over<00:03:14.629> here<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.319> not<00:03:15.500> let's<00:03:15.919> say<00:03:16.069> on<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.400> go

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
over here but not let's say on the go

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.940 
over here but not let's say on the go
just<00:03:17.889> changing<00:03:18.889> the<00:03:19.030> battery<00:03:20.260> why<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.319> one<00:03:21.739> is

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
just changing the battery why is one is

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.000 
just changing the battery why is one is
empty<00:03:22.400> but<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.120> guess<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:23.810> don't<00:03:24.139> have<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.859> do

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
empty but I guess you don't have to do

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.670 
empty but I guess you don't have to do
so<00:03:25.250> because<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.849> have<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.480> two<00:03:27.109> thousand<00:03:27.590> and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
so because you have to two thousand and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.479 
so because you have to two thousand and
six<00:03:28.010> hundred<00:03:28.989> milliampere<00:03:29.989> hours<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:31.160> it's

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
six hundred milliampere hours so it's

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.080 
six hundred milliampere hours so it's
way<00:03:32.209> more<00:03:32.239> than<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.169> two<00:03:33.859> thousand<00:03:34.639> and<00:03:34.760> one

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
way more than the two thousand and one

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.110 
way more than the two thousand and one
hundred<00:03:35.690> million<00:03:35.870> pairs<00:03:36.410> of<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.799> s3<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.609> like

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
hundred million pairs of the s3 and like

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.539 
hundred million pairs of the s3 and like
it's<00:03:38.359> normal<00:03:38.750> so<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.470> might<00:03:39.799> be<00:03:39.829> that<00:03:40.069> you<00:03:40.340> come

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
it's normal so it might be that you come

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.900 
it's normal so it might be that you come
over<00:03:40.849> the<00:03:40.970> day<00:03:41.120> just<00:03:41.840> with<00:03:42.109> one<00:03:42.609> charge<00:03:43.609> of

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
over the day just with one charge of

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.349 
over the day just with one charge of
this<00:03:44.260> battery<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:45.829> we<00:03:46.040> have<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.340> test<00:03:46.940> this<00:03:47.180> out

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
this battery so we have to test this out

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.659 
this battery so we have to test this out
and<00:03:47.720> by<00:03:48.139> the<00:03:48.200> way<00:03:48.349> this<00:03:48.620> one<00:03:48.889> over<00:03:49.160> here<00:03:49.190> this

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
and by the way this one over here this

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.240 
and by the way this one over here this
is<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.819> slot<00:03:50.209> for<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.540> sim<00:03:50.959> card<00:03:51.010> normal<00:03:52.010> size

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
is a slot for the sim card normal size

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.280 
is a slot for the sim card normal size

32 gigabyte internal memory is 8
gigabyte<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.950> might<00:04:01.160> be<00:04:01.430> some<00:04:01.879> six<00:04:02.450> gigabyte

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
gigabyte that might be some six gigabyte

at the end after all android and apps

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.470 
at the end after all android and apps
and<00:04:08.989> whatever<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.769> have<00:04:09.949> to<00:04:10.150> find<00:04:11.150> on<00:04:11.299> this

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.400 
and whatever you have to find on this
device<00:04:12.049> so<00:04:12.709> let's<00:04:13.579> say<00:04:13.819> you<00:04:14.060> can<00:04:14.629> go<00:04:15.230> with

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
device so let's say you can go with

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.099 
device so let's say you can go with
about<00:04:15.680> six<00:04:16.340> gigabyte<00:04:16.849> over<00:04:17.150> here<00:04:17.449> and<00:04:17.599> as<00:04:18.079> you

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
about six gigabyte over here and as you

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.080 
about six gigabyte over here and as you
might<00:04:18.530> know<00:04:18.769> on<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.519> s3<00:04:19.789> we<00:04:20.180> have<00:04:20.329> 16<00:04:20.750> 32<00:04:21.709> and

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
might know on the s3 we have 16 32 and

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.580 
might know on the s3 we have 16 32 and
65<00:04:23.260> 64<00:04:24.260> arms

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
65 64 arms

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.990 
65 64 arms
65<00:04:25.160> gigabyte<00:04:25.699> internal<00:04:26.300> plus<00:04:26.600> 65<00:04:27.560> gigabyte<00:04:28.190> yr

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
65 gigabyte internal plus 65 gigabyte yr

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.530 
65 gigabyte internal plus 65 gigabyte yr
SD<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:29.960> it's<00:04:30.230> way<00:04:30.470> more<00:04:30.610> memory<00:04:31.610> over<00:04:31.910> here<00:04:32.120> but

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
SD so it's way more memory over here but

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.629 
SD so it's way more memory over here but
we<00:04:32.780> are<00:04:32.870> talking<00:04:33.229> about<00:04:33.320> totally<00:04:34.190> different

roundabout<00:05:08.870> but<00:05:09.440> it's<00:05:10.300> definitely<00:05:11.530> less

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
roundabout but it's definitely less

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.490 
roundabout but it's definitely less
expensive<00:05:13.430> this<00:05:13.610> one<00:05:13.790> over<00:05:14.030> here<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:15.050> as<00:05:15.410> you

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
expensive this one over here and as you

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.180 
expensive this one over here and as you
can<00:05:15.650> see<00:05:15.680> we<00:05:15.950> have<00:05:16.120> android<00:05:17.120> for<00:05:17.740> say<00:05:18.740> four

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
can see we have android for say four

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.140 
can see we have android for say four

bit<00:05:23.270> tricky<00:05:23.960> for<00:05:23.990> me<00:05:24.199> I'm<00:05:24.410> sorry<00:05:24.590> for<00:05:24.830> that<00:05:24.949> as

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
bit tricky for me I'm sorry for that as

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.070 
bit tricky for me I'm sorry for that as
you<00:05:25.789> can<00:05:25.910> see<00:05:26.090> over<00:05:26.330> here<00:05:26.360> we<00:05:26.780> have<00:05:26.930> the

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
you can see over here we have the

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.040 
you can see over here we have the
widgets<00:05:27.470> and<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:28.130> apps<00:05:28.479> separately<00:05:29.479> and<00:05:29.930> you

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
widgets and the apps separately and you

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.680 
widgets and the apps separately and you
can<00:05:30.260> oh<00:05:30.470> is<00:05:30.770> this<00:05:30.950> one<00:05:31.160> is<00:05:31.280> nice<00:05:31.460> yeah<00:05:32.060> okay

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
can oh is this one is nice yeah okay

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.550 
can oh is this one is nice yeah okay
it's<00:05:33.200> very<00:05:33.410> fluently<00:05:33.979> totally<00:05:34.700> great<00:05:35.630> and<00:05:35.900> you

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
it's very fluently totally great and you

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.950 
it's very fluently totally great and you
can<00:05:36.800> expect<00:05:37.100> it<00:05:37.310> from<00:05:37.340> a<00:05:37.789> quad-core<00:05:38.180> processor

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
can expect it from a quad-core processor

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.219 
can expect it from a quad-core processor
but<00:05:39.440> let's<00:05:39.650> go<00:05:39.830> back<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:40.099> the<00:05:41.050> benchmarks<00:05:42.050> I

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
but let's go back to the benchmarks I

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.110 
but let's go back to the benchmarks I
told<00:05:42.500> you<00:05:42.740> so<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.849> compare<00:05:44.210> those<00:05:44.450> i<00:05:45.080> have<00:05:46.120> made

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
told you so to compare those i have made

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.680 
told you so to compare those i have made
about<00:05:47.690> 10<00:05:48.250> benchmarks<00:05:49.250> like<00:05:49.490> deep<00:05:49.910> bench<00:05:50.240> and

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
about 10 benchmarks like deep bench and

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.100 
about 10 benchmarks like deep bench and
lynn<00:05:50.990> peg<00:05:51.260> and<00:05:51.680> quadrant<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.360> 22<00:05:53.780> and

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
lynn peg and quadrant and and 22 and

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.110 
lynn peg and quadrant and and 22 and
pass<00:05:54.349> mark<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.950> whatever<00:05:55.280> and<00:05:55.490> especially

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.110 
pass mark and whatever and especially
the<00:05:56.840> sunspider<00:05:57.530> was<00:05:57.830> surprising<00:05:58.520> for<00:05:58.639> me<00:05:58.700> and

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
the sunspider was surprising for me and

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.290 
the sunspider was surprising for me and
the<00:05:59.630> other<00:05:59.780> ones<00:06:00.139> the<00:06:00.650> s3<00:06:01.039> is<00:06:01.070> a<00:06:01.220> little<00:06:01.460> bit<00:06:01.580> on

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
the other ones the s3 is a little bit on

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.610 
the other ones the s3 is a little bit on
the<00:06:02.630> on<00:06:03.260> the<00:06:03.550> upper<00:06:04.550> side<00:06:04.820> about<00:06:05.599> the<00:06:06.289> ten

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
the on the upper side about the ten

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.150 
the on the upper side about the ten
percent<00:06:07.220> about<00:06:07.580> this<00:06:08.389> one<00:06:08.630> and<00:06:09.530> on<00:06:09.710> the<00:06:09.860> others

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
percent about this one and on the others

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.700 
percent about this one and on the others
may<00:06:10.789> be<00:06:10.870> less<00:06:12.460> like<00:06:13.460> let's<00:06:13.910> say<00:06:14.000> geekbench<00:06:14.710> but

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
may be less like let's say geekbench but

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.469 
may be less like let's say geekbench but
on<00:06:16.030> total<00:06:17.030> if<00:06:17.180> you<00:06:17.300> take<00:06:17.840> all<00:06:18.080> those

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
on total if you take all those

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.890 
on total if you take all those
benchmarks<00:06:20.479> together<00:06:21.410> we<00:06:22.010> have<00:06:22.190> a<00:06:22.430> plus<00:06:23.150> from

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
benchmarks together we have a plus from

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.500 
benchmarks together we have a plus from
nineteen<00:06:24.620> percent<00:06:24.919> for<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.729> S<00:06:25.849> free<00:06:26.030> so<00:06:26.330> it's

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
nineteen percent for the S free so it's

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.719 
nineteen percent for the S free so it's
ninety<00:06:26.930> percent<00:06:27.080> quicker<00:06:27.650> and<00:06:28.010> total<00:06:28.880> and<00:06:29.060> the

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729 
ninety percent quicker and total and the

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:33.969 
ninety percent quicker and total and the
percentage<00:06:31.729> if<00:06:32.630> you<00:06:32.810> compare<00:06:33.229> both<00:06:33.469> devices

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
percentage if you compare both devices

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.430 
percentage if you compare both devices
so<00:06:34.700> this<00:06:35.360> is<00:06:35.979> kind<00:06:36.979> of<00:06:37.039> surprising<00:06:37.190> because

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
so this is kind of surprising because

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.980 
so this is kind of surprising because
I<00:06:38.470> said<00:06:39.280> told<00:06:39.550> you<00:06:39.700> and<00:06:40.030> on<00:06:40.240> the<00:06:40.480> beginning

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
I said told you and on the beginning

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.040 
I said told you and on the beginning
this<00:06:41.350> one<00:06:41.560> is<00:06:41.650> well<00:06:41.920> way<00:06:42.160> own<00:06:42.820> processor<00:06:43.780> and

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
this one is well way own processor and

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.530 
this one is well way own processor and
this<00:06:44.170> is<00:06:44.350> Samsung<00:06:44.890> own<00:06:45.070> processor<00:06:45.820> but<00:06:46.330> both

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
this is Samsung own processor but both

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.490 
this is Samsung own processor but both
have<00:06:46.840> the<00:06:47.350> same<00:06:48.360> quad-core<00:06:49.360> 1.5<00:06:50.110> gigahertz

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
have the same quad-core 1.5 gigahertz

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.670 
have the same quad-core 1.5 gigahertz
and<00:06:51.100> one<00:06:51.400> gigabyte<00:06:51.880> RAM<00:06:52.720> so<00:06:53.200> it<00:06:53.380> should<00:06:53.650> be

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
and one gigabyte RAM so it should be

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.190 
and one gigabyte RAM so it should be
almost<00:06:54.130> the<00:06:54.400> same<00:06:54.580> but<00:06:54.640> it<00:06:54.940> isn't<00:06:55.210> so<00:06:55.390> let's

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200 
almost the same but it isn't so let's

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.110 
almost the same but it isn't so let's
say<00:06:56.350> that<00:06:56.680> is<00:06:57.070> maybe<00:06:57.700> a<00:06:57.820> problem<00:06:58.360> of<00:06:58.750> the<00:07:00.120> less

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
say that is maybe a problem of the less

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.190 
say that is maybe a problem of the less
or<00:07:01.470> qualitative<00:07:02.470> or<00:07:02.980> less<00:07:03.430> quicker<00:07:03.960> ram<00:07:04.960> i

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.200 
or qualitative or less quicker ram i

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.500 
or qualitative or less quicker ram i
don't<00:07:05.560> know<00:07:05.740> i<00:07:06.010> can<00:07:06.520> tell<00:07:06.730> you<00:07:06.850> that<00:07:07.240> it's

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:07.510 
don't know i can tell you that it's

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.980 
don't know i can tell you that it's
definitely<00:07:08.140> not<00:07:09.010> the<00:07:09.190> same<00:07:09.430> league<00:07:10.360> so

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
definitely not the same league so

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.640 
definitely not the same league so
compared<00:07:11.830> with<00:07:12.040> a<00:07:12.810> building<00:07:13.810> quality<00:07:14.050> and

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650 
compared with a building quality and

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.180 
compared with a building quality and
speed<00:07:15.460> so<00:07:16.150> that's<00:07:16.450> the<00:07:16.840> difference<00:07:17.230> all<00:07:17.710> the

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
speed so that's the difference all the

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.060 
speed so that's the difference all the
other<00:07:18.450> things<00:07:19.450> we<00:07:19.840> will<00:07:20.050> have<00:07:20.230> to<00:07:20.350> find<00:07:20.530> out<00:07:20.800> on

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
other things we will have to find out on

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.230 
other things we will have to find out on
the<00:07:22.170> test<00:07:23.170> we<00:07:23.740> will<00:07:23.770> do<00:07:24.070> in<00:07:24.370> the<00:07:24.400> next<00:07:24.640> two

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
the test we will do in the next two

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.540 
the test we will do in the next two
weeks<00:07:25.270> so<00:07:25.840> stay<00:07:26.170> tuned<00:07:26.650> and<00:07:26.860> i<00:07:26.980> hope<00:07:27.190> to<00:07:27.250> see

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
weeks so stay tuned and i hope to see

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.540 
weeks so stay tuned and i hope to see
you<00:07:27.610> back<00:07:27.760> soon<00:07:28.000> take<00:07:28.450> care
