00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello everybody says my name is a smartphone 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.470
 today I'm running here we're 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.360
 working in the spindle and we do not have the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.219
 suspension noise that happens to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.710
 this arm here 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.379
 he has a pivot on the end and look have this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.380
 small gap that there would be in place 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.060
 So it is the same and it also moves 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.250
 everything is thought of here we can not give 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.900
 identify with him how he stays 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.740
 pressed we can not get the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.810
 people can hear the noise and see the 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.880
 the bar is not even and often 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.130
 people think that that bush that broke 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.160
 the window is not this people here that gives 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.219
 off we will replace this 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.190
 new original that we talk about in the way 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.809
 to find the right side and also 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.879
 remembering also that he will leave together 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.750
 the tapered making the conic be 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.850
 together 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.250
 so we have to put the conical 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:06.780
 people are going to hit here the roriz is going to hit 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:10.229
 wins and it happens that the campaign will go down 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.150
 would have given people a shot in the face of the goal 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.040
 alone the same tool put a 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.470
 screw hits right note 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.900
 so let's summarize here is this noise 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 you have here can not identify in the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.680
 pivot is the pivot is bad but the people 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.869
 can not identify because it 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 everything is stuck here that everyone in prison is 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.350
 You can not see right, we 'll go. 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.790

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.340
 mounted for you 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.850
 Good folks, this one is already a tray 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.710
 Replacing it, it's here or you're putting it back 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.049
 here remembering that this screw here 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.240
 you have to tighten it in the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.939
 straight tray does not end up waiting for this 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.369
 search faster is placed 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.290
 Okay, this is going to make a noise here. 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.450
 you have is usually when you step on the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.780
 Brake spends some hole that makes a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.100
 noise no rubber noise whatsoever 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.719
