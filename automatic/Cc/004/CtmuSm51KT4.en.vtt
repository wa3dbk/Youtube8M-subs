00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:20.030
 the fans dressing but makes vegan and 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:24.250

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.250

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:40.700
 Lemon juice in my case 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:47.210

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.020

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.969

 i could do that too mister magic why 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.320
 but I just do it now 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:59.030
 quickly with a blender and then 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.870

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.870

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:17.819
 a little pepper and a pinch of salt 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:33.329

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.259

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.590
