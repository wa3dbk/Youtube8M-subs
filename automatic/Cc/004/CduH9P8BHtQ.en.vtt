00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.940
 you

 when you have 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.340
 16 about company roles 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.710
 while zeca wants to accelerate the world 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.710
 need 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.850
 00 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:46.130
 to receive one from whom I may not only be 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:49.210
 moral morality and the talk that the turkey 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.210
 that are turned 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.500

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.399
 only trains with January smiled and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.399
 preparation here 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.270
 so much that as much as is left over I said 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.270
 too much 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.659
 the paper 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.300
 Anyway, you get to the ground or 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.410
 play to win here too 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.410
 against European teams 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.440
 the cat 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.440
 they got carried on there 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.670
 but 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.670
 Got the backpack. 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.020
 Do you think 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.420
 came again with danger 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.950
 How was it when I decided to delegate 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.950
 they rented lost people won 2 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.950
 the money 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.740
 Sorry this is the tired one. 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.380
 In September 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.420
 no b is that if someone arrives 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.780
 if I take medicine or play against 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.780
 they 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.569
 guys lost 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.440
 show people things 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.440
 We are going to play today. 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.530
 the guy already said this several times several 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.360
 places I was scared 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.610
 while you look so little time 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.950
 I've even talked mostly to you. 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.430
 how was he the preparation between the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.130
 emi china and the first funk dance was 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.740
 were six rose so much level 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.780
 very shelter 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.590
 centenarian says that there are areas 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.590
 that made 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.959
 ae 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.269
 so I think one of the biggest criticisms 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.060
 The last thing you give the two of you is that the 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.819
 I was going there and you saw the 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.459
 control against the said in final note of the 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.640
 cyprus country and I also ended up with 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.810
 Who you are that you do not want can go 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.810
 alone in every game 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:44.910
 This is practice playing together and end. 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.910
 the movie, how do you think I know? 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.500
 be the first 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.500
 it's the practice 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.450
 everything is still right 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.430
 You're here now. 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.100
 You need it because of the show. 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:22.120
 Tell Diego the Shivani with your day 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.580
 in fact I hate who plays who are you already 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.580
 saw that one more time greater support 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.600
 has some 100% you do not now the case with the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.600
 cna 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:46.360
 they known for leasing of epe up 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.360
 be caught the success of the river 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.389
 You were the isp in the first game. 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.649
 possibly a third game in itself 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.649
 I think it helps with you. 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.760
 but I have the answer of always using 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.980
 their banks 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.390
 You're going to have a precise answer to be 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.390
 recognized in its neighborhoods 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.640
 Who is so beautiful to you in this? 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.640
 championship 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.639
 when I picked up they did not have the epp was the 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.159
 teleport can 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.490
 dragons too which I think changed 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.080
 much of you when you light would look at you 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.749
 facebook saying it was being 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.630
 called now started to make you took out 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:45.240
 me 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.890
 Where did you go but is your scissors thing? 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.890
 brazil was discussed by the team 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.190
 ae 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.749
 Who does not like my job? 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.579
 I remember that in the first qualify you 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:13.559
 has a pilot project already without a happy ending 

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:16.349
 It's a tactic similar to what you 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:21.139
 they won the following week 7 credit 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:24.610
 squared square game was totally 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.610
 rain reaches 20 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.190
 we hold the Rio stopped 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.170
 because to win 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.390
 So these people are going to give a message 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:45.290
 I hope you will light 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.250
 not even a kiss your fans did not let 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.590
 to run away 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.590
 samantha your father is just a voice to say 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:59.619
 at that moment the members with 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:59.619
 sponsors saw you takehi 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.040
 That's what gives a good-bye heck. 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.240
 that's it 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.419
 in itapemirim 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.280
 was very difficult rule also provides 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:29.280
 coach said nothing will betray 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:38.240
 but just to see that the staff 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:41.260
 It is closed place I knew that the study 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.260
 even though I have 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:46.480
 on the beach take you have a head 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.660
 girlfriend 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.710
 that's cute, it's good people 

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.710
 Luck for you in the morning.
