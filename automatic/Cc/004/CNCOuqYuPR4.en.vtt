 that we have prepared for today 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.490
 I really was thinking about staying with 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.560
 my flower was a food of people who 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.529
 they thought that cauliflower is a food 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.599
 very boring and I said how can you 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.640
 eat more cauliflower is only I 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.590
 only the food as well as 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.350
 little tree they already know of little ones that after 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.680
 the saplings of cauliflowers or in as in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.680
 Chile 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.020
 well already and I know how else 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.580
 we can eat cauliflower until 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.290
 I found this recipe that called me 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.600
 a lot of attention was made to me 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.130
 different state super easy to prepare 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.989
 and as I told you and I said 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.489
 I think it could be rich we're going to 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.590
 prepare it and if it looks good 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.660
 then I share it with my friends from 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.750
 channel and here I bring it for you 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.170
 hope we are going to make some chips like 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.320
 a cauliflower cheese sticks we 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.180
 to see how they prepare and what we need 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.280
 we need a medium cheese cauliflower 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 grated I used mozzarella cheese and 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:31.090
 parmesan half cup and half cup 2 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:34.030
 eggs and spices I used oregano 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.860
 thyme rosemary basil and pepper 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.560
 First we cut the cauliflower into small pieces 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.240
 and since it is clean and disinfected the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.860
 cusa in the food processor too 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.720
 can use the blender not 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.850
 worry let's process until 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.170
 it is as if we were cooked something else or 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.570
 less so 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.030
 and then we put our cauliflower in a 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.770
 kitchen cloth super clean and what 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.330
 Let's squeeze to remove the excess 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.649
 of water when we wash and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:06.369
 We disinfect the cauliflower in a bowl 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:11.459
 let's stir the egg and then 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.459
 with the cheese and we're going to keep mixing 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.540
 you can add a little bit of pepper and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.510
 If you feel that you also need a 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.790
 little pinch of salt and finally we emptied it 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.920
 in a mold and we postpone it super well 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:36.239
 it should look good and encimita 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.239
 we add the spices 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.670
 we're going to put this in the oven for 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.670
 about 30 minutes at 200 degrees centigrade 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.440
 and then we take it out and cut it in 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.850
 strips or in rectangles in squares 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.950
 as you prefer and I'm ready 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:05.120
 accompany with barbecue sauce but you 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:06.650
 they can put the dressing they prefer and 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.620
 the truth is that alone they also know 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:18.200
 very very rich I hope you prove them that 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:20.300
 tell me what you think and walk 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.610
 our tics are our little sticks 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.070
 cheese with cauliflower I find a very 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.020
 good option to botanize or for a 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.620
 lunch or something like that I think is super 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.690
 Rich to compare me with ranch with cats to use 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.670
 super rich can shield their 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.560
 friends when they prepare them if they have 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.510
