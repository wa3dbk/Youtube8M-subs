of<00:01:28.140> military<00:01:29.070> contact<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.810> really

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
of military contact and this is really

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.420

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
what has kept us going all these years

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.880 
what has kept us going all these years
and<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.810> that's<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> first<00:01:34.409> line<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> defense

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and so that's the first line of defense

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.399 
and so that's the first line of defense
and<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.520> sense<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.360> people<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.229> world

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and in a sense the people of the world

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.370 
and in a sense the people of the world
who<00:01:37.830> are<00:01:38.270> ninety-nine<00:01:39.270> percent<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:40.080> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
way instead of a destructive way and so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.190 
way instead of a destructive way and so
we<00:01:53.070> know<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.150> constituency<00:01:54.990> for
