west good options here real quick I once
there<00:03:28.300> I<00:03:28.330> just<00:03:28.630> changed<00:03:28.840> resolution<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.970> be

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
there I just changed resolution to be

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.560 
there I just changed resolution to be
the<00:03:31.180> optimal<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:36.700> actual<00:03:37.060> brightness<00:03:37.300> that

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
the optimal the actual brightness that

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:46.110 
the optimal the actual brightness that

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
I won't be able to run that so I'll show

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:09.110 
I won't be able to run that so I'll show
some<00:03:52.360> gameplay<00:03:53.110> here

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120
