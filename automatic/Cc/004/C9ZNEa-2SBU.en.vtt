00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
to ride check out the rest of this we're

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.180 
to ride check out the rest of this we're
gonna<00:00:36.899> give<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.260> opinions<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.100> we

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.530 

so<00:00:52.190> for<00:00:52.460> me<00:00:52.550> when<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.790> comes<00:00:52.910> down<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.420> the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
so for me when it comes down to the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.900 
so for me when it comes down to the
decision<00:00:53.989> between<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.410> 500<00:00:54.860> exe<00:00:55.220> and<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.430> 350

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
decision between the 500 exe and the 350

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.810 
decision between the 500 exe and the 350
I<00:00:55.940> take<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.390> 350<00:00:56.989> power<00:00:57.260> wise<00:00:57.560> the<00:00:57.770> 500<00:00:58.309> is<00:00:58.460> a

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
I take the 350 power wise the 500 is a

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.520 
I take the 350 power wise the 500 is a
beast<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.420> that's<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.870> good<00:00:59.989> thing<00:01:00.230> in<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.380> lot

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
beast and that's a good thing in a lot

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.110 
beast and that's a good thing in a lot
of<00:01:00.650> situations<00:01:00.830> you<00:01:01.370> know<00:01:01.489> it's<00:01:01.610> great<00:01:01.790> uphill

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
of situations you know it's great uphill

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.790 
of situations you know it's great uphill
climbs<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.629> everything<00:01:03.020> but<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.530> kind<00:01:03.710> of

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
climbs and everything but the kind of

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.680 
climbs and everything but the kind of
riding<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.129> do<00:01:04.190> which<00:01:04.580> is<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:04.820> lot<00:01:05.269> of<00:01:05.330> single

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
riding I do which is a lot of single

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.330 
riding I do which is a lot of single
track<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.140> just<00:01:06.200> low<00:01:06.410> speed<00:01:06.680> trail<00:01:06.890> riding

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
track and just low speed trail riding

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.010 
track and just low speed trail riding
I<00:01:07.460> think<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.880> 500<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.390> too<00:01:08.510> much<00:01:08.690> punch

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
I think the 500 is too much punch

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.080 
I think the 500 is too much punch
initially<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:09.979> I<00:01:10.400> kinda<00:01:10.670> don't<00:01:10.760> like<00:01:10.940> that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
initially and I kinda don't like that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.080 
initially and I kinda don't like that
it's<00:01:11.270> not<00:01:11.450> as<00:01:11.570> manageable<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.290> 350<00:01:12.890> but<00:01:13.190> 350<00:01:13.970> to

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
it's not as manageable so 350 but 350 to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.670 
it's not as manageable so 350 but 350 to
me<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.360> just<00:01:14.479> an<00:01:14.630> incredible<00:01:15.020> motor<00:01:15.229> package

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
me is just an incredible motor package

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.870 
me is just an incredible motor package
because<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.070> could<00:01:16.190> really<00:01:16.340> carry<00:01:16.640> a<00:01:16.700> lot<00:01:16.850> of

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
because you could really carry a lot of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.030 
because you could really carry a lot of
speed<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:17.509> still<00:01:18.229> has<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.560> torque<00:01:18.830> that<00:01:18.860> I

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
speed on it still has the torque that I

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.880 
speed on it still has the torque that I
want<00:01:19.310> but<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:20.000> not<00:01:20.150> too<00:01:20.450> much<00:01:20.630> my<00:01:21.530> favorite

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
want but it's not too much my favorite

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.609 
want but it's not too much my favorite
bike<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.820> two<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.330> 500<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.229> power

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
bike of the two is the 500 the power

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.310 
bike of the two is the 500 the power
delivery<00:01:24.950> on<00:01:25.130> both<00:01:25.310> is<00:01:25.520> really<00:01:25.820> smooth

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
delivery on both is really smooth

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.510 
delivery on both is really smooth
accelerates<00:01:27.320> up<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:27.680> can<00:01:27.800> chug<00:01:28.009> both<00:01:28.250> of<00:01:28.399> them

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
accelerates up you can chug both of them

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.719 
accelerates up you can chug both of them
but<00:01:28.790> for<00:01:29.030> me<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.509> 500<00:01:30.110> shines<00:01:30.649> because<00:01:30.950> I<00:01:31.430> can

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
but for me the 500 shines because I can

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.150 
but for me the 500 shines because I can
go<00:01:31.850> from<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.149> dead<00:01:32.300> stop<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.630> just<00:01:33.410> roll<00:01:33.830> on<00:01:34.039> the

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
go from a dead stop and just roll on the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.120 
go from a dead stop and just roll on the
power<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.789> thing<00:01:34.940> just<00:01:35.119> climbs<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:36.259> KTM

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
power and the thing just climbs the KTM

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.029 
power and the thing just climbs the KTM
350<00:01:37.789> was<00:01:38.119> manageable<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.649> has<00:01:39.770> enough

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
350 was manageable and it has enough

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.370 
350 was manageable and it has enough
power<00:01:40.070> for<00:01:40.520> me<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:41.030> 500<00:01:41.660> just<00:01:41.869> has<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.229> much

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
power for me the 500 just has so much

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.580 
power for me the 500 just has so much
power<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.729> 350<00:01:44.570> is<00:01:44.630> just<00:01:45.020> enough<00:01:45.289> power

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
power and the 350 is just enough power

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.639 
power and the 350 is just enough power
to<00:01:46.190> get<00:01:46.340> me<00:01:46.369> up<00:01:47.000> any<00:01:47.300> hill<00:01:47.600> I<00:01:47.630> wanted<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.320> get<00:01:48.500> up

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
to get me up any hill I wanted to get up

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.120 
to get me up any hill I wanted to get up
so<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.280> think<00:01:49.399> I'd<00:01:49.580> recommend<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.660> KTM<00:01:51.080> 350<00:01:51.800> to

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
so I think I'd recommend the KTM 350 to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.460 
so I think I'd recommend the KTM 350 to
any<00:01:52.550> of<00:01:52.700> my<00:01:52.759> girlfriends<00:01:53.420> that<00:01:53.630> ride<00:01:53.840> handling

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
any of my girlfriends that ride handling

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.889 
any of my girlfriends that ride handling
Juarez<00:01:54.950> they<00:01:55.100> felt<00:01:55.340> very<00:01:55.580> similar<00:01:56.390> I<00:01:56.599> would

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
Juarez they felt very similar I would

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.889 
Juarez they felt very similar I would
say<00:01:57.080> that<00:01:57.289> the<00:01:57.970> 350<00:01:58.970> kind<00:01:59.330> of<00:01:59.390> turned<00:01:59.660> down<00:01:59.869> a

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
say that the 350 kind of turned down a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.630 
say that the 350 kind of turned down a
little<00:02:00.110> easier<00:02:00.259> it's<00:02:00.679> easier<00:02:01.069> to<00:02:01.220> start<00:02:01.429> that

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
little easier it's easier to start that

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.760 
little easier it's easier to start that
lean<00:02:01.849> but<00:02:02.479> once<00:02:02.690> you're<00:02:02.869> turning<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:03.440> tight

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
lean but once you're turning and tight

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.520 
lean but once you're turning and tight
stuff<00:02:04.069> they<00:02:04.280> both<00:02:04.729> felt<00:02:05.000> pretty<00:02:05.179> good<00:02:05.360> I<00:02:05.599> would

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
stuff they both felt pretty good I would

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.760 
stuff they both felt pretty good I would
probably<00:02:06.800> buy<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.340> 500<00:02:08.090> because<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:09.140> know<00:02:09.349> that

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
probably buy the 500 because I know that

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.130 
probably buy the 500 because I know that
if<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:10.039> wanted<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.399> go<00:02:10.550> connect<00:02:11.209> trail<00:02:11.750> systems

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
if I wanted to go connect trail systems

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.500 
if I wanted to go connect trail systems
that<00:02:12.290> were<00:02:12.380> farther<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:13.010> would<00:02:13.250> be<00:02:13.580> better<00:02:14.000> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
that were farther it would be better the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.990 
that were farther it would be better the
street<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.140> can<00:02:15.410> ride<00:02:15.950> farther<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.550> hit<00:02:16.880> that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
street I can ride farther and hit that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.820 
street I can ride farther and hit that
sixth<00:02:17.510> gear<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.900> just<00:02:18.050> cruise<00:02:18.500> down<00:02:18.740> the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
sixth gear and just cruise down the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.040 
sixth gear and just cruise down the
highway<00:02:19.130> easier<00:02:19.849> than<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.330> 350<00:02:20.810> without

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
highway easier than the 350 without

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.080 
highway easier than the 350 without
wringing<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.440> out<00:02:21.530> if<00:02:22.520> I<00:02:22.640> was<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:22.970> spend

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
wringing it out if I was going to spend

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.490 
wringing it out if I was going to spend
a<00:02:23.209> lot<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.420> time<00:02:23.660> on<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.900> freeway<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.200> lot<00:02:24.380> of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
a lot of time on the freeway a lot of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.440 
a lot of time on the freeway a lot of
time<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.770> dirt<00:02:24.950> roads<00:02:25.250> kind<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.730> going<00:02:25.940> fast

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
time on dirt roads kind of going fast

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.320 
time on dirt roads kind of going fast

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
but in the end of the 350 is so good for

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.110 
but in the end of the 350 is so good for
a<00:02:32.180> guy<00:02:32.590> 175<00:02:33.590> pounds<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.160> lighter<00:02:34.370> I'm<00:02:34.910> only
