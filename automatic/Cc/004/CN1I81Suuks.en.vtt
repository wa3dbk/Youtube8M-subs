00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.260 

simplifying<00:00:05.250> square<00:00:05.550> roots<00:00:07.969> here<00:00:08.969> we<00:00:09.120> have<00:00:09.240> a

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
simplifying square roots here we have a

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.570 
simplifying square roots here we have a
selection<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.960> square<00:00:10.559> roots<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.190> we're

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
selection of square roots and we're

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.090 
selection of square roots and we're
going<00:00:11.789> to<00:00:11.879> write<00:00:12.119> them<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.590> simplest<00:00:13.590> radical

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
going to write them in simplest radical

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.430 
going to write them in simplest radical
form<00:00:15.020> so<00:00:16.340> taking<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> look<00:00:17.430> at<00:00:17.780> the<00:00:18.780> square<00:00:19.260> root

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
form so taking a look at the square root

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.830 
form so taking a look at the square root
of<00:00:19.590> 12<00:00:20.420> we<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:22.340> prime<00:00:23.340> factor<00:00:24.090> 12<00:00:24.720> into<00:00:25.560> say<00:00:25.950> 3

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
of 12 we can prime factor 12 into say 3

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.529 
of 12 we can prime factor 12 into say 3
times<00:00:27.840> 4<00:00:30.080> 3<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.260> prime<00:00:31.530> number<00:00:31.789> 4<00:00:32.789> factors

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
times 4 3 is a prime number 4 factors

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.640 
times 4 3 is a prime number 4 factors
into<00:00:33.840> 2<00:00:34.050> times<00:00:34.770> 2<00:00:36.079> that<00:00:37.079> means<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
into 2 times 2 that means that the

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.639 
into 2 times 2 that means that the
square<00:00:37.890> root<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.280> 12<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:39.060> be<00:00:39.210> written<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
square root of 12 can be written as the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.420 
square root of 12 can be written as the
square<00:00:41.100> root<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:42.380> 3<00:00:43.380> times<00:00:43.739> 2<00:00:44.310> times<00:00:44.820> 2<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:47.280> we

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
square root of 3 times 2 times 2 but we

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
square root of 3 times 2 times 2 but we
know<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.540> square<00:00:48.840> root<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> 2<00:00:49.230> times<00:00:49.500> 2

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
know what the square root of 2 times 2

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.500 
know what the square root of 2 times 2
is<00:00:51.530> 2<00:00:52.530> times<00:00:52.829> 2<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.340> another<00:00:53.579> way<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> writing<00:00:54.030> 4

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
is 2 times 2 is another way of writing 4

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.870 
is 2 times 2 is another way of writing 4
and<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.950> square<00:00:56.070> root<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.520> 4<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.180> 2<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
and the square root of 4 is 2 so the

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.819 
and the square root of 4 is 2 so the
square<00:01:00.149> root<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> 2<00:01:00.450> times<00:01:00.480> 2<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.579> 2<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:04.559> square

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:04.829 
square root of 2 times 2 is 2 the square

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:07.190 
square root of 2 times 2 is 2 the square
root<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> 3<00:01:05.219> is<00:01:05.369> an<00:01:05.519> irrational<00:01:05.909> number<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
root of 3 is an irrational number so

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.260 
root of 3 is an irrational number so
we're<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.709> leave<00:01:08.009> it<00:01:08.219> inside<00:01:08.459> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
we're going to leave it inside the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.399 
we're going to leave it inside the
square<00:01:09.539> root<00:01:09.719> sign<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.450> simplest<00:01:12.929> radical

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
square root sign so the simplest radical

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.179 
square root sign so the simplest radical
form<00:01:13.679> of<00:01:13.859> the<00:01:13.950> square<00:01:14.280> root<00:01:14.399> of<00:01:14.429> 12<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:15.709> 2<00:01:16.709> times

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
form of the square root of 12 is 2 times

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.199 
form of the square root of 12 is 2 times
the<00:01:17.520> square<00:01:17.999> root<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.539> 3<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:22.560> let's<00:01:22.770> look<00:01:22.950> at

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:23.209 
the square root of 3 now let's look at

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:27.910 
the square root of 3 now let's look at
problem<00:01:24.209> B<00:01:25.909> we<00:01:26.909> should<00:01:27.179> pretty<00:01:27.420> well<00:01:27.659> know

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
problem B we should pretty well know

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.969 
problem B we should pretty well know
that<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.130> square<00:01:29.399> root<00:01:29.429> of<00:01:29.549> 36<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> 6<00:01:30.859> but<00:01:31.859> if

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that the square root of 36 is 6 but if

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.489 
that the square root of 36 is 6 but if
this<00:01:32.130> method<00:01:32.399> is<00:01:32.700> any<00:01:33.240> good<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.599> all<00:01:33.719> it<00:01:34.109> should

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:34.499 
this method is any good at all it should

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:37.940 
this method is any good at all it should
get<00:01:34.889> us<00:01:35.069> that<00:01:35.279> same<00:01:35.609> answer<00:01:36.029> so<00:01:36.959> doing<00:01:37.679> it<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
get us that same answer so doing it the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.690 
get us that same answer so doing it the
same<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:39.469> prime<00:01:40.469> factor<00:01:41.179> 6<00:01:42.179> times<00:01:42.630> 6<00:01:43.369> 3<00:01:44.369> times

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
same way prime factor 6 times 6 3 times

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.969 
same way prime factor 6 times 6 3 times
2<00:01:45.259> 3<00:01:46.259> times<00:01:46.619> 2<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.899> square<00:01:49.139> root<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.259> 36<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
2 3 times 2 so the square root of 36 is

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.690 
2 3 times 2 so the square root of 36 is
also<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.149> square<00:01:51.509> root<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.779> 3<00:01:52.349> times<00:01:52.709> 2<00:01:53.219> times

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
also the square root of 3 times 2 times

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.980 
also the square root of 3 times 2 times
3<00:01:54.329> times<00:01:54.359> 2

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260 

but<00:01:58.650> we<00:01:58.770> know<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.580> square<00:01:59.880> root<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.030> 3

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
but we know what the square root of 3

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.840 
but we know what the square root of 3
times<00:02:00.420> 3<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.590> square<00:02:01.770> root<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.010> 3<00:02:02.220> times<00:02:02.520> 3

can be further prime factored into 2
times<00:02:50.880> 3<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.440> square<00:02:52.739> root<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:52.890> 42<00:02:53.459> is

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
times 3 so the square root of 42 is

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.059 
times 3 so the square root of 42 is
equal<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:55.200> square<00:02:55.590> root<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:56.750> 2<00:02:57.750> times<00:02:58.080> 3

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
equal to the square root of 2 times 3

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.539 
equal to the square root of 2 times 3
times<00:02:59.700> 7

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
times 7

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.900 
times 7
well<00:03:02.549> let's<00:03:03.299> prime<00:03:03.540> factored<00:03:04.049> and<00:03:04.760> there<00:03:05.760> are

nothing more to be done with this the

nothing more to be done with this the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.400 

now<00:03:30.310> let's<00:03:30.520> look<00:03:30.700> at<00:03:30.880> three<00:03:31.690> other<00:03:31.870> problems

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
now let's look at three other problems

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.700 
now let's look at three other problems
that<00:03:32.820> don't<00:03:33.820> have<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.480> leading<00:03:35.080> coefficient<00:03:35.200> of

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
that don't have a leading coefficient of

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.680 
that don't have a leading coefficient of
one<00:03:35.950> leading<00:03:36.850> coefficient<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:38.110> three<00:03:39.690> well

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
one leading coefficient is a three well

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.930 
one leading coefficient is a three well
we<00:03:40.810> start<00:03:41.080> out<00:03:41.200> by<00:03:41.230> doing<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.770> exactly<00:03:42.190> the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
we start out by doing it exactly the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.480 
we start out by doing it exactly the
same<00:03:43.210> way<00:03:44.580> we<00:03:45.580> prime<00:03:45.850> factor<00:03:46.300> 18<00:03:47.040> which<00:03:48.040> is<00:03:48.220> 2

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
same way we prime factor 18 which is 2

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:56.850 
same way we prime factor 18 which is 2
times<00:03:48.910> 9<00:03:49.770> 9<00:03:50.770> is<00:03:51.450> 3<00:03:52.450> times<00:03:52.600> 3<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:55.030> 3<00:03:55.930> times<00:03:56.290> the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
times 9 9 is 3 times 3 so 3 times the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.390 
times 9 9 is 3 times 3 so 3 times the
square<00:03:57.010> root<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.310> 18<00:03:57.730> is<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:59.140> same<00:03:59.410> as<00:03:59.709> 3<00:04:00.130> times

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
square root of 18 is the same as 3 times

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:11.550 
square root of 18 is the same as 3 times
the<00:04:01.560> square<00:04:02.560> root<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.890> 2<00:04:03.250> times<00:04:03.790> 3<00:04:04.330> times<00:04:04.360> 3<00:04:10.560> but

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
the square root of 2 times 3 times 3 but

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.510 
the square root of 2 times 3 times 3 but
we<00:04:11.650> know<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:12.610> square<00:04:12.880> root<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.030> 3<00:04:13.270> times<00:04:13.450> 3<00:04:13.840> is

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
we know the square root of 3 times 3 is

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.180 
we know the square root of 3 times 3 is
3<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:16.810> that's<00:04:17.140> going<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.590> be<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.769> 3<00:04:18.100> times<00:04:20.190> there

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
3 so that's going to be a 3 times there

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.020 
3 so that's going to be a 3 times there
was<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.340> 3<00:04:21.930> already<00:04:22.930> out<00:04:23.140> front<00:04:23.850> times<00:04:24.850> the

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
was a 3 already out front times the

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.240 
was a 3 already out front times the
square<00:04:25.330> root<00:04:25.360> of<00:04:25.650> 2<00:04:28.590> doesn't<00:04:29.590> pair<00:04:29.800> up<00:04:29.919> nicely

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
square root of 2 doesn't pair up nicely

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.930 
square root of 2 doesn't pair up nicely
so<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:31.740> final<00:04:32.740> answer<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:33.220> 3<00:04:33.700> times<00:04:33.910> 3<00:04:34.200> 9<00:04:35.940> times

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
so the final answer is 3 times 3 9 times

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.060 
so the final answer is 3 times 3 9 times
the<00:04:37.180> square<00:04:37.660> root<00:04:37.690> of<00:04:37.900> 2

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.030 

now<00:04:46.070> here<00:04:46.310> are<00:04:46.400> two<00:04:46.580> more<00:04:47.800> why<00:04:48.800> don't<00:04:48.950> you

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
now here are two more why don't you

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.240 
now here are two more why don't you
pause<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.670> video<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.320> give<00:04:51.320> those<00:04:51.530> two<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> try

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
pause the video and give those two a try

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.510 
pause the video and give those two a try
on<00:04:52.520> your<00:04:53.180> own<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.950> then<00:04:54.950> we'll<00:04:55.010> come<00:04:55.190> back<00:04:55.370> and

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
on your own and then we'll come back and

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.890 
on your own and then we'll come back and
check<00:04:55.580> them

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.240 

all<00:05:03.900> right<00:05:04.140> let's<00:05:04.620> try<00:05:04.890> these<00:05:06.770> we<00:05:07.770> know<00:05:07.950> that

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
all right let's try these we know that

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.110 
all right let's try these we know that
this<00:05:08.640> is<00:05:08.880> going<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.210> be<00:05:09.360> five<00:05:10.140> times<00:05:11.120> square

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
this is going to be five times square

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.150 
this is going to be five times square

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
root of something we have to figure out

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.790 
root of something we have to figure out
what<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:15.030> prime<00:05:15.300> factorization<00:05:16.110> of<00:05:16.170> 48<00:05:16.380> is

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
what the prime factorization of 48 is

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.440 
what the prime factorization of 48 is

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
first so this is 6 times 8 6 is 2 times

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.810 
first so this is 6 times 8 6 is 2 times
3<00:05:22.020> 8<00:05:22.860> is<00:05:23.190> 2<00:05:23.460> times<00:05:23.490> 4<00:05:24.740> which<00:05:25.740> is<00:05:25.770> 2<00:05:26.190> times<00:05:26.490> 2

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
3 8 is 2 times 4 which is 2 times 2

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.060 
3 8 is 2 times 4 which is 2 times 2

look for pairs our answer is going to be

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.880 
look for pairs our answer is going to be
5<00:05:52.800> times<00:05:54.230> let's<00:05:55.230> see<00:05:56.630> there's<00:05:57.630> a<00:05:57.750> pair<00:05:58.110> of<00:05:58.230> twos

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.510 

there's<00:06:01.890> another<00:06:02.310> pair<00:06:02.700> of<00:06:02.850> twos<00:06:03.180> and<00:06:04.520> that's

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
there's another pair of twos and that's

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.230 
there's another pair of twos and that's
going<00:06:05.730> to<00:06:05.850> leave<00:06:06.030> us<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:07.500> lone<00:06:08.120> square<00:06:09.120> root

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
going to leave us the lone square root

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.330 
going to leave us the lone square root
of<00:06:09.330> 3<00:06:09.600> inside<00:06:10.640> 5<00:06:11.640> times<00:06:11.970> 2<00:06:12.180> is<00:06:12.210> 10<00:06:12.770> times<00:06:13.770> 2<00:06:14.130> is

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
of 3 inside 5 times 2 is 10 times 2 is

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:22.810 
of 3 inside 5 times 2 is 10 times 2 is
20<00:06:16.070> 20<00:06:17.070> square<00:06:18.030> root<00:06:18.210> 3

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.580 

now<00:06:23.360> let's<00:06:23.630> try<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:25.490> do<00:06:25.640> the<00:06:25.790> next<00:06:26.590> should

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
now let's try and do the next should

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.020 
now let's try and do the next should
have<00:06:27.680> left<00:06:27.890> a<00:06:28.010> little<00:06:28.250> more<00:06:28.370> space<00:06:28.610> here<00:06:28.880> I'm

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
have left a little more space here I'm

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:36.190 
have left a little more space here I'm
sorry<00:06:30.460> so<00:06:33.850> this<00:06:34.850> is<00:06:35.060> going<00:06:35.270> to<00:06:35.360> be<00:06:35.480> six<00:06:35.870> times

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
sorry so this is going to be six times

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.490 
sorry so this is going to be six times

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
factorization of 150 is now we should be

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.080 
factorization of 150 is now we should be
good<00:06:42.140> enough<00:06:42.170> at<00:06:42.590> this<00:06:42.770> to<00:06:43.430> do<00:06:43.580> a<00:06:43.610> little<00:06:43.910> bit

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
good enough at this to do a little bit

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.530 
good enough at this to do a little bit
of<00:06:44.120> prime<00:06:44.390> factorization<00:06:45.200> in<00:06:45.350> our<00:06:45.470> head<00:06:46.540> 150
