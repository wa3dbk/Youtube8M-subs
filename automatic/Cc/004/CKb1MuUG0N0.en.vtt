first plane of this Bloodgood I was a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.380 
first plane of this Bloodgood I was a
little<00:02:53.770> skeptical<00:02:54.130> of<00:02:54.430> where<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:54.880> was<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:55.300> to

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
put it so what I did was I planted the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.180 
put it so what I did was I planted the
