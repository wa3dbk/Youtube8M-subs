00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.280
 some upset within disappointment 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.700
 now a bit above 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.790
 yes yes yes we will go back to tomorrow 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.839
 bake against twente so no that just go 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.630
 again 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.330
 between atmosphere now in the group good because the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.810
 despite being out of the cup final or 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.010
 from passionate we are now baker yes 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.340
 know that they must focus on the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.500
 competition and since game I am there 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.239
 makes me not worry about that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.730
 yes we designed to the i am also the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.950
 above that prank should say fairly quickly 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.260
 it was up to ourselves we have had to 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.670
 goals make at least 5 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.250
 we give it, we really have no chance away 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.600
 but three goals and if we have that too 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.469
 get out and we start really well 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.840
 to be because I find that one 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.489
 fantastic that we played a 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.430
 have an evening camp here you stand 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.920
 you along with our trail so yes that one 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.410
 to not happened often and the atmosphere 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.180
 there is also b20a in the stadium 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.949
 that if you sit there on the field that is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 that is unbelievable what happened and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.390
 dimension jump there and then he is 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.460
 just not normal that was 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 wonderful to experience only yes then 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.700
 you lose the game and then again 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.930
 standing ovation crainer that is typical 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.729
 cambuur so it reminds me again 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.110
 good and people recognize how to play 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 and they stand behind it as your polders 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.850
 that is for our staff and players though 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.720
 important many boys have 120 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.540
 minutes in the legs 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.060
 how do you change the preparation 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.220
 we released the day and we had to 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.990
 we coached something else through it 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.829
 winter situation it the snow we had 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.939
 first off 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.650
 it was slippery so we got something 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.810
 otherwise there is training there is good 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 but also because of tell I have them the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.740
 The images show fernando 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 Ricksen we showed eh yes that 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.689
 do you want to walk we heard very fast 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.689
 so we don't talk about that 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.530
 and that is the power of fc twente of fc 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.159
 twente 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.880
 I think they also walk a lot 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.780
 walking people have got them right 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.950
 soccer team with who always try 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.369
 to think a step further than one 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.370
 opponent and yes you go 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.710
 to combat 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.050
 you play great alone lee 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.630
 often forget to score 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.390
 yes yes that is true that they are good 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.690
 observation here I yes I train myself 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.920
 also with beer and other spiers on the 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.540
 finish 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.760
 he doesn't like it in the training sessions 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.280
 but yes in the match now too 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.900
 to you might be a kind of pressure was only 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.490
 I think we don't worry about that 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.390
 have to make because we create enough 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.060
 opportunities 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.560
 is that a piece of stress or cell? 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.080
 well for me only for myself 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.260
 talk in that respect for myself 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.330
 don't always try it yes in the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.460
 shoot from the goalkeeper 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.680
 and yes last Tuesday tackled yes from 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.390
 zwolle picked up after just a few balls 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.780
 of which I thought well he doesn't 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.940
 more often more so yes spend being ready 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.680

 trainer think that is going to lose or like 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.910

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.110
 we are going to win and then we see 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.239
 after 19 minutes 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.620

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.870

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.820
