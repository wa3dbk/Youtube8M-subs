00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.420 
pair of boots on it was a really good
race<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.900> ever<00:02:51.230> since<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:51.680> I've<00:02:51.950> always<00:02:52.130> used

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
race so ever since then I've always used

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.949

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
evolving the bike and evolving the bike

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.450 
evolving the bike and evolving the bike
so<00:04:59.520> so<00:05:00.240> yeah<00:05:00.450> it's<00:05:00.660> it's<00:05:01.170> sort<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.950> me<00:05:02.100> but<00:05:02.310> it's
