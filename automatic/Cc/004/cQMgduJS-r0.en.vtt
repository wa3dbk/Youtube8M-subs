okay we are now gonna try to restore a
very<00:00:19.570> faded<00:00:20.140> area<00:00:20.590> on<00:00:20.770> this<00:00:20.920> RV<00:00:21.279> we<00:00:21.460> did<00:00:21.580> a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
very faded area on this RV we did a

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.100 
very faded area on this RV we did a
white<00:00:21.850> area<00:00:22.060> earlier<00:00:22.480> which<00:00:22.600> is<00:00:22.720> you<00:00:22.990> know

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
white area earlier which is you know

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.410 
white area earlier which is you know
turned<00:00:23.590> out<00:00:23.680> very<00:00:23.710> well<00:00:23.890> but<00:00:24.790> this<00:00:24.910> is<00:00:24.970> really

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
turned out very well but this is really

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.999 
turned out very well but this is really
faded<00:00:25.630> I<00:00:25.840> think<00:00:26.110> so<00:00:26.320> we're<00:00:26.439> gonna<00:00:26.529> give<00:00:26.710> a<00:00:26.830> shot

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
faded I think so we're gonna give a shot

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.870 
faded I think so we're gonna give a shot
and<00:00:27.160> see<00:00:27.220> what<00:00:27.430> happens

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
and see what happens

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.390 
and see what happens
every<00:00:28.630> every<00:00:28.990> I<00:00:29.140> tell<00:00:29.380> people<00:00:29.619> you<00:00:29.919> know<00:00:30.040> every

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
every every I tell people you know every

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.369 
every every I tell people you know every
vehicle<00:00:31.270> is<00:00:31.570> different<00:00:31.779> you<00:00:32.050> just<00:00:32.199> really

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
vehicle is different you just really

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.689 
vehicle is different you just really
doesn't<00:00:32.529> know<00:00:32.680> what's<00:00:32.949> gonna<00:00:33.100> happen<00:00:33.280> let's

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
doesn't know what's gonna happen let's

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.759 
doesn't know what's gonna happen let's
put<00:00:34.210> this<00:00:34.330> on<00:00:34.480> there<00:00:34.690> but<00:00:34.840> we<00:00:35.320> expect<00:00:35.650> this<00:00:35.710> to

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
put this on there but we expect this to

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.400 
put this on there but we expect this to
be<00:00:35.860> restored<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.580> like<00:00:36.699> new<00:00:36.910> condition

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
be restored to the like new condition

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.689 
be restored to the like new condition
I've<00:00:38.410> already<00:00:38.620> seen<00:00:38.800> some<00:00:39.010> tremendous<00:00:39.190> color

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
I've already seen some tremendous color

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.470 
I've already seen some tremendous color
differences<00:00:40.559> already<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:43.090> so<00:00:43.210> this<00:00:43.360> is

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
differences already and so this is

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.900 
differences already and so this is
probably<00:00:43.720> what<00:00:43.870> this<00:00:43.960> piece<00:00:44.440> looked<00:00:44.710> like<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
probably what this piece looked like and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.210 
probably what this piece looked like and
it<00:00:46.030> was<00:00:46.120> first<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.500> can<00:00:47.620> see<00:00:47.739> I'm<00:00:47.830> pulling<00:00:48.100> off

I<00:01:42.360> was<00:01:42.510> saying<00:01:42.720> earlier<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.290> want<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.500> do

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
I was saying earlier is you want to do

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.950 
I was saying earlier is you want to do
that<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.190> process<00:01:44.730> until<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.630> stop

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
that to this process until you stop

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.780 
that to this process until you stop
pulling<00:01:46.200> off<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> lot<00:01:46.800> of<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.040> blue<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> if

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
pulling off a lot of this blue if you if

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.010 
pulling off a lot of this blue if you if
you<00:01:47.910> stop<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> middle<00:01:48.480> of<00:01:48.660> this<00:01:48.810> you're

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you stop in the middle of this you're

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.770 
you stop in the middle of this you're
leaving<00:01:49.790> colder<00:01:50.790> oxidized<00:01:51.180> paint<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.600> there

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
leaving colder oxidized paint on there

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.880 
leaving colder oxidized paint on there
it<00:01:51.930> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.170> defeating<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> purpose<00:01:52.650> of

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it kind of defeating the purpose of

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.950 
it kind of defeating the purpose of
doing<00:01:52.980> this<00:01:53.160> process<00:01:53.390> now<00:01:54.390> sometimes<00:01:54.870> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
doing this process now sometimes it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.050 
doing this process now sometimes it
takes<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.230> while<00:01:55.460> I'm<00:01:56.460> surprised<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.850> we're

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
takes a while I'm surprised that we're

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.310 
takes a while I'm surprised that we're
only<00:01:57.150> pulling<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> blue<00:01:57.840> moon<00:01:57.900> not<00:01:58.140> this

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
only pulling up the blue moon not this

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.380 
only pulling up the blue moon not this
brown<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.250> actually<00:01:59.790> thought<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.150> red

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
brown I actually thought it was red

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.730 
brown I actually thought it was red
early<00:02:00.690> but<00:02:00.870> it's<00:02:00.960> actually<00:02:01.230> brown<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
early but it's actually brown on the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.090 
early but it's actually brown on the
bottom<00:02:01.860> here<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.600> blue<00:02:03.870> is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
bottom here and this blue is

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.770 
bottom here and this blue is
we're<00:02:06.580> pulling<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.940> most<00:02:07.150> us<00:02:07.390> because<00:02:07.659> the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
we're pulling it most us because the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.460 
we're pulling it most us because the
dark<00:02:08.020> color<00:02:08.350> absorbs<00:02:08.920> more<00:02:09.100> UV<00:02:09.399> rays<00:02:10.230> I'm<00:02:11.230> very

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
dark color absorbs more UV rays I'm very

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.440 
dark color absorbs more UV rays I'm very
right<00:02:11.680> about<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.040> but<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.060> pulled<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.330> little

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
right about that but I pulled a little

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.660 
right about that but I pulled a little
bit<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.750> red<00:02:13.930> here<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.620> top<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.459> more

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
bit of the red here on the top and more

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.310 
bit of the red here on the top and more
blue<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.180> I'm<00:02:16.240> gonna<00:02:16.330> flip<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.570> over<00:02:16.750> cleaner

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
blue so I'm gonna flip it over cleaner

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.390 
blue so I'm gonna flip it over cleaner
area<00:02:17.940> little<00:02:18.940> dab<00:02:19.120> polish<00:02:19.890> again<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.190> get<00:02:21.280> this

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
area little dab polish again to get this

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.870 
area little dab polish again to get this
back

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
back

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.650 
back
this<00:02:22.120> was<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.300> 1970<00:02:23.020> X<00:02:23.140> we're<00:02:23.260> talking<00:02:24.120> 30<00:02:25.120> 30

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
this was a 1970 X we're talking 30 30

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.490 
this was a 1970 X we're talking 30 30
some<00:02:25.870> years<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.810> know<00:02:28.900> exposure<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
some years of you know exposure to the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.860 
some years of you know exposure to the
Sun<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.610> not<00:02:30.760> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.000> come<00:02:31.209> back<00:02:31.510> to

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
Sun so it's not going to come back to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.230 
Sun so it's not going to come back to
new<00:02:32.050> in<00:02:32.830> two<00:02:33.100> minutes<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.850> please<00:02:34.060> don't

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
new in two minutes so please don't

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.830 
new in two minutes so please don't
expect<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:35.130> but<00:02:36.130> once<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:37.000> do<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.690> will

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
expect that but once you do this it will

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.660 
expect that but once you do this it will
be<00:02:37.930> protected<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.220> won't<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.520> do

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670

be protected and you won't have to do
this<00:02:39.820> type<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.060> intense<00:02:40.510> work<00:02:41.010> very<00:02:42.010> often

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
this type of intense work very often

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.620 
this type of intense work very often
maybe<00:02:42.459> once<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.820> year<00:02:42.850> maybe<00:02:43.120> once<00:02:43.239> every<00:02:43.420> two

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
maybe once a year maybe once every two

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.030 
maybe once a year maybe once every two
years<00:02:43.660> depending<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.440> how<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.590> use<00:02:44.890> it

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
years depending on how you use it

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.360 
years depending on how you use it
depending<00:02:45.870> what<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.050> exposed<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:48.280> I'm

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
depending what it's exposed to but I'm

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.790 
depending what it's exposed to but I'm
still<00:02:48.610> pulling<00:02:48.790> up<00:02:49.060> blue

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.100 

I'm<00:02:56.220> glad<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.460> didn't<00:02:57.210> expect<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.720> thought<00:02:57.930> this

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
I'm glad I didn't expect I thought this

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.950 
I'm glad I didn't expect I thought this
might<00:02:58.290> be<00:02:58.350> more<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:59.330> contrast<00:03:00.330> but<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.720> blue

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
might be more of a contrast but the blue

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.790 
might be more of a contrast but the blue
is<00:03:00.990> really<00:03:02.570> amazingly<00:03:03.570> coming<00:03:04.410> back<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.770> a

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
is really amazingly coming back to a

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.280 
is really amazingly coming back to a
really<00:03:04.980> deep<00:03:05.340> dark<00:03:05.610> blue<00:03:05.940> versus<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> faded

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
really deep dark blue versus the faded

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.199 
really deep dark blue versus the faded
blue<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.680> was

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.030 

and<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.569> change<00:03:12.870> rags<00:03:13.140> again<00:03:13.379> or<00:03:13.799> change

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
and you change rags again or change

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.940 
and you change rags again or change
sides<00:03:14.280> again<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.049> somewhat<00:03:16.379> cleaner<00:03:16.650> spot

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
sides again on the somewhat cleaner spot

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.899 
sides again on the somewhat cleaner spot
because<00:03:19.950> if<00:03:20.069> you<00:03:20.159> stop<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.519> middle<00:03:20.579> then

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
because if you stop in the middle then

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.280 
because if you stop in the middle then
you're<00:03:21.030> leaving<00:03:21.150> half<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.719> contaminants

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
you're leaving half of the contaminants

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.270 
you're leaving half of the contaminants
on<00:03:22.379> there<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.680> kind<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:22.920> defeating<00:03:23.219> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
on there and kind of defeating the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.130 
on there and kind of defeating the
purpose<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:23.730> while<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.599> is<00:03:24.629> a<00:03:24.750> bit<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.019> work

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
purpose so while it is a bit of work

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.399 
purpose so while it is a bit of work
initially<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.819> results<00:03:27.359> will<00:03:27.689> last<00:03:28.049> for<00:03:28.349> a

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
initially the results will last for a

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.589 
initially the results will last for a
long<00:03:28.439> time<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.010> you'll<00:03:29.099> be<00:03:29.189> much<00:03:29.430> happier

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
long time and you'll be much happier

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.849 
long time and you'll be much happier
knowing<00:03:30.599> you've<00:03:30.810> really<00:03:31.049> done<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.379> real<00:03:31.590> deal

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
knowing you've really done the real deal

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.030 
knowing you've really done the real deal
versus<00:03:32.639> halfway<00:03:33.079> those<00:03:34.079> tire<00:03:34.349> marks<00:03:34.739> when<00:03:34.889> we

versus halfway those tire marks when we

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.679 
versus halfway those tire marks when we
think<00:03:35.519> is<00:03:35.579> a<00:03:35.730> bicycle<00:03:36.060> guitar<00:03:36.269> it's<00:03:36.389> probably

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
think is a bicycle guitar it's probably

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:37.699 
think is a bicycle guitar it's probably
not<00:03:36.780> gonna<00:03:36.900> come<00:03:36.959> out<00:03:37.170> with<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.439> Phil<00:03:37.620> it

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
not gonna come out with you Phil it

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.349 
not gonna come out with you Phil it
works<00:03:37.889> they've<00:03:38.639> actually<00:03:38.819> look<00:03:39.060> like<00:03:39.180> they've

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
works they've actually look like they've

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.790 
works they've actually look like they've
rubbed<00:03:40.079> back<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.409> abs<00:03:40.530> with<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.739> base

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.110 

and<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.250> believe<00:03:45.490> some<00:03:45.700> of<00:03:45.730> this<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.060> I'm

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
and I believe some of this and I'm

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.790 
and I believe some of this and I'm
getting<00:03:46.210> off<00:03:46.450> now<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:47.050> actually<00:03:47.350> from<00:03:47.740> the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
getting off now is actually from the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.990 
getting off now is actually from the
edges<00:03:48.190> where<00:03:48.280> I'm<00:03:48.400> kind<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.700> hitting<00:03:48.850> the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
edges where I'm kind of hitting the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.500 
edges where I'm kind of hitting the
edges<00:03:49.330> but<00:03:49.960> the<00:03:50.140> main<00:03:50.500> area<00:03:50.710> that<00:03:50.740> I'm<00:03:50.890> working

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
edges but the main area that I'm working

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.530 
edges but the main area that I'm working
has<00:03:52.510> really

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
has really

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:05.100 
has really
improve<00:03:55.170> itself

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:19.099 

it's<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.770> little<00:04:06.040> bit<00:04:06.130> less<00:04:06.310> now
