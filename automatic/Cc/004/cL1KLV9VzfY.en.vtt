00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.849
 my background that percent is building the normal school 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.289
 not at midnight 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.410
 Computer Science studies September 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.319
 Eva Lichtenberger worked 

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.189
 on 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.640
 9 one believes but hapless is actually complete 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.400
 to clarify scorer 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.580
 Diddy p 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.680
 otherwise, constantly brewing with InDesign with coach BZ actually did out 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.250
 that is to say, there is a certain tendency towards the graphic 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.290
 he cleanses origin 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.750
 by Maren Martell 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.300
 which in the end I think that's it 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.010
 every job 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.590
 must be found in Prüm son 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.810
 the perpetrators before 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.830
 But what Monti immediately does is also different kinds of creativity 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.460
 "That does not mean anyone in any creative way does that 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 To cheat tax office is far from a good draftsman 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.680
 Nevertheless, the creative ideas are what you do 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.030
 around 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 this means 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.150
 Most computer people most places the Ditib really recognizes in here 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.400
 have the computer out of passion 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.730
 around 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.220
 a project of the keyboardist 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.380
 came 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.850
 from and one 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.840
 of these worlds 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.140
 and my dad always said there are three drives all three reasons for what 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.619
 do 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:39.530
 around 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.690
 watch or make money » 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.210
 that was so nice that a teacher has already told you so who of so 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.940
 impressed 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.810
 that is obviously very impressed Olmert has tried the team 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.810
 enter 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.080
 So in my opinion, I'm doing a lot of timing 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.590
 So I can not be completely satisfied with these three because I'm over the top 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 Athenians could almost exist 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.759
 I am doing things that make the play "Rain of these three reasons 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.599
 around the company good 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.429
 the topic is fourth 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.469
 Drive way to magic 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.790
 that's the children leaving the crisis animal what's up the nail 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.749
 the head 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.819
 because it's the stuff you do that makes the Hammers magical 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.439
 Although, for example, know the absolutely magical tied in her 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.209
 Blog 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.189
 and added something on it 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.859
 and you're a reporter of data 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.069
 around 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.659
 and in this area of ​​ver di 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 there is nothing at first and would have been different 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339
 and in that role that has that's just that that's what they do 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.790
 no matter what you do, no matter what 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.199
 with breathing 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.219
 No matter if you are using extra to zero processes 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.619
 no matter if you write a program no matter if you title climate whatever 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.269
 you basically catch it with you 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.539
 In terms of percentage, a neighboring area is an incredibly complex building block 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.509
 in Innichen lego building blocks or Ultra complex house 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.729
 so it uses on customers due to the always a bite 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:10.310
 used these building blocks 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.149
 and to create something that was not there before 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.080
 and 2 so it is almost a 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.719
 Creating original ones, he told the dpa 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.809
 and percent of what funds are used in the Computer Club or what funds 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:23.519
 ever used to create that 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.510
 Later, it does not matter so much that it's their request from Compellent or 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.539
 around question from a tilt 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:31.879
 and in that year 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.279
 most of the computer people I know float on this magical wave 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.029
 and to use this point even further 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.839
 I'm not a professional dad I do not know all the tricks I love my 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:46.019
 Drawings are 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.909
 so a pro of copts probably i hate to nose under 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:50.539
 water 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:54.989
 Pearson made mistakes and that does not happen so that's been proven 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:56.759
 around 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:59.759
 but my impression is that it does not matter 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.109
 for the average person, it's not about signing up on the profile 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.669
 and then i started to look at the drawn i here are there 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.659
 at the moment it was not guaranteed to draw so drew cartoons 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.379
 Cartoons made easy by come 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:19.590
 and made by professionals if you do not do anything the whole day 

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:24.110
 who have no idea what it's like if you have not been since 20 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.840
 Years shows 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.960
 and even if Latvia have 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.480
 but it's true what I've seen Wrinkles Wine Book 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.070
 where the first 50 pages I believe were exercise around the artisans too 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.219
 get 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.830
 if I have a teacher like that 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.289
 has the class immediately that is not that quiet there I know I mean mine 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.939
 Hand loose I want 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.719
 I feel the need to excel 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.779
 please tell me how to do it 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.750
 the premiums paperwork real carries light art 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.240
 do so but 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.449
 but how do I know where to start Bobo should have his first stroke 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.330
 does not succeed in her record Pierburg group 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.520
 around 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.140
 and there I had some ideas so lecturers or more precisely strategies 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.550
 I start 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.550
 Under point 4, 3 percent as explained 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.089
 it might be interesting for someone who says Hermann 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:17.009
 I can not show you 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.960
 to give in the few tips 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.860
 because if you bought the DVD it probably means that the podium 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.389
 I can not wait 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.529
 actually I would like to do it 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.120
 but only i do not know i should start 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.860
 and around 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.050
 That's why there is already usually the remainder is Red 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.449
 Realistic is not the last word of wisdom 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:41.449
 that should be the airport so must do that 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:46.019
 Just like to do it again in the 20th century or cycle times and what you do that is just 

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:47.840
 the taste and and an innovation 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.460
 and can dream 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.199
 to some people just cared about somewhere 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.830
 on the corner and between 2 2 and and and realistic 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.889
 we draw 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.280
 Petra Katholik also needs special talent for total realism 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.210
 needs a lot of newspaper nominated good eye for 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.639
 but Europe between 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.699
 you should not be overstrained that's the way I can do that 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.210
 and that's the message around her line 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.099
 if you enjoy the product of an offer for the parquet 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:18.949
 Name how to proceed 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.939
 to get INTEGION views motive are few tips Prof 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:25.349
 Bonn Miklos 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:26.699
 that would be 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.699
 one aspect 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.969
 if I have a piece of paper from Geothermal or I have project so gaps in it 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:36.850
 Munich transfer a piece of paper I have a document in front of me 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.360
 on the sales side 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.169
 Of course I would always have cautiously stroking Jasper Forks 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.789
 describe 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.339
 In order to be preventive, this is really what I call pencil on paper week 

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.319
 have to think about it in the 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.979
 RN Schiederig percent I draw a bull where the lines stop there 

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:55.629
 you can do that 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:58.270
 percent has a certain charm 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.749
 So to say all these facets may be lines 

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:05.119
 and then I eventually have a big lip so you know what 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:08.519
 I really wanted to have it paid as soon as it actually exists 

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:09.589
 the depth 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:12.749
 to automatically hatch, so to speak 

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:16.379
 around the opponents to the athletics percent results 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.659
 the castle café no longer has built up such a newspaper so erased 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.619
 that due to the person says has gotten worse 

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:24.960
 as the freshly drawn 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.510
 that's one way but on the other hand, I'm really clear 

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:32.440
 Lines have the World Bank want mainz-bingen the Bummerl percent left 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.939
 did something as possible with him 

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:38.139
 while, for example, then the drawing goes against this every second 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:40.119
 Economic Package II 

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:43.119
 there must cover the lines in the calculator keys outlook 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.800
 around on the sheet of paper is the fears 

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:49.059
 because of the rubber 

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.279
 and this fifteen minutes alone that's not my job but it does me 

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:53.899
 big fun 

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:57.719
 that is to say that usually it is like this for me projects of different ones 

00:07:57.719 --> 00:07:59.319
 Drawing too 

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.299
 at 18 o'clock the order is used
