what<00:00:12.870> you're<00:00:13.019> going<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.230> need<00:00:13.469> are<00:00:13.799> some

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
what you're going to need are some

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.230 
what you're going to need are some
palatinus<00:00:15.450> pliers<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:17.029> you'll<00:00:18.029> need

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
palatinus pliers like this you'll need

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.080 
palatinus pliers like this you'll need

some around nose pliers and you also

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.779 
some around nose pliers and you also
need<00:00:21.420> some<00:00:21.779> cutters<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:23.130> cut<00:00:23.160> your<00:00:23.640> wire

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
need some cutters to cut your wire

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.390 
need some cutters to cut your wire
obviously<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.529> type<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.890> flower<00:00:26.070> that

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
obviously and the type of flower that

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160 
obviously and the type of flower that
I'm<00:00:26.460> using<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.029> comes<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
I'm using it just comes like this on the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.169 
I'm using it just comes like this on the
spool<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:29.220> sure<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.730> see<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.000> but

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
spool and not sure if you can see it but

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.380 
spool and not sure if you can see it but
it's<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.599> squared<00:00:31.199> wire<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.969> it's<00:00:32.969> probably

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
it's a squared wire and it's probably

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.560 
it's a squared wire and it's probably
about<00:00:33.980> I'd<00:00:34.980> say<00:00:35.570> 0.6<00:00:36.570> or<00:00:36.809> 0.7<00:00:37.910> millimeters<00:00:38.910> but

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
about I'd say 0.6 or 0.7 millimeters but

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.880 
about I'd say 0.6 or 0.7 millimeters but
you<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:39.870> use<00:00:40.110> whatever<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.469> want<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you can really use whatever you want and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.510 
you can really use whatever you want and
then<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.360> need<00:00:42.629> some<00:00:42.899> foam<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:44.040> these<00:00:44.370> little

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
then you need some foam so these little

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.420 
then you need some foam so these little
pins<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.210> piece<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.170> paper<00:00:46.260> obviously<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.129> then

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
pins a piece of paper obviously and then

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.819 
pins a piece of paper obviously and then
just<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.030> piece<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.390> thread<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.410> that'll<00:00:49.800> just

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
just a piece of thread and that'll just

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
just a piece of thread and that'll just
make<00:00:50.250> sure<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.430> you're<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.879> wasting<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
make sure that you're not wasting a

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.020 
make sure that you're not wasting a
whole<00:00:51.629> lot<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> wire<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:53.399> how<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:54.000> about

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
whole lot of wire so how I go about

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.680 
whole lot of wire so how I go about
making<00:00:54.870> these<00:00:55.110> kinds<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.500> antennas<00:00:56.449> is<00:00:57.449> I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
making these kinds of antennas is I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.479 
making these kinds of antennas is I
always<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.320> draw<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.949> shape<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.370> I

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
always just draw out the shape that I

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.420 
always just draw out the shape that I
wanted<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> make<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.890> infinite

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
wanted to make so for this infinite

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.429 
wanted to make so for this infinite
heart<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.120> started<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.080> regular

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
heart I just started with like a regular

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.929 
heart I just started with like a regular
heart<00:01:04.680> shape<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.519> added<00:01:05.729> in

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
heart shape and then I just added in

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.390 
heart shape and then I just added in
this<00:01:06.390> design<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.890> then<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.189> want

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
this design here and then what you want

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.070 
this design here and then what you want
to<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> figure<00:01:09.299> out<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.540> way<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to do is you want to figure out a way of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.640 
to do is you want to figure out a way of
how<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.700> shape<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:13.110> just

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
how you can have this shape with just

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.789 
how you can have this shape with just
like<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:14.159> continuous<00:01:14.970> piece<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.659> wire<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.590> for

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
like one continuous piece of wire so for

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.359 
like one continuous piece of wire so for
me<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.159> gonna<00:01:17.400> run<00:01:17.670> along<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.369> then

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
me it's gonna run along like this then

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.359 
me it's gonna run along like this then
up<00:01:20.670> into<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.509> curve<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.200> finish<00:01:23.159> around

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
up into this curve and finish around

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.910 
up into this curve and finish around
here<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.350> putting<00:01:25.710> any

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
here and because I'm not putting any

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.300 
here and because I'm not putting any
kind<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.369> loops<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:28.040> like<00:01:29.040> eye

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
kind of loops like this for like eye

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.550 
kind of loops like this for like eye
pins<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.790> any<00:01:29.880> kind<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.150> ways<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.509> tie<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.810> what

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
pins or any kind of ways to tie it what

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.899 
pins or any kind of ways to tie it what
I'm<00:01:31.650> actually<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.430> I'm<00:01:32.579> gonna<00:01:32.640> get

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna get

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.300 
I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna get
the<00:01:33.060> ends<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.570> bend<00:01:34.049> them<00:01:34.290> around<00:01:34.619> these

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
the ends and bend them around these

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.030 
the ends and bend them around these
pieces<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.329> here<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.740> there's<00:01:37.890> no

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
pieces here and here so that there's no

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.330 
pieces here and here so that there's no
like<00:01:38.820> ends<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.380> then<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.979> do<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.250> I

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
like ends and then what I can do is I

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.120 
like ends and then what I can do is I
could<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.610> attach<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.360> chain<00:01:43.079> directly<00:01:43.979> on

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
could just attach the chain directly on

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.649 
could just attach the chain directly on
the<00:01:44.220> sides<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.700> making<00:01:45.180> these<00:01:45.329> kind<00:01:45.570> of

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the sides I have making these kind of

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.770 
the sides I have making these kind of
where<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> loops

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.500 

so<00:01:49.320> once<00:01:49.620> you<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.160> something<00:01:50.580> done<00:01:50.940> what

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
so once you have the something done what

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.080 
so once you have the something done what
I<00:01:51.540> always<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:52.080> is<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.650> take<00:01:52.830> some<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.460> just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
I always do is I take some and just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.510 
I always do is I take some and just
plain<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:55.200> string<00:01:55.590> whatever<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
plain like string whatever you have and

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.360 
plain like string whatever you have and
I<00:01:56.550> put<00:01:56.760> them<00:01:56.820> off<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.300> end<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:58.650> then<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.100> use

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
I put them off at the end and then I use

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.670 
I put them off at the end and then I use
these<00:01:59.640> pins<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.360> some<00:02:00.630> foam<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.260> I<00:02:01.320> use<00:02:01.440> foam

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
these pins and some foam and I use foam

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.410 
these pins and some foam and I use foam
just<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> don't<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.670> pierce<00:02:03.000> my<00:02:03.180> deck

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
just that I don't like pierce my deck

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.100 
just that I don't like pierce my deck
and<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.030> kind<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.420> put<00:02:06.660> pins

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and what I do is I just kind of put pins

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.440 
and what I do is I just kind of put pins
and<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.759> most<00:02:10.160> like<00:02:11.160> all<00:02:11.610> these<00:02:12.060> kind<00:02:12.420> of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and the most like all these kind of

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.550 
and the most like all these kind of
turning<00:02:13.080> points<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.930> these<00:02:15.930> will<00:02:16.110> just<00:02:16.350> be

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
turning points so these will just be

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.720 
turning points so these will just be
like<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.920> kind<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:18.950> locations<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.250> obviously

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
like the kind of locations and obviously

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.310 
like the kind of locations and obviously
this<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.120> straight<00:02:21.390> right<00:02:21.660> here<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> don't

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
this is straight right here so you don't

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.250 
this is straight right here so you don't
really<00:02:22.530> need<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.160> pin<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.580> there<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:25.020> then

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
really need to the pin in there and then

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.710 
really need to the pin in there and then
I<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.560> kind<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.770> take<00:02:26.010> my<00:02:26.220> wife<00:02:26.430> or<00:02:26.910> my<00:02:26.970> thread

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
want to pull very tight the youngest but

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.699 
want to pull very tight the youngest but
very<00:02:32.910> gently<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.420> laid<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.320> string

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
very gently is laid then you string

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.380 
very gently is laid then you string
around<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.700> want<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.910> go<00:02:36.030> around<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
around and you want to go around the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.360 
around and you want to go around the
entire<00:02:36.420> shape<00:02:37.320> all<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.709> way<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.100> can<00:02:38.250> way

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
entire shape all the way you can way

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.699 
entire shape all the way you can way
you're<00:02:38.580> going<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.850> bend<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.390> wire<00:02:39.709> because

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
you're going to bend the wire because

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.870 
you're going to bend the wire because
then<00:02:40.890> what<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.280> do<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.730> can

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
then what you can do because you can

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.229 
then what you can do because you can
take<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.690> thread<00:02:42.739> off<00:02:43.739> from<00:02:44.340> your<00:02:44.459> shape<00:02:44.700> and

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
take the thread off from your shape and

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.449 
take the thread off from your shape and
you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.690> put<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.140> against<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.800> ruler<00:02:47.400> or

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
you can just put it against a ruler or

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.960 
you can just put it against a ruler or
something<00:02:48.060> like<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:49.230> why<00:02:50.100> Cannot<00:02:50.550> be

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
something like that so why Cannot be

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.570 
something like that so why Cannot be
about<00:02:51.540> 7<00:02:52.140> inches<00:02:52.500> for<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.160> some<00:02:53.370> type<00:02:53.549> of

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
about 7 inches for it to some type of

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.240 
about 7 inches for it to some type of
shape<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:54.930> what<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.140> did<00:02:55.260> was<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.709> had<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:56.100> a

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
shape and then what I did was I had it a

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.180 
shape and then what I did was I had it a
little<00:02:56.970> bit<00:02:57.120> on<00:02:57.390> either<00:02:57.780> side<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.650> total<00:02:58.830> I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
little bit on either side so in total I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.820 
little bit on either side so in total I
cut<00:02:59.459> my<00:02:59.640> wire<00:02:59.850> to<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.540> length<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.080> eight<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.739> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
cut my wire to a length of eight and a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.830 
cut my wire to a length of eight and a
half<00:03:01.860> inches<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:03.239> you're<00:03:03.480> always<00:03:03.570> want

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
half inches because you're always want

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.120 
half inches because you're always want
to<00:03:03.900> have<00:03:04.080> more<00:03:04.350> than<00:03:04.410> less<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:06.170> that<00:03:07.170> way<00:03:07.650> I'm

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
to have more than less and that way I'm

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.289 
to have more than less and that way I'm
ready<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.610> go<00:03:08.730> ahead<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.120> start<00:03:09.420> bending<00:03:09.720> this

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
ready to go ahead and start bending this

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.539 
ready to go ahead and start bending this
so<00:03:12.299> just<00:03:12.480> before<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.870> start<00:03:13.320> I'm<00:03:13.650> bending<00:03:14.489> my

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
so just before I start I'm bending my

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.850 
so just before I start I'm bending my
wire<00:03:14.910> edge<00:03:15.299> as<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.690> take<00:03:15.930> some<00:03:16.170> tape<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.830> just

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
wire edge as I take some tape and I just

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.210 
wire edge as I take some tape and I just
tape<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:18.060> piece<00:03:18.360> with<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.170> design<00:03:19.470> onto<00:03:19.799> my

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
tape this piece with the design onto my

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.720 
tape this piece with the design onto my
or<00:03:20.760> cancer

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
or cancer

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.000 
the bad lighting ball and what I did was
even<00:03:31.720> though<00:03:31.810> my<00:03:31.959> necklace<00:03:32.260> starts<00:03:32.650> over<00:03:32.980> here

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010

I added maybe half an inch of extra wire
outside<00:03:36.790> here<00:03:37.360> for<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.019> loop<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:39.370> then<00:03:39.550> all

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
outside here for the loop and then all

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.180 
outside here for the loop and then all
you<00:03:39.910> need<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.209> do<00:03:40.330> is<00:03:41.080> just<00:03:41.530> take<00:03:41.860> your<00:03:41.920> piece

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.949 
gently like bend the wire around and you
might<00:03:48.459> want<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.819> make<00:03:48.910> sure<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.690> follow

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
might want to make sure that you follow

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.670 
might want to make sure that you follow
the<00:03:50.140> shape<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.910> your<00:03:51.910> design<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.230> I'm<00:03:53.470> just

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
the shape of your design so I'm just

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.410 
the shape of your design so I'm just
gonna<00:03:53.860> go<00:03:54.069> ahead<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.549> do<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.849> a<00:03:55.060> little<00:03:55.239> bit

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
gonna go ahead and do it a little bit

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:11.700 
gonna go ahead and do it a little bit
and<00:03:55.660> I'll<00:03:55.810> show<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:55.989> had<00:03:56.349> that<00:03:56.500> goats

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.370 

what<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:12.850> also<00:04:13.030> might<00:04:13.390> notice<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:13.780> happens

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
what you also might notice that happens

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.140 
what you also might notice that happens
is<00:04:14.650> as<00:04:14.800> you're<00:04:14.980> playing<00:04:15.250> with<00:04:15.460> the<00:04:15.640> wire<00:04:15.820> as

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
is as you're playing with the wire as

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.480 
is as you're playing with the wire as
you<00:04:16.180> can<00:04:16.450> see<00:04:16.690> there's<00:04:17.020> a<00:04:17.110> kind<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.590> bat<00:04:18.040> raised

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:18.490 
you can see there's a kind of bat raised

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.450 
you can see there's a kind of bat raised
but<00:04:18.910> here<00:04:19.240> so<00:04:19.870> here<00:04:20.050> right<00:04:20.200> now<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:20.440> then<00:04:20.620> you

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
but here so here right now and then you

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.810 
but here so here right now and then you
just<00:04:21.610> want<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.820> take<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.270> like<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.670> can

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
just want to take it like so and you can

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.030 
just want to take it like so and you can
see<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:25.630> piece<00:04:25.930> here<00:04:26.410> kind<00:04:26.650> of<00:04:26.710> comes

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
see that this piece here kind of comes

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.900 
see that this piece here kind of comes
upwards

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
upwards

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
upwards
so<00:04:28.420> it<00:04:28.510> was<00:04:28.660> bend<00:04:28.930> up<00:04:29.110> down<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:31.450> you<00:04:31.600> just<00:04:31.780> want

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
so it was bend up down and you just want

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.900 
so it was bend up down and you just want
to<00:04:32.020> make<00:04:32.170> sure<00:04:32.380> that<00:04:32.650> your<00:04:32.830> wire<00:04:33.070> lies<00:04:33.490> that's

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
to make sure that your wire lies that's

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.620 
to make sure that your wire lies that's
flat<00:04:34.270> on<00:04:34.570> your<00:04:34.840> surface<00:04:35.080> as<00:04:35.500> possible<00:04:39.330> so<00:04:40.330> as

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
flat on your surface as possible so as

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.250 
flat on your surface as possible so as
you<00:04:40.750> can<00:04:40.900> see<00:04:41.140> there<00:04:41.350> that<00:04:41.620> looks<00:04:41.950> much<00:04:42.760> better

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
you can see there that looks much better

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.510 
you can see there that looks much better
so<00:04:44.260> when<00:04:44.440> you<00:04:44.530> have<00:04:44.680> that<00:04:44.710> done<00:04:45.070> just<00:04:45.100> go<00:04:45.460> ahead

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
so when you have that done just go ahead

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.580 
so when you have that done just go ahead
around<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.300> finish<00:04:46.870> shaping<00:04:47.440> your<00:04:47.740> wire<00:04:49.590> so

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
around and finish shaping your wire so

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.500 
around and finish shaping your wire so
as<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.920> can<00:04:51.040> see<00:04:51.100> this<00:04:51.670> is<00:04:51.820> what<00:04:52.060> my<00:04:52.210> finish

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
as you can see this is what my finish

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.140 
as you can see this is what my finish
that<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:52.720> look<00:04:53.050> like<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.650> if<00:04:53.950> I<00:04:54.190> remove<00:04:54.520> it<00:04:54.550> you

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
that I look like and if I remove it you

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.300 
that I look like and if I remove it you
can<00:04:55.300> see<00:04:55.480> that's<00:04:55.630> um<00:04:56.160> practically<00:04:57.160> identical

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
can see that's um practically identical

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.390 
can see that's um practically identical
to<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.330> design<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:59.620> this<00:04:59.950> might<00:05:00.190> take<00:05:00.370> a

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
to the design and this might take a

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.860 
to the design and this might take a
little<00:05:00.610> bit<00:05:00.820> of<00:05:00.910> practice<00:05:01.060> for<00:05:01.450> you<00:05:01.540> to<00:05:01.630> get<00:05:01.750> at

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
little bit of practice for you to get at

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.570 
little bit of practice for you to get at
the<00:05:01.960> right<00:05:02.140> shape<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.980> want<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.430> be

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
the right shape that you want it to be

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.180 
the right shape that you want it to be
but<00:05:04.330> my<00:05:04.810> advice<00:05:05.110> would<00:05:05.350> be<00:05:05.410> that<00:05:05.620> when<00:05:06.070> you're

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
but my advice would be that when you're

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.800 
but my advice would be that when you're
bending<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.550> wire<00:05:06.730> you<00:05:07.420> want<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:07.660> make<00:05:07.780> sure

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
bending the wire you want to make sure

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.100 
bending the wire you want to make sure
that<00:05:08.080> you<00:05:08.260> make<00:05:08.410> very<00:05:08.680> very<00:05:08.980> tiny<00:05:09.340> tiny<00:05:10.110> holes

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
that you make very very tiny tiny holes

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.380 
that you make very very tiny tiny holes
or<00:05:11.410> bends<00:05:11.590> because<00:05:12.580> it's<00:05:12.820> better<00:05:13.030> for<00:05:13.150> the

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
or bends because it's better for the

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.630 
or bends because it's better for the
wire<00:05:13.570> that<00:05:13.930> you<00:05:14.050> bend<00:05:14.290> it<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.530> few<00:05:14.800> times<00:05:15.100> in<00:05:15.430> one

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
wire that you bend it a few times in one

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.180 
wire that you bend it a few times in one
direction<00:05:16.050> down<00:05:17.050> if<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.320> bend<00:05:17.560> it<00:05:17.740> like<00:05:17.980> back

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
direction down if you bend it like back

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.070 
direction down if you bend it like back
and<00:05:18.430> forth<00:05:18.520> because<00:05:19.240> if<00:05:19.450> you<00:05:19.570> bend<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:19.900> wire

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
and forth because if you bend the wire

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.990 
and forth because if you bend the wire
back<00:05:20.350> and<00:05:20.590> forth<00:05:20.830> what<00:05:21.130> that<00:05:21.280> does<00:05:21.460> is<00:05:21.610> it<00:05:21.880> it

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
back and forth what that does is it it

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.390 
back and forth what that does is it it
hardens<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:23.020> spot<00:05:23.320> where<00:05:23.620> it's<00:05:23.770> being<00:05:24.010> bent

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
hardens the spot where it's being bent

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.900 
hardens the spot where it's being bent
at<00:05:24.670> and<00:05:25.240> it<00:05:25.750> gets<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.920> a<00:05:26.950> point<00:05:27.220> where<00:05:27.490> it's<00:05:27.700> so

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
at and it gets to a point where it's so

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.480 
at and it gets to a point where it's so
fragile<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.540> actually<00:05:29.170> breaks<00:05:29.410> off<00:05:29.620> so<00:05:30.370> if

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
fragile that actually breaks off so if

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.220 
fragile that actually breaks off so if
you<00:05:30.640> bend<00:05:30.850> the<00:05:31.090> wire<00:05:31.270> back<00:05:31.540> and<00:05:31.750> forth<00:05:31.960> too

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
you bend the wire back and forth too

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.720 
you bend the wire back and forth too
much<00:05:32.440> what<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.860> learn<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.130> puppeting<00:05:33.580> is

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
much what you learn the puppeting is

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.910 
much what you learn the puppeting is
that<00:05:33.910> your<00:05:34.090> entire<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:34.900> pendant<00:05:35.470> will<00:05:35.680> break

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
that your entire and pendant will break

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.000 
that your entire and pendant will break
so<00:05:36.640> just<00:05:36.880> do<00:05:37.180> it<00:05:37.210> a<00:05:37.390> little<00:05:37.630> bit<00:05:37.810> at<00:05:38.050> a<00:05:38.080> time<00:05:38.170> and

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
so just do it a little bit at a time and

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.000 
so just do it a little bit at a time and
get<00:05:39.250> it<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.580> shape<00:05:39.760> that<00:05:39.790> you<00:05:40.090> like<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:41.010> if

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
get it to the shape that you like and if

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.500 
get it to the shape that you like and if
you're<00:05:42.160> not<00:05:42.310> very<00:05:42.520> comfortable<00:05:42.760> with<00:05:43.120> wire

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
you're not very comfortable with wire

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.330 
you're not very comfortable with wire
then<00:05:43.840> maybe<00:05:44.020> practice<00:05:44.320> with<00:05:44.770> some<00:05:45.040> scrap

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
then maybe practice with some scrap

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.390 
then maybe practice with some scrap
piece<00:05:45.610> first<00:05:46.110> so<00:05:47.110> anyway<00:05:47.650> when<00:05:47.890> you<00:05:48.040> have<00:05:48.220> that

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
piece first so anyway when you have that

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.550 
piece first so anyway when you have that
done<00:05:48.700> all<00:05:49.420> you're<00:05:49.600> gonna<00:05:49.690> do<00:05:49.930> is<00:05:50.170> just<00:05:50.320> wrap

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
done all you're gonna do is just wrap

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.670 
done all you're gonna do is just wrap
these<00:05:50.800> pieces<00:05:51.310> around<00:05:51.780> here<00:05:52.780> and<00:05:53.050> here<00:05:53.290> and

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
these pieces around here and here and

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:11.670 
these pieces around here and here and
then<00:05:54.610> you'll<00:05:55.060> be<00:05:55.120> finished

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.850 

so<00:06:12.680> as<00:06:12.979> you<00:06:13.099> can<00:06:13.189> see<00:06:13.250> here's<00:06:13.849> what<00:06:14.090> my<00:06:14.270> final

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
so as you can see here's what my final

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.309 
so as you can see here's what my final
pendant<00:06:15.860> looks<00:06:16.400> like<00:06:16.699> and<00:06:17.060> I<00:06:17.870> had<00:06:18.080> a<00:06:18.110> little

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
pendant looks like and I had a little

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.689 
pendant looks like and I had a little
bit<00:06:18.500> of<00:06:18.590> wire<00:06:18.800> left<00:06:19.069> over<00:06:19.280> on<00:06:19.430> the<00:06:19.550> bottom

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
bit of wire left over on the bottom

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.640 
bit of wire left over on the bottom
after<00:06:20.060> I<00:06:20.389> wrapped<00:06:20.780> it<00:06:20.960> so<00:06:21.199> I<00:06:21.259> just<00:06:21.469> made<00:06:21.620> a

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
after I wrapped it so I just made a

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.350 
after I wrapped it so I just made a
little<00:06:21.800> loop<00:06:22.039> like<00:06:22.099> this<00:06:22.550> and<00:06:22.819> then<00:06:23.000> you<00:06:23.180> can

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
little loop like this and then you can

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.379 
little loop like this and then you can
attach<00:06:23.479> any<00:06:23.990> kind<00:06:24.080> of<00:06:24.349> beads<00:06:25.250> or<00:06:25.520> tassel<00:06:26.090> or<00:06:26.360> a

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
attach any kind of beads or tassel or a

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.170 
attach any kind of beads or tassel or a
feather<00:06:26.659> even<00:06:27.110> whatever<00:06:27.439> you<00:06:27.590> want<00:06:27.800> and<00:06:28.460> then

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
feather even whatever you want and then

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.760 
feather even whatever you want and then
to<00:06:29.449> make<00:06:29.569> it<00:06:29.689> into<00:06:29.900> a<00:06:29.930> necklace<00:06:30.139> all<00:06:30.560> you're

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770 
to make it into a necklace all you're

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.700 
to make it into a necklace all you're
going<00:06:30.919> to<00:06:31.039> need<00:06:31.310> will<00:06:31.580> be<00:06:31.610> two<00:06:31.969> little<00:06:32.710> jump

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
going to need will be two little jump

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.520 
going to need will be two little jump
rings<00:06:33.919> and<00:06:34.430> then<00:06:35.000> what<00:06:35.509> I<00:06:35.539> did<00:06:35.659> was<00:06:35.810> I<00:06:36.139> took<00:06:36.289> a

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
rings and then what I did was I took a

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.899 
rings and then what I did was I took a
necklace<00:06:37.099> that<00:06:37.400> I<00:06:37.430> had<00:06:37.759> with<00:06:39.639> the<00:06:40.639> closure

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
necklace that I had with the closure

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:43.959 
necklace that I had with the closure
here<00:06:41.300> and<00:06:41.330> I<00:06:42.020> just<00:06:42.199> cut<00:06:42.379> mine<00:06:42.560> in<00:06:42.710> half<00:06:42.819> as<00:06:43.819> you

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:43.969 
here and I just cut mine in half as you

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.800 
here and I just cut mine in half as you
can<00:06:44.120> see<00:06:44.389> as<00:06:44.690> and<00:06:45.500> two<00:06:46.009> bits<00:06:46.280> there<00:06:46.629> and<00:06:47.629> then

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
can see as and two bits there and then

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.600 
can see as and two bits there and then
I'm<00:06:47.870> just<00:06:48.020> going<00:06:48.229> to<00:06:48.289> attach<00:06:48.440> each<00:06:49.009> end<00:06:49.310> to

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
I'm just going to attach each end to

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.990 
I'm just going to attach each end to
either<00:06:50.030> side<00:06:50.509> so<00:06:51.610> here's<00:06:52.610> what<00:06:52.789> the<00:06:52.849> whole

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
either side so here's what the whole

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.180 
either side so here's what the whole
thing<00:06:53.270> looks<00:06:53.719> like<00:06:53.840> so<00:06:54.530> I<00:06:54.590> hope<00:06:54.770> you<00:06:54.919> enjoyed
