00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.740
 Subaru in the Hello Sagamihara Pakurenzu belongs 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:13.330
 The ball introduced this time was newly released by stormers 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.650
 I would like to introduce you to Cracks Pearl 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.039
 At first we go in layout farmhouse 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:24.620
 Pin from pap 4 7/8 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:32.140
 As for the voice of 5 inches of pin buffer is set once 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:32.140
 And comparison ball wants to throw the crack of the previous work as comparison ball 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:41.060
 If the layout is Pin Kraphy p 4 and 7/8 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.940
 Here is the wait base is set to 4 and 1/2 in buffer is 31 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.590
 I will 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.650
 It will be the worldwide launch of this cracks pearl 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.580
 But it will be in New ball 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:58.530
 The difference between the previous and the previous is erg 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:02.960
 This is a new cover stock but from a hybrid of drg 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.360
 It was changed to Pearl Material 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:15.159
 And because the surface is polished in the form of 1500 No. polish 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.159
 I feel a sense of skit very long compared to the previous work crack 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:28.190
 Cocoa people use the same core, so it feels like rolling, or in the back end 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:32.240
 Well but I guess do you Tteyuu movement is basically is an image that has not changed 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.310
 It is very because the material of the surface is pearl 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.640
 I did not enter in the previous work smooth smooth 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.990
 In your chewing is the back-end with the feeling et al. 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:48.240
 It is because the stability of the catalyst core has come out very much. 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.329
 I think that it has become a movement that can be a stable pocket hit was 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.790
 It is strong in oil very much to crack the previous work 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.869
 There were quite a few professional bowlers used in heavy conditions as well 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.920
 But 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:06.900
 It is center condition It is not good I think the catch is too strong 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:12.360
 It feels like it was very good to use it after polishing 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.530
 But after all this crack is very effective in oily condition 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.160
 Because it can be used 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.910
 eh 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:23.610
 If you say that you are throwing and throwing anyway, that one 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:28.320
 It is not possible to have both balls were balls and clouds running go balls to write assertions in this ball 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.890
 I said that there was a response to the condition, but this time the pearl material came out 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.180
 is not it 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.990
 These cracks can also be used on this as-is surface under d conditions. 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.150
 You 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.920
 This 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:44.739
 Because it is a pearl material policy, it can be used even in the next village, which is medium or a little late. 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:51.010
 It looks like this is so very much because these two rice images are the same 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:52.420
 I think it has become so wide that it can be used properly depending on the condition 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.440
 I will 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:03.790
 Very pin action is also good, so it is quite high score and high misery is expected. 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.560
 The second half of the game accompanies this crack whenever it gets tough 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.370
 Pearl 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.410
 Use It is by all means you because I think that is as able and who have this Klux 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.890
 Even those who do not have it are very here here Cracks pearl 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.940
 Ah ah ah 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.880
 Since it is a good ball so I think I'll have that love 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:25.140
 In this Tokyu animation 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.140

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.700
