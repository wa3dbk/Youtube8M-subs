the<00:00:44.820> imperative<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:46.579> continuing<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> take<00:00:47.910> on

the imperative of continuing to take on

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.729 
the imperative of continuing to take on
more<00:00:48.329> where<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.719> realistically<00:00:49.020> take<00:00:49.559> on

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
and it's a systemic kind of thing so it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.170 
and it's a systemic kind of thing so it
takes<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.440> real<00:00:55.680> courage<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.730> interior
