the you had a lot of rain and the
temperature<00:00:17.940> dropped<00:00:18.210> again<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> walls

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
temperature dropped again so the walls

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.130 
temperature dropped again so the walls
ended<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.520> sort<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.820> not<00:00:21.119> drying<00:00:21.480> as<00:00:21.869> quickly

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
ended up sort of not drying as quickly

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.769 
ended up sort of not drying as quickly
as<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.500> would<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.710> liked<00:00:23.180> the<00:00:24.180> temperature

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
as we would have liked the temperature

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
sensors dropped significantly so what

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.630 
sensors dropped significantly so what
kind<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.710> decided<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> put<00:00:47.399> plywood

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
kind of I decided to just to put plywood

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.680 
kind of I decided to just to put plywood
on<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> sides<00:00:48.329> basically<00:00:50.449> it's<00:00:51.449> already

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
on the sides basically it's already

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.029 
on the sides basically it's already
going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:51.960> plywood<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> roof<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.920> had

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
going to use plywood as a roof we had

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.760 
going to use plywood as a roof we had
these<00:00:53.190> extra<00:00:53.489> pieces<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.850> plywood<00:00:54.030> because<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
these extra pieces of plywood because I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
these extra pieces of plywood because I
miscalculated<00:00:56.420> when<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.510> were<00:00:57.629> building<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
miscalculated when we were building the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.560 
miscalculated when we were building the
milking<00:00:58.500> barn<00:00:59.270> and<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.390> decided<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:04.309> I<00:01:05.570> forgot

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
milking barn and I decided to I I forgot

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
milking barn and I decided to I I forgot
that<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> um<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.159> put<00:01:08.369> foot<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that that um the to put foot the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.520 
that that um the to put foot the
four-foot<00:01:09.330> pieces<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.750> plywood<00:01:09.930> work<00:01:10.320> on

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
four-foot pieces of plywood work on

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.820 
four-foot pieces of plywood work on
behalf<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> doubled<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> order<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:13.049> got

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
behalf so I doubled up the order I got

behalf so I doubled up the order I got
twice<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.100> many<00:01:14.340> boards<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.909> needed

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
twice as many boards as I needed

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.830 
twice as many boards as I needed
unfortunately<00:01:16.830> even<00:01:17.220> though<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.840> not

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
unfortunately even though I was not

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.870 
unfortunately even though I was not
happy<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> did<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> time

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
happy that I did that when at the time

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
happy that I did that when at the time
this<00:01:21.630> worked<00:01:21.900> out<00:01:22.080> quite<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.409> bit<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.860> we've

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
this worked out quite a bit and we've

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.420 
this worked out quite a bit and we've
used<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> plywood<00:01:23.880> variety<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> different

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
used the plywood variety of different

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.969 
used the plywood variety of different
tasks<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:27.990> really<00:01:28.110> come<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.500> handy<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
tasks so it's really come in handy and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.870 
tasks so it's really come in handy and
they<00:01:29.040> were<00:01:29.100> actually<00:01:29.280> good<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.990> two<00:01:31.110> foot

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
the cow gray and we got the goat grain

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.090 
the cow gray and we got the goat grain
is<00:02:34.430> because<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.880> did<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:38.530> goats<00:02:39.530> eat<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:39.950> need

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
is because it did the goats eat you need

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.670 
is because it did the goats eat you need
to<00:02:40.220> eat<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> lot<00:02:40.850> more<00:02:41.209> their<00:02:42.170> percentage<00:02:42.590> of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
to eat a lot more their percentage of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.890 
to eat a lot more their percentage of
their<00:02:42.799> body<00:02:43.010> weight<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.580> mean<00:02:44.120> cows<00:02:44.330> eat<00:02:44.600> about

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
their body weight I mean cows eat about

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.390 
their body weight I mean cows eat about
four<00:02:45.230> percent<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.680> their<00:02:45.739> body<00:02:45.950> weight<00:02:46.069> a<00:02:46.250> day

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
four percent of their body weight a day

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.350 
four percent of their body weight a day

can see there's no rudders quite large

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.580 
can see there's no rudders quite large
they're<00:03:16.310> run<00:03:16.489> away<00:03:16.730> from<00:03:16.970> us<00:03:17.260> they<00:03:18.260> had<00:03:18.470> all

they're run away from us they had all
this<00:03:18.739> food<00:03:19.010> they<00:03:19.359> thought<00:03:20.359> we<00:03:20.480> were<00:03:20.510> probably

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
this food they thought we were probably

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.319 
this food they thought we were probably
going<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.959> take<00:03:21.049> them<00:03:21.200> out<00:03:21.350> of<00:03:21.380> here<00:03:22.180> but<00:03:23.180> now

going to take them out of here but now
they're<00:03:23.540> coming<00:03:23.930> up<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.049> us<00:03:24.200> because<00:03:24.500> they

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
they're coming up to us because they

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.199 
they're coming up to us because they
think<00:03:24.829> what<00:03:25.160> we<00:03:25.250> might<00:03:25.400> have<00:03:25.640> some<00:03:25.940> sort<00:03:26.180> of

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
think what we might have some sort of

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.610 
think what we might have some sort of
food<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:26.750> forth<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.959> see<00:03:30.109> that<00:03:30.230> her<00:03:30.290> stool

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
food and so forth you see that her stool

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.729 
food and so forth you see that her stool
it's<00:03:31.100> getting<00:03:31.569> larger<00:03:32.569> I<00:03:32.870> think<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.470> must<00:03:33.590> be

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
it's getting larger I think that must be

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.099 
it's getting larger I think that must be
some<00:03:33.950> sort<00:03:34.100> of<00:03:34.190> sign<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:35.359> being<00:03:35.540> pregnant<00:03:36.049> and

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
some sort of sign of being pregnant and

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.300 
some sort of sign of being pregnant and
instead<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.560> having<00:03:36.680> these<00:03:36.799> little<00:03:37.040> sort<00:03:37.190> of

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
instead of having these little sort of

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.970 
instead of having these little sort of
rabbit<00:03:37.819> pellets<00:03:38.180> some<00:03:39.019> sort<00:03:39.290> of<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.380> dog<00:03:39.620> stool

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
rabbit pellets some sort of a dog stool

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.410 
rabbit pellets some sort of a dog stool
there<00:03:40.280> almost<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.850> so<00:03:41.440> you<00:03:42.440> see<00:03:42.470> her<00:03:42.680> otter

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
there almost and so you see her otter

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.729 
there almost and so you see her otter
huge<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.750> know<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:45.109> just<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.410> don't<00:03:45.470> think<00:03:45.680> you

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
huge you know it just I don't think you

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.680 
huge you know it just I don't think you
can<00:03:45.799> get<00:03:45.980> much<00:03:46.100> bigger<00:03:46.340> she<00:03:47.299> seems<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.569> be<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
can get much bigger she seems to be the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.140 
can get much bigger she seems to be the
most<00:03:47.810> pregnant<00:03:48.139> and<00:03:48.560> Maggie<00:03:48.920> here<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.459> believe

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
most pregnant and Maggie here I believe

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.949 
most pregnant and Maggie here I believe
that<00:03:50.299> oh<00:03:51.370> he<00:03:52.370> made<00:03:52.519> it<00:03:52.549> with<00:03:52.790> both<00:03:52.940> of<00:03:53.000> them<00:03:53.329> on

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
that oh he made it with both of them on

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.539 
that oh he made it with both of them on
the<00:03:54.109> same<00:03:54.260> day<00:03:54.319> that<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.889> first<00:03:55.130> day<00:03:55.250> we<00:03:55.370> had

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
the same day that the first day we had

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.470 
the same day that the first day we had
him<00:03:55.700> so<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.660> just<00:03:56.690> seems<00:03:56.989> that<00:03:57.049> IV<00:03:57.410> here<00:03:57.620> is

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
him so it just seems that IV here is

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.410 
him so it just seems that IV here is
farther<00:03:59.480> along<00:03:59.540> as<00:03:59.810> Maggie<00:04:00.200> her<00:04:00.470> mother<00:04:00.680> she

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
farther along as Maggie her mother she

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.819 
farther along as Maggie her mother she
seems<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.510> be<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.660> little<00:04:03.019> bit<00:04:03.170> less<00:04:03.440> far<00:04:03.709> and

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
seems to be a little bit less far and

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.280 
seems to be a little bit less far and
then<00:04:03.920> we<00:04:04.010> didn't<00:04:04.160> even<00:04:04.340> see<00:04:04.600> her<00:04:05.600> moma<00:04:05.959> here

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
then we didn't even see her moma here

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.729 
then we didn't even see her moma here
with<00:04:07.450> iris<00:04:08.450> is<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:08.810> biggest<00:04:09.139> of<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.319> goat<00:04:09.470> so

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
with iris is the biggest of the goat so

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.670 
with iris is the biggest of the goat so
we<00:04:09.859> thought<00:04:10.010> that<00:04:10.190> maybe<00:04:10.310> she<00:04:10.430> wasn't

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
we thought that maybe she wasn't

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.720 
we thought that maybe she wasn't
she<00:04:12.680> wasn't<00:04:12.830> going<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.100> be<00:04:13.160> thieves<00:04:13.400> did<00:04:13.580> she

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
she wasn't going to be thieves did she

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.730 
she wasn't going to be thieves did she
would<00:04:13.880> didn't<00:04:14.390> just<00:04:14.900> stare<00:04:15.170> all<00:04:15.350> or<00:04:15.440> something

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
would didn't just stare all or something

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.040 
would didn't just stare all or something
but<00:04:16.180> it<00:04:17.180> appears<00:04:17.480> not<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.720> be<00:04:17.840> the<00:04:18.020> case

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
but it appears not to be the case

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.080 
but it appears not to be the case
because<00:04:20.860> her<00:04:21.860> others<00:04:22.130> blow<00:04:22.340> them<00:04:22.520> as<00:04:22.610> well<00:04:22.790> so

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
because her others blow them as well so

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.420 
because her others blow them as well so
you<00:04:23.150> know<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:24.440> earliest<00:04:24.800> there<00:04:25.130> was<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.250> couple

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
you know the earliest there was a couple

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.800

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
cleared anyway that sauce so we really
