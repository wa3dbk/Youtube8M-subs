books he was actually one of the green
lantern<00:00:40.140> guardians<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.809> maybe<00:00:42.809> got<00:00:43.020> infected

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
lantern guardians and maybe got infected

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
blackest night but they definitely look

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.750 
blackest night but they definitely look
dead<00:03:05.030> look<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:06.019> zombies<00:03:06.340> faces<00:03:07.340> all<00:03:07.489> messed
