was<00:00:25.500> built<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.950> really<00:00:26.250> weird<00:00:26.550> body<00:00:26.849> and

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
was built on that really weird body and

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.760 
was built on that really weird body and
had<00:00:27.390> weird<00:00:27.720> proportions<00:00:28.350> and<00:00:28.500> didn't<00:00:28.650> look

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
had weird proportions and didn't look

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.100 
had weird proportions and didn't look
quite<00:00:28.980> right<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.970> one's<00:00:30.180> a<00:00:30.270> little<00:00:30.390> tall<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
quite right this one's a little tall and

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.869 
quite right this one's a little tall and
a<00:00:31.350> little<00:00:31.380> slim<00:00:32.010> but<00:00:32.400> I<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:32.730> it's

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
a little slim but I think it's

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.930 
a little slim but I think it's
definitely<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> better<00:00:33.660> choice<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.760> Elektra

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
definitely the better choice for Elektra

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.880 
definitely the better choice for Elektra
all<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.390> flesh<00:00:36.660> tones<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.320> molded

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
all of this flesh tones are molded

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
all of this flesh tones are molded
plastic<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.520> they're<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:38.760> fairly<00:00:39.180> even<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
plastic so they're all fairly even and

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.869 
plastic so they're all fairly even and
we<00:00:40.290> don't<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.530> really<00:00:40.800> any<00:00:40.920> issues<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
we don't have really any issues of the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
we don't have really any issues of the
paint<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.269> looking<00:00:42.690> right<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.470> then<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
paint not looking right so then all of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.430 
paint not looking right so then all of
the<00:00:44.040> red<00:00:44.220> parts<00:00:44.520> are<00:00:44.640> painted<00:00:45.030> on

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
the red parts are painted on

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.569 
the red parts are painted on
unfortunately<00:00:46.440> there's<00:00:46.649> no<00:00:46.739> sculpting<00:00:47.460> on

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
unfortunately there's no sculpting on

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.760 
unfortunately there's no sculpting on
any<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> red<00:00:48.300> parts<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> seam<00:00:49.170> we're<00:00:49.649> not

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
any of the red parts the seam we're not

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.560 
any of the red parts the seam we're not
seeing<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> edge<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> clothing<00:00:51.300> is

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
seeing but the edge of the clothing is

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
seeing but the edge of the clothing is
not<00:00:51.600> sculpted<00:00:52.290> anywhere<00:00:52.950> on<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.460> figure<00:00:53.730> so

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
not sculpted anywhere on this figure so

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.760 
not sculpted anywhere on this figure so
that's<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> little<00:00:54.809> disappointing<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.620> all

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that's a little disappointing it's all

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.740 
that's a little disappointing it's all
just<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.100> paint<00:00:56.309> application<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.390> doesn't<00:00:57.540> look

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
just a paint application it doesn't look

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.270 
just a paint application it doesn't look
too<00:00:57.899> bad<00:00:57.930> though<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.890> easy<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
too bad though and I think it's easy to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.850 
too bad though and I think it's easy to
overlook<00:00:59.870> because<00:01:00.870> they<00:01:01.290> did<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> pretty<00:01:01.680> good

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
overlook because they did a pretty good

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.619 
overlook because they did a pretty good
job<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> lines<00:01:02.579> are<00:01:02.760> fairly<00:01:03.120> clean<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
job all the lines are fairly clean so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.930 
job all the lines are fairly clean so
that's<00:01:03.809> ok<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.070> sculpted<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.580> sculpted

that
she<00:01:27.630> has<00:01:27.720> interchangeable<00:01:28.229> hands<00:01:29.039> she<00:01:29.459> has

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
she has interchangeable hands she has

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.550 
she has interchangeable hands she has
these<00:01:29.700> hands<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:31.080> are<00:01:31.319> meant<00:01:31.500> for

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
these hands here which are meant for

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.089 
these hands here which are meant for
holding<00:01:32.099> the<00:01:32.250> size<00:01:33.170> I'm<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.440> sure<00:01:34.679> how<00:01:34.890> they

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:35.099 
holding the size I'm not sure how they

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:36.770 
holding the size I'm not sure how they
how<00:01:35.459> she's<00:01:35.700> supposed<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> hold<00:01:36.149> him<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.330> think

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
how she's supposed to hold him I think

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.029 
how she's supposed to hold him I think
let's<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.080> if<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.410> do<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.979> remember

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
let's see if I can do it if I remember

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.040 
let's see if I can do it if I remember
yeah<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:38.940> think<00:01:39.060> she's<00:01:39.390> meant<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> hold<00:01:39.869> him

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
yeah I think she's meant to hold him

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.680 
yeah I think she's meant to hold him
like<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.280> I'm<00:01:41.429> not<00:01:41.580> positive<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.149> she

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
like that but I'm not positive but she

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.510 
like that but I'm not positive but she
does<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.039> of<00:01:44.160> course<00:01:44.310> she

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
does have that and so of course she

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.749 
does have that and so of course she
comes<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.330> size<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> she<00:01:47.550> has

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
comes with the to size and that she has

a swivel of course because it's a peg
for<00:02:23.489> removal<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.420> then<00:02:24.780> we

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
for removal and then we

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.770 
for removal and then we
have<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.200> hinge<00:02:25.439> as<00:02:25.709> well<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:27.180> course<00:02:27.239> was<00:02:27.659> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
have the hinge as well of course was the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.750 
have the hinge as well of course was the
diaphragm<00:02:28.260> joint<00:02:28.560> same<00:02:28.799> as<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.069> shield<00:02:29.310> agent

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
diaphragm joint same as the shield agent

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.119 
diaphragm joint same as the shield agent
female<00:02:30.689> SHIELD<00:02:30.959> agent<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.680> doesn't<00:02:31.980> have

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
female SHIELD agent so it doesn't have

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.369 
female SHIELD agent so it doesn't have
the<00:02:32.280> best<00:02:32.579> range<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:33.030> motion<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.870> does<00:02:34.140> swivel

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
the best range of motion it does swivel

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.800 
the best range of motion it does swivel
there<00:02:34.739> hers<00:02:35.519> doesn't<00:02:35.849> lean<00:02:36.090> side<00:02:36.329> to<00:02:36.359> side<00:02:36.599> at

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
there hers doesn't lean side to side at

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.599 
there hers doesn't lean side to side at
all<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.439> it's<00:02:37.560> basically<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.280> forward

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
all so it's basically just the forward

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.399 
all so it's basically just the forward
and<00:02:38.849> back<00:02:39.030> right<00:02:39.329> they're<00:02:39.599> pretty<00:02:39.959> limited

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
and back right they're pretty limited

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.050 
and back right they're pretty limited
this<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.980> separate<00:02:41.430> piece<00:02:41.549> if<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.790> didn't

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
this is a separate piece if you didn't

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
this is a separate piece if you didn't
notice<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:43.500> hips

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
notice the hips

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.920 
notice the hips
kind<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.609> like<00:02:44.790> ball<00:02:45.000> hinges<00:02:45.420> it's<00:02:45.569> kind<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
kind of like ball hinges it's kind of a

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.569 
kind of like ball hinges it's kind of a
cross<00:02:46.170> between<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.560> ball<00:02:46.829> hinge<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
cross between a ball hinge and the

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.849 
cross between a ball hinge and the
current<00:02:47.969> Marvel<00:02:48.269> Legends<00:02:48.629> it's<00:02:49.349> effectively

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
current Marvel Legends it's effectively

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.740 
current Marvel Legends it's effectively
the<00:02:49.980> same<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.579> a<00:02:50.609> wide<00:02:50.909> joint<00:02:51.239> though<00:02:51.569> so

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
the same it is a wide joint though so

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.110 
the same it is a wide joint though so
you<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.989> do<00:02:52.139> a<00:02:52.170> little<00:02:52.730> tweaking<00:02:53.730> before

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
you have to do a little tweaking before

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.819 
you have to do a little tweaking before
you<00:02:54.420> can<00:02:54.540> get<00:02:54.689> it<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.900> go<00:02:54.930> where<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.349> want<00:02:55.590> but

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
you can get it to go where you want but

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.319 
you can get it to go where you want but
it<00:02:55.920> does<00:02:56.159> work<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:56.670> should<00:02:56.730> be<00:02:57.090> able<00:02:57.209> to

it's<00:03:20.159> not<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.489> best<00:03:20.760> figure<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.329> world

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
it's not the best figure in the world

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.080 
it's not the best figure in the world
but<00:03:21.810> it's<00:03:21.959> definitely<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.739> solid<00:03:23.430> figure<00:03:23.939> and

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
but it's definitely a solid figure and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.220 
but it's definitely a solid figure and
since<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.359> comes<00:03:24.540> with<00:03:24.689> all<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:25.019> these

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
since it comes with all of these
