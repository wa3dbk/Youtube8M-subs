get started today we're going to install
a<00:00:35.640> slab<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.420> outside<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.230> door<00:00:37.589> as<00:00:38.039> you

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
a slab just outside of this door as you

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.799 
a slab just outside of this door as you
can<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.550> now<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:38.909> you<00:00:38.999> open<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.390> door<00:00:39.659> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
can see now when you open this door and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.779 
can see now when you open this door and
you<00:00:39.929> step<00:00:40.199> out<00:00:40.409> you're<00:00:40.620> stepping<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.249> grass

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
you step out you're stepping on to grass

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.049 
you step out you're stepping on to grass
we<00:00:42.059> need<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> concrete<00:00:42.719> slab<00:00:42.960> right<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:44.059> right

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
we need a concrete slab right here right

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.169 
we need a concrete slab right here right
now<00:00:45.269> we<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:46.550> establishing<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.699> boundaries

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
now we are establishing the boundaries

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.419 
now we are establishing the boundaries
for<00:00:48.479> our<00:00:48.839> slab<00:00:49.199> we've<00:00:49.710> determined<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
for our slab we've determined that the

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:54.219 
for our slab we've determined that the
slab<00:00:50.699> needs<00:00:51.269> to<00:00:51.449> be<00:00:51.569> four<00:00:51.809> feet<00:00:52.050> by<00:00:52.289> four<00:00:52.530> feet

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
slab needs to be four feet by four feet

00:00:54.229 --> 00:01:05.830 
slab needs to be four feet by four feet
setting<00:00:55.229> our<00:00:55.379> second<00:00:55.889> corner<00:01:01.819> and<00:01:02.819> then<00:01:03.479> we

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.450 

finish<00:01:06.840> off<00:01:09.350> now<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.409> need<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> excavate<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
finish off now we need to excavate the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.289 
finish off now we need to excavate the
area<00:01:12.030> where<00:01:12.840> we're<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> place<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.649> slab

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
area where we're going to place the slab

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
area where we're going to place the slab
we'll<00:01:15.299> set<00:01:15.539> our<00:01:15.689> grade<00:01:15.990> off<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.009> area

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
we'll set our grade off of this area

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.170 
we'll set our grade off of this area
right<00:01:17.610> along<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> door<00:01:23.000> since<00:01:24.000> we've

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
right along the door since we've

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.940 
right along the door since we've
determined<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.659> our<00:01:24.750> slab<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.649> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.859> be

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
determined that our slab is going to be

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.340 
determined that our slab is going to be
four<00:01:26.159> feet<00:01:26.340> by<00:01:26.549> four<00:01:26.789> feet<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.840> see<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
four feet by four feet you can see that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
four feet by four feet you can see that
I<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.829> two<00:01:29.039> by<00:01:29.219> four<00:01:29.250> by<00:01:29.670> eight<00:01:29.700> feet

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
I have here a two by four by eight feet

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
I have here a two by four by eight feet
long<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.020> I'm<00:01:31.109> simply<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> cut<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.829> in

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
long so I'm simply going to cut it in

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
long so I'm simply going to cut it in
half<00:01:37.490> I'm<00:01:38.490> gonna<00:01:38.640> make<00:01:38.820> our<00:01:38.969> concrete<00:01:39.359> slab

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
half I'm gonna make our concrete slab

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.340 
half I'm gonna make our concrete slab
four<00:01:40.200> inches<00:01:40.560> deep<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:42.539> case<00:01:42.810> we've

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
four inches deep in this case we've

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.529 
four inches deep in this case we've
excavated<00:01:43.679> but<00:01:44.399> we've<00:01:44.520> actually<00:01:44.700> excavated<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
excavated but we've actually excavated a

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:46.969 
excavated but we've actually excavated a
little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.869> more<00:01:46.079> than<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.469> needed<00:01:46.679> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
little bit more than what we needed to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.099 
little bit more than what we needed to
so<00:01:47.670> we're<00:01:47.789> gonna<00:01:47.880> fill<00:01:48.210> back<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
so we're gonna fill back in just a

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.560 
so we're gonna fill back in just a
little<00:01:49.350> bit<00:01:49.499> before<00:01:50.340> we<00:01:50.549> put<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:50.999> our<00:01:51.119> gravel

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
little bit before we put in our gravel

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.310 
little bit before we put in our gravel
base<00:01:53.210> right<00:01:54.210> now<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.780> working<00:01:54.990> on

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
base right now I'm just working on

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.709 
base right now I'm just working on
getting<00:01:55.499> the<00:01:55.829> proper<00:01:56.340> level<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.630> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.149 
getting the proper level just want to
make<00:01:57.840> sure<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.229> we're<00:01:58.439> pitched<00:01:58.859> a<00:01:59.039> little

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
make sure that we're pitched a little

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.660 
make sure that we're pitched a little
bit<00:01:59.399> away<00:01:59.700> from<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.060> door

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.990 

we<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.820> safely<00:02:09.270> take<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.869> our<00:02:10.050> strings<00:02:10.380> now

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
we can safely take out our strings now

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.160 
we can safely take out our strings now
now<00:02:12.000> we're<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.240> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> nail<00:02:12.690> our<00:02:12.720> forms

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
now we're just going to nail our forms

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.980 
now we're just going to nail our forms
together<00:02:17.030> just<00:02:18.030> need<00:02:18.210> enough<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.630> contain

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
together just need enough to contain

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.710 
together just need enough to contain
things<00:02:20.450> yeah<00:02:21.560> perfectly<00:02:22.560> level<00:02:22.860> there<00:02:23.720> when

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
things yeah perfectly level there when

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.710 
things yeah perfectly level there when
you<00:02:24.840> put<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.050> slab<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:25.770> grade<00:02:25.950> like<00:02:26.520> this<00:02:26.820> if<00:02:27.540> you

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
you put a slab on grade like this if you

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.000 
you put a slab on grade like this if you
have<00:02:27.870> any<00:02:27.990> water<00:02:28.290> movement<00:02:28.830> whatsoever

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
have any water movement whatsoever

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.250 
have any water movement whatsoever
underneath<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> slab<00:02:30.270> it'll<00:02:30.690> cause<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.870> slab

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
underneath the slab it'll cause the slab

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.620 
underneath the slab it'll cause the slab
to<00:02:31.470> move<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.890> buckle<00:02:32.250> by<00:02:32.730> placing<00:02:33.180> gravel

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
to move in to buckle by placing gravel

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.540 
to move in to buckle by placing gravel
underneath<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.650> will<00:02:34.800> allow<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> free

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
underneath that will allow for the free

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.750 
underneath that will allow for the free
flow<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:35.940> water<00:02:36.470> underneath<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.709> slab<00:02:38.010> as

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
flow of water underneath of the slab as

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.240 
flow of water underneath of the slab as
we<00:02:39.000> put<00:02:39.209> some<00:02:39.390> Zachary<00:02:39.930> all-purpose<00:02:40.709> gravel

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
we put some Zachary all-purpose gravel

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.750 
we put some Zachary all-purpose gravel
into<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.090> excavation<00:02:43.430> typically<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.550> don't

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
into the excavation typically you don't

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.790 
into the excavation typically you don't
need<00:02:44.910> more<00:02:45.209> than<00:02:45.390> an<00:02:45.570> inch<00:02:45.750> or<00:02:45.959> two<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.170> gravel

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
need more than an inch or two of gravel

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.510 
need more than an inch or two of gravel
yeah<00:02:47.670> we<00:02:47.790> are<00:02:47.910> perfectly<00:02:48.420> level<00:02:48.780> side-to-side

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
yeah we are perfectly level side-to-side

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.010 
yeah we are perfectly level side-to-side
we<00:02:50.520> have<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.940> very<00:02:50.970> slight<00:02:51.450> pitch<00:02:51.510> away

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
we have just a very slight pitch away

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.410 
we have just a very slight pitch away
from<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.470> building<00:02:53.150> we're<00:02:54.150> ready<00:02:54.330> for

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
from the building we're ready for

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:26.630 
from the building we're ready for
concrete

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.970 

this<00:03:27.640> is<00:03:27.819> an<00:03:27.909> 80<00:03:28.060> pound<00:03:28.390> bag<00:03:28.599> of<00:03:28.629> concrete

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
this is an 80 pound bag of concrete

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.530 
this is an 80 pound bag of concrete
which<00:03:29.980> calls<00:03:30.280> for<00:03:30.430> approximately<00:03:31.209> three<00:03:31.450> and

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
which calls for approximately three and

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.449 
which calls for approximately three and
a<00:03:31.569> half<00:03:31.689> to<00:03:31.870> four<00:03:32.019> quarts<00:03:32.409> of<00:03:32.530> water<00:03:32.769> so<00:03:33.340> I'm

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
a half to four quarts of water so I'm

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.129 
a half to four quarts of water so I'm
going<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.700> begin<00:03:34.000> by<00:03:34.209> adding<00:03:34.420> most<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:35.049> the

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 
going to begin by adding most of the

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.050 
going to begin by adding most of the
water<00:03:35.349> and<00:03:35.590> then<00:03:36.129> holding<00:03:36.489> some<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:36.879> reserve

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
water and then holding some in reserve

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.479 
water and then holding some in reserve
if<00:03:37.689> we<00:03:38.019> need<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.379> you<00:03:38.829> don't<00:03:38.859> have<00:03:39.159> to<00:03:39.310> use<00:03:39.459> a

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
if we need it you don't have to use a

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.099 
if we need it you don't have to use a
mixer<00:03:39.879> when<00:03:40.030> you're<00:03:40.180> pouring<00:03:40.420> concrete<00:03:40.659> you

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
mixer when you're pouring concrete you

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.690 
mixer when you're pouring concrete you
can<00:03:41.290> mix<00:03:41.470> in<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.680> wheel<00:03:41.829> bar<00:03:42.069> you<00:03:42.220> can<00:03:42.370> mix<00:03:42.549> in

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
can mix in a wheel bar you can mix in

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.179 
can mix in a wheel bar you can mix in
them<00:03:42.790> in<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.120> mortar<00:03:43.450> pan<00:03:43.689> but<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.590> mixer<00:03:44.980> makes

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
them in a mortar pan but a mixer makes

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.420 
them in a mortar pan but a mixer makes
life<00:03:45.459> much<00:03:45.909> simpler<00:03:46.419> this<00:03:46.870> particular<00:03:47.430> slab

the day and it will make our job much
easier<00:04:04.379> I'm<00:04:05.379> adding<00:04:05.680> just<00:04:05.709> a<00:04:05.950> little<00:04:06.189> bit<00:04:06.280> of

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
easier I'm adding just a little bit of

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.729 
easier I'm adding just a little bit of
water<00:04:06.549> at<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.790> time<00:04:07.169> when<00:04:08.169> you<00:04:08.290> first<00:04:08.470> start

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
water at a time when you first start

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.740 
water at a time when you first start
mixing<00:04:08.919> concrete<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:10.389> tendency

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
mixing concrete that the tendency

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.539 
mixing concrete that the tendency
immediately<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.500> ball<00:04:11.829> up<00:04:11.859> you<00:04:12.250> need<00:04:12.430> to

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
immediately is to ball up you need to

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.640 
immediately is to ball up you need to
add<00:04:12.669> enough<00:04:12.940> water<00:04:12.970> until<00:04:13.930> all<00:04:14.139> those<00:04:14.290> balls

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
add enough water until all those balls

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.979 
add enough water until all those balls
go<00:04:14.979> away<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.639> the<00:04:16.120> material<00:04:16.539> is<00:04:16.599> dropping

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
go away and the material is dropping

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.719 
go away and the material is dropping
freely<00:04:17.409> from<00:04:17.620> one<00:04:17.829> flight<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.159> the<00:04:18.370> next

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
freely from one flight to the next

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.479 
freely from one flight to the next
inside<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.269> mixer<00:04:20.039> you'll<00:04:21.039> notice<00:04:21.370> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
inside the mixer you'll notice the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.600 
inside the mixer you'll notice the
consistency<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.180> this<00:04:22.389> concrete<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:24.460> might

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
consistency of this concrete you might

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.710 
consistency of this concrete you might
think<00:04:24.789> it's<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:24.909> little<00:04:25.030> bit<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.479> stiff

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
think it's a little bit on the stiff

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.050 
think it's a little bit on the stiff
side<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.590> is<00:04:26.770> actually<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.340> consistency

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
side this is actually the consistency

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.760 
side this is actually the consistency
you're<00:04:28.210> looking<00:04:28.270> for<00:04:28.840> when<00:04:29.409> you<00:04:29.560> make<00:04:29.710> a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
you're looking for when you make a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.610 
you're looking for when you make a
concrete<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:30.760> wet<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:31.750> wants<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.139> fill

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
concrete so wet that it wants to fill

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.649 
concrete so wet that it wants to fill
into<00:04:32.830> all<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.310> spaces<00:04:33.610> by<00:04:34.000> itself<00:04:34.419> without

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
into all the spaces by itself without

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.290 
into all the spaces by itself without
any<00:04:35.020> movement<00:04:35.320> you've<00:04:36.310> compromised<00:04:36.970> the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
any movement you've compromised the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.029 
any movement you've compromised the
integrity<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.080> product<00:04:38.349> you've<00:04:38.710> now<00:04:38.860> got

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
integrity of the product you've now got

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.050 
integrity of the product you've now got
a<00:04:39.070> product<00:04:39.550> that's<00:04:39.699> going<00:04:39.849> to<00:04:39.940> be

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
a product that's going to be

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.029 
a product that's going to be
considerably<00:04:40.630> weaker<00:04:41.110> than<00:04:41.680> what<00:04:41.860> it's

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
considerably weaker than what it's

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.969 
considerably weaker than what it's

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
designed to be all right we should have

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.589 
designed to be all right we should have
close<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.460> the<00:04:45.580> amount<00:04:45.849> of<00:04:45.940> material<00:04:46.389> that<00:04:46.419> we

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
close to the amount of material that we

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.310 
close to the amount of material that we
need<00:04:46.810> now<00:04:47.229> if<00:04:47.830> not<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.220> little<00:04:48.430> bit<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:49.320> little

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
need now if not a little bit a little

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
bit more so what we're going to do don't

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.800 
bit more so what we're going to do don't

this off at this point just to make sure
we've<00:04:58.930> got<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.229> right<00:04:59.349> amount<00:04:59.409> of<00:04:59.740> material

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.399 

what<00:05:04.240> we're<00:05:04.360> going<00:05:04.479> to<00:05:04.509> do<00:05:04.690> now<00:05:04.900> is<00:05:05.080> just<00:05:05.110> take

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
what we're going to do now is just take

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.520 
what we're going to do now is just take
some<00:05:05.470> of<00:05:05.800> this<00:05:05.889> and<00:05:06.159> make<00:05:06.280> sure<00:05:06.490> we've<00:05:06.729> got

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
some of this and make sure we've got

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:18.180 
some of this and make sure we've got
everything<00:05:08.530> filled

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.469 

all<00:05:19.190> we're<00:05:19.400> doing<00:05:19.639> right<00:05:19.789> now<00:05:19.849> is<00:05:20.270> just

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
all we're doing right now is just

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.330 
all we're doing right now is just
basically<00:05:20.930> leveling<00:05:21.530> can<00:05:21.800> take<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.130> board

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
basically leveling can take the board

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.540 
basically leveling can take the board
back<00:05:22.580> up<00:05:22.849> start<00:05:23.330> again<00:05:23.979> you'll<00:05:24.979> notice<00:05:25.190> we're

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
back up start again you'll notice we're

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.809 
back up start again you'll notice we're
moving<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.000> board<00:05:26.240> in<00:05:26.449> a<00:05:26.539> sawing<00:05:27.110> action

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
moving the board in a sawing action

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.210 
moving the board in a sawing action
that's<00:05:28.819> very<00:05:29.090> important<00:05:29.690> because<00:05:30.039> one<00:05:31.039> it's

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
that's very important because one it's

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.860 
that's very important because one it's
very<00:05:31.400> difficult<00:05:31.759> to<00:05:31.880> drag<00:05:32.120> this<00:05:32.330> across<00:05:32.509> the

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
very difficult to drag this across the

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.400 
very difficult to drag this across the
concrete<00:05:33.349> if<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:33.680> don't<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.419> two<00:05:35.419> this<00:05:36.110> helps

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
concrete if you don't and two this helps

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.960 
concrete if you don't and two this helps
to<00:05:36.530> ensure<00:05:36.650> that<00:05:37.039> everything<00:05:37.310> is<00:05:37.610> completely

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
to ensure that everything is completely

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.370 
to ensure that everything is completely
filled<00:05:38.360> you<00:05:38.569> won't<00:05:38.780> have<00:05:38.930> any<00:05:39.080> voids

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
filled you won't have any voids

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.040 
filled you won't have any voids
underneath<00:05:40.099> if<00:05:40.789> you<00:05:40.970> use<00:05:41.120> this<00:05:41.330> sawing<00:05:41.870> action

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
underneath if you use this sawing action

00:05:42.050 --> 00:06:13.089 
underneath if you use this sawing action
here

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.619 

the<00:06:14.099> two<00:06:14.310> biggest<00:06:14.580> things<00:06:14.789> that<00:06:15.060> people<00:06:15.479> do

the two biggest things that people do

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:17.689 
the two biggest things that people do
wrong<00:06:15.659> with<00:06:16.050> concrete<00:06:16.469> are<00:06:16.680> one<00:06:16.889> over<00:06:17.430> water

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
wrong with concrete are one over water

and<00:06:18.000> two<00:06:18.419> over<00:06:18.930> trowel<00:06:19.319> if<00:06:19.650> I<00:06:20.250> take<00:06:20.550> this

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 
and two over trowel if I take this

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.629 
and two over trowel if I take this
trowel<00:06:21.240> and<00:06:21.569> I<00:06:21.960> continue<00:06:22.650> right<00:06:22.889> now<00:06:23.129> to<00:06:23.189> work

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
the fines to the surface when you do

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.869 
the fines to the surface when you do
that<00:06:31.169> and<00:06:31.529> the<00:06:31.620> water<00:06:31.889> in<00:06:32.069> the<00:06:32.159> fines<00:06:32.430> come<00:06:32.789> to

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
that and the water in the fines come to

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.480 
that and the water in the fines come to
the<00:06:33.000> surface<00:06:33.680> unnaturally<00:06:34.680> you're<00:06:35.310> going<00:06:35.430> to

the surface unnaturally you're going to

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.420 
the surface unnaturally you're going to
create<00:06:35.789> a<00:06:36.120> weak<00:06:36.389> surface<00:06:36.960> if<00:06:37.409> you<00:06:37.949> can<00:06:38.129> see<00:06:38.310> the

surface of this it looks like there's

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.429 
surface of this it looks like there's
kind<00:06:39.990> of<00:06:40.050> a<00:06:40.139> wet<00:06:40.409> sheen<00:06:40.800> to<00:06:41.129> it<00:06:41.900> once<00:06:42.900> that<00:06:43.169> wet

kind of a wet sheen to it once that wet
Sheen<00:06:43.830> goes<00:06:44.159> away<00:06:44.490> then<00:06:45.389> we'll<00:06:45.659> know<00:06:45.870> that

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
Sheen goes away then we'll know that

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.510 
Sheen goes away then we'll know that
it's<00:06:46.169> time<00:06:46.500> to<00:06:46.680> come<00:06:46.889> back<00:06:47.039> with<00:06:47.310> a<00:06:47.340> different
