move up the Proms attach the grill front
grille<00:01:32.270> bumper<00:01:33.219> the<00:01:34.219> wheels<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:36.380> this

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
grille bumper the wheels and this

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.910 
grille bumper the wheels and this
essentially<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:38.479> robot<00:01:38.869> this<00:01:39.439> is<00:01:39.770> his

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
essentially is the robot this is his

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.960 
essentially is the robot this is his
backpack<00:01:41.289> kind<00:01:42.289> of<00:01:42.380> sucks<00:01:42.619> but<00:01:42.979> I<00:01:43.280> guess

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
backpack kind of sucks but I guess

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.749

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
that's how they made it so accurate so

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.210 
that's how they made it so accurate so

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
legs can sign him up at this point we

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.820 
legs can sign him up at this point we
have<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.549> feet<00:01:59.470> check<00:02:00.470> out<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.890> arms<00:02:01.599> rotate
