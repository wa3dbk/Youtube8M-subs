but embedded into here you have an NFC
chip<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.520> all<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> need<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> read<00:00:36.630> the

information is place my device on top of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.869 
information is place my device on top of
it<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:40.290> move<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.790> will

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it and just move it and then it will

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
it and just move it and then it will
scan<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.120> now<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.360> stored<00:00:42.750> no<00:00:42.870> data<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> ship

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you can see on this one is 137 bytes

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.530 
you can see on this one is 137 bytes
that<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.640> stored<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.210> particular

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.620 
that can be stored on to this particular
tag<00:01:10.610> then<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.180> read<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> information

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
tag then I can read that information
