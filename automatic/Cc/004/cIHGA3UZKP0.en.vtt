 during the day thank you by invitation 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.039
 this is 50% of the book what has 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.480
 that see authors 100 33 in what has 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.099
 that see the production is missing the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.570
 editorial that has been part very 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.969
 important but good we are very 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.780
 happy to be here in this house 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.329
 particularly to talk about a dream 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.969
 that this one that has let us sleep in the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.270
 last the last weeks how much has 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.840
 what to see and the fact that you are 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.539
 Florida and was born on August 25 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.180
 to develop this good story there are 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.590
 things that are conditioning until the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.329
 names conditions we just talked about 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 'Martian chronicles' as the first 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:02.310
 our product the first book 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.830
 somehow this reference to 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.520
 redrado wine but is also linked with 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.120
 our name I think it has to do 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.590
 surely with all that and good is one 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.600
 of the roads that we have chosen for 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.030
 to communicate there are others and what is it about 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.470
 the dream of san jose to go 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.090
 discovering people now let's see 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.790
 we are seeing images of a cedé that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.680
 it is precisely this presentation 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.280
 of the book that is not only the book but 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.229
 also accompanying images and good 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.030
 what is the dream of san jose 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.979
 that thing is the continuation of the code 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.140
 white the plan code is a book of 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.170
 historical fiction that was dictated in the year 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.759
 2007 was gold book sold 16 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.710
 thousand copies for us was a 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.590
 tremendous pride a responsibility one 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.990
 big backpack to be able to integrate that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.610
 throw the second part flight never 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.320
 they were good and from there 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.570
 we elaborated with the Martian with my son 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.520
 the dream of san jose is also fiction 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.410
 historical it is not necessary to have read the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.660
 code talk is to understand this by 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.060
 more than the characters are the same 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.770
 studied to jose has as trigger 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.929
 the presence of an Italian cardinal 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.229
 called giovanni and later ferretti 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.060
 that in the year 1823 arrives in montevideo is 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.519
 started in a masonic lodge in 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.500
 montevideo a lodge integrated by the 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.410
 more preclear minds of those times 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.560
 from Uruguay, nascent francisco coins 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.660
 figueroa decided today in Dámaso Antonio 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.670
 Larrañaga started Freemasonry and 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.830
 This good lord will kill Ferretti 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.590
 will become the pope over the years 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.319
 ninth or pionono maybe one of the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.870
 most important popes of the pontificate a 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.660
 from there that is the trigger the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.549
 presence of different events 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:48.540
 that have gone unnoticed now 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:52.049
 they are like first novel with reality 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.599
 increased if that wants that's a 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.220
 additional the book is written in two 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.269
 plans the past and present of the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.549
 even chapters are developed in 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.620
 1823 and 24 odd at present 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.299
 the protagonists must happen those who 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.540
 decode what happened in the 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.160
 previous chapter for that the reader will 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.380
 proposes as the fifth 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.390
 agonist the fifth decoder the 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.020
 book has every so many small pages 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.190
 qr codes like those that appear in the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.450
 bus stops on the ballots 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.540
 etc 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.400
 those in the book you bring the cds 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.110
 placed on the computer is installed alone 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.760
 it is not necessary to have any kind of 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:37.200
 knowledge and when one comes east 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.770
 the code shows the webcam that 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.140
 code and from the book leaves image comes out 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.920
 sound and it goes out in motion that is to say there 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.080
 videos loaded in the book that allow 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.910
 somehow testify what is it 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.300
 that arises as well as reality what is 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.800
 say if you come fiction the book is 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.930
 intellectually honest does not intend 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.510
 sell a hidden story that does not 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.970
 taught at school we entered the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.520
 cde in history what we see in the 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.050
 book in the novel in that novel 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.710
 story that we can then stop and 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.990
 say yes 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.150
 this happened clearly because it happens that 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.670
 propose important data such as 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.769
 example that in this country the buildings 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.690
 they were built aligned 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.940
 of what are called lines far lines 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.340
 of energy so much in a first line in 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.560
 eastern tip that joins the stop 10 of 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.870
 guillermo marconi where william lived 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.000
 marconi with the abandoned church of 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.590
 willow of portezuelo the castle of piria 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.770
 and the castle of pita miguel is to say 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.080
 religion of alchemy and masonry 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.780
 in a line zone but also in 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.509
 montevideo then to say that is 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.060
 good to show you raise that the book 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.650
 proposes the existence of the work of art 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.319
 largest in the world in our country 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.620
 absolutely divisible exclusively 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.030
 from the air those are data that are 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.759
 real 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:03.360
 fiction is how we have 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:05.130
 tied that data so that it 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.680
 necessarily you have to read the first 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.419
 book to understand this necessarily 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.400
 you have to resort to that technological part 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.240
 or the one who wants to read it on the beach 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.430
 for example we are on vacation 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.050
 can do it and understand the book without 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.520
 no type achieves is it good 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.440
 question of the book was intended to 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.780
 that defends itself only from the paper and the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.030
 absolute ink 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.250
 clearly help the other is a support that 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.660
 that makes the story credible is more there 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.410
 many people who have opted for 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.660
 read it and then to complement it 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.880
 to not stop and talking about 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.610
 technological one is also youtube 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.060
 facebook twitter all networks 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.590
 social and technological issues has had a 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.090
 important presence starting with is a 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.760
 book with a trailer thing that is not 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.340
 common this but has had a presence 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.740
 important what has moved us in the 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.850
 last 30 days we have done 2,000 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.780
 kilometers of 10 presentations 650 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.610
 people 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.470
 we have come together to talk this 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.510
 book and they really are very happy 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.360
 with the path that has taken the dream of 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.820
 san josé because it's a project of 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.680
 family more than a literary project 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.870
 individual marcelo and the title of the book 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.310
 is based on a box of blanning the 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.080
 reference to one of the works of speaking 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.240
 the dream of san jose that is also a 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.520
 biblical passage but in this case 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.800
 refers to the work of this 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.630
 blanes and the name of the lodge from which 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.180
 we spoke at the beginning now the lodge of 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.750
 San Jose that in the hospital chapel 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:33.120
 more if he had the initiation of this 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.190
 Italian cardinal giuseppe el ferreti la 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.340
 presence and the existence of a treasure 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.479
 absolutely is a millionaire 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.430
 evaluated at some time in seven thousand 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.650
 millions of dollars that is hidden 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.330
 in the bowels of Montevideo in 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.729
 opportunity of the master's visit and 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.789
 ferretti the search for that treasure the 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:52.680
 Freemasonry the church is looking for and 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:55.020
 trying to recover that treasure until 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.000
 these days in the presentation I do not know 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.039
 let's ask some questions 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.490
 in the book we necessarily find 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:04.169
 the answers if most of them and 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.820
 if we leave like the 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.130
 code plans some open endings 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.710
 they propose is good propose the 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.810
 interaction there is a lot of respect towards the 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.340
 reader the reader is taken as a 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.720
 very important person us 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.180
 we understand that the reader should 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.669
 become active has part 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:25.590
 active decides decides thinks suggests 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:26.759
 this one imagines some endings but it's a 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.740
 important parts of what 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:32.270
 we said is to be intellectually honest 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.270
 when presenting a story
