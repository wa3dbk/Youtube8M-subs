00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.870 
the whole experience for me now i'm not
sure<00:03:07.140> if<00:03:07.260> he<00:03:07.380> could<00:03:07.530> do<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.710> whole<00:03:07.800> album<00:03:08.250> where

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
sure if he could do a whole album where

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.820 
sure if he could do a whole album where
it's<00:03:09.000> all<00:03:09.150> street<00:03:09.510> narrative<00:03:09.930> talking<00:03:10.590> about

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
it's all street narrative talking about

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.890 
it's all street narrative talking about
what<00:03:11.280> he's<00:03:11.370> been<00:03:11.610> through<00:03:11.640> his<00:03:12.090> experiences

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
what he's been through his experiences

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.720 
what he's been through his experiences
struggle<00:03:13.530> because<00:03:13.800> maybe<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.250> would<00:03:14.370> be<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
struggle because maybe that would be a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.270 
struggle because maybe that would be a
little<00:03:15.240> depressing<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.930> one-dimensional

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
little depressing and one-dimensional

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.740 
little depressing and one-dimensional
but<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> first<00:03:17.550> couple<00:03:17.730> songs<00:03:18.060> sort<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.540> set

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
but the first couple songs sort of set

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.449 
but the first couple songs sort of set
you<00:03:18.870> up<00:03:18.930> for<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.200> because<00:03:19.470> that's<00:03:19.739> that's

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.460 
you up for that because that's that's
how<00:03:20.790> he<00:03:20.850> leads<00:03:21.209> into<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:21.540> album<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.350> know

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
lot of beats that really sound out of

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.600 
lot of beats that really sound out of
place<00:04:36.570> which<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.290> always<00:04:37.830> appreciate<00:04:38.310> when

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
when an iris can do that but even though

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.189 
when an iris can do that but even though
the<00:04:40.949> beats<00:04:41.250> flow<00:04:41.580> into<00:04:42.180> one<00:04:42.330> another<00:04:42.600> the

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
the beats flow into one another the

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.520 
the beats flow into one another the
content<00:04:43.850> sort<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:44.970> shifts<00:04:45.479> you<00:04:46.050> know<00:04:46.169> like<00:04:46.380> I

expect<00:06:33.210> an<00:06:33.419> artist<00:06:33.690> to<00:06:33.750> make<00:06:33.870> an<00:06:33.960> album<00:06:34.169> where

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680

the whole thing relates to everybody

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.630 
the whole thing relates to everybody
just<00:06:36.990> pretty<00:06:37.590> much<00:06:37.770> impossible<00:06:37.920> to<00:06:38.310> do<00:06:38.400> that

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
would be an amazing feat that would

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.840 
would be an amazing feat that would
probably<00:06:40.530> only<00:06:40.590> happen<00:06:40.980> once<00:06:41.340> every<00:06:41.520> 10<00:06:41.820> years

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850
