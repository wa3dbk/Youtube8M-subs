00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.667
 Vayu the Wind 

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.917
 By Madhuri Pai 

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:18.417
 Every time I have been in a warm, hot bath 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.083
 my wet body feels so wonderful, so wonderfully cool. 

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:25.667
 How did that happen? 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.000
 That is because of Vayu the Wind! 

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:32.083
 The milk in my cup - way and way too hot. 

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:35.000
 But he soon cooled down. 

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:36.750
 How did that happen? 

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:40.083
 That is because of Vayu the Wind! 

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.667
 The curtains flutter at the window 

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.417
 and gently caress my face. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.083
 How did that happen? 

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:50.000
 That is because of Vayu the Wind! 

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.750
 A lightning bolt far away. 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.500
 Dark clouds float towards me. 

00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:58.750
 How did that happen? 

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:00.833
 That is because of Vayu the Wind! 

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:05.250
 Waving tree branches and leaves shaking. 

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:08.000
 Blossom falls gently. 

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.917
 Who did all that? 

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:11.750
 Vayu the Wind! 

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:14.917
 We play far from home 

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:17.750
 and yet I can smell the cookies 

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:19.833
 that mother bakes. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.167
 How did that happen? 

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.083
 That is because of Vayu the Wind! 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.667
 A glass can on the windowsill 

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:30.167
 falls to the ground. 

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.917
 Thank goodness I wasn't around. 

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:34.917
 Who was so naughty? 

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:38.667
 That was of course Vayu the Wind! 

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:42.750
 A whistle sounds. A train enters. 

00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:46.583
 I can't see that, but I hear the noise. 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.417
 How did that happen? 

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:50.250
 That is because of Vayu the Wind! 

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:52.083
 Can't be seen 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.750
 Can't be heard 

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:55.833
 Does all the work 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.250
 Without a word. 

00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.833
 Who can it be? 

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:02.000
 The wind of course!
