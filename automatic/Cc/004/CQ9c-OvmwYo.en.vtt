00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.040
 now all welcome to this new 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.229
 Video tutorial guitar and be located 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.269
 union on this occasion we will learn that 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:12.900
 we will learn a theme of dragon buy and jim 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.820
 and the subject is capricious of this occasion 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.440
 very easy 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.490
 and I will try to be as simple as possible 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.789
 proceed well explain to the chords and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.220
 the royal 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.960
 but in a moment if we first go with 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.000
 the chords we will need 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.420
 eight chords to 68 chords which are 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.420
 I am 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.030
 it's a very well-known agreement for us 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.030
 that we always use 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.580
 I remembered the minor 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.140
 the king chord 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.360
 the chord fa 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.730
 I agreed to my minor 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.820
 the chord 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.740
 the chord if minor 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.020
 in the nut only I can what 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.740
 they put up the fifth string in is a 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.270
 others yes 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.140
 between the images anyway are 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.140
 the images of victims 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.260
 and the last cut is if seventh look 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.020
 well the position of the finger the index finger 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.060
 fourth string on the first fret and the 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.840
 three other fingers go in the second 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.510
 fret but so goes the middle finger in the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.100
 fifth string on the second fret finger 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.930
 cancel 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.060
 the third string of the second fret and 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.689
 the little finger on the first string of 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.689
 second fret 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.440
 those are the eight orders that we are going to 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.780
 need for this song are 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.480
 easy to learn all so I do not know 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.370
 worry, practice them and so that 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.720
 moment to change us interspersed be 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.720
 much simpler for you 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.769
 he explained the chords we go to 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.659
 strum the regio is also very easy if 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.659
 for an image to be an idea 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.400
 is twice down and twice for 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.400
 up and once down it's like that 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.930
 look at the rhythm of this song that is the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.239
 rhythm that happens with strumming is slow 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.480
 but neither is it so slow is a rhythm 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.480
 soft 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.260
 more or less when I played the song they go 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.260
 to touch something like that 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.820
 it's a bit slow slow well I hope that 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.960
 after violence it was clear if twice 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.830
 down twice up 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:21.510
 and one last time down 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.370
 but now let's start with the song in 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.370
 yes I will put the entire letter of the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.490
 song and the just one that shortens chords it 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.420
 they play in that part 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.020
 in account of how it is played 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.020
 and let's go 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.810
 if they have problems at the moment of 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.479
 change a chord or complicate them 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.789
 much practice space and in some 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.810
 moment will come out if space and 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.880
 then drive to give more speed 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.849
 well that has been all the fear of the day 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.210
