00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.260
 hello i am lennart i am the product 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.850
 specialist of fietscomputerstore.nl 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.679
 Brighton has one with their driving series 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.330
 series of bicycle computers released where 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.710
 the accent with every model somewhere else 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.259
 and to give you some insight 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.859
 in where every aksept light 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.750
 I review the Bryton Rider 21 today 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.240
 the bryton rider 21 is actually 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.830
 same as the rider 20 plus is alone 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.929
 providing this with a barometric 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.800
 altimeter causing that height 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.800
 exact 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.620
 if you choose a package then sit 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.729
 there in the Dutch summary 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.799
 instructions 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:43.559
 the cable to connect with you 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:44.820
 PC of course the bike computer itself 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.610
 handlebar holder with the connection them 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.589
 elastics if you choose the model t 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.390
 then this is the all in and then sit 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.970
 we also added the combined cadence 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.400
 and speed sensor is the cadence sensor 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.049
 on the front and cooperates with this 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.940
 that of weakness and pedal and speed 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.460
 its kind that cooperation with this die 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.409
 you attach to your speech and of course 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.970
 the heart rate sensor weighs the rider 21 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.710
 only 40 grams and and works through 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.060
 of a very sensitive integrated 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.650
 GPS system 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.450
 he measures things by default, among other things 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.510
 as speed distance and burned 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.040
 calories and he also has one 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.600
 barometric altimeter so you next 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.730
 that your exact height is also one 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.170
 can show a slope percentage 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.610
 if you turn it around, see the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.620
 back of course here it 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.780
 handlebar mounting system and 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.190
 this is where you need the usb cable 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.870
 Close 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.770
 on the bottom we see three 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.890
 buttons 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.620
 of which is the budgeted blue button to one 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.360
 mark the circle with this you stop it 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.110
 and say you still pause with this you go again 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.479
 further 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.820
 and with this button you browse through me now 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.720
 if you are the rider 21 or the rider 20 plus 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.640
 takes into use 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.210
 first select your age digitally 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.930
 and weight the signals from the optional 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.370
 heart rate sensor and the combined 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.630
 speed and cadence sensor 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.860
 automatically linked to you 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.299
 cycle computer 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.220
 as soon as you start cycling you get on you 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.470
 display current data within three 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.700
 different data windows on those three 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.830
 windows you can have eight different 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.930
 read staff views and you can do it yourself 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.970
 programming the available 42 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.830
 data fields which display you want 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.890
 see this way you have in three 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.480
 screens always 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.310
 information that is important to you 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.110
 your specific exercise 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.300
 the training options are less 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.530
 extended than the 40 but prepare it 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.480
 is sufficient for the people who want 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.830
 work on their speed condition or time 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.720
 per distance 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.550
 You can also upload your data 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.959
 to brighton sport point com 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.480
 see your driven route and you 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.520
 analyze training every time you do 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.180
 driver connects to your PC you will 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.180
 software updated 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.050
 although the rider 21 is equipped with a 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.430
 accurate eps system that you won't 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.050
 tell you which way to cycle 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.770
 so it has no compass on it, no map 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.360
 and he gives no 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.980
 directions if you have something like that 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.470
 looking then you should actually look at 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.690
 the rider 50 as in the capacities of 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.400
 the rider 21 will then utilize fully 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.470
 its actually oct package 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.470
 order in the package is namely the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.640
 combined speed and cadence sensor 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.440
 and of course the heart rate sensor 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.760
 including the row 21 is small is set to 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.930
 it is user friendly 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.700

 in addition, it is well readable through it 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.630
 anti-glare screen and the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.630
 backlight for the dark 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.900
 the rider 21 gets up on brighton itself 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.000
 marketed as the bike computer for 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.980
 every day and I'll give you quite right in 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.150
 he is easy to bina and fast 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.130
 accurate and he also has it 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.690
