prides themselves and the build quality

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.630 
prides themselves and the build quality
as<00:00:22.170> well<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> design<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.980> their<00:00:23.130> products<00:00:23.490> and

generally<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.300> shows<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.109> lunatic<00:00:25.500> doesn't

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
generally it shows now lunatic doesn't

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.410 
generally it shows now lunatic doesn't
tell<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> how<00:00:26.099> far<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.699> actually<00:00:27.060> drop

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
tell you how far you can actually drop

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.580 
tell you how far you can actually drop
it<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.750> i'm<00:00:27.869> guessing<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.289> didn't<00:00:28.470> actually

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it so i'm guessing they didn't actually

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.099 
it so i'm guessing they didn't actually
go<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> test<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.029> their<00:00:30.539> faq

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
go and do the test but and their faq

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.720 
go and do the test but and their faq
they<00:00:31.289> say<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:31.949> somebody<00:00:32.189> riding<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
they say you know somebody riding a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.370 
they say you know somebody riding a
motorcycle<00:00:33.329> dropped<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.840> fell<00:00:34.050> off<00:00:34.200> while

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
motorcycle dropped it fell off while

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.110 
motorcycle dropped it fell off while
they<00:00:34.559> were<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.920> at<00:00:35.130> 50<00:00:35.250> miles<00:00:35.579> per<00:00:35.700> hour<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
they were going at 50 miles per hour so

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.250 
they were going at 50 miles per hour so
they<00:00:36.270> make<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.570> sound<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.020> pretty

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
they make it sound like it's pretty

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.380 
they make it sound like it's pretty
tough<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> entire<00:00:38.550> phone<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.090> sits

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
tough so the entire phone kind of sits

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.479 
tough so the entire phone kind of sits
in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> middle<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.680> silicon<00:00:41.190> there's

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
in the middle of the silicon there's

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.220 
in the middle of the silicon there's
about<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> half<00:00:42.210> an<00:00:42.390> inch<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.660> silicone<00:00:42.989> around

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
about a half an inch of silicone around

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.049 
about a half an inch of silicone around
the<00:00:43.320> entire<00:00:43.590> phone<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.340> call<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.640> an<00:00:44.760> impact

triangles in it whatnot the things that
we<00:00:47.879> look<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.329> our<00:00:48.390> drop<00:00:48.629> test<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
we look for in our drop test is just to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.660 
we look for in our drop test is just to
see<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.469> there's<00:00:49.620> any<00:00:49.770> physical<00:00:50.039> damage<00:00:50.309> to

screwed together so there's almost no

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.459 
screwed together so there's almost no
chance<00:01:49.640> other<00:01:49.819> than<00:01:50.030> somehow<00:01:50.810> we're<00:01:51.020> tearing

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
chance other than somehow we're tearing

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.649 
chance other than somehow we're tearing
apart<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.890> pub<00:01:52.130> polymer<00:01:52.909> polycarbonate

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
apart the pub polymer polycarbonate

apart the pub polymer polycarbonate
plastic<00:01:54.079> thing<00:01:54.200> apart

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
plastic thing apart

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:03.999 
plastic thing apart
we'll<00:01:55.819> do<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.030> speedy<00:01:56.539> test<00:01:56.950> speedy<00:02:03.009> still

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
we'll do a speedy test speedy still

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:14.350 
we'll do a speedy test speedy still
going<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:05.049> if<00:02:06.049> we<00:02:06.200> do<00:02:06.349> a<00:02:06.380> hole<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.120> is<00:02:14.299> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
going and if we do a hole so this is the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.850 
going and if we do a hole so this is the
last<00:02:14.540> test<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.840> we're<00:02:15.019> gonna<00:02:15.170> do<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.650> we're

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
last test that we're gonna do and we're

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.250 
last test that we're gonna do and we're
gonna<00:02:16.010> make<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> doozy<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:20.150> I'm<00:02:20.660> gonna<00:02:20.870> try

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
gonna make it a doozy so I'm gonna try

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.289 
gonna make it a doozy so I'm gonna try
to<00:02:21.319> toss<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.829> phones<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:24.910> totally<00:02:25.910> missed

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.180 

we're<00:02:29.299> gonna<00:02:29.450> do<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.690> one<00:02:29.959> more<00:02:30.170> time<00:02:30.440> this

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
we're gonna do that one more time this

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.120 
we're gonna do that one more time this
time<00:02:31.250> I'm<00:02:32.030> going<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.269> try<00:02:32.450> not<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.660> fail<00:02:33.130> and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
time I'm going to try not to fail and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:47.860 
time I'm going to try not to fail and
we're<00:02:34.340> gonna<00:02:44.650> still<00:02:45.650> filming<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.970> after<00:02:47.599> all

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
we're gonna still filming so after all

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.229 
we're gonna still filming so after all
those<00:02:48.260> drops<00:02:48.889> the<00:02:49.280> one<00:02:49.430> thing<00:02:49.670> we<00:02:49.790> did<00:02:50.060> notice

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
those drops the one thing we did notice

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.330 
those drops the one thing we did notice
was<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:51.670> this<00:02:52.670> piece<00:02:53.180> doesn't<00:02:54.079> fit<00:02:54.530> into<00:02:54.769> the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
was that this piece doesn't fit into the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.319 
was that this piece doesn't fit into the
plug<00:02:55.849> anymore<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.389> are<00:03:01.000> gonna<00:03:02.000> guess

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
plug anymore and so we are gonna guess

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.879 
plug anymore and so we are gonna guess
that<00:03:02.359> we<00:03:02.780> dropped<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.169> on<00:03:03.260> corner<00:03:03.620> which<00:03:03.769> it

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
that we dropped it on corner which it

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.640 
that we dropped it on corner which it
look<00:03:04.010> like<00:03:04.190> we<00:03:04.310> did<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:05.109> something's<00:03:06.109> bent<00:03:06.440> on

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
look like we did and something's bent on

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.479 
look like we did and something's bent on
the<00:03:06.769> inside

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
the inside

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.699 
the inside
I've<00:03:08.209> unscrewed<00:03:08.750> these<00:03:09.019> ones<00:03:09.319> I'm<00:03:09.560> gonna

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
I've unscrewed these ones I'm gonna

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.500 
I've unscrewed these ones I'm gonna
leave<00:03:09.889> this<00:03:10.250> one<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:10.790> we're<00:03:11.209> just<00:03:11.299> going<00:03:11.480> to

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
leave this one and we're just going to

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.280 
leave this one and we're just going to
do<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:12.010> quickly<00:03:13.010> now<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.109> one

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
do that quickly now this is the one

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.710 
do that quickly now this is the one
that's<00:03:15.489> holds<00:03:16.489> in<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.700> plug<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.299> it's<00:03:17.599> the

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
that's holds in the plug and it's the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.270 
that's holds in the plug and it's the
thing<00:03:17.870> that's<00:03:18.049> not<00:03:18.230> fitting<00:03:18.680> properly

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.460 

that's<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.489> screw<00:03:23.000> in<00:03:23.180> question<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:24.349> it

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
that's the screw in question and it

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.819 
that's the screw in question and it
doesn't<00:03:24.739> look<00:03:24.829> like<00:03:24.889> it's<00:03:25.190> bent<00:03:25.549> oh<00:03:26.680> good<00:03:27.680> it

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
doesn't look like it's bent oh good it

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.710 
doesn't look like it's bent oh good it
fits<00:03:27.950> back<00:03:28.220> in

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.220 

that's<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.840> bust<00:03:32.439> no<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.189> doesn't<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.750> went

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
that's a bust no it doesn't so I went

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.050 
that's a bust no it doesn't so I went
and<00:03:35.319> got<00:03:35.500> my<00:03:35.650> old<00:03:35.860> lunatic<00:03:36.280> tactic<00:03:36.670> extreme

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
and got my old lunatic tactic extreme

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.539 
and got my old lunatic tactic extreme
and<00:03:37.209> I've<00:03:37.269> got<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.540> little<00:03:37.599> red<00:03:37.959> knob<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.379> I

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
and I've got this little red knob and I

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.610 
and I've got this little red knob and I
had<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.670> take<00:03:39.879> I<00:03:40.120> compared<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.689> two<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.200> then

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
had to take I compared the two and then

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.830 
had to take I compared the two and then
I'm<00:03:41.829> guessing<00:03:42.250> one<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.879> impacts<00:03:43.269> actually

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
I'm guessing one of the impacts actually

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.589 
I'm guessing one of the impacts actually
one<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.349> drops<00:03:44.909> landed<00:03:45.909> directly<00:03:46.060> on<00:03:46.360> this

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
one of the drops landed directly on this

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.289 
one of the drops landed directly on this
corner<00:03:47.079> because<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:48.159> piece<00:03:48.430> actually<00:03:49.120> this

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
corner because the piece actually this

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.000 
corner because the piece actually this
metal<00:03:49.629> piece<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.140> actually<00:03:50.500> slightly

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
metal piece is actually slightly

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.569 
metal piece is actually slightly
deformed<00:03:51.549> it's<00:03:51.819> a<00:03:52.379> little<00:03:53.379> longer<00:03:53.650> now<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.430> it

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
deformed it's a little longer now so it

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.210 
deformed it's a little longer now so it
used<00:03:54.819> to<00:03:54.940> fit<00:03:55.209> but<00:03:56.140> now<00:03:56.319> it<00:03:56.500> doesn't<00:03:56.769> because<00:03:57.129> I

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
used to fit but now it doesn't because I

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.699 
used to fit but now it doesn't because I
fight<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.700> this<00:03:57.819> red<00:03:58.060> piece<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:58.659> put<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.260> in<00:03:59.500> if

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
fight it this red piece and put it in if

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.309 
fight it this red piece and put it in if
it's<00:04:00.069> quite<00:04:00.909> nicely<00:04:01.120> into<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.689> hole<00:04:01.900> but<00:04:02.079> if<00:04:02.230> I

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
it's quite nicely into the hole but if I

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.520 
it's quite nicely into the hole but if I
take<00:04:02.500> this<00:04:02.739> orange<00:04:03.359> little<00:04:04.359> nub<00:04:04.569> because

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
take this orange little nub because

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.099 
take this orange little nub because
we've<00:04:05.709> deformed<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.640> doesn't<00:04:07.239> really<00:04:07.569> fit

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
we've deformed it it doesn't really fit

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.099 
we've deformed it it doesn't really fit
that<00:04:08.349> well<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:09.310> kind<00:04:09.579> of<00:04:09.639> pumps<00:04:10.000> out<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.629> little

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
that well it kind of pumps out a little

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.649 
that well it kind of pumps out a little
bit<00:04:11.430> all<00:04:12.430> in<00:04:12.639> all<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.790> still<00:04:13.090> think<00:04:13.299> this<00:04:13.420> case

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
bit all in all I still think this case

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.800 
bit all in all I still think this case
is<00:04:13.840> pretty<00:04:14.019> tough<00:04:14.319> we<00:04:14.530> did<00:04:14.709> just<00:04:15.449> toss<00:04:16.449> it<00:04:16.690> like

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
is pretty tough we did just toss it like

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.789 
is pretty tough we did just toss it like
nobody's<00:04:17.229> business

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
nobody's business

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.860 
nobody's business
but<00:04:18.370> I<00:04:18.400> think<00:04:18.729> we<00:04:18.910> might<00:04:19.269> be<00:04:19.299> able<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.630> do

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
but I think we might be able to do

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.439 
but I think we might be able to do
something<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.620> little<00:04:20.709> more<00:04:21.220> with<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.549> but<00:04:21.880> you

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
something a little more with it but you
