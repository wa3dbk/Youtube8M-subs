thing<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.440> know<00:02:28.620> about<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> Spartans

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
thing to know about that is the Spartans

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.100 
thing to know about that is the Spartans
are<00:02:29.910> totally<00:02:30.300> different<00:02:30.390> from<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> elites

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
are totally different from the elites

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.680 
are totally different from the elites
the<00:02:31.620> elites<00:02:31.830> are<00:02:31.950> big<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.820> got<00:02:32.940> more<00:02:33.120> shields

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the elites are big you got more shields

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.990 
the elites are big you got more shields
more<00:02:33.900> health<00:02:34.140> they<00:02:34.500> run<00:02:34.740> faster<00:02:35.340> but<00:02:35.880> there

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
more health they run faster but there

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.970 
more health they run faster but there
are<00:02:36.030> also<00:02:36.150> much<00:02:36.420> bigger<00:02:36.630> targets<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.680> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
are also much bigger targets so the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.890 
are also much bigger targets so the
Spartans<00:02:38.400> are<00:02:38.520> sort<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.730> small<00:02:39.120> maneuverable

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
Spartans are sort of small maneuverable

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.960 
Spartans are sort of small maneuverable

are<00:02:58.500> very<00:02:58.770> important<00:02:59.250> part<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.520> reach<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.060> we

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
are very important part of reach and we

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.729 
are very important part of reach and we
want<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.780> make<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:00.959> feel<00:03:01.200> like<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.440> logical

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
want to make it feel like a logical

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.250 
want to make it feel like a logical
extension<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.940> sandbox<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.870> how<00:03:04.050> do<00:03:04.110> you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
extension of the sandbox so how do you

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.810 
extension of the sandbox so how do you
balance<00:03:04.380> armor<00:03:04.890> abilities<00:03:05.280> against<00:03:05.670> our

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
balance armor abilities against our

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.090 
balance armor abilities against our
weapons<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.570> vehicles<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.590> all<00:03:07.739> feels

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
weapons and vehicles so it all feels

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.520 
weapons and vehicles so it all feels
like<00:03:08.220> one<00:03:08.340> coherent<00:03:09.000> vision<00:03:09.269> I<00:03:09.750> think<00:03:10.410> it's

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
like one coherent vision I think it's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.620 
like one coherent vision I think it's
important<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.519> each<00:03:11.760> armor<00:03:12.180> ability<00:03:12.540> is

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
important to that each armor ability is

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.360 
important to that each armor ability is
balanced<00:03:13.140> against<00:03:13.500> each<00:03:13.620> other<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.190> there's

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
balanced against each other so there's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.490 
balanced against each other so there's
not<00:03:14.489> one

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
not one

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.780 
not one
rule<00:03:15.650> them<00:03:15.920> all<00:03:16.070> like<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.520> don't<00:03:16.670> want

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
rule them all like you don't want

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.210 
rule them all like you don't want
everyone<00:03:17.090> using<00:03:17.600> jetpack<00:03:17.990> my<00:03:18.560> favorite<00:03:18.980> armor

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
between halo 3 and reached one you don't

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.330 
between halo 3 and reached one you don't
jump<00:03:46.459> as<00:03:46.610> high<00:03:46.870> reaches<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:48.320> little<00:03:48.680> more<00:03:48.920> real

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
jump as high reaches a little more real

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.150 
jump as high reaches a little more real
world<00:03:49.670> so<00:03:50.360> jump<00:03:50.810> height<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.230> definitely<00:03:51.800> not

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
world so jump height is definitely not

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.490 
world so jump height is definitely not
crazy<00:03:52.730> Master<00:03:53.239> Chief<00:03:53.420> jump<00:03:53.720> height<00:03:53.900> health

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.040 
crazy Master Chief jump height health
packs<00:03:54.830> are<00:03:55.040> back<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.630> probably<00:03:56.630> the<00:03:56.810> last

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
packs are back and probably the last

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.199 
packs are back and probably the last
thing<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.040> your<00:03:58.459> movement<00:03:58.910> speed<00:03:58.940> is

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
thing is that your movement speed is

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.310 
thing is that your movement speed is
going<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.390> be<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.510> little<00:03:59.750> different<00:03:59.930> than<00:04:00.170> halo

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
going to be a little different than halo

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.229 
going to be a little different than halo
3<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:01.010> your<00:04:01.310> field<00:04:01.520> of<00:04:01.640> view<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:01.970> little

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
3 and your field of view is a little

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.970 
3 and your field of view is a little
different<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:02.870> we're<00:04:03.020> trying<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.350> again<00:04:03.680> make

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
different so we're trying to again make

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.300 
different so we're trying to again make
it<00:04:04.160> feel<00:04:04.430> more<00:04:05.830> fictional<00:04:06.830> irrelevant<00:04:07.280> i

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
it feel more fictional irrelevant i

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.800 
it feel more fictional irrelevant i
think<00:04:07.489> it's<00:04:07.610> best<00:04:07.820> term<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:10.660> we<00:04:11.660> have<00:04:11.750> a

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
think it's best term to you we have a

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.020 
think it's best term to you we have a
