Alright!

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.150
This is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com,
today we have another exciting episode for

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.230
you, and this is going to be a fun one at
that.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.840
We’re here at O’Hare Airport here in Chicago,
and what we’re looking at behind me is the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.500
O’Hare Urban Garden.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.060
This is where inside the American Terminal
between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3, they have

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.480
a rotunda, and up on the top level actually
they’re growing food indoors.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.710
I think this is an excellent idea, and what
they’re using to grow food indoors is the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.050
Tower Garden set-up.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.579
So while they do use the Tower Garden set-up
in a commercial application, there is also

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.800
a home tower garden.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.810
And what we’re going to do today is actually
show you guys what’s growing indoors under

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.790
HPS lights, and also how the tower garden
works, and also my opinions on it.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.540
So let’s head over to the O’Hare Urban
Garden and share with you guys what’s growing

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.540
on.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.009
Alright so here it is, O’Hare Urban Garden,
HPS lights, really bright in here, it’s

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.320
night time as you guys can see outside, and
it is a it is a balmy, like 16 degrees outside

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.700
today in Chicago, but things are growing beautifully
indoors, so that’s the first clue if you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.120
are living in a place where it’s cold, grow
indoors in the winter.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.120
I don’t necessarily recommend using HPS
lights, especially this many, that takes a

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.120
lot of power, I would recommend some standard
fluorescent bulbs and growing some sprouts

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.220
and/or microgreens in the winter here.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:49.490
So as you guys could see, what they’re using
here is the Tower Garden by Juice Plus, and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.840
how this works is pretty simple, basically
there’s a water reservoir in the bottom

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.970
it’s like a big half a wine barrel size
with a lid on it, and then there’s basically

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.850
a plastic tube that goes all the way up, and
in each tube there’s multiple holes so that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.560
they can plant a number of plants in the tower.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.639
And it looks like things are growing fairy
well here, this is actually some Swiss chard

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:25.230
in this one, here they have some nasturtiums,
over behind there they have some tomatoes,

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.900
and this one is chives, and I like that it’s
actually labeled, each one is actually labeled,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.290
because many people might not know the different
crops that are growing, I mean I do, but most

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.090
people like “Oh that’s what arugula looks
like when it’s growing?” and it’s totally

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.329
cool that they’re growing things inside
and actually using some of the produce in

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.260
the restaurants actually at the airport.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.959
As you guys can see this arugula is going
to be used at Tuscany Café, and the chives

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.819
here will be used in Wicker Park.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.199
So it’s totally real cool that they’re
doing that, but let’s talk more about how

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:04.469
this system works specifically, and I can
actually hear the pumps come on, so multiple

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.839
times per hour or however often during the
day, there’s a pump that takes the water

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:16.260
from the bottom there, and then pumps it up
the middle of the tube, and then basically

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.170
the water drips down the tube all the way
down so that all the plants get watered.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.099
So one of the things that I’m noticing as
I’m walking around this tower garden set-up

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:37.019
is actually some of the excess salts and the
build-up of the hydroponic solution that they’re

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.900
using today, so let me go ahead and show you
guys some of the salts that are actually drying

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.909
and crusting up.

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.809
So check it out, if we look closely at this
one here, we can totally see right there,

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:57.889
some of the salts that are crusting up and
drying on the plastic housing.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.859
In addition on the bottom of the unit there
you can see more salts crusting up.

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.559
Now this primarily happens because they’re
using fertilizer that’s synthetic chemical

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:13.409
fertilizer, and as you guys can see they’re
actually in the blue barrels behind me, and

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.339
this is not the natural way food is grown.

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:21.250
Now while I do think it’s definitely good
to grow food and grow fresh food where it’s

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.789
needed, I personally believe that it’s much
better to duplicate nature instead of trying

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.830
to emulate nature like they’re doing in
hydroponics.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.310
So I would prefer to use a soil-based system
instead of a hydroponic system like they’re

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.690
doing here.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.629
I prefer the Garden Tower instead of the Tower
Garden.

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:49.150
Be sure to check my past videos on that, it’s
actually less expensive than the Tower Garden

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.449
set-up actually that they’re using here
behind me.

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.360
The personal Tower Garden set-up you can purchase,
they cost around $500 and I think that is

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.900
a lot of money for what you’re getting.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.710
I’d much rather you guys put $500 towards
building some raised beds in the backyard

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.620
or investing in some fluorescent tube lights
and some good sprouting materials and actually

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.539
taking the time to learn how to grow your
food.

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.479
I mean the benefit of the Tower Garden that
you guys are seeing behind me is that it’s

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.669
pretty turn-key, they provide all the nutrient
solution for you and all this kind of stuff

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:20.810
and you just do it.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.300
But you know I’m concerned that the food
that you’re growing with this nutrient solution

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.430
may not be the highest quality food.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.830
I mean I’m looking at some of these items
growing, and while some do look fairly healthy,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.210
some kind of look a little bit anemic to me,
and it’s not like the plants are getting

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.870
everything they need, because they probably
don’t have everything in the nutrient solution

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.990
mixture over there.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.509
In addition, if you take a look at the chemical
fertilizers that are water soluble, they provide

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:55.819
runoff, and the excess actually goes into
the soil, into the dirt, and especially due

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.969
to the standard conventional agriculture,
many of it runs down into the Gulf of Mexico

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.810
which creates dead zones, which is not a good
thing.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.919
So once again, I would always encourage you
guys to grow organically, and in accordance

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.699
with nature whenever possible.

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.940
So if you do live in the Chicago area or another
place where it does get cold in the winter,

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.139
besides growing indoors, you can erect simply
a [inaudible] house outside and grow some

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:30.750
cold tolerant crops, especially when heated
with a compost pile that’s heating up your

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.090
[inaudible] house outside, I do have past
episodes where I visited Will Allen’s place

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.229
in Milwaukee, [inaudible] where I actually
show how he does that, and actually I have

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.030
another video that I’ll actually post down
below in a link in the description so you

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.759
can see how they’re growing even in the
winter time in the snow if you don’t want

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.340
to grow inside you can still grow outside.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:54.960
I always encourage you guys, no matter what
to just plant some food and grow some things

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.599
indoors, because I know many of you guys are
not in the winter time, you know grow some

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:05.750
little herbs in a window sill, grow some microgreens
or some sprouts indoors, those are the best

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.729
things that you can be growing in the winter
indoors.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:15.599
So hopefully you guys enjoyed this quick episode
learning more about my ideas about the Tower

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.710
Garden they have here at O’Hare Airport.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.990
In general I think it’s a great idea to
grow food where you need it, but I’m not

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:27.780
a big fan of the hydroponics that they’re
using here due to all the salt build-ups,

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.879
and where does all that extra salt go when
they clean the tanks out?

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:32.879
Hmmm.

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:36.479
In any case, I’ve got to go catch my flight,
once again my name is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com.

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:39.590
We’ll see you next time, and remember keep
on growing.
