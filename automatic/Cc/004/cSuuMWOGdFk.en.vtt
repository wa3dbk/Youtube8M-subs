00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 and jam the battery has a standard 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.970
 form size and terminals therefore looks in 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.820
 Accuracy like a normal battery is flooded 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.490
 liquid electrolyte however it is not the same 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.800
 the very thing that is inside the jam 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.130
 the battery makes it significantly 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.990
 better the most important difference between edge 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.430
 and classic designs in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 using fiberglass 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.949
 aggregate which absorbs the whole 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.810
 electrolyte contained in the battery 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.940
 so he called the battery with 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.120
 absorbent fiberglass or 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.800
 abbreviated hey dj fiberglass 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.930
 placeholder used in our 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.930
 Batteries are not the same as 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.120
 common material separator our 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.730
 vibro resistant protective design 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.430
 fiberglass maximizes the life 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.440
 battery life fiberglass 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.210
 placeholder specifically envelops 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.610
 internal battery components 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.340
 protecting his most important strengths 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.160
 elements are positive and negative 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.830
 electrodes except a significant increase 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.049
 service life is very important 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 efficiently absorbed and electrolyte 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.460
 inside the battery due to 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.979
 fiberglass aggregate at 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.460
 electrolyte shortage batteries quickly 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.080
 dry out and fail 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.490
 our fiberglass aggregate 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.320
 has the highest level of absorption 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.150
 it keeps electrolyte inside the fibers 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.670
 and makes him maximize 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.390
 contact with the electrode which increases 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.040
 overall battery performance 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.700
 our high quality fiberglass 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.710
 plates 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.329
 also have lower 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.310
 electrical resistance 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.770
 compared with the material used in 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
 familiar batteries 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.110
 causes accelerated energy flow 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.420
 and quick engine start 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.729
 our and jam batteries with built-in 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.470
 adjustable valves are superior 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.570
 ordinary batteries with power 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.009
 connected devices increases 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.060
 number of work cycles and 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.219
 vibration resistance 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.149
 rather than sealed have the best 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.950
 starting current and power characteristics 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.900
 made in the USA and jam batteries 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.240
 have absolutely standard form 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.140
 ey DJ technology 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.570
 established itself as completely 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 meet strict standards 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.080
 industry quality and 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.640
 performance 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.430
 one of the key advantages of our 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.150
 designs and jam similiar to ordinary 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.490
 battery 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.800
 our battery has a typical 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.660
 compatibility 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.460
 Our jam and batteries can with 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.560
 ease to replace almost any 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.540
 liquid battery and excellent 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.520
 work in a conventional car system 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.280
 with alternator and 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.800
 voltage regulator and as is the case with 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.880
 conventional battery technology hey ji 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.220
 uh available full recycling 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.170
 what's inside ours and jam batteries 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.800
 gives them unrivaled durability 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.380
 and the performance outside is still the same 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.170
 Typical design for easy installation and 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.630
 simple maintenance and internally and 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.390
 externally ours and jam batteries 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.280
 fully meet the requirements 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.750
 modern driver and provide 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.750
 vehicle reliability
