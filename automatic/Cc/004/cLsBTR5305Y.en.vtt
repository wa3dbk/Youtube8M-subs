inside<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> operating<00:01:25.920> system

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
inside of the a of the operating system

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.270 
inside of the a of the operating system
but<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:28.200> fun<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.009> they're<00:01:29.159> doing

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
horrible things you can see here I don't

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.310 
horrible things you can see here I don't
have<00:01:59.070> any<00:01:59.340> any<00:01:59.790> Facebook<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.840> might<00:02:01.049> also

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
have any any Facebook this might also

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.920 
have any any Facebook this might also
work<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.759> pictures<00:02:03.180> I'll<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.869> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
work for for pictures I'll think that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.320 
work for for pictures I'll think that
they<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:05.159> forget<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.729> it

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
they then all forget like it

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.440 
they then all forget like it
menu<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.020> let's<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.590> try<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.910> see<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.210> can

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
menu so let's just try to see if I can
