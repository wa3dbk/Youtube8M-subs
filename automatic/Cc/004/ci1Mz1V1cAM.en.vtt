00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.120
 4 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.200
 what is the ribbon the megalodon 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.200
 I had selected 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:24.180
 the loss is a huge is totally 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.980
 giant and this one says they're going to see 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.510
 then it is totally amazing 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.850
 Well, I wonder what you have to do 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.369
 to be able to do everything in this mystery, let's say 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.010
 to activate it is to play naval map 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.660
 strike called attack nobody this 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.489
 surely the requirements to be able 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.859
 make this historic to be able to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.109
 let's say that seeing is having downloaded the 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.539
 of choice of naval strike do not matter 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:48.359
 but if it was something intimate to live others 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.309
 of the important thing is to have is and second 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.499
 is to get to this point of screaming I go 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.199
 to use the location and although here not 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:56.819
 it looks very clear there is a trace that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.519
 was behind the command maybe that 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.470
 affect me is a pot and is 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.730
 between points 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.070
 then you have to be playing 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.320
 conquest to be able to move 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.790
 let's say that another requirement then 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.160
 it simply has to arrive and be 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.510
 here ten people then it is says a 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.940
 little complicated because many people 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.070
 when they see here the people gathered 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.900
 obviously he starts to kill them all if 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.700
 you see those resistant do not kill 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.470
 people are trying to see stress 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.120
 then how do they realize we did 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.850
 back of the inba for the location 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.590
 exact I'm in all the air point and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.650
 once you find the 10 people 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.380
 gathered to appear this showed 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.610
 this mega how amazing a mind 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.640
 Kill is the people that are down there 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.560
 is there gathered turnadas that is worth the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.600
 worth dying looks totally amazing and 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.580
 meritorious will show other captures 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.290
 that I took a mind says several times 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.790
 and something great about this story that is 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.950
 that they can do it every time 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.810
 obviously want the important thing is that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.850

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.500

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.710
 map connected to overcome as it is given 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.250

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.649
