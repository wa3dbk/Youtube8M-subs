00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.740 

it<00:02:54.909> is<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> different<00:02:56.080> thing<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:57.750> easing

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
it is it is a different thing but easing

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.559 
it is it is a different thing but easing
into<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.349> think<00:02:59.680> is<00:03:00.010> both<00:03:00.819> challenging<00:03:01.450> and

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
into it I think is both challenging and

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.559 
into it I think is both challenging and
rewarding<00:03:01.720> because<00:03:02.140> she's<00:03:03.069> prepared<00:03:03.760> now<00:03:03.909> and

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
rewarding because she's prepared now and

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.350 
rewarding because she's prepared now and
of<00:03:04.750> course<00:03:04.989> we're<00:03:05.260> more<00:03:05.739> at<00:03:05.830> ease<00:03:05.980> because

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
of course we're more at ease because

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.089 
of course we're more at ease because
okay<00:03:07.360> we<00:03:07.510> see<00:03:07.690> she<00:03:07.870> can<00:03:08.019> handle<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.440> she<00:03:08.709> can<00:03:08.950> do

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
okay we see she can handle it she can do

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.809 
okay we see she can handle it she can do
it<00:03:09.280> and<00:03:10.150> it's<00:03:10.870> definitely<00:03:11.230> fun<00:03:11.560> for<00:03:11.739> her<00:03:11.860> the
