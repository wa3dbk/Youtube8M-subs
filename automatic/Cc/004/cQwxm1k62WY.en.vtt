00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
with just a little artificial light I

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.220 
with just a little artificial light I
found<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.850> window<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> best<00:00:33.780> window<00:00:34.110> in

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
found this window is the best window in

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.590 
found this window is the best window in
my<00:00:34.260> whole<00:00:34.559> house<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.130> plants<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.489> grow<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:36.120> is

my whole house for plants to grow it is
east<00:00:36.870> facing<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> gets<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> Sun<00:00:38.340> that

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489

is<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.410> every<00:00:46.920> night<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> only

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
is on every night it's about the only

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
is on every night it's about the only
light<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> leave<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.260> part<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
light that I leave on in this part of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.400 
light that I leave on in this part of
the<00:00:49.649> house<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.449> enough<00:00:51.750> light<00:00:52.050> for

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the house and it's just enough light for

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.610 
the house and it's just enough light for
all<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> plants<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:53.820> light<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:55.050> night<00:00:55.379> as

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
all the plants to have light at night as

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.279 
all the plants to have light at night as
well<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.520> seems<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.360> enough<00:00:57.719> for

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
well and it seems to be just enough for

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.869 
well and it seems to be just enough for
them<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.469> do<00:00:58.770> even<00:00:59.100> better<00:00:59.250> than<00:00:59.579> if<00:00:59.730> they

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
them to do even better than if they

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.900 
them to do even better than if they
didn't<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.329> any<00:01:00.629> light<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.559> night<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
didn't get any light at night and I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.490 
didn't get any light at night and I
found<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.539> little<00:01:03.780> bit<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.989> artificial

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
found just a little bit of artificial

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.719 
found just a little bit of artificial
light<00:01:04.680> goes<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> long<00:01:05.189> way

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
light goes a long way

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.300 
light goes a long way
and<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.140> takes<00:01:07.409> whether<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.040> little

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and all it takes whether it's a little

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.429 
and all it takes whether it's a little
light<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:09.030> laundry<00:01:09.479> room<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> light<00:01:10.229> in

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
light in your laundry room or a light in

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.770 
light in your laundry room or a light in
your<00:01:10.560> bathroom<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.640> even<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.180> light<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.659> your

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
your bathroom or even a light in your

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.289 
your bathroom or even a light in your
office<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.040> put<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> plant<00:01:14.640> underneath

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
office if you put a plant underneath

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.789 
office if you put a plant underneath
that<00:01:15.479> light<00:01:15.750> when<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> lights<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.770> night

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that light when the lights on at night

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.399 
that light when the lights on at night
it<00:01:17.340> might<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.450> enough<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.080> plant

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it might be just enough for that plant

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.429 
it might be just enough for that plant
to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:19.979> well<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.840> course

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
to do really well so of course

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.950 
to do really well so of course
sunlight<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> best<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.850> plants<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.930> not

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
sunlight is the best for plants but not

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.410 
sunlight is the best for plants but not
all<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.470> us<00:01:25.560> live<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.100> areas<00:01:26.369> where<00:01:26.580> even<00:01:27.270> when

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
all of us live in areas where even when

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.899 
all of us live in areas where even when
the<00:01:27.659> Sun<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.770> there's<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.759> many
