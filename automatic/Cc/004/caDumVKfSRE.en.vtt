00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
facelift where some integral problems of

facelift where some integral problems of
the<00:02:09.360> concrete<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.890> wanted<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.780> beautify

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the concrete and we wanted to beautify

the structure doing a band-aid approach
for<00:02:16.170> many<00:02:16.319> years<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.120> then<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.239> just<00:02:18.390> came

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
for many years and then it just came

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.240 
for many years and then it just came
down<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.900> well<00:02:19.319> we've<00:02:19.590> got<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.890> do<00:02:19.980> something

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
down to well we've got to do something

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.180 
down to well we've got to do something
took<00:02:20.790> three<00:02:21.060> years<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.629> this<00:02:21.780> project

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
took three years to do this project

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.979 
took three years to do this project
because<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.400> our<00:02:23.549> construction<00:02:24.209> season<00:02:24.660> we

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
because of our construction season we

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.470 
because of our construction season we
spent<00:02:25.290> close<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.340> seven<00:02:26.700> million<00:02:26.880> dollars<00:02:27.299> to

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
spent close to seven million dollars to

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.289 
spent close to seven million dollars to
do<00:02:27.599> this<00:02:27.780> job<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.799> real<00:02:28.980> estate<00:02:29.160> values<00:02:29.640> have

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
do this job the real estate values have

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.190 
do this job the real estate values have
gone<00:02:30.569> up<00:02:30.780> at<00:02:31.319> least<00:02:31.620> forty<00:02:31.980> percent<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.660> I

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
gone up at least forty percent so I

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.630 
gone up at least forty percent so I
think<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.980> beautification<00:02:35.640> part<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:37.799> energy

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
think the beautification part the energy

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.809 
think the beautification part the energy
