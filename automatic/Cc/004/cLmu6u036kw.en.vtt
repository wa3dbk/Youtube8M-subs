still working on getting all of my where
routing<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.720> way<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:46.900> like<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.170> but<00:03:47.859> so<00:03:48.100> far<00:03:48.340> so

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
routing the way I like it but so far so

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.099 
routing the way I like it but so far so
good

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.870 

as<00:03:53.109> you<00:03:53.230> can<00:03:53.350> see<00:03:53.560> most<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.340> motor

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
as you can see most of the the motor

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.380 
as you can see most of the the motor
wires<00:03:55.450> come<00:03:56.040> either<00:03:57.040> through<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.760> extrusion

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
wires come either through the extrusion

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.289 
wires come either through the extrusion
or<00:03:58.750> up<00:03:59.590> over<00:04:00.010> in<00:04:00.190> this<00:04:02.190> energy<00:04:03.190> chain<00:04:03.790> from<00:04:04.060> I

or up over in this energy chain from I

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.220 
or up over in this energy chain from I
guess<00:04:05.100> comes<00:04:06.100> down<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.609> out<00:04:06.700> one<00:04:06.910> of<00:04:07.030> the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
guess comes down and out one of the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.490 
guess comes down and out one of the
cords<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.380> for<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.799> power<00:04:09.040> for<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:12.150> router

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
cords is for the power for the router

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.160 
cords is for the power for the router
we'll<00:04:14.500> see<00:04:14.709> how<00:04:14.859> that

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
we'll see how that

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:24.350 
we'll see how that
I<00:04:17.150> got<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.800> rack<00:04:19.800> from<00:04:20.580> more<00:04:21.420> gear<00:04:23.360> they

case of a malfunction they worked very
well<00:05:28.680> so<00:05:29.070> far<00:05:29.100> and<00:05:29.910> like<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.300> said<00:05:30.360> I've<00:05:30.600> got<00:05:30.780> one

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
well so far and like I said I've got one

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.960 
well so far and like I said I've got one
on<00:05:31.110> each<00:05:31.260> corner<00:05:31.590> of<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.860> machine<00:05:34.970> did

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
on each corner of the machine did

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.030 
on each corner of the machine did
earlier<00:05:36.330> today<00:05:37.670> was<00:05:38.670> to<00:05:39.500> make<00:05:40.500> marks<00:05:40.830> and

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
earlier today was to make marks and

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.780 
earlier today was to make marks and
measure<00:05:41.250> just<00:05:41.700> how<00:05:41.820> accurately<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:43.790> machine

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
measure just how accurately the machine

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.230 
measure just how accurately the machine
moved<00:05:45.320> as<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.650> can<00:05:46.890> see<00:05:47.160> these<00:05:47.400> two<00:05:47.700> pencil

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
moved as you can see these two pencil

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.740 
moved as you can see these two pencil
lines<00:05:48.450> on<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.020> extrusion<00:05:49.940> are<00:05:50.940> exactly<00:05:51.570> 2

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
lines on the extrusion are exactly 2

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.960 
lines on the extrusion are exactly 2
inches<00:05:52.020> apart<00:05:52.170> and<00:05:52.590> put<00:05:52.770> that<00:05:52.890> into<00:05:53.100> Makka<00:05:53.430> and

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
inches apart and put that into Makka and

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.620 
inches apart and put that into Makka and
this<00:05:54.180> one<00:05:54.630> of<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:54.840> setting<00:05:55.410> screens<00:05:55.770> and<00:05:56.630> it

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
this one of the setting screens and it

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.160 
this one of the setting screens and it
will<00:05:57.870> automatically<00:05:58.500> adjust<00:05:59.070> your<00:05:59.670> axes<00:06:00.240> to

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
will automatically adjust your axes to

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.890 
will automatically adjust your axes to
that<00:06:01.440> distance<00:06:02.400> so<00:06:02.670> I<00:06:03.000> did<00:06:03.300> that<00:06:03.450> on<00:06:03.480> all<00:06:03.750> the

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
that distance so I did that on all the

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.770 
that distance so I did that on all the
axes<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:04.320> they<00:06:04.560> were<00:06:04.620> right<00:06:04.890> on<00:06:05.420> my<00:06:06.420> current

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
axes and they were right on my current

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.790
