00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
it was for but that'll be coming off at

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.950 
it was for but that'll be coming off at
some<00:01:45.600> point<00:01:45.869> also<00:01:47.509> but<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.840> how

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
some point also but I don't know how

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.410 
some point also but I don't know how
much<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.549> really<00:01:50.549> used<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> lot

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
much it was really used it's got a lot

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.300 
much it was really used it's got a lot
of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.659> green<00:01:52.110> mildew<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.040> some

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
of the green mildew on it and some

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.209 
of the green mildew on it and some
really<00:01:54.210> thick<00:01:54.509> three<00:01:55.290> stuff<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.009> it's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
really thick three stuff so it's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.530 
really thick three stuff so it's
probably<00:01:56.369> been<00:01:56.579> sitting<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> last<00:01:57.240> 10<00:01:57.509> or

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
probably been sitting for the last 10 or

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.440 
probably been sitting for the last 10 or
so<00:01:57.780> years<00:01:58.100> but<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.219> got<00:01:59.340> good<00:01:59.640> paint<00:01:59.939> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
so years but it's got good paint you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.090 
so years but it's got good paint you
know<00:02:00.570> where<00:02:00.750> usually<00:02:01.020> would<00:02:01.380> wear<00:02:01.560> off<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
know where usually would wear off on the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.139 
know where usually would wear off on the
front<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> engine<00:02:02.520> shroud<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
front of the engine shroud and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.170 
front of the engine shroud and
everything<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:05.700> guessing<00:02:06.090> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
everything so you know I'm guessing it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.670 
everything so you know I'm guessing it
probably<00:02:06.210> had<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.750> mower<00:02:07.020> deck<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.560> for

the<00:02:07.740> most<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.190> life<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:09.149> all<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
the most of it's life because all the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.240 
the most of it's life because all the
grease<00:02:10.170> buildup<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.830> know<00:02:10.920> there's<00:02:11.129> no

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
grease buildup you know there's no

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
greatest of all shape it's pretty well

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.479 
greatest of all shape it's pretty well
rotted<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.630> got<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> lot<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:36.989> holes<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.530> and

rotted it's got a lot of holes in it and
it<00:02:38.610> probably<00:02:38.849> had<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> bunch<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.390> grass<00:02:39.660> and

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
it probably had a bunch of grass and

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.540 
it probably had a bunch of grass and
stuff<00:02:40.140> sitting<00:02:40.500> on<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.709> at<00:02:40.800> one<00:02:40.980> point<00:02:41.250> for

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
quite some time with water and all that

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.170 
quite some time with water and all that
didn't<00:02:44.400> help<00:02:44.489> too<00:02:44.760> much<00:02:45.799> so<00:02:46.799> I<00:02:47.130> might<00:02:47.700> redo<00:02:48.060> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
didn't help too much so I might redo the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.820 
didn't help too much so I might redo the
dick<00:02:48.360> at<00:02:48.540> some<00:02:48.750> point<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.440> know<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.680> easy

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
dick at some point you know it's easy

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.640 
dick at some point you know it's easy
enough<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.130> cut<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.580> out<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:52.049> can<00:02:52.140> bend<00:02:52.530> up

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
enough to cut this out and I can bend up

here<00:03:27.780> which<00:03:28.170> isn't<00:03:28.440> too<00:03:28.530> bad<00:03:29.600> so<00:03:30.600> it's

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
here which isn't too bad so it's

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.059 
here which isn't too bad so it's
probably<00:03:30.900> going<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.140> be<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.290> project<00:03:31.560> for<00:03:31.890> later

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
probably going to be a project for later

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.590 
probably going to be a project for later
on<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.489> year<00:03:32.519> maybe<00:03:33.030> next<00:03:33.239> year<00:03:33.390> or

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
something if I have some time I can

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.630 
something if I have some time I can
always<00:03:35.880> tackle<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.950> serial<00:03:38.370> number

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
always tackle that and the serial number

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.789 
always tackle that and the serial number
on<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.819> if<00:03:39.780> anybody<00:03:40.230> has<00:03:40.410> one<00:03:40.680> close<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.579> is<00:03:41.760> a

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
on it if anybody has one close it is a

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.710

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
1971 commercial 10a I also didn't have a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.479 
1971 commercial 10a I also didn't have a
muffler<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.380> but<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:49.829> was<00:03:50.010> able<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.310> run<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
muffler in it but I was able to run the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.699 
muffler in it but I was able to run the
tap<00:03:50.819> through<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.269> we<00:03:51.359> got<00:03:51.540> threads<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.109> just

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
tap through it and we got threads I just

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.410 
tap through it and we got threads I just
packed<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.130> in<00:03:53.220> with<00:03:53.370> grease<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.269> doesn't

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
packed it in with grease so it doesn't

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.039 
packed it in with grease so it doesn't
leak<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.900> dozen<00:03:55.739> trust<00:03:55.950> up<00:03:56.130> anymore<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:57.060> maybe

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
leak a dozen trust up anymore and maybe

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.390 
leak a dozen trust up anymore and maybe
I<00:03:58.200> can<00:03:58.350> get<00:03:58.410> him<00:03:58.500> up<00:03:58.680> flare<00:03:58.920> in<00:03:59.010> there<00:03:59.130> at<00:03:59.220> some

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
little bit of heat will take care of

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.360 
little bit of heat will take care of
that<00:05:04.560> right<00:05:04.860> in<00:05:05.070> here<00:05:06.470> so<00:05:07.470> it's<00:05:07.590> not<00:05:07.650> too<00:05:07.889> bad<00:05:08.100> i

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
that right in here so it's not too bad i

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.100 
that right in here so it's not too bad i
forgot<00:05:08.700> if<00:05:08.910> i<00:05:09.000> mentioned<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.540> but<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.720> picked<00:05:09.990> it

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
forgot if i mentioned it but I picked it

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.340 
forgot if i mentioned it but I picked it
up<00:05:10.200> for<00:05:10.350> 150<00:05:11.100> so<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.120> figured<00:05:12.419> I<00:05:12.810> got<00:05:12.960> my<00:05:13.080> money's

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350
