extenuating<00:00:27.230> circumstances<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.380> think<00:00:28.650> it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
extenuating circumstances I think it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.370 
extenuating circumstances I think it
does<00:00:29.279> happen<00:00:29.760> where<00:00:29.939> online<00:00:30.150> IDs<00:00:30.689> get<00:00:30.929> stolen

people to see it and there's only one

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.170 
people to see it and there's only one
reason<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.350> would<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.219> well<00:02:05.700> maybe<00:02:05.909> two

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
reason you would do that well maybe two

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.210 
reason you would do that well maybe two
reasons<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> first<00:02:06.930> reason<00:02:07.259> would<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.799> that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
reasons the first reason would be that

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.490 
reasons the first reason would be that
you<00:02:08.369> played<00:02:08.670> everything<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.390> easy<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.229> can

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
you played everything on easy so you can

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.050 
you played everything on easy so you can
hurry<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.039> get<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.220> review<00:02:11.580> out<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.120> that's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
hurry up and get a review out and that's

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.540 
hurry up and get a review out and that's
beresan<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.080> second<00:02:14.530> reason<00:02:14.739> would<00:02:15.130> be<00:02:15.190> you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
beresan the second reason would be you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.280 
beresan the second reason would be you
don't<00:02:15.700> even<00:02:15.940> own<00:02:16.239> these<00:02:16.450> games<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.050> you've

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
don't even own these games and you've

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.350 
don't even own these games and you've
never<00:02:17.560> played<00:02:17.890> them<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.670> think<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.060> is

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
never played them and I think that is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.870 
never played them and I think that is
why<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.720> lot<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.200> people's<00:02:20.770> profiles<00:02:21.280> are<00:02:21.580> set

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
why a lot of people's profiles are set

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.150 
why a lot of people's profiles are set
to<00:02:22.030> private<00:02:22.380> even<00:02:23.380> though<00:02:23.560> they're<00:02:23.920> there

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
to private even though they're there
