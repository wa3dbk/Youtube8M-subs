00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.339
 from let's play again youtube the judo 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.799
 it was extremely red is still on 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.150
 three matches are still missing in this one 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.469
 in this video about the very large 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.120
 employment last time we have 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.250
 seen how the word will 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.230
 tag team championship the dns team boss 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 had brought chips was what a 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.160
 signal spinning laptop gets it 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.789
 my god standing English 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.410
 each one is incredible to see 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.349
 how much I defend a chip 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.119
 then new lyrics with his likewise and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.560
 Barbel Pair gets the victory in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.829
 this session with opposite probably 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.600
 dempsey where i am i am alone i am 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.860
 Only this this fire but have 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.270
 the good jannik with me on hold 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.950
 youtube well you have a channel 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.180
 Imagine what are coming for 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.840
 videos on what people can do 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.379
 there to be happy 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.010
 So with me on the channel that is called the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.050
 power country there's fifa ultimate team 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.930
 but sometimes predominantly career mode 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.670
 So manager mode and soon there will be 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.739
 also the new to kay showcases with 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.210
 christian and elz and as places sometimes 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:15.659
 like the hot match just the one and the other 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:18.210
 another 22 sa and exactly the three pieces 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.369
 it will soon be enough for you too 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.750
 it is when you realize the start with 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.570
 the one with the christian with the match the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.700
 you go straight to release yes i believe 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.290
 A day later I start then 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.259
 the episode already out when people 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.729
 which probably has to be now 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.140
 but I will try only the one 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.479
 to bring airbus com because we have 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.759
 today the next game the wild smatch one 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.759
 one can say very much on sizzling threads 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.350
 can still continue until they say it 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.439
 but as bad as three wild comes here 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.159
 Ring foot here are lights off 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.250
 nations and then blow them out again 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.470
 logic I think he does not come with that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:17.060
 horseclub 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:18.860
 what they are on world what you mean 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.650
 who is the victorious is here to between 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.960
 bate martin pluss rather good than dean m 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.690
 breast 1 of course I have the nameless 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.340
 but brathwaite could say that thing 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.440
 of course tear here 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.670
 Well that's the right one is 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.710
 very intense movie 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.060
 We already have week by week 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.000
 who are in principle in the us 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.360
 You met her only to each other 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.260
 witnessed extend the space you have 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.450
 this looks or good 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.090
 start now is a ford ca mez 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.550
 that does not mean like they then the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.010
 settle at foxconn any way match so 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.360
 there is no disqualification 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.600
 you can take the opponent anywhere outside 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.950
 of the ring in the rain 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.209
 backstage and where is that not in the game 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:12.940
 But below the ring you could 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.080
 even if the ring judge looks after yes 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.720
 finished are always interesting approach 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.769
 You could either do that 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.300
 valuable the controversy one underlies 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:25.180
 the regiment pin and the spectators 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.950
 could see himself he is good stop 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.810
 although you could maybe with the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.519
 camera among the fans see this 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.200
 of course with the whole screen 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:38.150
 theirs hangs with long but so right 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.730
 they could not be that easy 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.070
 recognize hk is it quite well 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.620
 shielded airbus first gave 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.730
 run nicely against the ring stairs and 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.769
 snaps now just a 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.260
 baseball bat and right now 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:56.030
 formally on the world of the world 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.610
 but that must of course also say that 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.680
 Nimbus already has the more extreme 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.390
 I say now past time you 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.640
 Do eight facts in the rest 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.510
 tell me what are your names 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:14.310
 wiesdorf juvisy top-jobs ezb man zur 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.440
 complete wrestling so he has so 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:24.419
 those in pink held up in the advantage 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.720
 by the ezb exactly together is up to him 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.430
 German 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.230
 In any case , he has one there 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.120
 little experience so far you can not 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.190
 but say a lot of experience in the hard 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.350
 matches were because they are yes 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.770
 a bit more extreme I say now 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.050
 here 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.419
 they are not called in vain &amp; rough violence 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.700
 matches or death matches name is there 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.120
 program is a little bit blood 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.490
 bloody than in the ww 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.860
 you like to fly on cement blocks 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.990
 and so on also a rollmops the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.590
 then where I was in principle pleasurable 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:07.230
 that makes him crazy and was crazy 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:09.390
 it is not as well that came to me the whole 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.190
 no longer remember names and first 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.470
 cover out of fear but we see 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.180
 really we are just not with the 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.320
 Show line is the turn 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.600
 but we bring in as 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.800
 next opponent does not simulate that way 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.910
 really and then you do not see it either 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.320
 really, if the match is over or 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:34.940
 do not always hope for it now 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:39.169
 let's say that was 23 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:47.210
 that's fast now escalating jannik 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:49.710
 explain magna wurz had not only 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.330
 skills people on the face too 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.690
 kiss but just finished 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:58.530
 to do without any special 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.450
 Tools caught the mother went 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.130
 the staircase worked 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.240
 then they never existed when they were all themselves 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.350
 offers so there must be one 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.330
 plug in yourself 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.830
 but it does bring relative 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.860
 surprised how fast this is over here 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.800
 went 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.590
 yes I had really expected that more 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.210
 but not yet to be finished 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.320
 so who has come after this hard 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.690
 still not enough 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.950
 and right now here to be nervous on that 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:29.160
 What's that supposed to do ? 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.000
 we continue to beat 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.410
 destroy 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.760
 that means that means for me 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.480
 principle that these mistakes are not over 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.410
 is or how and that we will at the 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.650
 next episode 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.660
 because I'm definitely curious 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.490
 So today a little shorter issue so 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.420
 we'll see this tomorrow 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.700
 penultimate match in this extreme match 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.010
 namely randy orton against to plate like 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.090
 This match came about is white 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.230
 you do not even we can do it anyway 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.420
 take another look at how 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.550
 this rivalry of world against the 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.630
 harmless degenerated caught her lawyer has 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.310
 you have to intervene before the match 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.110
 There was no news like wild and 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.030
 chaim continues to outnumber the 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.590
 Airbus in their matches divert it 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.180
 even with a stand and between 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.940
 Wild and the proceeds are real 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.620
 war broke out and the wild has it 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.250
 match and rivalry with the bus 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:23.370
 a brutal ended the butcher 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:28.770
 the reality ends more interesting 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:31.470
 approach good pascal you never have like that 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.370
 description link the border learns 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.370
 or so it was said 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:38.970
 that's where you 'll find fifa videos or soon 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.360
 or already 215 videos is everything 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.590
 clear 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.360
 Have a look over below in the 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.500
 description is this channel we sound

 cool apple testified bit more 1
