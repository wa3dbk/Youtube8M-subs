00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
mom bought me for Christmas in the first

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.589 
mom bought me for Christmas in the first
semester<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:14.009> was<00:00:14.400> sucking<00:00:15.059> pretty<00:00:15.269> bad<00:00:15.450> at

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
semester I was sucking pretty bad at

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.420 
semester I was sucking pretty bad at
taking<00:00:15.719> notes<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.440> studying<00:00:16.980> off<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.310> them

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
taking notes and studying off of them

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.760 
taking notes and studying off of them
because<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.390> can't<00:00:18.570> study<00:00:18.869> off<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.380> words

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
because I just can't study off of words

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.840 
because I just can't study off of words
so<00:00:20.689> what<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.470> when<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.769> write<00:00:23.070> it

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so what this is for is when you write it

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.130 
so what this is for is when you write it
records<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:24.990> um<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:25.920> you're<00:00:26.189> hearing<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> I

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
records what um what you're hearing so I

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.560 
records what um what you're hearing so I
can<00:00:29.070> then<00:00:29.250> go<00:00:29.429> home<00:00:29.640> off<00:00:30.000> load<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.359> onto<00:00:30.480> my

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
can then go home off load it onto my

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.319 
can then go home off load it onto my
computer<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.410> study<00:00:32.070> my<00:00:32.250> notes<00:00:32.279> from<00:00:33.000> what

better<00:03:59.959> than<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.410> pen<00:04:00.590> does<00:04:00.830> however<00:04:01.819> I<00:04:02.090> don't

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
better than the pen does however I don't

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.360 
better than the pen does however I don't
think<00:04:02.720> my<00:04:02.780> teachers<00:04:03.260> would<00:04:03.890> let<00:04:04.040> me<00:04:04.160> wear

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
think my teachers would let me wear

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.589 
think my teachers would let me wear
earphones<00:04:04.610> even<00:04:05.090> if<00:04:05.150> they<00:04:05.269> know<00:04:05.360> what<00:04:05.480> they're

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
earphones even if they know what they're

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.890 
earphones even if they know what they're
for<00:04:06.250> just<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.580> know<00:04:07.670> because<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.299> don't<00:04:08.780> want

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
for just you know because I don't want

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.009 
for just you know because I don't want
me<00:04:09.080> listen<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.349> music<00:04:09.860> or<00:04:09.950> anything<00:04:10.900> so<00:04:11.900> I'll

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
me listen to music or anything so I'll

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.440 
me listen to music or anything so I'll
probably<00:04:12.170> just<00:04:12.349> leave<00:04:12.530> these<00:04:12.709> wrapped<00:04:12.980> up<00:04:13.450> and

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
probably just leave these wrapped up and

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
probably just leave these wrapped up and
asked<00:04:14.630> my<00:04:14.780> teachers<00:04:15.080> how<00:04:15.170> they<00:04:15.290> feel<00:04:15.440> about

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
asked my teachers how they feel about

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.310 
asked my teachers how they feel about
that<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:16.040> we'll<00:04:16.160> see<00:04:16.370> what<00:04:16.549> they<00:04:16.700> say<00:04:16.729> but<00:04:17.320> now

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
and then it comes with different sized

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.560 
and then it comes with different sized
Ed's<00:04:24.040> for<00:04:25.040> different<00:04:25.430> sized<00:04:25.550> ear<00:04:25.790> canals<00:04:26.060> the

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.150 
will see which one fits me best then put
those<00:05:10.130> on<00:05:10.310> there<00:05:10.750> you<00:05:11.750> got<00:05:11.990> an<00:05:12.350> extra<00:05:12.800> ink

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
those on there you got an extra ink

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.040 
those on there you got an extra ink
because<00:05:13.610> obviously<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.300> inks<00:05:14.539> replaceable

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
because obviously the inks replaceable

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.270 
because obviously the inks replaceable
because<00:05:15.200> that<00:05:15.320> would<00:05:15.440> really<00:05:15.590> suck<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:16.039> have

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
because that would really suck to have

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.650 
because that would really suck to have
to<00:05:16.490> buy<00:05:16.610> like<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:16.910> two-hundred-dollar<00:05:17.479> pen

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
to buy like a two-hundred-dollar pen

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.839 
to buy like a two-hundred-dollar pen
every<00:05:17.870> time<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.080> ink<00:05:18.440> runs<00:05:18.560> out<00:05:24.550> how<00:05:25.550> to<00:05:25.610> do

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
every time the ink runs out how to do

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.279 
every time the ink runs out how to do
these<00:05:26.000> come<00:05:26.300> out<00:05:26.389> of<00:05:26.539> here<00:05:28.720> just<00:05:29.720> one<00:05:29.870> sentence

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
these come out of here just one sentence

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.550 
these come out of here just one sentence
and<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.889> force<00:05:31.160> I<00:05:31.700> hate<00:05:32.150> like<00:05:32.419> this<00:05:33.260> type<00:05:33.530> of

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
and the force I hate like this type of

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.920 
and the force I hate like this type of
packing<00:05:34.070> where<00:05:34.940> it's<00:05:35.060> secured<00:05:35.510> in<00:05:35.630> there<00:05:35.810> you

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
packing where it's secured in there you

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.529 
packing where it's secured in there you
gotta<00:05:36.080> pry<00:05:36.320> it<00:05:36.380> out<00:05:36.820> these<00:05:37.820> are<00:05:37.970> caps<00:05:38.240> that<00:05:38.419> go

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
gotta pry it out these are caps that go

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.960 
gotta pry it out these are caps that go
on<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.720> end<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:38.990> protect<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:39.700> little<00:05:40.700> camera

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
because that's how this tracks what

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
enough it has a little bit of power so I

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.640 
enough it has a little bit of power so I
haven't<00:07:02.479> set<00:07:02.630> my<00:07:02.750> time<00:07:02.930> but<00:07:03.080> I'm<00:07:03.169> sure<00:07:03.319> in<00:07:03.530> that
