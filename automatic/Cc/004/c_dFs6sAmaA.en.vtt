I think that exercise is a really

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
I think that exercise is a really

if you're new to high carb low fat then

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.340 
if you're new to high carb low fat then
it's<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:45.030> important<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> meet<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.020> caloric

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it's very important to meet your caloric

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.069 
it's very important to meet your caloric

struggling to meet those calorie goals

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
struggling to meet those calorie goals
because<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.110> exercise<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.860> consuming<00:00:56.520> those

because your exercise is consuming those

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.849 
because your exercise is consuming those

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
say it's 700 calories and so seven hours

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.720 
say it's 700 calories and so seven hours
later<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.989> 7<00:02:44.380> p.m.<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.160> take<00:02:45.370> another
