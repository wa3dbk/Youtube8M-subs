00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
say it's got a still a reputation for

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280 
say it's got a still a reputation for
being<00:01:02.100> an<00:01:02.460> extremely<00:01:03.120> seaworthy<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:03.870> stiff

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
being an extremely seaworthy and stiff

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.920 
being an extremely seaworthy and stiff
vessel<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:06.030> are<00:01:06.150> quite<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> few<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
vessel and there are quite a few that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.510 
vessel and there are quite a few that
have<00:01:06.960> crossed<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> Atlantic<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.159> believe

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
have crossed the Atlantic and I believe

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.820 
have crossed the Atlantic and I believe
even<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.420> two<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.840> circumnavigated<00:01:10.260> by

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
even one or two have circumnavigated by

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
even one or two have circumnavigated by
now<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:14.100> turned<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.150> could

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
now and it turned out that if I could

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.899 
now and it turned out that if I could
find<00:01:15.570> one<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.619> did<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.100> work<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.670> was
