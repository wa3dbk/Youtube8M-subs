how to keep your feet warm in winter weather uses for handwarmers do handwarmers work

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.310
hi it's AlaskaGranny

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.420
I recently got back from a hunting trip

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.990
it turned out to be much colder and snowier than

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.420
expected so I  wanted to tell you how I

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.150
made sure my feet stayed nice and warm

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.770
before I left  I got these new boots from Cabela's

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.029
Pinnacle 400 gram insulate

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.330
and they were  extremely comfortable

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.270
they are  waterproof and they have lots of leather on them

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.739
I was hiking all over  through deep snow I climbing over logs

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.920
gigantic rocks and things

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.340
I even slipped and fell in a stream

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.950
never got wet  and the shoes were comfy

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.230
however my feet got very cold

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.320
and I wasn't counting on that so I was glad I started
off

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.550
the first day  just wearing my favorite Cabela's socks

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.140
and my feet got cold so then the next
day or afternoon

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.150
I put on silk liners

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.939
I have thin silk liners from Cabela's

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.049
couple years ago

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.610
I put these on under these socks and then put on the boots  that was pretty good

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.950
but then the weather got very cold, down to zero

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.770
what I was glad I had were the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.229
foot warmers    these are actually
made

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.500
for toes    they come 2 in a pack and they are adhesive

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.810
so I put on my silk liners

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.490
and then right on my toes I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.720
adhered the toe warmer

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.460
I put my other sock over that to keep it insulated and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.719
and then I put on my boots

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.740
I put them on before I left the cabin in the morning and a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.130
they stayed warm it says on here six hours and they lasted at least 6 hours

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.580
I was very glad I had them

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.900
I had multiples of them and my feet were never cold again

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.180
then I decided any time I'm going to go out again

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.030
I am going to be sure bring enough of  these so I have

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.560
enough a pair for the morning a pair for the afternoon and another pair

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.569
if shoes or boots ever get wet

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.310
drop these in overnight and  they can help dry them out  I didn't
have a problem with that

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.840
I had extra boots in case mine got wet but they never did

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.379
but just to make sure  I'm prepared

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.620
from now on I am going to take 3 pairs of these for each day I am out hunting

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.170
I like the Cabela's  Pinaccle  400 gram boots

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.209

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.680
but they  just weren't warm enough for

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.510
where I was hunting so always make
sure to bring extra socks

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.629
and extra gear so

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.800
if  the weather is worse than
expected

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.709
you are gonna be fine and then you are gonna have lots of fun

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.129
it is fun to be out in the woods

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.949
