00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.759
 the regional federation of cooperatives 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.460
 agricultural meeting the department 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.210
 of the meeting and the cirad presents you 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.210
 lose here 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.680
 listen to the shelter 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.680
 listen to his world 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.910
 forget the fire forget the death 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.760
 down to earth the head in the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.590
 clouds of his musical interpretations 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.870
 jean jules morel is a farmer is 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.969
 a troubadour two facets of his 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.339
 personality he cultivates the one and 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.510
 the other with passion between saying indeed 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.510
 he has to hold 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.360
 my parents my grandparents they have 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.820
 all they have all been more or less lived 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.410
 Thursday do more or less because my 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.720
 back grandfather was doing more of the 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.270
 picking I would say aiea grandfather my 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.770
 grandfather was half musicians - dia 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.840
 culture I say half because 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.930
 it was copper orchestras 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.740
 the time he had debated 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.660
 I was going to say beautiful but these debates 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.300
 there I had bullets everywhere 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.100
 right and left and often the passion 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.590
 music for more support 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.740
 relation to agricultural activity properly 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.050
 said and here it was not a 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.280
 agriculture that was rational and 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.180
 promotional as it is 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.950
 today 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.479
 from father to son the work of the land 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.399
 it is thus transmitted in the family 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.100
 morel over generations 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.710
 by necessity at the beginning and then also 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.750
 by passion on their exploitation located 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.090
 in the highs of saint joseph jean 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.070
 jules marie queen his wife and rodolphe 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.410
 their son produce today in 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.020
 optimal conditions his stag 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.640
 product quality tomatoes 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.170
 basically the tomato round the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.940
 big tomato on the farm know 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.000
 it's hard you're at an altitude 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.380
 who is who is good we are at 550 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.090
 meters of altitude 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.030
 it's an appropriate altitude and for 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.030
 the little one for the big one we are well we 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.890
 is well placed tradition and innovation 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.860
 are the two drivers of this 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.780
 family farm jean jules is 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.340
 one of the first, for example, to have 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.290
 used on his crops 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.440
 a biological control technique against 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.500
 their ode a pest of tomato a 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.300
 method developed by cirad 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.310
 still today the cooperative of which 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.800
 it's part works in partnership 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.910
 with other actors on a project 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.849
 innovative deco extraction we go we go 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.440
 to welcome an eggplant we will eat it 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.270
 but maybe tomorrow we can 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.599
 extract molecules from this 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.310
 aubergine years that have a added value 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.700
 much more important than she has 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.569
 today 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.140
 and that's the foreshadowing of what tomorrow 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.560
 will be farming in in the landscape 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.140
 agricultural of the island if you do not 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.120
 with with the innovation with the technique 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.060
 you are in withdrawal and you are no longer 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.590
 time it's obvious that everyone must have to 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.510
 move forward compared to what my 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.190
 ancestors in fact what I do what 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.170
 my son will do what his little son 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.940
 to do is a perpetual evolution 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.940
 there is not even discussed that 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.450
 at 22 years old rodolphe morel is underway 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.180
 installation 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.130
 young already they wanted to follow the 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.420
 traces of his parents and become like 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.030
 them 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.280
 farmers and their 80s age 80 is a 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.380
 criterion he worked at school because 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.190
 that and no taxis time it takes 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.860
 to know how to read and write 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.600
 and that's what motivated him for school 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.820
 by titling Thursday in an agricultural bts 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.640
 so he gives me the capacity for a 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.490
 operating from us settle with with 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.140
 the n 6 th Thursday is important too 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.880
 to have a level of qualification for 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.130
 to be able to have notions of management 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.180
 accounting not what I say the 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.370
 crafts and culture was not 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.410
 only start as missed pick 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.239
 we say it's also the management of a 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.720
 company so it's important I say 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.210
 I think 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.070
 on the family farm rodolphe a 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.290
 already taken in hand part of the 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.780
 vegetable production and livestock 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.730
 chickens shouldered in his task by his 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.820
 parents of course but also by his 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.650
 future wife emilie it's easier 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.970
 when we know how we work one 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.170
 and the other we know we can do this 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.520
 that we are able to do so we 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.560
 manages to divide the tasks 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.970
 the hardest work he does me I 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.500
 have you been in the papers after 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.120
 I will help him in the greenhouses for 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.770
 clean what can I do and over the 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.190
 big fat big is easier than being 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.680
 alone 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.950
 everyone puts the stuff that everyone masters 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.750
 not everything here as elsewhere probably 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.150
 it is this family structure well 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.540
 anchored which is the strength of this 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.930
 farm of course this is 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.760
 obvious that having family 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.940
 around them the parents 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.220
 grandparents by the know-how been 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.800
 passed on by the inheritance and the children 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.590
 who come back on behind and the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.180
 future little who comes after this is 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.560
 obvious that it gives a lot more 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.390
 force to an agricultural structure 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.890
 I mean a funny structure but 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.990
 I think it's also valid 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.690
 for an economic structure which 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.290
 whether in any sector 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.810
 business 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.300
 the family remains a strong wind pillar 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.150
 important has basically yes I 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.220
 am absolutely convinced a real 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.350
 philosophy another vision of 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.330
 farming that jean jules and marie 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.460
 Queen also loves to share with the 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.300
 visitors to their cottage with large elbow 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.190
 it always seemed obvious to me that the 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.880
 agricultural world had to communicate with 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.040
 outdoors 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.630
 and what better than a structure like 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.850
 that to tell people to show the 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.919
 people what we do good I have the chance to 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.200
 to be able to do some music and and 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.330
 to give a little more soul to what I 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.370
 do but it's true that every time 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.100
 people come here I can their 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.020
 explain my job 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.630
 reconcile the consumer with the 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.150
 producer that's it I can not 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.080
 explain why it happened like this 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.780
 but it was a bit 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.419
 it's not about combining the craft of 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.400
 gieter jitter fingering tables and 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.810
 agriculture in general that does not 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.050
 seemed something completely 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:38.560
 completely natural and supplements 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:40.560
 complementary ones who badly barred 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.560
 Oh 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.930
 you are badly barred 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.930
 we know history 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.350
 no
