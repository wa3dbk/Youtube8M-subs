00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
moon thought that's all warden so big

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.430 
moon thought that's all warden so big
Warren<00:05:48.500> Hills<00:05:49.060> so<00:05:50.060> so<00:05:50.509> the<00:05:50.599> game<00:05:50.780> basically<00:05:51.199> it

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
Warren Hills so so the game basically it

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.140 
Warren Hills so so the game basically it
just<00:05:51.469> kind<00:05:51.770> of<00:05:51.830> you<00:05:52.009> start<00:05:52.310> in<00:05:52.520> a<00:05:52.639> world<00:05:52.880> and<00:05:53.060> it

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
just kind of you start in a world and it

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.959 
just kind of you start in a world and it
spits<00:05:53.449> out<00:05:53.680> random<00:05:54.680> to<00:05:54.710> rain<00:05:55.039> and<00:05:55.759> I<00:05:55.880> was

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
spits out random to rain and I was

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:57.270 
spits out random to rain and I was
looking<00:05:56.210> for<00:05:56.360> one<00:05:56.479> with<00:05:56.630> this<00:05:56.750> kind<00:05:57.020> of

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
looking for one with this kind of

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.240 
looking for one with this kind of
overhangs<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:59.020> arches<00:06:00.020> and<00:06:00.259> I<00:06:00.860> found<00:06:01.099> these

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
overhangs and arches and I found these

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.730 
overhangs and arches and I found these
these<00:06:01.789> three<00:06:02.180> cliffs<00:06:02.570> when<00:06:02.900> I<00:06:02.990> first<00:06:03.169> bond<00:06:03.469> and

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
these three cliffs when I first bond and

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.159 
these three cliffs when I first bond and
I<00:06:03.770> thought<00:06:03.919> they<00:06:04.610> were<00:06:04.729> kind<00:06:05.449> of<00:06:05.539> a

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
I thought they were kind of a

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.379 
I thought they were kind of a
leading<00:06:07.039> up<00:06:07.129> to<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.430> biggest<00:06:07.969> one<00:06:08.150> thing

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
leading up to the biggest one thing

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.679 
leading up to the biggest one thing
that's<00:06:08.990> pretty<00:06:09.229> cool<00:06:10.389> turned<00:06:11.389> out<00:06:11.539> quite

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:11.689 
that's pretty cool turned out quite

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.379 
that's pretty cool turned out quite
nicely<00:06:12.490> this<00:06:13.490> is<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:13.729> this<00:06:13.999> is<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.150> project

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389
