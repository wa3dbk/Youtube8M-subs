00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
students as they get older and I guess

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.950

she's<00:01:04.949> amazing<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:06.900> miss<00:01:07.170> Raine<00:01:07.380> can

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
she's amazing but I think miss Raine can

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.679 
she's amazing but I think miss Raine can
really<00:01:07.799> say<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.330> Grace's<00:01:09.330> emotional

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
really say that Grace's emotional

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.170 
really say that Grace's emotional
problems<00:01:10.020> are<00:01:10.170> almost<00:01:10.560> bigger<00:01:11.460> than<00:01:11.610> her

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
problems are almost bigger than her

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.840 
problems are almost bigger than her
talent<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.260> her<00:01:13.439> future<00:01:14.189> career<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
talent and her future career and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.340 
talent and her future career and
actually<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:15.360> needs<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.540> help<00:01:15.720> her<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:15.930> as

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
actually really needs to help her out as

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
actually really needs to help her out as
the<00:01:16.799> teacher<00:01:17.070> she<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.670> pulls<00:01:18.030> everything

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the teacher she kind of pulls everything

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.310 
the teacher she kind of pulls everything
into<00:01:18.689> everyone<00:01:18.990> else

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
into everyone else

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
into everyone else
but<00:01:19.530> doesn't<00:01:19.740> really<00:01:20.250> focus<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.850> herself<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
but doesn't really focus on herself and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.630 
but doesn't really focus on herself and
so<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.689> she<00:01:22.530> finds<00:01:22.860> love

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
so I think she finds love

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.390 
so I think she finds love
then<00:01:23.820> finds<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.630> little<00:01:24.750> Jenny<00:01:25.170> I've<00:01:25.710> arrived
