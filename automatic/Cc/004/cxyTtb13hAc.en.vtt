childbirth<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.840> one<00:00:10.080> common<00:00:10.530> example<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:11.250> loss

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
childbirth is one common example of loss

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.850 
childbirth is one common example of loss
for<00:00:11.880> game<00:00:12.090> with<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> mother<00:00:13.019> voluntarily

the<00:00:17.910> second<00:00:18.480> example<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:19.200> exciting<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.490> it's

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the second example is exciting but it's

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.030 
the second example is exciting but it's
a<00:00:20.790> bit<00:00:20.970> esoteric<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.560> may<00:00:22.800> not

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
a bit esoteric and one that you may not

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.070 
a bit esoteric and one that you may not
have<00:00:23.310> consciously<00:00:23.880> looked<00:00:24.240> at<00:00:24.420> before<00:00:24.600> I've

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
have consciously looked at before I've

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.410 
have consciously looked at before I've
never<00:00:25.290> heard<00:00:25.740> anyone<00:00:26.010> discuss<00:00:26.520> it<00:00:26.790> so<00:00:27.210> it's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
never heard anyone discuss it so it's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.100 
never heard anyone discuss it so it's
probably<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:28.860> here<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:30.110> to

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
probably do for you but here it is to

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.380 
probably do for you but here it is to
matter<00:00:31.320> fast<00:00:31.680> as<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.430> current<00:00:32.640> version<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the sink or swim situation man must

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.170 
the sink or swim situation man must
develop<00:00:42.300> his<00:00:42.960> ability<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:44.010> what<00:00:45.000> we

develop his ability to think what we

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.320 
develop his ability to think what we
call<00:00:45.449> our<00:00:45.809> rational<00:00:46.410> mind<00:00:46.650> and<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:48.210> our

call our rational mind and in our

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.270 
call our rational mind and in our
everyday<00:00:48.690> perspective<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
everyday perspective this is a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.210 
everyday perspective this is a
life-threatening<00:00:50.940> handicap<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.350> why<00:00:52.950> would

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
life-threatening handicap so why would

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.060 
life-threatening handicap so why would
we<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.720> example<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:55.770> hatch

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
we do that when for example the hatch

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.840 
we do that when for example the hatch
lead<00:00:56.520> who<00:00:57.210> primarily<00:00:57.570> relies<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.860> instinct

why because by doing this the human

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.610 
why because by doing this the human

these two functions we can not only go
with<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.720> flow<00:03:18.990> now<00:03:19.200> but<00:03:19.530> coupled<00:03:20.040> with<00:03:20.160> our

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
wheel we can now choose and direct the

to this urge to reconnect to our
instinct<00:03:43.500> our<00:03:43.620> spirituality<00:03:44.180> because<00:03:45.180> we've

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
instinct our spirituality because we've

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.620 
instinct our spirituality because we've
got<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.500> steering<00:03:46.860> wheel<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.340> now<00:03:47.910> we<00:03:48.420> hear

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
got the steering wheel and now we hear

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.660 
got the steering wheel and now we hear
the<00:03:48.750> call<00:03:49.020> to<00:03:49.350> find<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.860> vehicle<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.520> was

the call to find the vehicle it was
