like<00:02:16.150> saying<00:02:16.540> you're<00:02:16.780> running<00:02:17.080> our<00:02:17.200> memory<00:02:17.650> I

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
like saying you're running our memory I

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.920 
like saying you're running our memory I
guess<00:02:18.790> I've<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.000> legs<00:02:19.300> up<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.510> cut<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.780> holes

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
guess I've the legs up to cut the holes

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.840 
guess I've the legs up to cut the holes
whole<00:02:20.140> died<00:02:20.410> down<00:02:20.650> all<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.920> videos<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.459> suppose
