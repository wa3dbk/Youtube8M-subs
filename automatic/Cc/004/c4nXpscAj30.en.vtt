00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
know handguns i think are very balanced

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.480 
know handguns i think are very balanced
in<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.019> game<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.680> takes<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.980> few<00:00:29.099> shots<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
in this game it takes a few shots to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.780 
in this game it takes a few shots to
kill<00:00:29.640> them<00:00:29.820> but<00:00:30.060> it's<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:31.430> unbelievably<00:00:32.430> like

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
kill them but it's not unbelievably like

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.430 
kill them but it's not unbelievably like
call<00:00:33.059> duty<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.540> think<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.989> deagle

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
call duty for I think the deagle

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.900 
call duty for I think the deagle
everybody<00:00:34.980> can<00:00:35.130> agree<00:00:35.219> was<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> little<00:00:35.820> bit

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
everybody can agree was a little bit

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.610 
everybody can agree was a little bit
overpowered<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.110> say<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.500> wasn't

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
overpowered not to say that it wasn't

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
overpowered not to say that it wasn't
fun<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.309> think<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.390> little<00:00:39.510> bit

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
fun I think it was just a little bit

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.069 
fun I think it was just a little bit
overpowered<00:00:40.340> but<00:00:41.340> that's<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:42.239> take<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.750> this

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
overpowered but that's my take and this

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.479 
overpowered but that's my take and this
is<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.980> an<00:00:44.100> update<00:00:44.219> video

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

is going to be kind of an update video
I'm<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> talk<00:00:45.510> about<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
I'm really not going to talk about the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
I'm really not going to talk about the
gameplay<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.320> much<00:00:46.500> unless<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.430> see

town<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.560> don't<00:03:27.920> think<00:03:28.100> that<00:03:28.220> would<00:03:28.310> be<00:03:28.430> a

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
town I don't think that would be a

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.220 
town I don't think that would be a
problem<00:03:28.820> because<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.480> not<00:03:29.540> many<00:03:29.750> video<00:03:30.050> game

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
problem because it's not many video game

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.600 
problem because it's not many video game
nerds<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.620> it's<00:03:30.740> not<00:03:30.830> like<00:03:30.920> a<00:03:30.980> big<00:03:31.160> city<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.580> i

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
nerds and it's not like a big city so i

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.150 
nerds and it's not like a big city so i
probably<00:03:31.880> have<00:03:32.060> been<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.240> only<00:03:32.390> one<00:03:32.630> um<00:03:33.590> so

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160
