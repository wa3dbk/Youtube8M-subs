there<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.059> ArcLight<00:00:12.330> pro<00:00:12.690> unit<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:14.099> had<00:00:14.730> some

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
there the ArcLight pro unit we had some

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.369 
there the ArcLight pro unit we had some
water<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.360> was<00:00:15.480> standing<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.049> for

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
water that was standing in it for

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.670 
water that was standing in it for
actually<00:00:17.369> three<00:00:17.820> weeks<00:00:18.029> four<00:00:18.359> weeks<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.869> it

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
actually three weeks four weeks and it

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.410 
actually three weeks four weeks and it
got<00:00:19.859> some<00:00:20.070> nasty<00:00:20.340> build<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
got some nasty build up so you have to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.689 
got some nasty build up so you have to
cycle<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.960> water<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.350> table<00:00:22.710> which<00:00:23.430> should

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
cycle the water the table which should

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.929 
cycle the water the table which should
be<00:00:23.789> happening<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.570> regular<00:00:24.750> basis<00:00:25.849> in<00:00:26.849> order

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
be happening on a regular basis in order

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.259 
be happening on a regular basis in order
to<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.170> two<00:00:28.380> hoses<00:00:29.269> running

the sink
to<00:00:45.090> quickly<00:00:45.300> show<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.669 

the<00:00:53.460> pump<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.719> pump<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.109> drawing<00:00:55.410> water

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
the pump with the pump is drawing water

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:18.960 
the pump with the pump is drawing water
out<00:00:55.859> and<00:00:56.219> dumping<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.640> into<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.359> sink

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.570 

and<00:01:19.970> again<00:01:20.180> dumping<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.720> water<00:01:21.370> so<00:01:22.370> good

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
and again dumping the water so good

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.890 
and again dumping the water so good
water<00:01:22.790> in<00:01:23.090> bad<00:01:24.080> water<00:01:24.380> out<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.570> at<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.630> end

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
water in bad water out and at the end

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.200 
water in bad water out and at the end
we'll<00:01:27.140> actually<00:01:27.320> turn<00:01:27.680> this<00:01:27.830> off<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.370> let<00:01:29.090> the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
we'll actually turn this off and let the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.320 
we'll actually turn this off and let the
good<00:01:29.330> water<00:01:29.510> fill<00:01:30.730> in<00:01:31.730> order<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:31.970> make<00:01:32.090> sure<00:01:32.120> we

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
good water fill in order to make sure we

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.150 
good water fill in order to make sure we
got<00:01:32.420> all<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.900> water<00:01:33.020> out<00:01:33.230> we<00:01:33.830> might<00:01:33.980> need<00:01:34.100> to

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
got all the water out we might need to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.700 
got all the water out we might need to
Jack<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.700> table<00:01:35.030> like<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:35.300> did<00:01:35.480> here<00:01:35.750> just<00:01:36.620> to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
Jack the table like I did here just to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.040 
Jack the table like I did here just to
get<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.190> little<00:01:37.400> bit<00:01:37.670> off<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:37.880> ground<00:01:38.050> and

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
get it a little bit off the ground and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.090 
get it a little bit off the ground and
that<00:01:39.410> way<00:01:39.530> we<00:01:39.680> have<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.800> nice<00:01:40.330> angle<00:01:42.040> for<00:01:43.040> the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
that way we have a nice angle for the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.860 
that way we have a nice angle for the
actual<00:01:43.490> drain<00:01:43.790> all<00:01:44.540> right<00:01:46.450> once<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.510> tables

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
actual drain all right once the tables

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.140 
actual drain all right once the tables
been<00:01:48.020> drained<00:01:48.520> there's<00:01:49.520> a<00:01:49.610> little<00:01:49.880> bit<00:01:50.030> of

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
been drained there's a little bit of

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.730 
been drained there's a little bit of
particular<00:01:50.900> at<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.080> bottom<00:01:51.380> there<00:01:51.530> that's

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
particular at the bottom there that's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.320 
particular at the bottom there that's
not<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.890> problem<00:01:52.190> we<00:01:52.430> can<00:01:52.460> scrub<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:52.940> off<00:01:53.030> later

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
not a problem we can scrub it off later

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.450 
not a problem we can scrub it off later
but<00:01:53.600> essentially<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.590> water<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.980> now<00:01:55.100> clean

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
but essentially the water is now clean

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.060 
but essentially the water is now clean
we've<00:01:56.330> shut<00:01:57.230> off<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:58.250> tap<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.760> bottom<00:01:58.910> and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
we've shut off the tap on the bottom and

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.350 
we've shut off the tap on the bottom and
we're<00:02:01.070> currently<00:02:01.340> filling<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:02.060> up<00:02:02.120> to<00:02:02.270> the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
we're currently filling it up to the

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.640 
we're currently filling it up to the
table<00:02:02.890> just<00:02:03.890> about<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:05.720> a<00:02:05.750> three<00:02:06.050> quarter<00:02:06.440> mark

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650
