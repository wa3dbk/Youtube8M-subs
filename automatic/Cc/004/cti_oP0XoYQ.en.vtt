00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.510 
side of this right there take two more
engine<00:00:34.829> blocks<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.880> guns<00:00:37.129> stick<00:00:38.129> those<00:00:38.309> on

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
engine blocks as the guns stick those on

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:49.670 
engine blocks as the guns stick those on
there<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.239> should<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:47.870> now<00:00:48.870> take<00:00:49.170> to

small so i can put that right in there
and<00:03:27.920> tilt<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.549> back<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:30.500> like<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:32.230> and

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419 
and tilt it back so just like that and

this<00:07:20.680> tilting<00:07:21.580> function<00:07:23.310> we've<00:07:24.310> got<00:07:24.460> the

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669 
this tilting function we've got the

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.150 
this tilting function we've got the
Boosters<00:07:25.600> there<00:07:25.870> these<00:07:26.350> two<00:07:26.620> little<00:07:26.830> things

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 
Boosters there these two little things

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.180 
Boosters there these two little things
that<00:07:27.669> kind<00:07:28.360> of<00:07:28.419> shut<00:07:29.020> up<00:07:29.169> spite<00:07:29.500> like<00:07:29.800> poke<00:07:30.010> out
