00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello to all your attention 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.429
 another static concept namely 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.900
 oven which during operation as well as 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.009
 put any normal oven 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.719
 produces smoke 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.850
 let's look at this mechanism 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.400
 action and so load our oven 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.830
 let's say one regiment stove flares up and out 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.960
 of our house code begins to smoke in that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.029
 the moment the furnace goes out the coals fade and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.429
 smoke also stops as you can see 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.230
 quite interesting and beautiful effect 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.989
 well now let's see how it is 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.030
 the scheme was made very simple and in her 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.010
 basis lies with us the flesh generator of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.170
 the coopers of this coke generator are two 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.820
 exit start here with this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.309
 command block is committed to 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.989
 determines when our stove lights up in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.530
 this naturally helps us magic 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.600
 invite 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.059
 let's look at the team here with us 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.340
 obviously the test corner team which 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.530
 coordinates checks for stoves and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.270
 further checks two or three parameters 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.129
 namely Cook time i be on time 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.590
 both of these parameters must be equal 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.359
 zero if they are zero then our 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.820
 the stove doesn't burn well and accordingly here 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.979
 at the output we have a signal this signal 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.080
 blocks the red torch located on 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.090
 This block is also included. 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.470
 the second line of our generator whom 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.659
 accordingly when our oven 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.700
 lights up here the signal disappears and here 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.430
 this signal starts to control the torch then 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.570
 there is a torch gives an intermittent signal 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.640
 accordingly, further we begin 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.860
 work here is this group of command blocks 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.600
 we have a new team in them 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.200
 which became available in the last 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.540
 snuffer 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.640
 and this team flowed that is the team by 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.680
 particle creation let's break it down 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.780
 detail team go to as 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.400
 the first parameter takes the type of particle 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.350
 which we will call in this 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.240
 case i cause a big puff of smoke 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.890
 next we have the appearance coordinates 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.619
 particles and that is this point above ours 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.250
 chimney and then particle displacement along 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.290
 xx 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.060
 and under this will be zeros that is our 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.369
 the particle horizontally will not 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.320
 navigate y be the unit 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.759
 have our particles fly up like 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.070
 put smoke well and accordingly 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.960
 the last parameter is the speed of movement 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.600
 particles and i decided to put speeds 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.469
 somewhere around 1 10 it produces 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.360
 best effect 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.580
 you might ask why here 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.709
 so many command blocks the answer is very 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.160
 simple when we create a particle she 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.930
 created 1 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.520
 if we need some particles that is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.710
 beautiful table of smoke we forced 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.750
 use multiple command blocks 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.460
 in every command block I have almost 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.200
 same team except 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.060
 last speed options here 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.010
 leave a little different to you 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.960
 looked better well we still have 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.820
 one part of the circuit which is and again 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.560
 added purely for aesthetic purposes 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.750
 this is the output of the command block 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.390
 this output is what we do 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.340
 creates sound effects accordingly 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.290
 It works when the furnace is ignited 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.060
 only once the first team we block 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.130
 there will be a play sound team 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.090
 plays the sound of igniting fire more precisely 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.920
 lighter sound 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.230
 This sound will be played to all 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.390
 players located within a radius of 10 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.610
 coordinates of our furnace to spread it 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.890
 will be from the furnace itself and the volume of this 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.960
 sound will be equal to two respectively 2 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.390
 command block is very similar to x here y 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.220
 us team produce the sound of fire the same 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.830
 most players for the same 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.720
 coordinates, too, volume 2 and distortion 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.580
 one hundredth to sound yes he is a little 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.320
 more natural as you can see the mechanism and 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.420
 the underlying principle is very 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.160
 simple but allows you to achieve very 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.200
 beautiful effects I hope that you 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.910
 Liked on this all today 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.500
 thank you very much for your attention 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.740
