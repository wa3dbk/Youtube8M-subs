I've<00:00:50.989> done<00:00:51.020> is<00:00:51.230> I've<00:00:51.560> added<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:52.220> heater<00:00:53.170> now

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
I've done is I've added a heater now

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.590 
I've done is I've added a heater now
instead<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.310> putting<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.790> heater<00:00:56.980> before<00:00:57.980> or

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
instead of putting the heater before or

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.900 
instead of putting the heater before or
after<00:00:59.600> the<00:01:00.040> vinyl<00:01:01.040> goes<00:01:01.190> into<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.520> machine<00:01:01.790> I

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
after the vinyl goes into the machine I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.689 
after the vinyl goes into the machine I
actually<00:01:02.090> put<00:01:02.450> it<00:01:02.540> on<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.930> grit<00:01:03.440> roller<00:01:03.699> now

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
actually put it on the grit roller now

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.629 
actually put it on the grit roller now
the<00:01:04.759> grit<00:01:05.119> roller<00:01:06.189> let<00:01:07.189> me<00:01:07.280> show<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:07.549> is<00:01:09.639> now

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:10.639 
the grit roller let me show you is now

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:12.910 
the grit roller let me show you is now
you<00:01:10.759> can<00:01:10.909> see<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.179> vinyl<00:01:11.569> coming<00:01:12.499> down<00:01:12.679> the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
you can see the vinyl coming down the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.050 
you can see the vinyl coming down the
white<00:01:13.069> vinyl<00:01:13.389> now<00:01:14.389> you<00:01:14.450> see<00:01:14.899> that<00:01:14.929> grey<00:01:15.319> area

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
white vinyl now you see that grey area

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.209 
white vinyl now you see that grey area
that<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.329> the<00:01:17.509> grit<00:01:17.689> roller<00:01:17.899> and<00:01:18.889> the<00:01:19.009> grit

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
that is the grit roller and the grit

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.459 
that is the grit roller and the grit
roller<00:01:19.459> of<00:01:20.209> course<00:01:20.539> goes<00:01:20.810> from<00:01:20.990> end<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.380> end

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
roller of course goes from end to end

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.370 
roller of course goes from end to end
and<00:01:21.939> you<00:01:22.939> can<00:01:23.060> see<00:01:23.299> it<00:01:23.420> all<00:01:23.600> polished<00:01:24.079> on<00:01:24.259> the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
and you can see it all polished on the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.520 
and you can see it all polished on the
end<00:01:24.530> there<00:01:24.649> and<00:01:24.979> as<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:25.969> comes<00:01:26.149> back<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:27.350> gets

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
end there and as it comes back it gets

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.429 
end there and as it comes back it gets
Bray<00:01:27.740> because<00:01:28.189> that<00:01:28.609> is<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.289> abrasive<00:01:30.289> that

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
Bray because that is the abrasive that

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.099 
Bray because that is the abrasive that
grabs<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.009> vinyl<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:31.700> or<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.479> paper<00:01:32.689> pulls

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
grabs the vinyl and or the paper pulls

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.419 
grabs the vinyl and or the paper pulls
it<00:01:33.259> down<00:01:33.289> into<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.069> machine<00:01:34.719> before<00:01:35.719> printing

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
it down into the machine before printing

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.459 
it down into the machine before printing
so<00:01:37.429> what<00:01:37.670> we've<00:01:37.819> done<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:38.420> we've<00:01:38.899> added<00:01:39.200> a

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
so what we've done is we've added a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.800 
so what we've done is we've added a
heater<00:01:39.709> and<00:01:39.979> we<00:01:40.729> put<00:01:40.969> it<00:01:41.060> inside<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.600> grit

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
heater and we put it inside the grit

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.620 
heater and we put it inside the grit
roller<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.609> this<00:01:43.609> is<00:01:43.729> our<00:01:43.850> controller<00:01:44.359> unit

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
roller and this is our controller unit

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.870 
roller and this is our controller unit
here<00:01:45.609> now<00:01:46.609> with<00:01:46.789> this<00:01:46.909> controller<00:01:47.389> we<00:01:48.200> can

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
here now with this controller we can

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.339 
here now with this controller we can
increase<00:01:49.880> or<00:01:50.149> decrease<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.899> temperature

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
increase or decrease the temperature

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.830 
increase or decrease the temperature
which<00:01:52.069> is<00:01:52.099> shown<00:01:52.490> here<00:01:52.789> that<00:01:52.849> is<00:01:53.299> our<00:01:53.509> old

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
which is shown here that is our old

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.120 
which is shown here that is our old
temperature<00:01:54.319> that's<00:01:54.560> what<00:01:54.709> we're<00:01:54.859> trying<00:01:55.039> to

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
temperature that's what we're trying to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.510 
temperature that's what we're trying to
achieve<00:01:55.389> as<00:01:56.389> you<00:01:56.539> can<00:01:56.659> see<00:01:56.869> we're<00:01:57.109> at<00:01:57.319> 120<00:01:57.979> 16

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
achieve as you can see we're at 120 16

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.819 
achieve as you can see we're at 120 16
at<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.819> moment<00:01:59.289> now<00:02:00.289> that's<00:02:00.499> the<00:02:00.619> temperature

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
at the moment now that's the temperature

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.389 
at the moment now that's the temperature
on<00:02:01.249> the<00:02:01.310> grit<00:02:01.639> roller<00:02:01.849> itself<00:02:03.399> temperatures

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
on the grit roller itself temperatures

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.330 
on the grit roller itself temperatures
that<00:02:04.639> we<00:02:04.819> need<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.779> heat<00:02:05.990> our<00:02:06.020> vinyl<00:02:06.409> are

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
that we need to heat our vinyl are

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.860 
that we need to heat our vinyl are
between<00:02:07.609> 113<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:09.970> 131<00:02:11.260> degrees<00:02:12.260> Fahrenheit

between 113 and 131 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.930 
between 113 and 131 degrees Fahrenheit
now<00:02:14.870> as<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.260> said<00:02:15.320> we're<00:02:16.160> heating<00:02:16.370> up<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.640> grit

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
now as I said we're heating up the grit

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.360 
now as I said we're heating up the grit
roller<00:02:17.380> now<00:02:18.380> in<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> back<00:02:18.830> there<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.190> can<00:02:19.340> see

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
roller now in the back there you can see

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.210 
roller now in the back there you can see
a<00:02:19.970> red<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.870> black<00:02:21.850> bar<00:02:22.850> vertically<00:02:24.220> attached

a red and black bar vertically attached

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.980 
a red and black bar vertically attached
to<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.820> ground<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.180> back<00:02:26.330> side<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.570> that<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.840> a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
to the ground the back side of that is a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.010 
to the ground the back side of that is a
thermocouple<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.880> wire<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.450> extends

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
thermocouple now that wire that extends

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.850 
thermocouple now that wire that extends
down<00:02:30.260> from<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:31.700> bar<00:02:32.030> goes<00:02:32.840> up<00:02:32.870> tomorrow<00:02:33.110> my

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
down from that bar goes up tomorrow my

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.390 
down from that bar goes up tomorrow my
controller<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.200> senses<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:36.800> temperature

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
controller so it senses the temperature

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.640 
desire so what I'm going to show you now
with<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.660> thermometer<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.380> laser

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
with this thermometer it's a laser

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.490 
with this thermometer it's a laser
thermometer<00:02:53.470> okay<00:02:55.720> whatever<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.989> points<00:02:57.350> that

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
thermometer okay whatever it points that

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.850 
thermometer okay whatever it points that
it<00:02:58.100> will<00:02:58.370> register<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.239> temperature<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.959> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.960 
little dot on the top of hole in the top
that<00:03:02.840> goes<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.320> laser<00:03:03.680> on<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.640> bottom

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
that goes to the laser on the bottom

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.840 
that goes to the laser on the bottom
that<00:03:05.120> goes<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.720> heat<00:03:05.870> sensor<00:03:06.550> so<00:03:07.550> we're

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
that goes to the heat sensor so we're

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.030 
that goes to the heat sensor so we're
kind<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.120> close<00:03:08.360> at<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.690> point<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.290> where<00:03:09.800> the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
kind of close at this point so where the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.490 
kind of close at this point so where the
lasers<00:03:10.550> pointing<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.750> little<00:03:12.170> bit<00:03:12.290> above

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
lasers pointing is a little bit above

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.490

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
where the the thermal sensor is pointing

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.770 
where the the thermal sensor is pointing
so<00:03:18.500> what<00:03:18.650> I'm<00:03:18.739> going<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.040> do<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:20.060> know<00:03:20.360> what<00:03:20.540> I'm

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
so what I'm going to do is know what I'm

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.560 
so what I'm going to do is know what I'm
going<00:03:21.049> to<00:03:21.170> show<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:22.390> on<00:03:23.390> our<00:03:23.420> printer<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:26.540> can

the difference in aim point I'm pointing

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.020 
the difference in aim point I'm pointing
a<00:03:32.600> little<00:03:32.870> bit<00:03:32.989> above<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:34.280> RIT<00:03:34.519> roller<00:03:34.730> which

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
a little bit above the RIT roller which

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.900 
a little bit above the RIT roller which
is<00:03:35.180> right<00:03:35.390> there<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:36.549> let's<00:03:37.549> see<00:03:37.670> what<00:03:37.820> the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
is right there and let's see what the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:47.020 
is right there and let's see what the
temperature<00:03:38.390> is<00:03:40.630> okay<00:03:43.720> 157<00:03:45.370> 156<00:03:46.370> somewhere

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.440 
temperature is okay 157 156 somewhere
about<00:03:47.239> there<00:03:48.610> so<00:03:50.680> now<00:03:51.680> our<00:03:52.150> remember<00:03:53.150> the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
about there so now our remember the

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.670 
about there so now our remember the
temperature<00:03:53.930> needs<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.320> be<00:03:54.440> between<00:03:54.980> 113<00:03:55.820> and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
temperature needs to be between 113 and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.330 
temperature needs to be between 113 and
131<00:03:57.680> degrees<00:03:58.549> Fahrenheit<00:03:59.209> on<00:03:59.420> the<00:04:00.140> vinyl<00:04:00.530> so

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
131 degrees Fahrenheit on the vinyl so
