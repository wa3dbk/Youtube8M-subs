00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.050
 delicious and surprising a little 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.280
 almond slipper with raspberry I 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.080
 go see it's very simple and very 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.400
 greedy and we will start with the cream 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.710
 almond that will give on the side 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.010
 Creamy gourmet recipe then we go there 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.680
 go then you'll start by putting a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.699
 butter weight then the butter which 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.930
 is very important is that it is soft 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.910
 that is, we took it out , see 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.140
 for quite some time and it is 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.939
 really consistency ointment 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.260
 if the popes to match like that you will 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.940
 spend a few seconds in the microwave 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.610
 and room okay so you're gonna 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.719
 stir and I'm going to add a buddy of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.100
 Brown sugar 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.719
 so I put some ska on the water 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.440
 white sugar it works too but the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.120
 Brown sugar 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.950
 it will give a touch a little bit 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.350
 rustic recipe that is both 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.969
 will have this very very big side 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.110
 alas what is very important is to 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.030
 make well malleable ointment the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.070
 butter and sugar brown sugar mixture 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.600
 the go really has to work very 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.579
 important to make it really very 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.989
 very hollow but that's the mix is 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.699
 well well bleached well creamy 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.489
 now we will add the egg 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.939
 so hop in its place to well-being 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.939
 and we will add 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.549
 now we will add the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.759
 almond powder that will absorb it 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.979
 going to make the mix is very pretty a 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.479
 paw a little bit thick consistency 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.549

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.280
