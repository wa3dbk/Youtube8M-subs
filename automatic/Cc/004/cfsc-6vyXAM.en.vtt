00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

so<00:00:00.269> when<00:00:00.420> using<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.840> manual<00:00:00.989> setting<00:00:01.500> we<00:00:01.920> need

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
so when using the manual setting we need

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.269 
so when using the manual setting we need
to<00:00:02.190> take<00:00:02.580> our<00:00:02.760> camera<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.360> set<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.659> dial<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.049> n

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
to take our camera and set the dial to n

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.619 
to take our camera and set the dial to n
this<00:00:05.279> means<00:00:05.549> that<00:00:05.640> we<00:00:05.850> have<00:00:05.879> complete<00:00:06.480> control

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
this means that we have complete control

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.020 
this means that we have complete control
over<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.410> exposure<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.980> camera<00:00:08.370> both<00:00:08.849> the

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
over the exposure of the camera both the

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.120 
over the exposure of the camera both the
shutter<00:00:09.240> speed<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.050> aperture<00:00:10.469> size<00:00:10.679> as

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
shutter speed and the aperture size as

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.669 
shutter speed and the aperture size as
well<00:00:11.429> as<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.670> eyesight<00:00:12.200> to<00:00:13.200> control<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
well as the eyesight to control the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.860 
well as the eyesight to control the
manual<00:00:14.009> exposure<00:00:14.370> there's<00:00:15.120> one<00:00:15.420> bit<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.660> your

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
manual exposure there's one bit of your

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.210 
manual exposure there's one bit of your
camera<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.619> need<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:16.980> very

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
camera that you need to get very

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.300 
camera that you need to get very
familiar<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:17.699> I'm<00:00:18.600> using<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.960> Canon<00:00:19.170> here<00:00:19.529> but

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
familiar with I'm using a Canon here but

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.890 
familiar with I'm using a Canon here but
on<00:00:20.550> your<00:00:20.820> camera<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.210> will<00:00:21.270> be<00:00:21.420> exactly<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
on your camera it will be exactly the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.509 
on your camera it will be exactly the
same<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:23.130> look<00:00:23.279> through<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> viewfinder

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
same I some look through the viewfinder

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.839 
same I some look through the viewfinder
and<00:00:24.240> let's<00:00:24.570> explore<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.350> light<00:00:25.590> meter<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:26.670> can

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and let's explore the light meter we can

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.849 
and let's explore the light meter we can
use<00:00:27.000> our<00:00:27.150> manual<00:00:27.630> settings<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.289> completely

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
use our manual settings to completely

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.710 
use our manual settings to completely
control<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.279> exposure<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.210> photograph

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
control the exposure of the photograph

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.200 
control the exposure of the photograph
so<00:00:31.710> I've<00:00:31.980> set<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.399> shot<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.790> Claire<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
so I've set up a shot with Claire as a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.810 
so I've set up a shot with Claire as a
model<00:00:33.570> I'm<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.890> portrait<00:00:35.250> shot

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
model I'm going to do a portrait shot

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.400 
model I'm going to do a portrait shot
but<00:00:36.270> I'm<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.899> landscape<00:00:37.079> mode

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
but I'm going to do it in landscape mode

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.049 
but I'm going to do it in landscape mode
so<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.129> demonstrate<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.879> light

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
so that I can demonstrate the light

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.520 
so that I can demonstrate the light
meter<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.850> I've<00:00:41.850> half<00:00:42.690> depressed<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
meter for you I've half depressed the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.380 
meter for you I've half depressed the
shutter<00:00:43.800> button<00:00:43.890> which<00:00:44.489> brings<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.149> light

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
shutter button which brings up my light

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.630 
shutter button which brings up my light
meter<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> display<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.829> currently<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
meter on the display and currently the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180 
meter on the display and currently the
cursor<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.239> right<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:48.750> zero<00:00:49.079> which<00:00:49.770> means<00:00:49.800> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
cursor is right at zero which means that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.880 
cursor is right at zero which means that
I've<00:00:50.309> got<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> correctly<00:00:51.120> exposed<00:00:51.890> settings

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
I've got the correctly exposed settings

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.180 
I've got the correctly exposed settings

You Claire so there we can see we've got
a<00:01:05.369> nicely<00:01:05.909> exposed<00:01:06.330> picture<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> Claire<00:01:07.229> with

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
a nicely exposed picture of Claire with

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.830 
a nicely exposed picture of Claire with
the<00:01:08.220> correct<00:01:08.490> lighting<00:01:08.760> levels<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the correct lighting levels for the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.100 
the correct lighting levels for the
photograph<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.549> example<00:01:11.970> we've<00:01:12.840> under

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
photograph in this example we've under

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.740 
photograph in this example we've under
exposed<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> picture<00:01:14.220> by<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:14.760> stop<00:01:15.150> which

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
exposed the picture by one stop which

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
exposed the picture by one stop which
actually<00:01:16.020> brings<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> color<00:01:17.220> within<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
actually brings out the color within the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.590 
actually brings out the color within the
picture<00:01:18.869> much<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:20.520> enhanced<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> so

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
picture much more it's enhanced it so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.330 
picture much more it's enhanced it so
sometimes<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.229> under<00:01:22.470> exposed<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> enhance

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
sometimes we under exposed to enhance

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.450 
sometimes we under exposed to enhance
color<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.270> example<00:01:24.689> we've<00:01:25.200> actually

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
color in this example we've actually

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.340 
color in this example we've actually
overexposed<00:01:26.460> by<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.060> stop<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.960> means<00:01:28.259> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
overexposed by one stop this means that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.100 
overexposed by one stop this means that
the<00:01:28.500> models<00:01:28.890> features<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.579> much<00:01:29.970> lighter<00:01:30.329> but

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the models features a much lighter but

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
the models features a much lighter but
also<00:01:31.290> much<00:01:31.650> softer<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> much<00:01:32.850> more

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
also much softer it's a much more

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.670 
also much softer it's a much more
pleasing<00:01:33.270> composition<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.320> kind<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
pleasing composition for this kind of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.890 
pleasing composition for this kind of
portrait<00:01:35.220> which<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.880> tend<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.180> call<00:01:36.240> high<00:01:36.659> key

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
portrait which we tend to call high key

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.499 
portrait which we tend to call high key
portraiture<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.759> creative<00:01:39.210> way<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
portraiture one really creative way to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.870 
portraiture one really creative way to
use<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.110> manual<00:01:40.290> settings<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.549> control

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
use the manual settings is to control

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.819 
use the manual settings is to control
the<00:01:42.030> exposure<00:01:42.119> triangle<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.170> ISO<00:01:43.619> shutter

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
paint light trails into an image if we

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.249 
paint light trails into an image if we
set<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.680> really<00:01:50.100> slow<00:01:50.460> shutter<00:01:50.820> speed<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:52.020> give

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
set a really slow shutter speed but give

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.499 
set a really slow shutter speed but give
a<00:01:52.290> corresponding<00:01:53.070> aperture<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.700> ISO<00:01:54.090> setting

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
a corresponding aperture and ISO setting

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.810 
a corresponding aperture and ISO setting
to<00:01:54.659> give<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> good<00:01:55.049> exposure<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.579> take<00:01:56.790> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
to give a good exposure and then take a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
to give a good exposure and then take a
photograph<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.540> car<00:01:57.810> moving<00:01:58.229> through<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
photograph of a car moving through the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.999 
photograph of a car moving through the
frame<00:01:59.340> we<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.479> use<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.049> cars<00:02:01.320> lights<00:02:01.680> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
frame we can use the cars lights to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.700 
frame we can use the cars lights to
paint<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.399> trail<00:02:02.670> across<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.450> image<00:02:03.570> which<00:02:04.500> can

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
paint a trail across the image which can

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.580 
paint a trail across the image which can
give<00:02:04.829> some<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.430> creative<00:02:05.670> effects<00:02:06.590> ferg

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
give some really creative effects ferg

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.529 
give some really creative effects ferg
on<00:02:07.770> rides<00:02:08.039> are<00:02:08.220> also<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.910> good<00:02:09.030> examples

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
on rides are also really good examples

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.820 
on rides are also really good examples
of<00:02:09.690> how<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.110> use<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.470> technique

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
of how you can use this technique

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.190 
of how you can use this technique
there's<00:02:11.760> no<00:02:11.970> real<00:02:12.300> right<00:02:12.599> or<00:02:12.840> wrong<00:02:13.020> way<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
there's no real right or wrong way of

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.740 
there's no real right or wrong way of
doing

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
doing

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.230 
doing
yes<00:02:13.840> it's<00:02:14.410> very<00:02:14.470> much<00:02:14.860> trial<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.340> error<00:02:15.520> so

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
yes it's very much trial and error so

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.540 
yes it's very much trial and error so
keep<00:02:16.750> practicing<00:02:16.960> keep<00:02:17.800> working<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.400> and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
keep practicing keep working on it and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.250 
keep practicing keep working on it and
keep<00:02:19.120> checking<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.540> images<00:02:19.930> as<00:02:20.110> they're

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
keep checking the images as they're

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.230 
keep checking the images as they're
coming<00:02:20.410> up<00:02:20.620> on<00:02:20.800> your<00:02:20.920> screen<00:02:21.190> so<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.030> get

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
coming up on your screen so that you get
