 it's actually a course is aeronautical we

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.199
 false document 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.610

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880
 defend 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:30.460

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.460
 I sang for a year and a half. 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.489
 even though the drugs were not 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.829
 found the investigations continue and 

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:03.049
 the accused must remain in custody 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.450

 really that he was selling drugs but he is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.790
 Unfortunately, this one with the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.130

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.459

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:31.609
