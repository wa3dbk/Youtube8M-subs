 has searched for the easiest way to 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.090
 communicate technology has come to 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.070
 such a point that only in the palm of 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.400
 our hands we can have access to 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.960
 a global screen is to say who 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.339
 only seconds we can keep 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.339

 rich 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.690
 and then like me the reflection environment 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.970

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.380
 for my best friend I think the box 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.929
 of secrets by the method of communicating 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.729
 whatsapp calls apart also if 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.579

 good for a best friend the cell phone is 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.689
 very important since it is a way of 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.120
 however communication can also 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.210
 serve as a form of editorial mind 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.229
 for me 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.390
 the cell phone is very necessary because 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.520
 because he always brings it when he lacks 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.520
 something something is always looking for 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.020
 If you can not find a phone , 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.170
 as we saw earlier the phone 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.530
 cellular is indispensable for many 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.020
 people 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.209
 the perfect name to define it is the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.970
 nomofobia which is the dependence on 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.680
 cell phones many people do not 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.700
 they do not even know that they exist and a lot 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.700
 less than the one suffered 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.410
 did you know that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.709

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.849
 cell phones called hypersensitivity 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.470
 electromagnetic philippines is the country

 6 hours a day 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.569
 next I will present you a 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.560
 interview with an expert on the subject 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.560
 accompanied 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.470
 good the nomophobia in some articles 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.990
 of research refers that is fear 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.390
 excessive like any other phobia 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.670
 but in this case to leave forgotten 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.670
 the cell phone or the mobile phone in the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.200
 home or lose it completely that you do not 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.270
 he knows where it is a situation 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.130
 relatively new since afterwards it is 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.920
 completely related to what it is 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.020
 the appearance of mobile phones 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.960
 then this situation is not yet known 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.880
 completely if it includes factors 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.500
 anatomical or structural 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.959
 dysfunctions of the brain or it became a 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.550
 completely psychological situation in 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.680
 where the person then starts hitting 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.320
 so much that it starts to create a stress 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.780
 when he loses contact with the world 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.580
 outside or with people who are in 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.830
 another in another place with messaging 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.870
 instantaneous all this situation 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:23.190
 it's very interesting and it starts 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.900
 know just a part of this 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.120
 if it feels identified with 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.100
 some of his sufferings are not 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.490
 worry because the doctor next 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.340
 will give us advice to solve it 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.520
 the nomophobia just like other phobias 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.500
 presents a clinical picture a 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.570
 set of signs and symptoms that can 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.550
 present the person who in this case 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.410
 They are characterized by disorders 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.870
 of anxiety in the person begins to 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.560
 feeling stressed can have this 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.540
 Sweating increases the speed of your 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.390
 heart begins to feel also 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.120
 irritable then it can be aggressive 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.440
 these people and the situations that 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.630
 they begin to disconnect those of others 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.910
 people we are already conditioned as 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.340
 humans as well as the dog when 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.560
 listen the croquettes start to salivate 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.620
 the people when we hear some 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.780
 vibrating cell that are a call 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.100
 immediately we run and leave what 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.780
 whatever we are doing even to 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.270
 our family then is a picture 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.060
 very important are the characteristics 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.020
 of anxiety and disconnection of 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.810
 reality 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.970
 for treatment issues the 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.919
 first option is to realize the same as 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.449
 in any other problem this can 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.310
 consider yourself an addiction 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.289
 then the first step is to realize 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.930
 and in some articles they refer that there 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.819
 than to gradually decrease the 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.229
 use of the phone while in 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.300
 others refers that you have to remove it 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.520
 complete and gradually return to 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.069
 use it with a measure put goals 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.990
 of what I'm going to use 30 minutes today and no more 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:56.020
 I'm only going to use only in these 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.740
 situations in case of emergency of the 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.599
 or more and some other studies refer 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.729
 that can cause some type of cancer 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.099
 cerebral is the excessive use of 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.750
 phone and some research that 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.210
 I had the opportunity to do in some 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.460
 primaries raise the risk of 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.830
 obesity and overweight in children a 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.880
 problem that is current and that has 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.280
 many risks 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.550
 then the treatment if it has to be 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.289
 multidisciplinary after it was a taste 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.960
