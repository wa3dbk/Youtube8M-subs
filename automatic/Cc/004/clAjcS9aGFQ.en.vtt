00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 good day is very relevant is 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.760
 the question of buying apartments in new building 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.570
 every day people come to me with 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.340
 new and new contracts bring 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.170
 documents confirming new new 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.990
 schemes that are offered by construction 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.160
 companies and due to the fact that this one 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.090
 the question is especially interesting for all who 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.840
 has a desire to improve their housing 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.240
 conditions 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.590
 buy apartments new buildings I 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.079
 I propose to consider this issue and 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.610
 draw certain on certain 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.239
 circumstances special attention 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.530
 underline the most interesting and since 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.340
 to buy an apartment in a new building 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.010
 you should pay special attention to 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.890
 1 what contract offers you 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.980
 construction company is it 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.020
 contract is a years agreement 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.420
 contract his participation or some clever 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.180
 document and so if it is a contract for 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.290
 participation and it is registered with the state register and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.990
 you pay cash after 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.540
 his registration means at this stage 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.420
 Everything is good, as if the risks are minimal and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.430
 contract can be included if you 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.950
 description of how long 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.900
 document sent to date 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.250
 the most common 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.880
 is a preliminary agreement 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.600
 sales but also takes place when 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.270
 extreme 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.530
 his participation in the sales contract 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.000
 invest investment contract 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.000
 assignment of claim 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 a huge number of contracts that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 offer to become today 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.410
 not companies so here if this is not a contract 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.570
 participation means there is any reason 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.400
 which prevent companies from getting 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.860
 all the necessary documents and 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.200
 conclude a contract with you that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.670
 present moment 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.229
 allowed canada is a this only 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.930
 such combat part bound 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.880
 registration and so if you are invited 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.150
 enter into equity agreements 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 it means the company has problems 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.550
 need to check all documents 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.500
 find out what's driving these essential 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.120
 irrelevant can they cause 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.850
 that you don't end up with money 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.930
 apartment or him and based on this 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.670
 information move on and so second 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.580
 what to take what should be paid 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.489
 attention when buying apartments new buildings 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.420
 it is the seller that is construction 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:36.060
 investor development companies and so on 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:40.310
 the less sales link the less risk 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.350
 for nothing 214 federal law permits 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.489
 implementation of apartment sales between 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.739
 developer and directly 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.709
 the buyer is the daughter then there is a direct connection 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.900
 Buildings Company Buyer Agreement and 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.209
 archers after place if with you 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.810
 such a contract is concluded 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.120
 directly from the builder then whiskey in 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.540
 In this case, attention if you 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.569
 proposed special contract which 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.549
 comes from some 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.249
 but you are a member and not your activity from 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.829
 investor from an individual or something 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.689
 companies which enters 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.420
 previously acquired rights 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.760
 under the contract of his participation is necessary 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.500
 be very attentive to this 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.870
 deals need to check not only 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.730
 validity and reality of those 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.719
 contracts that were concluded before you 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.189
 but complete their payment is very often 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.209
 intermediate 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:42.540
 agreements intermediate agreements 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:44.650
 which were made out yes you who 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.540
 arranged let's say so between yours 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.780
 contracts initial contract with 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.019
 developer are placed 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.969
 parties are not paid and at 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.219
 such circumstances 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.719
 even with full payment of your contract 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:01.150
 he ended up 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.579
 will lose its power will be untenable 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.799
 and qualify for an apartment daughter not worse 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.930
 I could not therefore if you do not have a direct 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.299
 contract with the developer so the deal 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.509
 must be treated very , very 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.250
 attention 3 circumstances on which 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:17.109
 I would like to pay attention to it 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.269
 availability of title documents 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.739
 building permit other 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.470
 documents that allow 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.599
 or do not allow the developer to build and 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.270
 selling an apartment is wrong if at the time 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.680
 make permission to the police developer 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.630
 for construction it means that everything 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.520
 documents at least for the moment 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.599
 sales at the time of your conclusion 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.849
 your contracts 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:48.130
 they are sufficient and disable the contract 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:50.139
 In this case, there is no risky little 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.110
 how much if permission to 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.849
 construction of the developer is not available 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.559
 means that there are some 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:02.020
 separated problems either not signed 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:04.749
 lease or some other 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:09.189
 way not formalized land relations 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:11.589
 either there is no home project or 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.309
 there are no other permissive 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:15.009
 documents 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:18.099
 all the way to the absence of a cadre and 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.020
 all this should be checked why 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.879
 that without a building permit 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.439
 the developer has no right not to build not 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.849
 sell apartments without permission 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.349
 construction he will not be able to hand over the house to 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.419
 operation will not be able to connect 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.550
 communication will not be able to conclude with you 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.469
 equity agreement 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.789
 register it so when 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.339
 lack of building permit 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.899
 it is better to refuse transactions either 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:40.659
 check carefully and not about you on 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:43.059
 new document and have not yet had to wait 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:47.080
 when construction is allowed 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:48.550
 after that went and the last is very 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.360
 important and by the way for which I would like 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.099
 pay attention to this calculations 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.360
 making payments under the contract 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:00.339
 developer and so payment on the contract 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.269
 equity participation or other contracts for 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:06.699
 primary housing market and if you 

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:08.979
 enter into an agreement with a company with 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:11.319
 I recommend to organizations 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.610
 the order to pay exactly 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.769
 cashless payment 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.469
 you pay cash through 

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:20.409
 bank you have as confirmation 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.029
 payment payment orders and no 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.700
 disputes further on 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:27.610
 not paying enough 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.580
 lack of payment plan so on not 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.680
 may take place may not have if 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.650
 nevertheless fucking cash 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.350
 payment and she hangs around the office 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.940
 then without fail you should 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.520
 to be a man who regards 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:46.090
 machine and receipts come to the main 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.610
 will not interfere with the earth about mutual settlements where 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.680
 all cash will be indicated 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.680
 paid decisively in this case 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.340
 pay special attention only act this 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.040
 not 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.240
 document properly 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.370
 confirming the payment on the floor should 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.170
 be again and h cash registers 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.630
 machines and if I exercise a smoothly 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:08.170
 personally payment or payment orders 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:11.350
 if you expand payment by bank transfer 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:14.170
 if the documents confirming the payment you 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.840
 not saved missing and further 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.590
 there is a dispute regarding the acquisition 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.240
 Vania 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:26.440
 residential or other real estate 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:29.430
 there are great risks that the court does not recognize 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.880
 you are eligible for environmental reasons therefore 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.440
 properly 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.580
 pay the contract confirm payment 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.520
 keep necessary documents 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.410
 the documents are required before the fact 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.450
 transferring your apartment registration rights 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.830
 home ownership so we 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:50.380

 current moments and circumstances on
