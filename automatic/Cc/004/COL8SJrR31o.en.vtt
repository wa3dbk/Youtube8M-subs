00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.920> homemade<00:00:02.220> fireworks<00:00:02.669> and<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.120> have

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so this is homemade fireworks and I have

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.630 
so this is homemade fireworks and I have
three<00:00:03.449> chemicals<00:00:03.899> here<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.259> have<00:00:05.100> ammonium

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
three chemicals here I have ammonium

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.170 
three chemicals here I have ammonium
nitrate

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
nitrate

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.270 
nitrate
I<00:00:06.620> have<00:00:07.620> zinc<00:00:07.950> dust<00:00:08.570> and<00:00:09.650> this<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.800> an<00:00:10.950> ammonium

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
I have zinc dust and this is an ammonium

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.589 
I have zinc dust and this is an ammonium
chloride<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> act<00:00:12.389> as<00:00:12.450> my

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
chloride so this is going to act as my

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.660 
chloride so this is going to act as my
catalyst<00:00:13.110> actually<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:14.219> what<00:00:14.400> I'm<00:00:14.460> gonna<00:00:14.549> do

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
catalyst actually so what I'm gonna do

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.160 
catalyst actually so what I'm gonna do
is<00:00:14.730> I'm<00:00:14.820> gonna<00:00:14.910> mix<00:00:15.030> these<00:00:15.179> three<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.660> then

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
is I'm gonna mix these three and then

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.300 
is I'm gonna mix these three and then
I'm<00:00:16.230> gonna<00:00:16.320> add<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> couple<00:00:16.770> drops<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.190> water

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
I'm gonna add a couple drops of water

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.769 
I'm gonna add a couple drops of water
and<00:00:17.640> that's<00:00:17.820> gonna<00:00:17.940> create<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> effect<00:00:18.750> that

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
and that's gonna create the effect that

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.859 
and that's gonna create the effect that
I<00:00:18.869> want<00:00:19.080> for<00:00:19.230> my<00:00:19.350> firework<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:21.539> ammonium

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
I want for my firework the ammonium

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.840 
I want for my firework the ammonium
nitrate<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.320> particular<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:23.010> very<00:00:23.100> dangerous

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
nitrate in particular is very dangerous

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.939 
nitrate in particular is very dangerous
so<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.600> zinc<00:00:24.810> dust<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.289> terms<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.650> storage

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
so as the zinc dust in terms of storage

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.170 
so as the zinc dust in terms of storage
you<00:00:26.099> don't<00:00:26.310> want<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> keep<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.849> next<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
you don't want to keep this next to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.429 
you don't want to keep this next to
anything<00:00:27.390> else<00:00:27.660> there's<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.840> lot<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.109> different

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
anything else there's a lot of different

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.689 
anything else there's a lot of different
things<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.830> mix<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.490> form

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
things that can mix with it to form

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.450 
things that can mix with it to form
explosives<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:31.289> zinc<00:00:31.619> itself<00:00:32.040> needs<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.369> be

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
explosives the zinc itself needs to be

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.700 
explosives the zinc itself needs to be
steered<00:00:33.030> away<00:00:33.149> from<00:00:33.270> water<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.350> both<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
steered away from water so so both of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.170 
steered away from water so so both of
these<00:00:34.770> things<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.100> not<00:00:35.219> something<00:00:35.460> simple<00:00:35.790> so

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
these things are not something simple so

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.850 
these things are not something simple so
you<00:00:36.210> don't<00:00:36.450> want<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> try<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.079> you're<00:00:37.260> not

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
you don't want to try this if you're not

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.799 
you don't want to try this if you're not
capable<00:00:38.100> which<00:00:38.670> probably<00:00:39.329> means<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.600> want

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
capable which probably means you want

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.020 
capable which probably means you want
the<00:00:39.840> access<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.379> anyways<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.489> when<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.820> first

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the access to it anyways so when I first

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.970 
the access to it anyways so when I first
do<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.300> take<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> three<00:00:42.840> things<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.770> mix

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
do is take the three things just mix

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.459 
do is take the three things just mix
them<00:00:44.100> together<00:00:44.660> don't<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.960> mix<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.289> tell

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
them together don't want to mix and tell

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.080 
them together don't want to mix and tell
you're<00:00:46.590> ready<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:47.340> because<00:00:47.879> this

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
you're ready for this to go because this

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.400 
you're ready for this to go because this
can<00:00:48.239> get<00:00:48.360> set<00:00:48.539> off<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.899> easily<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.260> it's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
can get set off really easily if it's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.040 
can get set off really easily if it's
set<00:00:49.559> off<00:00:49.590> by<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> drop<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> water<00:00:53.570> okay<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.809> I'm

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
set off by a drop of water okay so I'm

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.119 
set off by a drop of water okay so I'm
just<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.410> pour<00:00:55.590> those<00:00:55.710> three<00:00:55.920> things

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
just going to pour those three things

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.500 
just going to pour those three things
together<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.879> load<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> rest<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.420> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
together then we load the rest of it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
together then we load the rest of it
ball<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> way<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.820> I'm<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
ball out of the way and I'm going to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.110 
ball out of the way and I'm going to
take<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.480> scoop<00:01:00.809> eula<00:01:01.050> used<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.910> measure<00:01:02.910> this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
take the scoop eula used to measure this

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.630 
take the scoop eula used to measure this
out<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> did<00:01:03.840> eight<00:01:04.019> grams<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> ammonium

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
out so I did eight grams of the ammonium

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.190 
out so I did eight grams of the ammonium
nitrate<00:01:06.030> eight<00:01:06.240> grams<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> zinc<00:01:07.020> metal

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
nitrate eight grams of the zinc metal

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100 
nitrate eight grams of the zinc metal
and<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:08.520> I've<00:01:08.970> added<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.390> gram<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
and then I've added a gram of the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.640 
and then I've added a gram of the
potassium<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:11.010> sorry<00:01:11.250> ammonium<00:01:11.610> chloride

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
potassium I'm sorry ammonium chloride

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:22.330 
potassium I'm sorry ammonium chloride
catalyst<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.610> let's<00:01:14.729> give<00:01:14.880> us<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> nice<00:01:15.240> mixture

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.440 

so<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.700> any<00:01:23.759> point<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.179> would<00:01:24.329> be

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so really at any point this would be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.060 
so really at any point this would be
easiest<00:01:24.659> set<00:01:24.899> off<00:01:25.079> so<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.380> grinding<00:01:26.009> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
easiest set off so just grinding it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.849 
easiest set off so just grinding it
together<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.520> need<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.850> careful<00:01:30.859> okay

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
together we need to be careful okay

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.770 
together we need to be careful okay
let's<00:01:32.219> try<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.429> put<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.880> into<00:01:33.210> kind<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
let's try and put it back into kind of a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.889 
let's try and put it back into kind of a
form<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:35.909> let's<00:01:36.060> put<00:01:36.179> a<00:01:36.240> little<00:01:36.390> divot

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
form and then let's put a little divot

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.980 
form and then let's put a little divot
there<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> add<00:01:39.179> the<00:01:39.299> water<00:01:39.479> that's

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
there so when I add the water that's

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.209 
there so when I add the water that's
actually<00:01:40.289> gonna<00:01:40.409> initiate<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.520> by<00:01:43.219> reacting

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
actually gonna initiate this by reacting

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.380 
actually gonna initiate this by reacting
with<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.459> zinc<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.209> going<00:01:45.329> to

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
with the zinc and that's going to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.029 
with the zinc and that's going to
release<00:01:45.719> enough<00:01:45.990> heat<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> melt<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.740> ammonium

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
release enough heat to melt the ammonium

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.260 
release enough heat to melt the ammonium
nitrate<00:01:47.459> which<00:01:47.670> will<00:01:47.819> then<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.030> able<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.179> do

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
nitrate which will then be able to do

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.399 
nitrate which will then be able to do
the<00:01:48.359> restoration<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.020> where<00:01:49.109> it's<00:01:49.200> going<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the restoration so where it's going a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.350 
the restoration so where it's going a
couple<00:01:49.619> drops<00:01:50.780> then<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.840> got<00:01:51.959> back<00:01:52.170> up
