 make a fashionable now very stylish 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.599
 avatar round arch here for me 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.289
 there are 2 online services 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.690
 I don't have a pre-installed photoshop 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:23.189
 so i use or online photoshop 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.189
 or already familiar with the service from which 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.269
 he used to be told in general first 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 this is online photoshop analog online 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.190
 photoshop he has a complicated name 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.360
 I still can't do it right 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.610
 say the fixer something like this in general 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.000
 in order for us to get started with this 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.100
 service we need to open a tab and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 guitar here you don't need to create 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.260
 new drawing in general everything is extreme 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.020
 I just do not know tracing paper probably 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.629
 photoshop official 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.960
 here we put 200 200 us this will be 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.770
 enough for our avatars 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.010
 Here I have such a small window 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.080
 one avatar 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.210
 square on which you can now 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:21.799
 show how it will look like 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.799
 round format here we are dragging 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.380
 the picture is so necessary to slightly reduce 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:44.490
 here's how to do it now 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.570
 round on the layers panel we have like 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:53.520
 standard photoshop such mask icon 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.040
 layer we press it here and see that this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.439
 the mask we have superimposed on our original 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 picture 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:05.670
 now everything is very simple we go to the figures 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.739
 and choose the round shape of the ellipses then 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.010
 hold down the shift button and seeing 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.909
 our cursor is from 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.000
 corner of the picture just stretch 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:22.140
 we get this circle 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.680
 cut off here we got this 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.870
 round avatar 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.640
 but the only thing is that it is on a white background yes 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.860
 that is, if you have it on a white background 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.930
 put that basically everything will be 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.909
 ok if you want her to 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.780
 round format looked good on 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.980
 any background 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:50.739
 you just need to when creating the file 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:54.790
 specify the transparency settings and then 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.650
 the icon will look like a round on 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.970
 any background without this white 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.120
 white substrate that's one way he's 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.849
 such a little time consuming 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.980
 there are 2 much simpler which 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.040
 can be done in another service 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.139
 whose no less complicated name is gay 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.000
 francs 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.579
 here and how to use it already 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.769
 showed in one of the videos but now 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.260
 briefly remind after registering in this 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.889
 service you need to press the function 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.889
 add a photo 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.720
 here and upload a photo from our computer 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.720
 avatar 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.260
 here click here further 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:44.379
 that filter can be used can not 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.849
 apply it do not apply better prime 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:54.980
 to make a difference 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:57.709
 applying a filter here we have 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.720
 photos now to make her 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.280
 round 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.629
 we need to press the add function again 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.849
 photo and create a photo collage 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:13.430
 here we select the pattern as 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:15.970
 circle that's just dragging into it 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.970
 our photo 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.010
 now we see what we have with round 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:27.050
 photos on a black background 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:31.669
 he change to do business here 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.310
 what is the difference from 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.110
 previous service is that all 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.630
 much faster going on just 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.000
 we drag the photo but you see that 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.830
 no transparency that is if we are in 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.320
 first release can do transparency 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.450
 pointing just transparent background then in this 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.800
 In the service, well, we only enjoy all 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:55.760
 so that we have here 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.080
 we download a photo and we can principle it 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.080
 use specifically for yarbul 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.080
 use
