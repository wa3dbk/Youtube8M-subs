00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.139 
thumb brushed aluminum kind of look to
it<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.289> not<00:01:55.409> really<00:01:55.470> aluminum<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.970> least

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it but it's not really aluminum at least

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.219 
it but it's not really aluminum at least
it<00:01:57.240> doesn't<00:01:57.450> feel<00:01:57.539> like<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.840> feels<00:01:58.020> more<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it doesn't feel like it it feels more of

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.679 
it doesn't feel like it it feels more of
a<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> textured<00:01:59.759> kind<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.090> off<00:02:00.329> material

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
but has a really nice clean look to it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.419 
but has a really nice clean look to it
it<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.299> interesting<00:02:06.539> to<00:02:06.929> note<00:02:07.110> how<00:02:07.349> well<00:02:08.099> did

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
it is interesting to note how well did

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.009 
it is interesting to note how well did
this<00:02:08.580> design<00:02:08.880> where<00:02:09.149> all<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.690> buttons<00:02:09.929> are

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
this design where all the buttons are

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.210 
this design where all the buttons are
kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.229> scrunched<00:02:10.590> together<00:02:10.649> they're<00:02:11.190> not

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
kind of scrunched together they're not

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.610 
kind of scrunched together they're not
very<00:02:11.519> big<00:02:11.730> buttons<00:02:12.090> I'm<00:02:12.599> not<00:02:13.200> sure<00:02:13.319> why<00:02:13.500> they

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
very big buttons I'm not sure why they

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.860 
very big buttons I'm not sure why they
did<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:13.980> way<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.220> overall<00:02:14.819> seems<00:02:15.750> to

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
did it that way but overall seems to

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.780 
did it that way but overall seems to
work<00:02:16.079> there<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.799> additional<00:02:16.920> storage<00:02:17.250> back

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
work there is additional storage back

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.610 
work there is additional storage back
here

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
here

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.110 
here
there's<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.709> remote<00:02:19.860> go<00:02:20.549> into<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
there's the remote go into that in a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.620 
there's the remote go into that in a
second

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
second

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.420 
second
probably<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.590> weathers<00:02:22.829> a<00:02:22.860> remote<00:02:23.099> control

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
probably and weathers a remote control

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.759 
probably and weathers a remote control
so<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> couple<00:02:25.260> cup<00:02:25.470> holders<00:02:25.739> here

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
so you have a couple cup holders here

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.670 
so you have a couple cup holders here

this<00:03:37.769> one<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:39.150> hit<00:03:39.299> that<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:40.620> pops<00:03:40.860> up<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
this one you hit that it pops up the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.050 
this one you hit that it pops up the
display<00:03:41.489> there<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:41.940> now<00:03:42.900> we<00:03:42.959> have<00:03:43.230> GPS<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.790> I'm

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
display there and now we have GPS so I'm

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.369 
display there and now we have GPS so I'm
not<00:03:45.180> sure<00:03:45.329> it's<00:03:45.660> kind<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.900> funny<00:03:46.110> that<00:03:46.290> they

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
not sure it's kind of funny that they

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.830 
not sure it's kind of funny that they
gave<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.709> wireless<00:03:47.310> remote<00:03:47.519> control<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.660> all

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
gave a wireless remote control this all

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.750 
gave a wireless remote control this all
it's<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.140> touchscreen<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:50.609> guess

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
it's not a touchscreen and I guess

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.809 
it's not a touchscreen and I guess
you're<00:03:50.910> supposed<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.980> use<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.160> remote<00:03:53.400> while

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
you're supposed to use this remote while

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.410 
you're supposed to use this remote while
you're<00:03:53.940> driving<00:03:54.329> and<00:03:54.720> really<00:03:55.079> get<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:56.420> but

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
you're driving and really get it but

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.660 
you're driving and really get it but
it's<00:03:57.989> kind<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.230> quirky<00:03:58.879> it<00:03:59.879> seems<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.209> work<00:04:00.410> I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
it's kind of quirky it seems to work I

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.280 
it's kind of quirky it seems to work I
mean<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:03.030> don't<00:04:03.420> know<00:04:03.690> if<00:04:03.840> it's<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.079> best

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
mean I don't know if it's the best

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.220 
mean I don't know if it's the best
design<00:04:04.590> ever<00:04:04.799> but<00:04:05.099> I<00:04:05.640> guess<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.959> would<00:04:07.049> make

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
design ever but I guess it would make

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.390 
design ever but I guess it would make
sense<00:04:07.410> they<00:04:07.709> would<00:04:07.859> want<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.069> give<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.340> a

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
sense they would want to give you a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.490 
sense they would want to give you a
remote<00:04:08.700> because<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.629> is<00:04:09.780> kind<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.140> far<00:04:10.290> away

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
remote because it is kind of far away

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.690 
remote because it is kind of far away
from<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.769> driver<00:04:10.980> but<00:04:12.500> first<00:04:13.500> for<00:04:13.650> me<00:04:13.769> all<00:04:14.519> did

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
from the driver but first for me all did

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.400 
from the driver but first for me all did
a<00:04:14.760> really<00:04:14.790> good<00:04:15.060> job<00:04:15.120> on<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:16.139> stitched

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410

leather<00:04:16.530> design<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.250> fuel<00:04:17.459> pack<00:04:17.669> you
