hmm ok that's I did not really think
about<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.170> much<00:01:34.880> Nyjah<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.510> maybe<00:01:36.900> we

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
about this so much Nyjah for maybe we

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
about this so much Nyjah for maybe we
should<00:01:37.800> be<00:01:39.680> 744<00:01:40.680> he<00:01:40.920> finds<00:01:41.370> writer<00:01:41.760> Bishop

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
continuation not sure there should be

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.979 
continuation not sure there should be
five<00:02:04.979> de<00:02:05.310> five<00:02:05.729> deform<00:02:06.649> maybe<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:09.360> night<00:02:09.750> be

but<00:04:02.410> somehow<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:03.100> mean<00:04:03.570> sometimes<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:04.660> just

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
but somehow I mean sometimes you just

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.449 
but somehow I mean sometimes you just
know<00:04:05.080> something<00:04:05.530> better<00:04:05.769> but<00:04:05.980> somehow<00:04:06.370> I

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
know something better but somehow I

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.780 
know something better but somehow I
think<00:04:06.610> b5<00:04:07.209> is<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:07.680> don't<00:04:08.680> know<00:04:08.890> about<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.489> move

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790

I play a 4 here just to get it straight
he<00:05:49.160> might<00:05:49.400> play<00:05:49.880> something<00:05:50.630> like<00:05:50.780> that<00:05:51.020> and

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
he might play something like that and

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.210 
he might play something like that and
this<00:05:51.650> is<00:05:51.860> not<00:05:52.040> even<00:05:52.160> possible<00:05:53.770> so<00:05:54.770> that<00:05:54.980> was

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
this is not even possible so that was

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.940 
this is not even possible so that was
the<00:05:55.430> point<00:05:55.670> hmm<00:05:57.520> he<00:05:58.520> is<00:05:59.260> before<00:06:00.260> it's<00:06:00.770> not

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
the point hmm he is before it's not

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.400 
the point hmm he is before it's not
really<00:06:01.370> great<00:06:01.700> and<00:06:01.970> the<00:06:02.630> thing<00:06:02.840> is<00:06:02.870> probably

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
really great and the thing is probably

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.280 
really great and the thing is probably
if<00:06:03.980> he<00:06:04.220> is<00:06:04.340> not<00:06:04.610> doing<00:06:04.820> that<00:06:05.000> he<00:06:05.750> will<00:06:05.930> be<00:06:06.140> in

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
if he is not doing that he will be in

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.020 
if he is not doing that he will be in
some<00:06:06.500> kind<00:06:06.530> of<00:06:06.860> trouble<00:06:07.070> I<00:06:07.310> think<00:06:07.550> he<00:06:07.670> after

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
some kind of trouble I think he after

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.690 
some kind of trouble I think he after
that<00:06:08.210> it's<00:06:09.080> already<00:06:09.500> a<00:06:09.650> bit<00:06:09.920> awkward<00:06:10.160> because

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
that it's already a bit awkward because

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.820 
that it's already a bit awkward because
