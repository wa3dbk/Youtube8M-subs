as<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.560> issue<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:38.009> all<00:01:38.719> Dino<00:01:39.719> Zoff<00:01:39.929> managed<00:01:40.319> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
as an issue at all Dino Zoff managed it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.539 
as an issue at all Dino Zoff managed it
when<00:01:40.649> Italy<00:01:40.979> won<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.219> World<00:01:41.399> Cup<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.969> 19<00:01:43.549> 1990

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
I think if you can coach you can coach

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.010 
I think if you can coach you can coach
if<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.789> can<00:01:47.939> manage<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> managed<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> doesn't

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
if you can manage you managed it doesn't
