00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
my current MacBook Pro this time we're

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.880 
my current MacBook Pro this time we're
going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> take<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.230> step<00:00:55.379> further<00:00:55.440> I've<00:00:55.770> got

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
going to take it a step further I've got

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.799 
going to take it a step further I've got
a<00:00:55.920> bunch<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.460> components<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.329> Corsair

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
a bunch of components here from Corsair

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
a bunch of components here from Corsair
including<00:00:58.260> two<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.980> these<00:00:59.190> bad<00:00:59.460> boys<00:00:59.489> yes

those<00:01:00.629> are<00:01:00.780> almost<00:01:01.079> 500<00:01:01.500> gig<00:01:02.039> SSD<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.940> why

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
those are almost 500 gig SSD so why

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.340 
those are almost 500 gig SSD so why
would<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
would I have to because I'm going to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.649 
would I have to because I'm going to
replace<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> optical<00:01:05.339> drive<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:06.090> an<00:01:06.240> SSD

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
replace the optical drive and get an SSD

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649 
replace the optical drive and get an SSD
rate<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.409> almost<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.010> terabyte<00:01:08.610> inside<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.450> this

rate of almost a terabyte inside of this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.929 
rate of almost a terabyte inside of this
system<00:01:09.869> I've<00:01:10.470> also<00:01:10.650> got<00:01:10.830> some<00:01:10.890> RAM<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
system I've also got some RAM here to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.170 
system I've also got some RAM here to
separate<00:01:12.390> 16<00:01:12.900> gig<00:01:13.170> kits<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.220> them<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
separate 16 gig kits one of them is the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.660 
separate 16 gig kits one of them is the
Vengeance<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> other<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.530> Mac<00:01:16.860> specific

Vengeance the other one is Mac specific
we're<00:01:18.060> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> try<00:01:18.450> each<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.049> these<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
we're going to try each one of these and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
we're going to try each one of these and
figure<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:19.710> which<00:01:19.979> gets<00:01:20.250> better<00:01:20.430> performance

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
figure out which gets better performance

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.670 
figure out which gets better performance
and<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.420> works<00:01:21.689> better<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and which one works better so that you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.190 
and which one works better so that you
guys<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.520> own<00:01:23.759> purposes<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
guys know for your own purposes but the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
guys know for your own purposes but the
main<00:01:25.350> thing<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.979> put<00:01:26.130> together

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
main thing here is to put together

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.460 
main thing here is to put together
possibly<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> fastest<00:01:27.600> MacBook<00:01:28.080> Pro<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that that is my favorite design for a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
that that is my favorite design for a
couple<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.799> reasons<00:01:43.979> because<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.210> course<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
couple of reasons because of course it
has<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> little<00:01:46.320> bit<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.710> user<00:01:46.920> configuration

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
has a little bit of user configuration

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.880 
has a little bit of user configuration
available<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.799> be

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
available to you so this is going to be

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.020 
available to you so this is going to be
part<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> series<00:01:50.579> we're<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> put
