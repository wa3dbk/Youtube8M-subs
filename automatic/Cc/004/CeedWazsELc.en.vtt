there's a shitload of chopper to steal
iterate<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.970> race<00:00:19.150> usually<00:00:19.600> take<00:00:19.810> three<00:00:20.110> or

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
iterate the race usually take three or

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.519 
iterate the race usually take three or
four<00:00:20.380> shots<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.750> can<00:00:22.869> also<00:00:22.990> take<00:00:23.200> down<00:00:23.380> that

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
four shots you can also take down that

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.280 
four shots you can also take down that
phantom<00:00:23.920> pretty<00:00:24.130> easily<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:25.330> you<00:00:25.869> gotta<00:00:26.050> lead

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
phantom pretty easily it you gotta lead

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.769 
phantom pretty easily it you gotta lead
it<00:00:26.470> a<00:00:26.529> little<00:00:26.710> bit<00:00:26.890> though<00:00:27.099> because<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:28.480> tanks

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
it a little bit though because the tanks

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.370 
it a little bit though because the tanks
shot<00:00:29.310> takes<00:00:30.310> a<00:00:30.460> second<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.849> get<00:00:31.029> there<00:00:31.240> so<00:00:32.230> it's

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
shot takes a second to get there so it's

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.569 
shot takes a second to get there so it's
kind<00:00:32.560> of<00:00:32.619> hard<00:00:32.800> to<00:00:32.860> hit<00:00:33.010> those<00:00:33.160> images

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
kind of hard to hit those images

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.360 
kind of hard to hit those images
precisely<00:00:34.060> like<00:00:34.810> you<00:00:34.960> can<00:00:35.170> when<00:00:36.040> it's<00:00:36.160> close

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
precisely like you can when it's close

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.020 
precisely like you can when it's close
range

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.700 

but<00:00:41.660> it's<00:00:41.870> still<00:00:42.110> something<00:00:42.320> you<00:00:42.500> want<00:00:42.620> to

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
but it's still something you want to

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.840 
but it's still something you want to
shoot<00:00:42.860> for<00:00:42.890> especially<00:00:43.520> if<00:00:43.579> you're<00:00:43.670> trying<00:00:43.820> to

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
shoot for especially if you're trying to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.670 
shoot for especially if you're trying to
get<00:00:43.969> a<00:00:44.000> Metascore<00:00:44.329> achievement

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 

also<00:00:53.670> save<00:00:53.880> you<00:00:53.970> some<00:00:54.120> time<00:00:54.330> because<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
also save you some time because if you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.420 
also save you some time because if you
kill<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:54.960> pretty<00:00:55.200> quickly<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:56.190> prevent

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
kill it pretty quickly you can prevent

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
kill it pretty quickly you can prevent
it<00:00:56.640> dropping<00:00:57.210> off<00:00:57.330> a<00:00:57.360> bunch<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.900> I<00:00:58.560> think<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it dropping off a bunch of I think it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.710 
it dropping off a bunch of I think it
goes<00:00:59.580> and<00:01:00.090> maybe<00:01:00.600> some<00:01:00.810> choppers<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.260> shit

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
goes and maybe some choppers and shit

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.660 
goes and maybe some choppers and shit
you<00:01:03.720> have<00:01:03.900> to<00:01:04.020> get<00:01:04.140> towards<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.590> bottom

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.730 

another<00:01:08.670> scarab<00:01:09.210> drops<00:01:09.900> them<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.560> one's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
another scarab drops them this one's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.920 
another scarab drops them this one's
really<00:01:11.040> easy<00:01:11.160> to<00:01:11.490> kill<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.660> come

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
really easy to kill because you can come

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
really easy to kill because you can come
right<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.230> here<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.580> you're<00:01:14.580> almost

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
right up here and you're almost

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.440 
right up here and you're almost
completely<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.510> of<00:01:15.600> its<00:01:15.810> line<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.140> fire

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.550 

these<00:01:20.930> scarabs<00:01:21.829> are<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.009> lot<00:01:23.200> lot<00:01:24.200> cooler<00:01:24.469> than

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
these scarabs are a lot lot cooler than

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.830 
these scarabs are a lot lot cooler than
I<00:01:24.740> never<00:01:24.920> thought<00:01:25.130> because<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:26.180> if<00:01:26.539> you

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
I never thought because this if you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.569 
I never thought because this if you
shoot<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.170> sides<00:01:27.469> of<00:01:27.649> them

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
shoot the sides of them

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.039 
shoot the sides of them
there's<00:01:29.090> like<00:01:29.210> these<00:01:29.270> little<00:01:29.509> hatch<00:01:29.689> doors

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
there's like these little hatch doors

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.709 
there's like these little hatch doors
you<00:01:30.320> can<00:01:30.469> open<00:01:30.710> up<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.299> you<00:01:32.299> can<00:01:32.479> almost

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
you can open up and you can almost

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.490 
you can open up and you can almost
destroy<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:34.719> that<00:01:35.719> little<00:01:35.869> gun<00:01:36.170> that's<00:01:36.380> on

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
destroy the that little gun that's on

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.760 
destroy the that little gun that's on
the<00:01:36.619> top<00:01:36.799> of<00:01:36.950> it<00:01:37.039> it<00:01:37.159> looks<00:01:37.189> like<00:01:37.369> an<00:01:37.549> eyeball

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
the top of it it looks like an eyeball

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.709 
the top of it it looks like an eyeball
shooting<00:01:39.770> lasers<00:01:40.130> at<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.429> but<00:01:41.179> there's<00:01:41.569> some

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
shooting lasers at you but there's some

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.809 
shooting lasers at you but there's some
reason<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.170> can<00:01:42.319> like<00:01:42.469> come<00:01:42.770> 95<00:01:43.399> percent<00:01:43.789> of

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
reason you can like come 95 percent of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.160 
reason you can like come 95 percent of
the<00:01:43.909> way<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.060> destroying<00:01:44.539> it<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:44.990> gets

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
the way to destroying it like it gets

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.649 
the way to destroying it like it gets
all<00:01:45.429> blown<00:01:46.429> up<00:01:46.460> shit<00:01:47.000> like<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.329> just<00:01:47.390> knocked

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
all blown up shit like I just knocked

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:48.910 
all blown up shit like I just knocked
the<00:01:47.780> top<00:01:47.959> off<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.350> there<00:01:48.560> but<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.799> can

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the top off of it there but you can

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.090 
the top off of it there but you can
never<00:01:49.100> like<00:01:49.659> kill<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.689> completely

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.429 

you<00:01:57.189> know<00:01:57.310> just<00:01:57.520> keep<00:01:57.700> shooting<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.090> legs

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you know just keep shooting the legs

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.469 
you know just keep shooting the legs
until<00:01:59.439> it<00:02:00.369> gets<00:02:00.549> weakened<00:02:01.030> up<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.299> point

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
until it gets weakened up to the point

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.480 
until it gets weakened up to the point
where<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:03.400> falls<00:02:03.670> down<00:02:03.880> on<00:02:03.909> the<00:02:04.030> ground

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.530 

then<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.790> do<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.000> same<00:02:07.180> thing<00:02:07.390> you've<00:02:07.509> done

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
then you do the same thing you've done

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.490 
then you do the same thing you've done
before<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:08.050> jump<00:02:08.410> out

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
before to jump out

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.260 
before to jump out
put<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.980> couple<00:02:11.280> bullets<00:02:11.310> into<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.820> reactor

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
put a couple bullets into the reactor

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.920 
put a couple bullets into the reactor
core

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.410 

maybe<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.050> grenade<00:02:19.410> or<00:02:19.530> two<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.160> game<00:02:20.490> over

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
maybe a grenade or two and the game over

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.830 
maybe a grenade or two and the game over
mine

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
mine

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:32.490

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.440 

and<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:32.800> just<00:02:33.130> may<00:02:33.430> laid<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.790> scare<00:02:34.090> but<00:02:34.270> that
