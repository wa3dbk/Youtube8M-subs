 hello friends how are you today we have 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.250
 a very interesting driving test 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.189
 let's try the new hyundai sonata 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.830
 hybrid with the blue drive system 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.530
 hyundai let's see it 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.349
 we are ready, let's try the 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.830
 hyundai sonata hybrid hybrid is a 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.930
 vehicle that works with the engine and with 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.239
 electrical energy that comes from a 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.610
 battery has the engine forward that is 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.739
 a conventional motor is a 2400 motor 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.290
 of hyundai and in the back below 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.330
 of the trunk has a very good battery 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.540
 large that is loading is loading 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.640
 with energy that comes from the engine and that 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.170
 it also comes from the brakes at the time 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.589
 that the car is holding back that generates 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.220
 energy and with the motor and energy of 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.890
 the brakes is charging this battery that 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.940
 it also does it energizes the vehicle 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.940
 for the vehicle to work 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.219
 yes 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.049
 there are times where the vehicle is 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.659
 running only with energy 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.670
 electrical that's when the battery is 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.530
 loaded the computer knows that the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.479
 battery is charged and makes you work 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.619
 only with electric power the motor does not 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.590
 it works, that is, we are not consuming 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.140
 no fuel and no gasoline 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.600
 we are not giving any gas emission 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.259
 to the atmosphere is a very vehicle 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.259
 ecological 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.310
 and we're going to start the vehicle later 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.369
 turn on with the button here squeezed the 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.469
 button and the vehicle is turned on as you see 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.719
 and it has been felt that the 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.869
 engine because the vehicle is 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.910
 ready to move forward now is ready to 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.819
 walking here says that it is ready with 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.140
 some green directions on the board or 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.019
 at this moment the car is being 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.670
 behaving like a 100% electric car 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.209
 why it does not sound us 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.209
 we can continue 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.580
 the car therefore has all the communities 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.030
 everything everything everything that comes in the model 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.470
 Normal sonata that sold the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.540
 normal gasoline like the hybrid 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.490
 which are then we have all the controls 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.830
 at the helm we have cruise control 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.330
 we have the management of the radio and of all 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.220
 the audio controls here at the helm 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.650
 we have the bluetooth on the radio where 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.590
 we can answer the phone from here 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.260
 we have very comfortable conditioner also 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.660
 I set the temperature that I want 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.160
 we also have a system here if 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.050
 we press this button that is here in the 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.870
 flyer where blue says the eco blue 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.010
 drive that I'm going to press the button and on 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.439
 that moment 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.469
 I disconnect the controls that the 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:30.230
 vehicle computer to save 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:34.629
 fuel and energy saving and the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.629
 car gets me much faster still 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.099
 yes 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.099
 ah 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.170
 the truth that I was impressed 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.969
 with how this car works is first 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.069
 time you try a hybrid car and it's 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:13.739
 incredible that a car that has this 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.350
 technology where we have been in almost 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.959
 all the test walking with energy 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.120
 100% electric and with very little help 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.340
 of the engine have the benefits that 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.590
 has this hyundai sonata so he has 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.710
 It was amazing to try this hyundai 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:32.750
