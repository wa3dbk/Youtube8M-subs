00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
to go to Vegas and we feel like we got a

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.869 
to go to Vegas and we feel like we got a
shot<00:00:50.660> it's<00:00:51.650> going<00:00:51.769> to<00:00:51.800> be<00:00:51.920> tough<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:52.519> you<00:00:52.850> know

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.340 
shot it's going to be tough but you know
it's<00:00:53.090> kind<00:00:53.330> of<00:00:53.420> what<00:00:53.629> championships<00:00:54.199> are

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350
