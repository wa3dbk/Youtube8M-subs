00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.140
 hello again we are here in another 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.280
 draw of the channel another a lot draw 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.980
 important since this time 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.139
 we will be raffling a smartphone 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.450
 perfect nature 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.330
 tips and apart with a movement that is 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.890
 almost impossible to learn black gap 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.019
 in motion that is exclusive to give 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.960
 like and we all know how to give it to 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.089
 this is almost impossible to achieve and 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.470
 well at this moment it's almost almost 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.599
 impossible to achieve and much more 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.339
 pass this movement is still long 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.789
 but here in the channel we have a 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.739
 Perfect smartphone with nature and 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.780
 with black gap perfect for doubles 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.020
 that this pokemon would sweep in doubles already 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.390
 that black gap can sleep both 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.129
 rivals when we are in a combat 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.739
 double so it's a very very movement 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.170
 very to take into account is much better 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.960
 what is there that waits only sleeps 1 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.129
 with black brescia you sleep at 2 and 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 well next we'll see 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.859
 show them a video 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 where they will see that we have the embargo with 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.290
 the sips with nature and with gap 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.449
 black 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.490
 and apart you already know to compete only 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.610
 they are very few requirements 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.770
 just like this video 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.540
 discuss anything whatever to take them 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.520
 in mind obviously with its like and its 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.230
 commentary 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.060
 also what could they do then 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.729
 they obviously can share the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.010
 video and subscribe to the channel obviously 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.770
 since if we know that the one who won the 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.690
 pokemon further back written the wins what 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.090
 We regret but at the moment I do not know 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.189
 we can give 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.320
 and good apart from this that something else 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.909
 I wanted to tell you so I know this is not 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.859

 and good then I leave a video 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.820
 from the smartphone 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.440
 where I show that it has to look happy that 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.330

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.790

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.720
 like to comment subscribe and share the 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.720
 goodbye video 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.430
 and good here we have our smart 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.430
 world 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.830
 a little bit 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.899
 to the smart ball that we are raffling for 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.310
 that they see that everything that we announce here 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.709
 you can actually see what 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.690
 here is at some level one the only 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.060
 who knows is a black gap a movement 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.740
 that was extremely difficult to 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.680
 show him here you can see they are a boom 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.270
 and its nature that would be happy that 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.560
 increase the speed and decrease the 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.290
 special attack that is what this 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.640
 Pokemon needs to have expert but 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.620
 equally exists they want to change it 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.620
 well I sing a capsule skill for 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.630
 change it and good now for also 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.540
 check what he was commenting 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.300
 of the sips that is phillips is real then 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.190
 So we're going to be here with the 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.020
 batik city ​​judge and let's see what 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.570
 well, really, he's just missing a nick 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.820
 to the maximum because it only has 5 and at 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.590
 maximum but obviously the one that is missing 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.590
 is the special attack no matter 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.120
 for nothing 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.150
 and good here we have is bad 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.080
 We can see what it says, I see, I see this 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.739
 Pokémon has a potential 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.069
 extraordinary so I judge it at least 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:16.400
 by the way its potential lies in ps 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.890
 attack defense defense special and 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.860
 speed in general your pokemon is 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.450
 unbeatable so I judge it at least so 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.040
 who can see that this is an embargo 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.110
 perfect has 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.610
 with movement for doubles that comes from 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.930
 light that is black gap that sleeps 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.209
 both of the opposing team 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.849
 that is, if it is almost impossible to get 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.519
 at least as I mentioned you have a dark 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.599
 ride level 66 that knows black gap and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.390
 then to show it to you is a 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.159
 very very long procedure because no 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.129
 you can enter combat with a give but 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.799
 since the Wi-Fi combats and all that does not 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.400
 they apply so it's very very difficult 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.170
 show it to him 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.329
 but well anyway, here I have it 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.040
 pokemon that we are raffling and like 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.230

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.230
 have to like this video 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.439

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.080
 let's get to 150 light we're just going to 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.640
