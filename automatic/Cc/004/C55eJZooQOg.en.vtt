and there's three clamps holding this
thing<00:01:02.609> down<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.239> actually<00:01:03.600> enough<00:01:03.780> for

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
thing down to this actually enough for

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.440 
thing down to this actually enough for
curls<00:01:04.320> cranking<00:01:04.890> Steinman's<00:01:05.339> past<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
curls cranking Steinman's past and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.140 
curls cranking Steinman's past and
really<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:07.040> flip<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.070> off<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.640> table<00:01:08.790> which

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
really up flip it off the table which

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:21.140 
really up flip it off the table which
we're<00:01:09.360> using

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:33.740 

they<00:01:22.150> fall<00:01:22.780> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.540 

that's<00:01:34.560> handling<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.010> rough

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
that's handling the rough

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.530 
that's handling the rough
latias<00:01:37.480> are<00:01:37.630> then<00:01:37.750> doing<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:38.050> by<00:01:38.110> hand<00:01:39.540> alright

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
latias are then doing it by hand alright

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.510 
latias are then doing it by hand alright
so<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:40.780> is<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:40.960> result<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.680> our<00:01:42.190> first

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
so this is the result of our first

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.380 
so this is the result of our first
run-through<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.150> Frankenstein<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:46.240> is

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
run-through the Frankenstein and this is

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.030 
run-through the Frankenstein and this is
actually<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.780> really<00:01:47.110> good<00:01:47.500> beam<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.860> win<00:01:48.010> oh

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
actually a really good beam to win oh

actually a really good beam to win oh
it's<00:01:48.280> got<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:48.430> pretty<00:01:48.640> thin<00:01:48.970> shell<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.840> comes

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
it's got a pretty thin shell that comes

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.630 
it's got a pretty thin shell that comes
right<00:01:50.290> off<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.620> almost<00:01:50.740> looks<00:01:51.160> like<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.520> know

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
right off and almost looks like you know

right off and almost looks like you know
you<00:01:51.850> can<00:01:52.000> see<00:01:52.230> this<00:01:53.230> big<00:01:54.510> piles<00:01:55.510> of<00:01:55.690> nibs<00:01:55.990> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you can see this big piles of nibs and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.830 
you can see this big piles of nibs and
actually<00:01:57.460> kind<00:01:57.610> of<00:01:57.640> nice<00:01:57.910> big<00:01:58.330> chunks<00:01:58.720> of

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
actually kind of nice big chunks of

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.310 
actually kind of nice big chunks of
loose<00:02:00.330> husk<00:02:01.330> here<00:02:01.600> which<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:01.930> nice<00:02:02.080> because

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
loose husk here which is nice because

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.320 
loose husk here which is nice because
the<00:02:02.800> more<00:02:03.010> pieces<00:02:03.430> that<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.850> gets<00:02:04.060> cracked

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
the more pieces that it gets cracked

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.090 
the more pieces that it gets cracked
into<00:02:04.660> generally<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.230> more<00:02:05.350> dots<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:05.920> like

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
into generally the more dots so you like

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.280 
into generally the more dots so you like
to<00:02:06.220> see<00:02:06.370> these<00:02:06.550> kind<00:02:06.760> of<00:02:06.790> nice<00:02:07.060> large<00:02:07.300> pieces

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.870 

alright<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:11.560> next<00:02:12.130> step<00:02:12.400> would<00:02:12.520> be<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.670> run

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
alright so next step would be to run

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.760 
alright so next step would be to run
this<00:02:12.970> through<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> sieve<00:02:13.600> through<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> screen

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
this through a sieve through a screen

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.340 
this through a sieve through a screen
system<00:02:14.980> that<00:02:15.400> we<00:02:15.580> have<00:02:15.840> almost<00:02:16.840> set<00:02:17.020> up<00:02:17.140> over

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
system that we have almost set up over

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.240 
system that we have almost set up over
here<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.420> actually<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:20.010> quarter<00:02:21.010> inch

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
here this is actually a quarter inch

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.340 
here this is actually a quarter inch
screen<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:24.210> well<00:02:25.210> this<00:02:25.300> is<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.720> aluminum

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
screen and well this is this is aluminum

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.610 
screen and well this is this is aluminum
windows<00:02:27.100> screen<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.670> that's<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.780> eighth<00:02:29.290> inch

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
windows screen and that's a eighth inch

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:40.160 
windows screen and that's a eighth inch
base<00:02:30.520> achill<00:02:30.700> II<00:02:30.730> what<00:02:30.910> what<00:02:31.120> Orchard<00:02:31.450> had

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.500

let's<00:02:45.510> take<00:02:45.719> a<00:02:45.750> look<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.109> what<00:02:46.500> we<00:02:46.590> got<00:02:46.739> down

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
let's take a look at what we got down

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.559 
let's take a look at what we got down
here<00:02:48.650> well<00:02:49.650> know<00:02:49.829> much<00:02:50.640> much<00:02:50.909> better<00:02:51.090> huh<00:02:51.359> oh

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
here well know much much better huh oh

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.160 
here well know much much better huh oh
yeah

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
yeah

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.830 
yeah
the<00:02:52.409> ratio<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.069> going<00:02:53.189> down<00:02:53.430> from<00:02:53.670> well<00:02:54.599> what

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
the ratio is going down from well what

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.770 
the ratio is going down from well what
was<00:02:54.959> like<00:02:55.140> maybe<00:02:55.260> 10%<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.010> before<00:02:56.129> oh<00:02:56.549> yeah

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
was like maybe 10% in it before oh yeah

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.599 
was like maybe 10% in it before oh yeah
too<00:02:58.140> much<00:02:58.379> better<00:02:58.590> here<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.370> ones<00:02:59.549> that

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
too much better here and the ones that

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.129 
too much better here and the ones that
are<00:02:59.760> actually<00:03:00.000> going<00:03:00.120> through<00:03:00.239> or<00:03:00.599> not<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
are actually going through or not the

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.509 
are actually going through or not the
fault<00:03:01.349> of<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.469> winnower<00:03:01.709> they're<00:03:02.129> probably

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
fault of the winnower they're probably

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.339 
fault of the winnower they're probably
more<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.849> cracker<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.420> didn't<00:03:03.599> separate

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
more the cracker that didn't separate

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.080 
more the cracker that didn't separate
the<00:03:04.500> shell<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:04.980> nib<00:03:05.129> in<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> first<00:03:05.549> place

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the shell in the nib in the first place

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.119 
the shell in the nib in the first place
we<00:03:06.719> kind<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.079> whole<00:03:07.290> beans<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.889> are<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
we kind of have whole beans that are the

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.589 
we kind of have whole beans that are the
ones<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.370> are<00:03:08.459> getting<00:03:08.549> through<00:03:08.909> so<00:03:09.450> that's

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
ones that are getting through so that's

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.879 
ones that are getting through so that's
a<00:03:09.659> great<00:03:09.840> sign<00:03:10.049> all<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.349> have<00:03:10.439> to<00:03:10.530> do<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.709> run

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
a great sign all we have to do is run

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.860 
a great sign all we have to do is run
this<00:03:11.010> through<00:03:11.250> twice<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.659> setting

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
this through twice and this setting

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.059 
this through twice and this setting
should<00:03:13.079> be<00:03:13.170> perfect<00:03:13.530> for<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.739> first<00:03:13.920> level

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
should be perfect for the first level

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.979 
should be perfect for the first level
screen<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.299> happens<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.689> be<00:03:15.719> all<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
screen and that happens to be all the

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.379 
screen and that happens to be all the
way<00:03:16.079> closed<00:03:16.379> on<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.400> spell<00:03:17.639> which<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:18.000> one<00:03:18.359> a

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
way closed on the spell which is one a

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.940 
way closed on the spell which is one a
1/2<00:03:19.319> inch<00:03:19.530> actually<00:03:19.980> bolillo<00:03:21.560> we<00:03:22.560> did<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.829> to

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
1/2 inch actually bolillo we did have to

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.920 
1/2 inch actually bolillo we did have to
make<00:03:23.069> one<00:03:23.280> little<00:03:23.519> change<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.299> intake<00:03:24.629> to<00:03:24.810> get

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
make one little change the intake to get

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.589 
make one little change the intake to get
a<00:03:24.959> bit<00:03:25.109> more<00:03:25.200> suction<00:03:25.639> it's<00:03:26.639> got<00:03:26.849> this<00:03:27.000> big

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
a bit more suction it's got this big

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.089 
a bit more suction it's got this big
three<00:03:27.900> inch<00:03:28.049> opening<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.709> it's<00:03:28.950> been

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
three inch opening and it's been

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.369 
three inch opening and it's been
duct-taped<00:03:29.310> almost<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.359> nice<00:03:31.200> about

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
duct-taped almost a nice about

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.890 
duct-taped almost a nice about
three-fifths<00:03:31.859> closed<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:33.269> actually<00:03:33.750> made<00:03:33.870> a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
three-fifths closed that actually made a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.179 
three-fifths closed that actually made a
huge<00:03:34.109> difference<00:03:34.230> there's<00:03:34.650> all<00:03:34.769> doing<00:03:35.010> three

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:35.189 
huge difference there's all doing three

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.280 
huge difference there's all doing three
chords<00:03:35.669> right<00:03:36.329> further<00:03:36.719> for<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.019> for<00:03:37.200> that

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
chords right further for that for that

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.379 
chords right further for that for that
level<00:03:37.469> one<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:38.159> whole<00:03:38.400> was<00:03:38.639> just<00:03:38.819> too<00:03:39.150> too

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
level one that whole was just too too

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.089 
level one that whole was just too too
big<00:03:39.599> it<00:03:40.079> wasn't<00:03:40.319> enough<00:03:40.500> section<00:03:40.859> for<00:03:41.010> these

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
big it wasn't enough section for these

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.789 
big it wasn't enough section for these
big<00:03:41.549> chunks<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.169> a<00:03:43.200> two<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.680> half

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
big chunks this is a two and a half

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.879 
big chunks this is a two and a half
horsepower<00:03:44.159> shop<00:03:44.639> back<00:03:44.849> by<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.090> way<00:03:45.709> look<00:03:46.709> we

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
horsepower shop back by the way look we

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.530 
horsepower shop back by the way look we
had<00:03:46.980> really<00:03:47.280> good<00:03:47.430> results<00:03:47.909> here<00:03:48.299> with<00:03:48.449> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
had really good results here with the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.839 
had really good results here with the
nibs<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:49.560> had<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> good<00:03:49.829> ratio<00:03:50.040> probably<00:03:50.729> one

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
nibs we had a good ratio probably one

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:51.920 
nibs we had a good ratio probably one
more<00:03:50.879> pass<00:03:51.150> through<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.629> this<00:03:51.690> would<00:03:51.810> be

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
more pass through and this would be

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.500 
more pass through and this would be
completely<00:03:52.379> clean<00:03:52.849> now<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:53.940> other<00:03:54.449> big

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
completely clean now the other big

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.819 
completely clean now the other big
question<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:55.019> do<00:03:55.139> we<00:03:55.169> have<00:03:55.319> too<00:03:55.409> much<00:03:55.530> suction

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
question is do we have too much suction

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.309 
question is do we have too much suction
do<00:03:56.760> we<00:03:56.849> suck<00:03:57.120> through<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.449> whole<00:03:57.810> bunch<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.109> dip

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
do we suck through a whole bunch of dip

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.259 
do we suck through a whole bunch of dip
in<00:03:58.530> addition<00:03:58.889> to<00:03:58.949> shell<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.609> so<00:03:59.939> ideally

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
in addition to shell and so ideally

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.719 
in addition to shell and so ideally
we're<00:04:00.599> going<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.810> have<00:04:01.470> basically<00:04:01.919> shell<00:04:02.489> with

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
we're going to have basically shell with

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.949 
we're going to have basically shell with
just<00:04:02.939> maybe<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.299> few<00:04:03.840> smaller<00:04:04.109> pieces<00:04:04.379> of<00:04:04.680> Nibin

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
just maybe a few smaller pieces of Nibin

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.679 
just maybe a few smaller pieces of Nibin
all<00:04:06.959> right<00:04:07.340> as<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.939> can<00:04:09.060> see<00:04:09.209> that's<00:04:09.329> almost

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
all right as you can see that's almost

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.089 
all right as you can see that's almost
entirely<00:04:10.139> shell<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:12.720> this<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.079> very<00:04:13.530> efficient

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
entirely shell so this is very efficient

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.529 
entirely shell so this is very efficient
really<00:04:14.489> not<00:04:14.669> losing<00:04:15.090> anything<00:04:15.689> here<00:04:17.389> which<00:04:18.389> is

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
really not losing anything here which is

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.270 
really not losing anything here which is
great<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:19.049> know<00:04:19.199> compared<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.560> when<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.099> was

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
great you know compared to when I was

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.399 
great you know compared to when I was
doing<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.609> by<00:04:20.789> hand<00:04:20.840> I'd<00:04:21.840> probably<00:04:22.079> lose

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
doing this by hand I'd probably lose

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.460 
doing this by hand I'd probably lose
like<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.949> know<00:04:23.039> 5<00:04:23.370> or<00:04:23.550> 10%<00:04:23.699> nib<00:04:24.449> just<00:04:25.259> by

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
like you know 5 or 10% nib just by

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.620 
like you know 5 or 10% nib just by
blowing<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:26.009> out<00:04:26.099> with<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.400> shell<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:26.909> this<00:04:27.449> is

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
blowing it out with the shell so this is

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.820 
blowing it out with the shell so this is
a<00:04:27.659> great<00:04:27.870> improvement<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.560> think<00:04:28.740> the

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
a great improvement and I think the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.129 
a great improvement and I think the
screening<00:04:29.190> system<00:04:29.520> is<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.669> big<00:04:29.789> part<00:04:30.000> of<00:04:30.060> that

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
screening system is a big part of that

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.960 
screening system is a big part of that
we<00:04:31.139> are<00:04:31.259> now<00:04:31.409> feeding<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.949> second<00:04:32.370> level<00:04:32.759> of

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
we are now feeding the second level of

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.520 
we are now feeding the second level of
screen<00:04:33.720> through<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.280> nibs<00:04:35.520> here<00:04:35.970> are

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
screen through so the nibs here are

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.529 
screen through so the nibs here are
smaller<00:04:37.530> than<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.949> first<00:04:38.130> chunk<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:39.060> there's

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
smaller than the first chunk and there's

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.659 
smaller than the first chunk and there's
also<00:04:39.690> just<00:04:39.810> definitely<00:04:40.470> a<00:04:40.590> higher<00:04:40.800> ratio<00:04:41.039> of

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
also just definitely a higher ratio of

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.399 
also just definitely a higher ratio of
there's<00:04:42.330> more<00:04:42.479> nib<00:04:42.659> than<00:04:42.870> shell<00:04:43.139> in<00:04:43.289> this

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
there's more nib than shell in this

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.050 
there's more nib than shell in this
mixture<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.039> first<00:04:44.250> screen<00:04:44.490> was<00:04:44.729> a<00:04:44.759> lot<00:04:44.909> more

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
mixture the first screen was a lot more

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.170 
mixture the first screen was a lot more
shell<00:04:45.240> than<00:04:45.389> them<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:46.009> we<00:04:47.009> are<00:04:47.060> trying<00:04:48.060> to

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
shell than them and we are trying to

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.480 
shell than them and we are trying to
generate<00:04:48.240> enough<00:04:48.930> suction<00:04:49.139> here<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.740> we<00:04:50.130> are

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
generate enough suction here that we are

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.129 
generate enough suction here that we are
going

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
going

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.839 
going
to<00:04:51.349> finally<00:04:51.740> get<00:04:51.889> some<00:04:51.919> nip<00:04:52.280> coming<00:04:52.610> through

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
to finally get some nip coming through

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:54.149 
to finally get some nip coming through
that<00:04:52.879> way<00:04:53.210> we'll<00:04:53.360> know<00:04:53.509> that<00:04:53.539> we're<00:04:53.870> at<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
that way we'll know that we're at the

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:56.860 
that way we'll know that we're at the
upper<00:04:55.159> level<00:04:55.669> of<00:04:55.849> you<00:04:56.449> know<00:04:56.539> we've<00:04:56.719> actually

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
upper level of you know we've actually

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.689 
upper level of you know we've actually
overshot<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.710> we<00:04:57.830> can<00:04:57.949> start<00:04:58.189> kind<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.400> moving

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
overshot it we can start kind of moving

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.129 
overshot it we can start kind of moving
down<00:04:58.849> right<00:04:59.449> and<00:04:59.689> so<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.900> way<00:04:59.990> we've<00:05:00.110> done

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
down right and so the way we've done

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.110 
down right and so the way we've done
that<00:05:00.409> is<00:05:00.469> by<00:05:00.680> modifying<00:05:01.189> the<00:05:01.340> apparatus<00:05:01.699> we've

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
that is by modifying the apparatus we've

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.899 
that is by modifying the apparatus we've
added<00:05:02.509> more<00:05:02.840> tape<00:05:03.169> over<00:05:03.830> here<00:05:04.279> so<00:05:04.879> that

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
added more tape over here so that

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.059 
added more tape over here so that
basically<00:05:05.629> just<00:05:05.749> the<00:05:06.139> funnel<00:05:06.499> fits<00:05:06.740> through

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069 
basically just the funnel fits through

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.739 
basically just the funnel fits through
and<00:05:07.279> now<00:05:07.430> we<00:05:07.490> won't<00:05:07.849> we<00:05:08.060> wanted<00:05:08.330> to<00:05:08.419> do<00:05:08.509> is<00:05:08.659> we

00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:08.749 
and now we won't we wanted to do is we

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:12.010 
and now we won't we wanted to do is we
we<00:05:09.259> totally<00:05:09.650> closed<00:05:10.009> off<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.879> the<00:05:11.330> valve<00:05:11.629> here

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
we totally closed off the the valve here

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.959 
we totally closed off the the valve here
and<00:05:12.199> at<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.979> point<00:05:13.189> it<00:05:13.370> actually<00:05:13.550> started

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:13.969 
and at that point it actually started

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.760 
and at that point it actually started
sucking<00:05:14.240> nib<00:05:14.569> into<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:14.960> shop<00:05:15.199> back<00:05:15.439> so<00:05:15.620> now

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
sucking nib into the shop back so now

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.909 
sucking nib into the shop back so now
we've<00:05:15.979> opened<00:05:16.159> it<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.729> about<00:05:16.999> half<00:05:17.330> and

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
we've opened it to about half and

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.959 
we've opened it to about half and
hopefully<00:05:18.919> we'll<00:05:19.069> start<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.610> know<00:05:19.699> running

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:19.969 
hopefully we'll start you know running

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.469 
hopefully we'll start you know running
pretty<00:05:20.120> well<00:05:20.409> this<00:05:21.409> is<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:22.310> results<00:05:22.819> how<00:05:23.330> they

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
pretty well this is the results how they

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:23.920 
pretty well this is the results how they
look

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
look

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.850 
look
looks<00:05:24.560> fantastic<00:05:24.800> this<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.699> really<00:05:26.150> clean<00:05:26.860> it

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
looks fantastic this is really clean it

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.260 
looks fantastic this is really clean it
looks<00:05:28.009> like<00:05:28.189> the<00:05:28.370> only<00:05:28.490> bits<00:05:28.789> of<00:05:28.909> shell<00:05:29.060> we're

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
looks like the only bits of shell we're

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.909 
looks like the only bits of shell we're
getting<00:05:29.479> through<00:05:29.689> here<00:05:29.930> are<00:05:30.139> pieces<00:05:30.889> that

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
getting through here are pieces that

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.909 
getting through here are pieces that
were<00:05:31.129> already<00:05:31.310> attached<00:05:31.759> to<00:05:32.150> beam<00:05:32.650> this<00:05:33.650> this

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
were already attached to beam this this

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.879 
were already attached to beam this this
is<00:05:34.039> great<00:05:34.189> this<00:05:34.460> is<00:05:34.870> you<00:05:35.870> know<00:05:35.960> probably<00:05:36.349> about

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
is great this is you know probably about

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.159 
is great this is you know probably about
is<00:05:37.069> as<00:05:37.400> good<00:05:37.909> qualities<00:05:38.659> we<00:05:38.840> could<00:05:38.960> hope<00:05:39.139> for

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
is as good qualities we could hope for

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.279 
is as good qualities we could hope for
from<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.949> machine<00:05:40.430> like<00:05:40.580> this<00:05:40.639> and<00:05:41.289> it's

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
from a machine like this and it's

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.769 
from a machine like this and it's
certainly<00:05:42.620> well<00:05:42.860> below<00:05:43.009> the<00:05:43.279> one<00:05:43.460> percent<00:05:43.939> by

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
certainly well below the one percent by

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.019 
certainly well below the one percent by
weight<00:05:44.810> nib<00:05:45.349> permissible<00:05:46.189> by<00:05:46.279> law<00:05:46.460> so<00:05:46.759> this<00:05:46.879> is

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:47.029 
weight nib permissible by law so this is

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.170 
weight nib permissible by law so this is
a<00:05:47.060> going<00:05:47.449> to<00:05:47.509> be<00:05:47.599> fantastic

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
a going to be fantastic

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.700 
a going to be fantastic
what<00:05:50.180> do<00:05:50.240> you<00:05:50.300> got<00:05:50.419> there<00:05:50.599> Mike<00:05:51.080> alright<00:05:51.560> well

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
what do you got there Mike alright well

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
this is the end result of our first I

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.899 
this is the end result of our first I
guess<00:05:55.669> run<00:05:55.969> of<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:57.800> win<00:05:57.979> over<00:05:58.009> here<00:05:58.490> the

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
guess run of the the win over here the

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.309 
guess run of the the win over here the
Coco<00:05:59.330> mojo<00:05:59.750> winnower

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 
Coco mojo winnower

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.800 
Coco mojo winnower
and<00:06:00.770> I'm<00:06:01.729> pretty<00:06:01.939> happy<00:06:02.180> with<00:06:02.360> it<00:06:02.539> this<00:06:02.750> is

and I'm pretty happy with it this is
definitely<00:06:03.370> you<00:06:04.370> know<00:06:04.520> mostly<00:06:04.909> did<00:06:05.979> yeah<00:06:06.979> the

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
definitely you know mostly did yeah the

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:08.740 
definitely you know mostly did yeah the
one<00:06:07.460> thing<00:06:07.699> that<00:06:07.909> we<00:06:08.029> might<00:06:08.180> want<00:06:08.389> to<00:06:08.419> work<00:06:08.479> on

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
one thing that we might want to work on

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.170 
one thing that we might want to work on
in<00:06:09.139> the<00:06:09.289> future<00:06:09.319> is<00:06:09.830> for<00:06:10.129> the<00:06:10.219> very<00:06:10.399> last<00:06:10.669> green

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
in the future is for the very last green

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.200 
in the future is for the very last green
we<00:06:11.419> said<00:06:11.659> the<00:06:12.069> airflow<00:06:13.069> here<00:06:13.430> to<00:06:13.669> just<00:06:14.029> about

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
we said the airflow here to just about

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.709 
we said the airflow here to just about
1/8<00:06:14.599> of<00:06:15.259> the<00:06:15.740> way<00:06:15.919> closed<00:06:16.279> it's<00:06:16.759> it's<00:06:17.089> mostly

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
1/8 of the way closed it's it's mostly

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.279 
1/8 of the way closed it's it's mostly
open<00:06:17.990> I'm<00:06:18.770> sorry<00:06:19.069> yeah<00:06:19.339> it's<00:06:19.550> mostly<00:06:19.819> open<00:06:20.289> and

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
open I'm sorry yeah it's mostly open and

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:22.719 
open I'm sorry yeah it's mostly open and
we're<00:06:21.500> still<00:06:21.740> getting<00:06:21.889> a<00:06:22.009> lot<00:06:22.069> of<00:06:22.129> drum<00:06:22.399> coming

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
we're still getting a lot of drum coming

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.159 
we're still getting a lot of drum coming
through<00:06:22.879> and<00:06:23.089> I<00:06:23.149> don't<00:06:23.210> know<00:06:23.419> separation<00:06:24.080> of

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
through and I don't know separation of

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.589 
through and I don't know separation of
germs<00:06:24.409> is<00:06:24.589> something<00:06:24.860> that<00:06:24.979> we<00:06:25.069> can<00:06:25.189> solve

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
germs is something that we can solve

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:28.540 
germs is something that we can solve
with<00:06:26.599> the<00:06:26.779> win<00:06:26.899> worth<00:06:27.110> that<00:06:27.439> might<00:06:27.620> be<00:06:27.830> either

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
with the win worth that might be either

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.529 
with the win worth that might be either
screen<00:06:29.270> pollution<00:06:29.839> or<00:06:31.149> perhaps<00:06:32.149> even<00:06:32.330> just

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
screen pollution or perhaps even just

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.240 
screen pollution or perhaps even just
dumping<00:06:32.930> out<00:06:33.080> everything<00:06:33.710> that's<00:06:33.830> that's

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
dumping out everything that's that's

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.909 
dumping out everything that's that's
part<00:06:34.580> of<00:06:34.610> this<00:06:34.729> last<00:06:35.029> screen<00:06:35.710> because<00:06:36.710> while

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
part of this last screen because while

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.290 
part of this last screen because while
there<00:06:37.099> was<00:06:37.250> a<00:06:37.279> fair<00:06:37.520> amount<00:06:37.610> of<00:06:37.789> Nan<00:06:38.029> there<00:06:38.210> was

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
there was a fair amount of Nan there was

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.899 
there was a fair amount of Nan there was
also<00:06:38.449> the<00:06:39.379> high<00:06:39.469> percentage<00:06:39.860> of<00:06:39.949> turn<00:06:40.159> what<00:06:40.819> do

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
also the high percentage of turn what do

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.260 
also the high percentage of turn what do
you<00:06:40.969> think<00:06:41.089> the<00:06:41.149> percentage<00:06:41.539> was<00:06:41.689> at<00:06:41.870> the<00:06:41.930> turn

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
you think the percentage was at the turn

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.510 
you think the percentage was at the turn
oh<00:06:43.550> maybe<00:06:44.550> 20%<00:06:45.480> is<00:06:46.200> that<00:06:46.620> about<00:06:47.160> right<00:06:47.280> any

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
oh maybe 20% is that about right any

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.370 
oh maybe 20% is that about right any
news<00:06:47.670> -<00:06:47.880> yeah<00:06:48.240> that<00:06:48.450> was<00:06:48.540> cool<00:06:48.660> a<00:06:48.750> little<00:06:48.900> I

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
news - yeah that was cool a little I

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.080 
news - yeah that was cool a little I
mean<00:06:49.500> a<00:06:49.680> lot<00:06:49.830> we<00:06:50.010> didn't<00:06:50.220> see<00:06:50.340> any<00:06:50.520> Jamboree<00:06:50.940> in

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
mean a lot we didn't see any Jamboree in

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.990 
mean a lot we didn't see any Jamboree in
the<00:06:51.450> other<00:06:51.600> levels<00:06:52.020> yeah<00:06:52.620> which<00:06:53.610> we<00:06:53.760> wouldn't

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
the other levels yeah which we wouldn't

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.500 
the other levels yeah which we wouldn't
expect<00:06:55.160> you<00:06:56.160> know<00:06:56.280> so<00:06:56.550> I'm<00:06:57.150> having<00:06:57.390> me

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
expect you know so I'm having me

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.860 
expect you know so I'm having me
chocolate<00:06:57.990> with<00:06:58.200> German<00:06:58.710> it<00:06:58.800> before<00:06:59.160> it's<00:06:59.550> not

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
chocolate with German it before it's not

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.650 
chocolate with German it before it's not
is<00:07:00.870> make<00:07:01.140> a<00:07:01.170> huge<00:07:01.410> difference<00:07:02.090> but<00:07:03.090> if<00:07:03.390> it's

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
is make a huge difference but if it's

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.480 
is make a huge difference but if it's
something<00:07:04.140> that<00:07:04.230> we<00:07:04.320> can<00:07:04.440> avoid<00:07:04.710> or<00:07:04.950> get<00:07:05.310> some

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
something that we can avoid or get some

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.260 
something that we can avoid or get some
out<00:07:05.670> of<00:07:05.700> you<00:07:06.240> know<00:07:06.360> that<00:07:06.840> would<00:07:07.440> be<00:07:07.530> fine<00:07:08.270> but

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
out of you know that would be fine but

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.240 
out of you know that would be fine but
overall<00:07:09.540> this<00:07:09.780> is<00:07:09.930> this<00:07:10.170> is<00:07:10.350> great<00:07:10.590> and<00:07:11.190> this

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
overall this is this is great and this

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.950 
overall this is this is great and this
actually<00:07:11.970> took<00:07:12.090> us<00:07:12.240> a<00:07:12.270> fair<00:07:12.480> amount<00:07:12.720> of<00:07:12.780> time

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
actually took us a fair amount of time

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.170 
actually took us a fair amount of time
to<00:07:13.200> go<00:07:13.290> through<00:07:13.350> this<00:07:13.590> process<00:07:13.830> I<00:07:14.370> think<00:07:15.000> the

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 
to go through this process I think the

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.670 
to go through this process I think the
biggest<00:07:15.600> things<00:07:15.930> are<00:07:16.140> that<00:07:16.410> are<00:07:16.500> going<00:07:16.590> to

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
biggest things are that are going to

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.200 
biggest things are that are going to
speed<00:07:16.860> this<00:07:16.980> up<00:07:17.130> are<00:07:17.340> coming<00:07:17.640> up<00:07:17.820> with<00:07:17.940> a<00:07:18.000> box

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
speed this up are coming up with a box

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.290 
speed this up are coming up with a box
for<00:07:19.020> doing<00:07:19.260> the<00:07:19.350> screening<00:07:19.760> if<00:07:20.760> we<00:07:20.940> can<00:07:21.090> come

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
for doing the screening if we can come

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.880 
for doing the screening if we can come
up<00:07:21.330> with<00:07:21.450> a<00:07:21.570> faster<00:07:21.990> way<00:07:22.080> to<00:07:22.140> separate<00:07:22.530> out<00:07:22.740> of

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:22.890 
up with a faster way to separate out of

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.590 
up with a faster way to separate out of
the<00:07:22.980> different<00:07:23.340> levels<00:07:23.790> that's<00:07:24.210> going<00:07:24.420> to<00:07:24.510> be

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.600 
the different levels that's going to be

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.410 
the different levels that's going to be
huge<00:07:24.920> and<00:07:25.920> now<00:07:26.100> that<00:07:26.250> we<00:07:26.340> know<00:07:26.490> each<00:07:26.820> setting

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420 
huge and now that we know each setting

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.900 
huge and now that we know each setting
on<00:07:27.660> the<00:07:28.050> airflow<00:07:29.010> over<00:07:29.220> here<00:07:29.400> that<00:07:29.670> should<00:07:29.850> be

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910 
on the airflow over here that should be

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.350 
on the airflow over here that should be
pretty<00:07:30.060> quick<00:07:30.300> -<00:07:32.150> Cheers

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 
pretty quick - Cheers

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.930 
pretty quick - Cheers
yeah
