00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Today we are going to complete the video of what to take on a bicycle trip with all 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.469
 your contributions, you will see that interesting. 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.740
 This video has actually been done by you, the only thing we have done is 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.019
 collect 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.109
 the best and most interesting comments that you have made in the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.400
 video about 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090
 what to take on a bicycle trip and now transmit it 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 to share it with all of you. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.449
 A follower tells us that he always carries a fat or thin valve adapter, 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.589
 what is this adapter so tiny that weighs little and is very cheap 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.220
 Why is it useful for us? Well, if we carry a thin valve 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.100
 and especially on the road 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.150
 because the wheel carries much more pressure 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.720
 unscrewing the obus and giving it a little bit because it is stuck we screw the 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.430
 adapter 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.240
 in the valve and so we can use 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.060
 any compressor of any gas station after a puncture in 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.120
 road with the high pressure that is carried on the road wheels 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.710
 or to recover some pressure 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.160
 it is very useful because we will inflate 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.490
 the wheel without problems in any gas station. There's others 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.130
 followers who tell us we have not said 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.239
 that you have to wear a helmet, 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.500
 some glasses, 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.640
 or some gloves 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.750
 and of course we take it for obvious but it is not necessary to say it 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.570
 the ground is just as hard if we are going to buy the bread 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.190
 as if we make a route of 100 kilometers and wear a helmet that has the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.690
 Appropriate homologations if you look inside always if the helmet is 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.470
 quality 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.280
 will have the sticker of the corresponding approval and thus we will make sure 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.940
 that does not protect when we have a fall, 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.150
 depending on the quality of the helmet we will also have more ventilation or not 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.110
 and some glasses are not only for the wind 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.930
 and for mosquitoes they should also protect us 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.000
 the retina of harmful radiation 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.100
 and that's also in the quality of the lens 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.420
 and as 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.090
 gloves that are not only for the cold but to protect our hands in a 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.780
 fall and also to give us comfort riding but 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.260
 in a fall but 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.740
 the skin of the palm would suffer a lot 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.500
 if we do not wear a glove 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.180
 you can check all the videos we have about helmets 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.550
 glasses and gloves 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.349
 They will also give you information about these products, another follower 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.779
 David, he tells us he always wears these plastic gloves that are usually 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:12.539
 use 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.889
 at gas stations they do not weigh and do not occupy 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:15.840
 Y 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.189
 we did not finish filling our hands with fat 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.899
 neither the gloves, nor then stain the fists and we have a breakdown with the chain 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:25.299
 or with the change so 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.330
 It's another interesting little thing. 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.760
 David and Serafin coincide in the following comment and I read you textually the one of 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.160
 one of them because this is probably the most important of all, says one of 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.889
 They, hello friends, I'm a policeman 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.609
 tell you that modern phones always have locking systems 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.389
 making impossible 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.079
 see a contact in the calendar to notify any family member 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.559
 the DNI is very good to take it but 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:53.039
 attendance becomes very slow because you have to go to your home 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.179
 Our telephone number is registered in our database 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:57.509
 hilly 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:00.999
 It would also be important to know allergies and blood group in case of 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.849
 healthcare 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.479
 carry a simple paper 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.789
 or similar in the pocket or in the seat bag with a telephone number for 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:09.259
 advise and this data 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:11.909
 makes it much easier for us to help you 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.459
 so keep that in mind because it costs nothing 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.629
 and it's very interesting From Uruguay you also tell us to bring insect repellent 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.829
 in some areas it is worth more than a gold ingot, 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.529
 good in Spain is not usually very necessary but, 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.229
 in areas of South America should really be interesting. Several of you also 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.750
 you have advised to take some money 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.729
 forever 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.699
 and a small lubricant boat 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.919
 esquier de 15 milliliters but it can help us a lot in routes of several 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.849
 days or on a long routes with lots of mud 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.619
 or that partner who has always forgotten to lubricate the chain 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:46.230
 always carrying it with us 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.479
 It will be very useful, 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.769
 small things like the adapter that I taught you before, the money or the oil 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.729
 I recommend that you always carry it 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.159
 in a saddle bag 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.219
 so you will never forget, the seat bag will always go with the bike and 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:00.119
 our 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.979
 little things always inside 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:05.639
 and so we will not forget anything. Another follower tells us that 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.490
 we have said 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.270
 lots of things to take on the bike but for us nothing and that if we 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.390
 we fall or cut ourselves we only have the bike patches for 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.389
 for our injuries so 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.129
 we are going to teach you this 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.430
 small first aid kit 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.920
 and survival kit, deuter first aid 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.980
 which is very small 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.379
 it weighs very little and occupies very little we can take it in the camelback perfectly 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.879
 and it comes very complete, it comes with gauze, 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.439
 with elastic gauze, 

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.300
 with latex gloves 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.279
 sterile 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.879
 with scissors, 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.330
 sticking plaster, 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.059
 strips, here below we can cut them as much as possible, 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:47.949
 a whistle in case we get lost and 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.309
 all 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:53.289
 very compact also of course I recommend that you bring a disinfectant 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.729
 for wounds this is betadine monodosis is very small 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.759
 and it does not weigh or occupy is also very interesting, and a little green trick is that 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.659
 another follower tells us that carrying a piece of loose camera is very 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.539
 useful if we split the cover, because 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.509
 with cracked cover 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.379
 what we do is take the piece of camera, 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.960
 put it between the swollen chamber inside 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.940
 and the cover and then this is going to prevent 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.500
 that the camera inside comes out through the crack of the cover and we can 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.379
 arrive 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.319
 home without problems 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.490
 so it does not hurt and it's interesting too. And to finish the best, 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.199
 that when I read it I kept laughing 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:36.520
 Roberto tells us 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.600
 I'm going to take my grandmother too 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.389
 that very light and I fit even in the camelback 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.719
 so that I go making fabes along the way 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.059
 thanks Roberto for your good humor 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:48.680
 and nothing else if you have found it useful 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.379
 give the "Like" and do not forget to share it 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.629
 with the whole cycling world so that everyone has this information, 

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.139
 Thank you very much for following us and until the next video.
