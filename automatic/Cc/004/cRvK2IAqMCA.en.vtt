point out patch it just came out

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.650 
point out patch it just came out
literally<00:00:07.799> maybe<00:00:08.580> five<00:00:08.880> minutes<00:00:09.210> ago<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.630> just

this<00:00:12.570> video<00:00:12.809> for<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> while<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.340> goes

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
this video for a while and here it goes

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.849 
this video for a while and here it goes
so<00:00:15.059> some<00:00:15.389> key<00:00:15.719> changes<00:00:16.170> they<00:00:16.320> may<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.710> is

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
so some key changes they may this is

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.189 
so some key changes they may this is
back<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.279> roads<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.640> traffic<00:00:17.880> from<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
back to roads and traffic from the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.019 
back to roads and traffic from the
original<00:00:20.070> how<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.730> was<00:00:20.820> set<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:22.260> uh

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
original how it was set up is how uh

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.080 
original how it was set up is how uh
which<00:00:24.029> streets<00:00:24.480> cause<00:00:24.869> stoplights<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.090> here's

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
which streets cause stoplights so here's

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.910 
which streets cause stoplights so here's
we're<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.539> their<00:00:28.170> high<00:00:28.410> density

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
we're going to do their high density

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.070 
we're going to do their high density
Avenue<00:00:29.519> drop<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> straight<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.869> here

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
Avenue drop it straight in here

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.889 
Avenue drop it straight in here
completely<00:00:31.500> worthless<00:00:31.890> part<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.660> this<00:00:33.660> larger

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
completely worthless part of this larger

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.310 
completely worthless part of this larger
city<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.860> we've<00:00:34.980> got<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> high<00:00:35.340> density<00:00:35.520> Avenue

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
city now we've got a high density Avenue

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.700 
city now we've got a high density Avenue
now<00:00:37.610> previously<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:39.180> bisect<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.989> with<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> high

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
now previously you bisect it with a high

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
now previously you bisect it with a high
density<00:00:40.890> street<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.670> would<00:00:41.910> toss<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> stops

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
density street it would toss it stops

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.799 
density street it would toss it stops
light<00:00:43.079> now<00:00:43.969> let's<00:00:44.969> show<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.690> can

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
light now let's show that just you can

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.830 
light now let's show that just you can
see<00:00:46.520> it's<00:00:47.520> good<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> bisect<00:00:48.390> straight<00:00:48.629> through

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
see it's good to bisect straight through

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.470 
see it's good to bisect straight through
stoplight<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.280> green<00:00:50.520> there's<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
stoplight you see it's green there's a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.369 
stoplight you see it's green there's a
stoplight<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:52.699> before<00:00:53.699> previously<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.629> medium

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
stoplight now before previously a medium

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.740 
stoplight now before previously a medium
density<00:00:55.559> street<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> stop<00:00:56.910> sign<00:00:57.180> but

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
density street was just to stop sign but

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.410 
density street was just to stop sign but
now<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.530> stoplight<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.370> talking<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
now it is a stoplight to talking to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.869 
now it is a stoplight to talking to
Max's<00:01:00.870> gullion<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.579> don't<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.730> how<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
Max's gullion I don't know how to

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.280 
Max's gullion I don't know how to
pronounce<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> last<00:01:03.449> time<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.719> apologize<00:01:04.110> for

pronounce the last time I apologize for
that<00:01:04.760> these<00:01:05.760> lights<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.479> better<00:01:06.990> timed<00:01:07.439> for

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that these lights are better timed for

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
that these lights are better timed for
the<00:01:09.080> through<00:01:10.080> traffic<00:01:10.290> meaning<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> higher

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the through traffic meaning the higher

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
the through traffic meaning the higher
the<00:01:11.610> traffic<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> higher<00:01:12.360> density<00:01:12.780> street

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the traffic on the higher density street

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.960 
the traffic on the higher density street
then<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.770> are<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> traffic<00:01:14.640> from<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
then they are for the traffic from the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.249 
then they are for the traffic from the
lower<00:01:15.180> density<00:01:15.600> street<00:01:15.810> I'm<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.080> just

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
lower density street I'm just just

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.230 
lower density street I'm just just
trying<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> Shogun<00:01:16.890> show<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> guys<00:01:17.340> my<00:01:17.580> next

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
trying the Shogun show you guys my next

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.340 
trying the Shogun show you guys my next
thing<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.049> show<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.259> guys<00:01:20.090> so

thing that I want to show you guys so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.480 
thing that I want to show you guys so
there<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.650> couple<00:01:23.250> things<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:25.250> shiza<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
there are a couple things in shiza I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.530 
there are a couple things in shiza I
really<00:01:26.820> screwed<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:28.070> but<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> blue

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
really screwed up there but a blue

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
really screwed up there but a blue
that's<00:01:30.540> high<00:01:30.720> density<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.259> their<00:01:31.530> bang<00:01:31.979> okay

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that's high density or their bang okay

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.719 
that's high density or their bang okay
so<00:01:34.040> oftentimes<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> really

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
so oftentimes when you have a really

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.539 
so oftentimes when you have a really
long<00:01:35.820> street<00:01:36.509> let's<00:01:36.750> say<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.619> right

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
long street let's say this one right

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.999 
long street let's say this one right
here<00:01:38.610> cars<00:01:39.600> cannot<00:01:40.049> turn<00:01:40.409> around<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.890> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
here cars cannot turn around on it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.770 
here cars cannot turn around on it
because<00:01:41.579> there's<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> median<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.540> middle

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
because there's a median in the middle

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.679 
because there's a median in the middle
they<00:01:43.259> can't<00:01:43.470> turn<00:01:43.619> around<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.430> say<00:01:44.970> somebody

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
they can't turn around so say somebody

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.910 
they can't turn around so say somebody
from<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.899> building<00:01:45.960> wants<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> hear

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
from this building wants to go to hear

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.980 
from this building wants to go to hear
you<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.850> way<00:01:47.880> up<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.450> around<00:01:48.780> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you just go all the way up and around to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.100 
you just go all the way up and around to
get<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.229> there<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:50.100> that's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> pain<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.110> couple

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
get to there now that's a pain a couple

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.950 
get to there now that's a pain a couple
ways<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.409> fix<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.479> some

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
ways to fix this one is that some

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.929 
ways to fix this one is that some
buildings<00:01:55.530> including<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.189> trash<00:01:56.460> building

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
buildings including the trash building

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.139 
buildings including the trash building
and<00:01:57.869> recycling<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.340> things<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
and recycling have a little things so

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.030 
and recycling have a little things so
that<00:02:00.240> people<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.570> turn<00:02:00.750> around<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that people can turn around but that's a

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.789 
that people can turn around but that's a
pain<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:02.369> you'd<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
pain because you'd have to have that and

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.230 
pain because you'd have to have that and
police<00:02:04.799> stations<00:02:04.920> things<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:06.090> not

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
police stations things like that do not

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
police stations things like that do not
have<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.659> now<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> found<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.740> way<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.009> make<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
have that now I found a way to make it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.740 
have that now I found a way to make it
yourself<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.179> there's<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> couple<00:02:09.509> different

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
yourself so there's a couple different

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.449 
yourself so there's a couple different
ways<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.319> do<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.440> let's<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.069> back<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
ways we can do this let's go back to a

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.770 
ways we can do this let's go back to a
big<00:02:11.670> street<00:02:12.030> where<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.270> can't<00:02:12.480> turn<00:02:12.660> around

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
big street where you can't turn around

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.309 
big street where you can't turn around
the<00:02:13.020> middle

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the middle

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.360 
the middle
but<00:02:14.120> we're<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.299> go<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.780> road<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.370> it's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
but we're going to go for road and it's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.610 
but we're going to go for road and it's
a<00:02:17.430> few<00:02:17.609> different<00:02:17.849> ways<00:02:17.939> you<00:02:17.999> can<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.299> that<00:02:18.329> on

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
a few different ways you can do that on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.399 
a few different ways you can do that on
the<00:02:19.620> main<00:02:19.859> way<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> low-density<00:02:20.969> wrote<00:02:21.659> you

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
the main way is a low-density wrote you

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.199 
the main way is a low-density wrote you
barely<00:02:22.769> see<00:02:23.189> it's<00:02:23.310> barely<00:02:23.639> over<00:02:23.939> the<00:02:24.090> edge

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
barely see it's barely over the edge

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.229 
barely see it's barely over the edge
it's<00:02:24.689> like<00:02:24.840> one<00:02:25.109> spot<00:02:25.469> and<00:02:25.709> then<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.969> thing

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
it's like one spot and then this thing

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.879 
it's like one spot and then this thing
right<00:02:27.420> here<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.810> all<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.409> need<00:02:28.439> so<00:02:28.769> they<00:02:28.799> can

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
right here is all you need so they can

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.770 
right here is all you need so they can
turn<00:02:29.129> around<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.819> only<00:02:29.969> need<00:02:30.120> on<00:02:30.269> one<00:02:30.480> side<00:02:30.719> of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
turn around you only need on one side of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.170 
turn around you only need on one side of
the<00:02:30.870> road<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.170> now<00:02:31.920> with<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.579> people<00:02:33.060> can

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
the road and now with this people can

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.020 
the road and now with this people can
successfully<00:02:34.040> turn<00:02:35.040> themselves<00:02:35.310> around<00:02:35.609> I

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
successfully turn themselves around I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.300 
successfully turn themselves around I
think<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.900> also<00:02:37.079> do<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.409> a<00:02:37.500> walk<00:02:37.709> path<00:02:37.980> not

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
think you also do with a walk path not

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.330 
think you also do with a walk path not
one<00:02:38.430> hundred<00:02:38.519> percent<00:02:38.700> sure<00:02:39.590> yeah<00:02:40.590> c<00:02:41.040> walk

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
one hundred percent sure yeah c walk

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.059 
one hundred percent sure yeah c walk
pass<00:02:41.609> are<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.030> exact<00:02:42.359> same<00:02:42.450> thing<00:02:42.870> now<00:02:43.590> cars

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
pass are the exact same thing now cars

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.690 
pass are the exact same thing now cars
can<00:02:44.310> turn<00:02:44.489> around<00:02:44.609> up<00:02:44.879> both<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.389> these<00:02:45.540> places

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
can turn around up both of these places

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.699 
can turn around up both of these places
helps<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.790> ton<00:02:47.819> for<00:02:48.389> years<00:02:48.599> through<00:02:48.780> traffic<00:02:48.989> so

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
helps a ton for years through traffic so
