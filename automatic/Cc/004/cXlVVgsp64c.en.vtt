leader<00:01:06.580> you<00:01:07.510> didn't<00:01:07.780> surge<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.230> in<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.640> holes

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
leader you didn't surge it in the holes

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.929 
leader you didn't surge it in the holes
and<00:01:11.409> you<00:01:11.530> check<00:01:11.770> your<00:01:11.799> readings<00:01:12.430> which<00:01:12.729> we

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
and you check your readings which we

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.609 
and you check your readings which we
read<00:01:13.229> 120<00:01:14.229> volts<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:16.509> on<00:01:16.840> both<00:01:17.049> sides<00:01:17.350> your

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
read 120 volts that's on both sides your

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.149 
read 120 volts that's on both sides your
AC<00:01:17.829> power<00:01:18.780> okay<00:01:19.780> then<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.170> take<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.619> out<00:01:20.860> to

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
AC power okay then you take it out to

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.639 
AC power okay then you take it out to
check<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.670> make<00:01:21.700> sure<00:01:22.049> power<00:01:23.049> on<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.470> right

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
check to make sure power on the right

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.830 
check to make sure power on the right
side<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.100> your<00:01:24.159> outlet<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:25.270> stick<00:01:25.600> that<00:01:25.780> in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
side of your outlet you stick that in

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.840 
side of your outlet you stick that in
there<00:01:26.110> because<00:01:26.470> that's<00:01:26.590> supposed<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:27.520> be<00:01:27.579> your

ground you check in a small hole and
you're<00:01:31.149> going<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.299> read<00:01:31.509> 120<00:01:32.259> volts<00:01:32.619> that's

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
you're going to read 120 volts that's

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.719 
you're going to read 120 volts that's
that's<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.329> hole<00:01:34.509> with<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.020> power<00:01:35.579> stick<00:01:36.579> it

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
that's the hole with the power stick it

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.030 
that's the hole with the power stick it
in<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.329> large<00:01:37.600> hole<00:01:37.869> you're<00:01:38.680> going<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.860> read

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
in the large hole you're going to read

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.670 
in the large hole you're going to read
no<00:01:39.250> bolts

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
no bolts

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.670

okay<00:01:41.680> now<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.369> check<00:01:42.729> for<00:01:43.030> your<00:01:43.689> ground<00:01:44.110> on

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
okay now to check for your ground on

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.249 
okay now to check for your ground on
your<00:01:45.520> toilet<00:01:45.790> you'll<00:01:46.329> have<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.689> side<00:01:46.930> screw

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
your toilet you'll have that side screw

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.529 
your toilet you'll have that side screw
or<00:01:47.409> any<00:01:47.649> metal<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.490> could<00:01:48.759> get<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.360> on

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
or any metal that you could get to on

the outlet you take ground the ground

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.969 
the outlet you take ground the ground
should<00:01:54.549> be<00:01:54.759> zero<00:01:55.060> volts<00:01:55.539> which<00:01:56.229> is<00:01:56.259> point<00:01:56.710> zero

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
should be zero volts which is point zero

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.969 
should be zero volts which is point zero
zero<00:01:57.039> one<00:01:57.570> your<00:01:58.570> ground<00:01:58.930> side<00:01:59.259> of<00:01:59.439> your<00:01:59.560> outlet

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
zero one your ground side of your outlet

of your AC outlet zero volts in the
power<00:02:04.659> side<00:02:06.930> read<00:02:07.930> 120<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.539> by<00:02:10.660> checking<00:02:10.960> this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
power side read 120 so by checking this

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.390 
power side read 120 so by checking this
you<00:02:11.860> know<00:02:12.040> your<00:02:12.430> case<00:02:12.850> ground<00:02:13.240> is<00:02:13.480> good<00:02:14.400> if
