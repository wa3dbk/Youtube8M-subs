00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.930
 teach then some tricks of the counter 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.509
 they are worth that I am going to leave them in the 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.540
 description all the tricks and for what 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:16.750
 they serve and the tricks only serve when 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.390
 you play alone or with a friend of the 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.529
 same connection of it same 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.720
 internet then some tricks that the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.689
 let's see now they are worth 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.739
 ok I'll create for example this map or 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.970
 to ski look if you throw me you will see 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.750
 I fall directly 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.990
 Hello 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.100
 and now you will see what happens when I activate 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.820
 the hook 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.820
 OK 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:53.890
 alright let's go to the escape key and 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.890
 here we are going to give that v 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.270
 bar down as management love 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.829
 Yes one 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.490
 OK 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.369
 this and we give you send and now 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.090
 we can put the tube that we want I will 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.829
 prove it 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.829
 acceleration 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.520
 so that they accelerate the air and I do not fall 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.509
 I will send 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.750
 and now it is assumed that it is already activated 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.520
 look now what happens is that now 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.520
 I can fly here 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.010
 and now let's try another trick by 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:49.100
 example 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.100
 the one of a good order or clip 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.800
 this ere we are invincible we fly and 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.840
 everything and they never kill us 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.500
 I think that in order not to kill we have to 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.500
 put the butt 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.280
 and you see 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.130
 we never die, and this is all 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.110
