 his sign of the site he appreciates the name he approves 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.279

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.060
 just rezÃ© 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.170
 I am digging the golden rule 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.750
 we have a certain exchange rate can cumulate all these stuff what 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.830
 seemed in the lava 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.350
 another to fall into the water and so 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.900

 not enough thanks to the influx of chelsea 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.970
 he will be beaten who is so I start 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.970
 this part

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.880

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.400
 the third 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.400

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.180
 comments 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430
 some difficulties to go out 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.550
 here 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.700
 in places 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.880
 installed since yesterday 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 we are not going 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 I'm sure it's up to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.740
 m 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.740
 here 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.399
 why then to jump on several variants for example 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.720
 if not more than two you can very well put the most holes and 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.939
 what is one pillar of the road for Rome to make the suspense last 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:04.760
 paroxysm 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.820
 or have not been able to touch especially directories are economic and 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.820
 financial available 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.959
 m the balls 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.689
 these are for the first time 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.389
 2 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.589
 the manual chair 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.779
 what is boring dancing mini-journal his accomplices all the objects 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.379
 but it's a northern discourse 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.739
 conrad 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.079
 I have him room and the chance of more 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.479
 more incredible of all 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.689
 the only way that there would be a work force 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.689
 here 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:25.270
 the sentence 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.519
 and you 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.519
 we want 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.449
 10 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.669
 brown 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.089
 the hong kong stock market 3 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.089
 he participates 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.889
 as long as you can not see 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.109
 it's a game that has just been developed can be tweaked 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.250
 can be improved 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.010
 they will surely be able to others of this mini-game that will be changed it will have 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.010
 maybe the moment if I want to shoot but it's not bad but he's lying 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.569
 I like 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:11.059
 of course only I the six pairs that you liked this guide inspires you not sure 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.949
 there will be other variations of this game 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.090
 only wish it social centers are even almost every 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.659
 communities 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.249
 this country a very good day
