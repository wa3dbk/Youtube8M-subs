00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 this decade will surely be remembered 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.390
 like that of comic book adaptations to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.490
 cinema and the process comes pretty well 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.800
 however over the years 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.259
 there were the odd one that went to the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.540
 banquina and that's why this is the drive file 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.420
 from comics transformed into movies 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.960
 without first reading the comics put number 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.939
 5 the mask while the mask was 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 a success at the time for the only thing that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.289
 stands out is by painting the face of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.910
 true jim carrey 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.009
 while in the movie the character is 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.989
 a kind of pax band and in the comic the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.480
 user of the mask is transformed into 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.520
 a homicidal maniac the same as us 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.620
 it happens to us that today we see the movie 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.239
 that without it is called the penguins of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.350
 dad put number 4 see games tantín 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.350
 starting from the base that the true 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.899
 konstantín was based on steam choose 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.570
 to qian or as a protagonist is to urinate 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.610
 out of the jar however that was not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.520
 the only one dressed since the real 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.770
 Konstantin is a zero year chanta 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 point of being almost Argentine however 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.510
 in this movie warner turned to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.990
 character in the capusotto emo 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 and that character is already missing 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.150
 placed number 3 in the line of the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.280
 extraordinary gentlemen this comic 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.440
 that proposes great characters of the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.390
 world literature as a group of 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.850
 renegade vigilante is nothing more than a 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.710
 essay on the duality of man to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.170
 point that the heroes themselves end 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.240
 eliminating themselves among them however the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.790
 screenwriter of this movie horror 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.350
 must have leafed through the comic and said 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.630
 it's like that of the girls turtles but 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.150
 with characters from books and from 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.460
 there everything was dedicated just like the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.520
 box office collection number 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.950
 2 world the original version of this 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.440
 story is an orgy of violence where 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.240
 the protagonist based on eminem ends 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.190
 the story breaking the fourth wall 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.680
 announcing that if they allow me 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.950
 paraphrase is not making love 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.810
 forcibly to the readers however 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.090
 this tale of horrible villains 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.920
 vigilantes was taken to the cinema as a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.770
 anti-hero history where the bullets 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.290
 they bend and the angelina jolie get naked 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.310
 it's not that we want to make love with 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.440
 eminem but 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.160
 if you're not going to tell the story really 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.530
 at least change the name of the movie 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.099
 put numbers a number x men origins 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.319
 wolverine this movie for some reason 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.630
 from a paper to the leader of the black 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.819
 eyed peas but where he asked the worst 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.080
 born of deadpool a known character 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.030
 like the mutemouth mercenary not only 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.819
 the pool is the most beloved character by 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.069
 the marcelistas but ryan reynolds 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.780
 It was ideal for paper but we did not enjoy 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.150
 from the mouth and ready 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.150
 thanks boxer thanks for nothing
