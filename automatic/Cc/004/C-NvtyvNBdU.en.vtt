00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 buried super-low streams but 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.220
 now equal 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.840

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.789
 queers 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.140
 with the kilo of opportunities 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:59.940
 and I'm set but leave the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:06.750
 walls in the eye 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:09.900
 now the book of life of my 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.009
 competitors killing them 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.009
 close up 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.319
 once you're telling me that the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.720
 The only time he has played by loses is 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.940
 taken 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.640
 look stratus with me and we do not see so much the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.920
 car manufactured flipados buried te 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.250
 you've been blown yes or no from me 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.250

 who is the one who goes in the car please 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.610
 to see here comes the complex part 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.980
 its alive 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.709
 in a suit for care without pushing the 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.319
 study 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.200
 very well with this light that appears inside 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.560
 mine is now mine I have placed first 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.670
 here but it has been free is what fault 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.080
 I have a closure to appear 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.880
 under me and I threw myself 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.880
 for you I shit on God 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.330
 the collapse 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.360
 it's not worth subtracting 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.360
 Y 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.040
 and I go 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.560
 In this race 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.000
 I do not know how you see you 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.000
 But I'll go 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:54.900
 and it slows everything is what happened to me and 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.740

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.550

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:21.300
