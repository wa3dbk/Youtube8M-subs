00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.520

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.819
 up here to get better 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:03.519
 for example, I'll put it here, it's level 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.790
 It's going to make this very dark here. 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.609
 A little clear here 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:16.030
 besides I will also put a mat 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:19.389

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.019
 212 and saturation in 10 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:25.780
 It's beauty , I select this image. 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.000

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.370
 saturation, I put it on the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.049
 Saturation up here. Very well. I 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.660
 I'm going to create another layer that 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.139
 now on top of this upon this either 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:45.069
 say with that color here that people 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:49.090

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.730
 to paint on top are exactly the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:04:00.459
 same color to have a better result 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:02.620
 It's ok, this is it, so I'm going to 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.510
 little right with us in these 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.799
 levels that I had put here with the 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.500
 too white 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.549
 so I'll put it all over again and 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.549
 There's another one here too. 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.760

 these parts here, beauty 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:45.000

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:48.360
 You can lighten up a little here just 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.690
 Clicking on the leads is getting dark 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.480
