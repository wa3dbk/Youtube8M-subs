you<00:02:40.660> know<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:41.170> was<00:02:41.319> just<00:02:41.349> kind<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.700> attitude

you know I was just kind of the attitude
it's<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.599> little<00:02:43.870> different<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.410> general

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
it's a little different this general

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.880 
it's a little different this general
kind<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.959> tone<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.349> his<00:02:47.410> voice<00:02:47.470> is

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
kind of the tone of his voice is

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.530 
kind of the tone of his voice is
different<00:02:48.340> he's<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> little

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.990 

he's<00:02:54.540> kind<00:02:54.780> of

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
he's kind of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.760 
he's kind of
swagger<00:02:56.480> to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
swagger to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.390 
swagger to
so<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.810> wasn't<00:03:00.990> anything<00:03:01.320> specifically<00:03:02.160> that

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
so it wasn't anything specifically that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.800 
so it wasn't anything specifically that
I<00:03:02.460> was<00:03:02.580> like<00:03:02.700> all<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.000> want<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.210> do<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.450> under

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
I was like all I want to do this under

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.350 
I was like all I want to do this under
this<00:03:03.960> it<00:03:04.440> was<00:03:04.560> just<00:03:04.710> kind<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.100> mental<00:03:05.970> state

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
this it was just kind of a mental state

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.610 
this it was just kind of a mental state
that<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.630> tried<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> other

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
that I tried to get to and the other

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:16.589 
that I tried to get to and the other
thing<00:03:07.890> with<00:03:11.690> house<00:03:12.690> directly

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.869 

it<00:03:17.140> was<00:03:17.349> this<00:03:18.159> was<00:03:18.340> probably<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.730> most

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
it was this was probably the most

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.110 
it was this was probably the most
difficult

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
difficult

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:31.120 
difficult
I<00:03:23.989> was<00:03:24.989> essentially<00:03:25.379> introducing

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.190 

so<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:33.660> do<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:35.190> really<00:03:35.880> kind<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.480> direct<00:03:37.050> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
so to do to really kind of direct the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.140 
so to do to really kind of direct the
way<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.590> wanted<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.920> correct<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.700> also<00:03:38.880> be

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
way that I wanted to correct but also be

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.540 
way that I wanted to correct but also be
available<00:03:41.570> mentally<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:43.220> invest<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.490> new

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
available mentally to invest in this new

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.220 
available mentally to invest in this new
to<00:03:45.180> bring<00:03:45.360> this<00:03:45.450> new<00:03:45.600> character<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:46.050> live

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
to bring this new character you live

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.510 
to bring this new character you live
