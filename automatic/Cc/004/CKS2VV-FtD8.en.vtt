them to come out this well I think it's

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.709 
them to come out this well I think it's
a<00:00:46.739> great<00:00:46.920> sign<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.059> product<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
a great sign that this product is a

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.049 
a great sign that this product is a
solid<00:00:49.379> keeper<00:00:49.769> and<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.879> i've<00:00:51.000> been

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
solid keeper and that's what i've been

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
solid keeper and that's what i've been
using<00:00:51.359> it<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.929> i<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.079> i<00:00:52.589> might<00:00:52.769> get<00:00:53.039> another

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
using it and i think i might get another

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.810 
using it and i think i might get another
jar<00:00:54.019> not<00:00:55.019> even<00:00:55.289> kidding<00:00:55.499> and<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.609> also

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
jar not even kidding and I and I also

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.029 
jar not even kidding and I and I also
think<00:00:57.179> it's<00:00:57.420> due<00:00:57.749> to<00:00:57.929> the<00:00:58.050> fact<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.469> i<00:00:58.649> put<00:00:58.920> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
think it's due to the fact that i put it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.119 
think it's due to the fact that i put it
by<00:00:59.190> argan<00:00:59.609> oil<00:00:59.820> before<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.749> know<00:01:00.839> it's<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:01.589> oil

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
by argan oil before I know it's like oil

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.050 
by argan oil before I know it's like oil
but<00:01:02.429> it's<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:03.570> really<00:01:04.519> nourishing<00:01:05.519> oil<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
but it's a really nourishing oil that I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.430 
but it's a really nourishing oil that I
think<00:01:06.570> helps<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.590> nod<00:01:07.830> frizz<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
think helps with the nod frizz and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.870 
think helps with the nod frizz and
because<00:01:10.440> I<00:01:10.530> know<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.830> markets<00:01:11.310> itself<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.790> be

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
because I know like markets itself to be

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
because I know like markets itself to be
like<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> know<00:01:12.680> pretty<00:01:13.680> straight<00:01:14.070> hair<00:01:14.370> but

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
like you know pretty straight hair but

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.540 
like you know pretty straight hair but
like<00:01:14.960> curls<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.200> kinks<00:01:16.620> need<00:01:16.830> frizz<00:01:17.280> free

when I had break through and I showed
you<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.039> kind<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.459> took<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.660> excess

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you it kind of took out the excess

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
you it kind of took out the excess
moisture<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.070> was<00:02:11.250> raking<00:02:11.460> through<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
moisture as I was raking through so it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.780 
moisture as I was raking through so it
really<00:02:12.540> helped<00:02:12.990> with<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.260> dry<00:02:13.500> time<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.550> gel

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
really helped with the dry time the gel

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.650 
really helped with the dry time the gel
I<00:02:14.820> used

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
I used

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.160 
I used
equinox<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.710> like<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> more<00:02:17.610> wet<00:02:17.910> gel<00:02:18.330> so

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
equinox it's so like a more wet gel so

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.760 
equinox it's so like a more wet gel so
when<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.950> put<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.520> had<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.770> squeeze

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
when I have put it on I had to squeeze

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.410 
when I have put it on I had to squeeze
out<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.220> excess<00:02:23.250> water<00:02:23.670> or<00:02:24.000> else<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.300> would

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
out the excess water or else it would

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.750 
out the excess water or else it would
have<00:02:24.510> taken<00:02:24.810> me<00:02:25.200> forever<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.770> dry<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.550> this

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
have taken me forever to dry but this

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.150 
have taken me forever to dry but this
gel<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.210> think<00:02:27.690> because<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.320> more<00:02:28.530> heavy<00:02:28.890> and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
gel I think because it's more heavy and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.530 
gel I think because it's more heavy and
goopy<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:30.240> kind<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:31.280> took<00:02:32.280> away<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.150> excess

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
goopy it kind of took away the excess

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.080 
goopy it kind of took away the excess
moisture<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.740> hair<00:02:35.010> could<00:02:35.190> drive<00:02:35.430> faster

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
moisture so the hair could drive faster

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.370 
moisture so the hair could drive faster
in<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:37.020> better<00:02:37.230> shape<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.580> really<00:02:39.510> love<00:02:39.900> curl

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
in a better shape so really love curl

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.220 
in a better shape so really love curl
junkies<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.950> low<00:02:41.010> fix<00:02:41.370> gel<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.630> said<00:02:42.900> once

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
again I think it's the most strongest

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.870 
again I think it's the most strongest
holding<00:02:48.000> gel<00:02:48.750> out<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> bunch<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.100> i<00:02:50.700> will
