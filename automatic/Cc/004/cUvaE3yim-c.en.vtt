 buy this program and links like 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.270
 always in the description we do so 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.880
 forced exit

 ok now to go and import the dvd 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.479
 really simply just go 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.720
 top left on DVD disk 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.509

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.430
 solution then how to do 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:30.720
 we go on ok the risk has been there 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.270
 found in noa easing bis is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.979
 analyzing it so to speak already done e 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.049
 here he practically asked with all the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.619
 tracks from the longer one 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.240
 selected in this case 27 2 points 14 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.170
 that if I'm not mistaken it was the interview 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.600
 however we are going to import the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.720
 daytona in part 9 then we can give 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.689
 a carlo snap shot ie a photo of a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.259
 part of this video 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:05.100
 then we can go to select where 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.250
 go and import this movie if 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.290
 in the mp4 section 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.300
 music then going to remove the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.900
 take the video off and just have the audio 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.760
 and putting one in the music part le 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.750
 evidence there are many other choices than us 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.010
 we are here to list uselessly here 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.310
 we can go to choose I chose 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.250
 the 2mp session for we can go on 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.280
 ios and find better choose the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.010
 quality of audio 128 than that 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.570
 standard that already saw audio sound light 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.090
 selected at maximum and the volume is 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.560
 informed the same for the quality of 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.530
 video we can go increase the 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.870
 quality the frame per second 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.870
 use high quality and then formed 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.860
 Once this is done, just go and click 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.330
 on start and there was to import better 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.310
 convert video to lose this 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.770
 program in my opinion is really a lot 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.770

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.760
 video conversion and then we continue 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.390

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:39.230

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:48.250
 conversion lasts 51 56 in fact here it lasts 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:48.250
