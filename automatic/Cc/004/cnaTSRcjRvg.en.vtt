00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.650 
first if they have their balance they
can<00:02:11.220> figure<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:11.519> how<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> pedal<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.120> bike<00:02:12.299> in<00:02:12.600> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
can figure out how to pedal a bike in a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.630 
can figure out how to pedal a bike in a
matter<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.019> about<00:02:13.140> thirty<00:02:13.709> seconds<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.459> one

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
matter of about thirty seconds to one

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.940 
matter of about thirty seconds to one
minute<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:15.720> straight<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.140> unique<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.739> that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
minute so the straight of unique in that

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.949 
minute so the straight of unique in that
there<00:02:17.130> isn't<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.489> big<00:02:17.790> step<00:02:18.329> or<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.750> big

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
there isn't this big step or this big

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.020 
there isn't this big step or this big
leap<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.410> faith'<00:02:19.680> where<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.700> all<00:02:21.000> of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
leap of faith' where they have to all of

a sudden be riding at the first inkling
of<00:02:24.329> insecurity<00:02:25.019> can<00:02:25.410> just<00:02:25.590> put<00:02:25.709> their<00:02:25.859> feet

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
of insecurity can just put their feet

of insecurity can just put their feet
down<00:02:26.070> again<00:02:26.519> after<00:02:27.060> they've<00:02:27.239> figured<00:02:27.720> out<00:02:27.959> all

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
down again after they've figured out all
