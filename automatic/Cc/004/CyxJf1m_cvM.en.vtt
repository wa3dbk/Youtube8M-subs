00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.660
Homemade Orange Marmalade

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.759
Hello Friends! Today we will make an Orange Marmalade

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.359
and let me tell you that there are plenty of recipes for this jam and the truth is that we chose

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.060
within all recipes, the one that was the easiest to make, to share it with you

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:31.089
the result, let me tell you that we loved it, this jam is super easy to make

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.289
and I know that the people who love marmalades and jams, will enjoy very much this one

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:41.240
So I invite you to see the ingredients and then the directions

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.560
The ingredients for the orange marmalade are:

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.580
1 Kilo of fruit pulp, here we'll show you  how we did it

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.400
because this is roughly 1 kilo 300 (gr.) of fruit

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.500
but when you take out the white part of the oranges, and the seeds

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.420
and leaves only the pulp, and in this case, we used the peel of 3 oranges

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.150
It was letf a kilo of fruit pulp

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.070
and for that amount of pulp, I'm going to use 1/2 kilo of sugar

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.970
1 kilo of fruit for 1/2 kilo of sugar

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.150
Friends, the preparation is as follows

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.400
We used the valencia orange or the orange for juice

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.980
which is ideal for making jam, the other varieties may not work

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.280
what we will do and what we wanted to show you in this video

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.900
is that we took the peel of 3 oranges

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:55.880
we cut them very thin trying not to cut too much of the white part of the orange

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.220
and only cutting the orange part of the peel

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:08.329
then we are going to remove all the white parts of the remaining orange

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:15.319
and in the process, very thoroughly, we'll remove all the white parts of the orange

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:22.039
we're going to cut the orange in half, and we're going to remove the seeds and the core of the fruit

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:32.820
and we will make a thorough review, removing the remaining  pieces of orange rind and seeds

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.800
that, as you can see, are quite large

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.609
so that's a job that we must be very meticulous

00:02:50.880 --> 00:03:01.160
so if you need glasses, put on you glasses and check well that there are no seeds

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.229
and we do this with all the oranges

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.660
and now,  we have to weigh the fruit

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.789
in this case the pulp and the peel of 3 oranges

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:27.519
and that gave us almost 1 kilo, we were missing 3 grams to reach the kilo

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:36.619
so here we round the numbers, and this will go to a blender

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.679
and we're going to add the pulp and the peels to the blender

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:52.039
and this will be blended

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:07.009
we will cover the blender well and we will be using the speeds that the blender has

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:12.269
and you will see that it will form a thick juice

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.729
and with that, we will prepare the jam

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.910
once the oranges are well blended

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:41.759
we'll add the juice into a saucepan and bring the mixture to a low heat

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.559
if you do not have a low fire in your kitchen, you'll have to use a simmer plate or a Heat Diffuser

00:04:52.559 --> 00:05:00.719
what we'll do now is wait for it to boil and then wait for 20 minutes

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:09.639
once the 20 minutes have passed, then we'll add the granulated sugar

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.479
and you see that once you add all the sugar

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.399
it will stop boiling, and then we'll have to wait for it to boil again

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.580
and then we have to let cook for another 20 minutes. 40 minutes, in total.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.580
we'll have to stir it occasionally with a wooden spoon, once in a while

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.640
so the jam doesn't stick in the saucepan

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.580
once the 40 minutes have passed, remove the jam from the heat

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.880
and we wait until it's warm to place the marmalade in glass jars or in plastic boxes

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.159
and this lasts one month in the refrigerator

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:06.679
and we took the liberty to spread this delicious orange marmalade in one of our gluten free breads

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:14.319

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.720
we know that unfortunately, the allergies are increasing among children worldwide

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.500
and every day there are more people who have problems with food allergies

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:46.580
