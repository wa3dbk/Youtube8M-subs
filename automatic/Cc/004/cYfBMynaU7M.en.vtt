00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.690 
I'll be getting some new vintage gauges
for<00:02:00.160> that<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:00.870> as<00:02:01.870> far<00:02:02.140> as<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.440> know<00:02:02.500> that<00:02:03.400> not

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
for that and as far as I know that not

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.160 
for that and as far as I know that not
the<00:02:03.910> original<00:02:04.270> steering<00:02:04.510> wheel<00:02:04.750> I<00:02:04.780> believe

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
the original steering wheel I believe

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.350 
the original steering wheel I believe
Atwoods<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.860> Walmart<00:02:06.370> brand<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:06.850> that'll

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
Atwoods a Walmart brand so that'll

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.780 
Atwoods a Walmart brand so that'll
probably<00:02:07.390> have<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.960> get<00:02:08.050> replaced<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:09.340> birth

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
probably have to get replaced the birth

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.990 
probably have to get replaced the birth
control<00:02:10.320> unit<00:02:11.320> over<00:02:11.500> there<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.770> still<00:02:12.040> intact

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
control unit over there is still intact

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.040

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
and working the seats are pretty good as

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.410 
and working the seats are pretty good as
far<00:02:17.170> as<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> vinyl<00:02:18.010> part<00:02:18.280> goes<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:18.700> seats

hydraulic rams there's a cable right

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.970 
hydraulic rams there's a cable right
there<00:02:52.510> that's<00:02:53.470> because<00:02:53.830> it's<00:02:54.250> hand<00:02:54.489> operated

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980

there that's because it's hand operated
my<00:02:56.220> trusty<00:02:56.819> assistant<00:02:56.849> is<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.540> to

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
my trusty assistant is going to

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.710 
my trusty assistant is going to
demonstrate<00:02:57.780> that<00:02:58.140> by<00:02:59.060> cranking<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.299> handle

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
demonstrate that by cranking that handle

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.830 
demonstrate that by cranking that handle
which<00:03:00.870> goes<00:03:01.080> through<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.409> little<00:03:01.680> slot<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
which goes through a little slot in the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.500 
which goes through a little slot in the
engine<00:03:03.840> cover<00:03:04.049> there<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.860> see<00:03:05.190> how<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.510> turn

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
engine cover there you see how the turn

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.369 
engine cover there you see how the turn
drive<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.950> lowering<00:03:08.370> right<00:03:08.610> there<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.290> he

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
drive is lowering right there and if he

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.830 
drive is lowering right there and if he
cranks<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.769> back<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.069> other<00:03:11.220> way<00:03:11.629> you<00:03:12.629> see<00:03:12.810> it

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
cranks it back the other way you see it

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.240 
cranks it back the other way you see it
go<00:03:13.110> up<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:14.250> that's<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.269> pretty<00:03:15.450> cool<00:03:15.690> feature

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
go up so that's a pretty cool feature

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.740 
go up so that's a pretty cool feature
all<00:03:17.250> right<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.549> if<00:03:17.760> we<00:03:17.819> take<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.239> engine<00:03:18.390> cover

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
all right so if we take the engine cover

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.330 
all right so if we take the engine cover
off<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:19.640> remove<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.790> handle<00:03:21.120> first<00:03:22.340> that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
off and remove the handle first that

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.280 
off and remove the handle first that
handle<00:03:23.670> assembly<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.690> don't<00:03:24.900> want<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.110> lose

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
handle assembly you don't want to lose

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.199 
handle assembly you don't want to lose
that<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.890> had<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.430> friend<00:03:26.670> asked<00:03:26.849> me<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.090> other

you can see right here buffed out a

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.820 
you can see right here buffed out a
little<00:04:56.680> spot<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:57.639> there<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:58.630> am<00:04:58.750> looking<00:04:59.710> at

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
little spot and there I am looking at

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.170 
little spot and there I am looking at
you<00:04:59.979> right<00:05:00.130> there<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.400> reflection<00:05:01.000> of<00:05:01.090> the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
you right there and reflection of the

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.510 
you right there and reflection of the
side<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.539> boat<00:05:01.690> so<00:05:01.720> that's<00:05:02.560> very<00:05:02.919> savable

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
side of the boat so that's very savable

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.909 
side of the boat so that's very savable
and<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:05.020> trailer<00:05:05.320> obviously<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:05.740> going<00:05:05.860> to

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
and the trailer obviously is going to

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.620 
and the trailer obviously is going to
have<00:05:06.010> to<00:05:06.100> be<00:05:06.220> sandblasted<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.910> powder-coated

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
have to be sandblasted and powder-coated

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.020 
have to be sandblasted and powder-coated
but<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.990> think<00:05:08.470> overall<00:05:08.800> this<00:05:09.370> should<00:05:09.850> make<00:05:09.970> a

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
but I think overall this should make a

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.719 
but I think overall this should make a
pretty<00:05:10.240> cool<00:05:10.510> project<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.229> I'd<00:05:12.220> welcome<00:05:12.520> any

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729
