00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.719
 salt the facts today I you 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.480
 shows six outfits that I really like 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.670
 for the start, so firstly I 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.739
 starts with my favorite certainly that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.370
 that I was bringing back to school so it's 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:52.859
 an outfit a little respite but very 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:55.079
 classic created but not chic but I 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:58.079
 wears sandals that come from 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.629
 bike and on top of the loop there are 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.179
 tibrian stones that is said is 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.019
 found between pretty girls are 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.019
 really not exemplary 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.500
 then my shirt is a shirt of 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.100
 at each club 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.050
 she is blue striped white and generating 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.960
 a lot she is a bit tall but this 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.960
 what I like is a pretty look 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 relaxed 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.150
 then my belt well actually there is 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.440
 my mother I saw flying for the video but 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.020
 if he always stood up in leather that 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.580
 do not follow the height but not so much them 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.729
 come from abercrombie and fitch 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.560
 and maka also put a camisole to 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.110
 of audenge chicago time that 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.909
 I would like this is a very 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.100
 comfortable find since I add 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:51.399
 this retreat john instructions my 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.810
 I have attached hair from behind 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:02:00.250
 and especially with a schengen loop 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.960
 finally the necklace then our 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.020
 held that I would love that I have 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.660
 often worn last year so this 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.440
 with a pretty little dress and little 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.179
 comfortable 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.750
 it's really like my dress color 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.750
 I find 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.180
 so the belt of cyprus latvia 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.980
 monks and asome comes from olive 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.720
 I really like the neckline I find it 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.500
 very classic but she hesitates to wear 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.680
 to the double will 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.120
 in fact both and the cardigan comes 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.650
 fervent checks you and I like 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.570
 many the two blue stripes on the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.150
 case card for 6 shoes these are 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:44.420
 cases of another not held enough 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.000
 laid back so but in ten days that 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.230
 is often the retaining this coach 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.040
 are shiny shoes from 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.650
 stikeman so bad anyway 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.330
 so it's a super classic outfit 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.220
 jeans with a white sweater but 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.100
 I'd like in March so is their way 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.020
 and comes from midway and flora and 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.480
 of schaeffer and tony martin flores blue 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.370
 navy small white dots the belt of 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.590
 the same as sometimes my jeans come from 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.760
 Chicago 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.650
 then it's finally gone 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.790
 color and then it's very different from this 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.280
 that I usually wear so she is 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.730
 comfortable but it may be that your 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.220
 dress code 9 do not want that 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.170
 words so I'll track has 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.970
 added this cardigan there so it's a big 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.310
 wool cardigan but it's not 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.900
 the fairly light knitting issue from 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.760
 abercrombie and fitch is still 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.020
 warm enough that I like in 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.500
 penguins really really liked him 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.300
 oxygen 7-6 by a portable 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.910
 the shoes it's even can sometimes so 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.860
 these falls is on the diagram length 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.220
 her comforting lover I love all there 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.400
 you there is 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.170
 above the shorts shorts shorts 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.360
 of color as to us that I say 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.790
 and then mullen on stronger is because 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.290
 they come from gea - that anigo then to the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.770
 camisole that same as the white so 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.590
 she is black minergie garage and I like 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.450
 really consequences 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.330
 and finally the package and numbers 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.680
 hitwise 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.150
 if you want a little more outfit 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.790
 chic for sale and well I have a 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.460
 disappointed is it's a maxi dress with 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.060
 a jacket in jeans and the club I 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.920
 very much 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.450
 it's super comfortable but hot 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.040
 it's very advantageous because we 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.850
 are to be excited yet to come lengthen 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.490
 silhouette 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.200
 good I already take big but good there 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.200
 always good then it's very con 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.340
 I really like the color of the decline 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.770
 of the threshold loop the buttons that's 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.550
 too much I said so morocco comes from 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.050
 bar 3 and the one to buy in new york but 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.750
 an edge three end up in life 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.970
 and the verse and jacket from h &amp; m a 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.340
 sleeveless jacket what to say we tell you 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.640
 that can be worn with many oil 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.200
 the collection profits pass for 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.180
 what is my shoes in Corsica 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.310
 same diallo waste sandals that 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:05.050
 in the first and finally from alain 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.690
 held that I like possible or by 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.950
 phone at home with white striped meken and 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.540
 blue moon my time watch 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.920
 I love my neighborhood and eat 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.740
 three bodies from gap it is red 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.510
 fuchsia and very very flash management i 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.620
 think also a pendant a big heart 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.610
 shirt 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.230
 I really like this outfit because 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.460
 that she obviously very comfortable then 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.710
 I also like rips on my 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.810
 jeans that comes to contrast a little bit 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.510
 with the slightly more classic look of 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.250
 fuel then all that sweater and 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.970
 in my fingers as sometimes pigem for 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.830
 me the v-necks 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.720
 I do not really feel and then also 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.900
 we must not forget that every little outfit 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.850
 to be a little bit varied a click in 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.800
 strong flakes whose metals have a video 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.670
 on my channel with 5 to make for the 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.980
 back home so that's all for this 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.270
 video if I hope you liked it 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.310
 I hope you had some 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.290
 small ideas in the comments 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.180
 do not hesitate to tell me which outfit 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.830
 you preferred and also if you 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.330
 want to remember the pictures of what 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.970
 you plan to wear for the autumn 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.570
 so we will be very soon if that 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.570
 go girls
