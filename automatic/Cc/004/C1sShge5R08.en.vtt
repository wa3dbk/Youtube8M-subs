so<00:00:01.230> in<00:00:01.560> glaucoma<00:00:02.480> the<00:00:03.480> eyeball<00:00:05.000> fills<00:00:06.000> up<00:00:06.210> with

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
so in glaucoma the eyeball fills up with

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.810 
so in glaucoma the eyeball fills up with
fluid<00:00:06.830> and<00:00:07.830> gets<00:00:08.309> big<00:00:08.550> an<00:00:08.730> armed<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.450> painful

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
fluid and gets big an armed and painful

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.209 
fluid and gets big an armed and painful
the<00:00:11.820> normal<00:00:12.179> line<00:00:12.300> makes<00:00:12.630> fluid<00:00:12.900> behind<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the normal line makes fluid behind the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.420 
the normal line makes fluid behind the
iris<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.509> these<00:00:16.020> glands<00:00:16.410> called<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.010> ciliary

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
iris in these glands called the ciliary

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.140 
iris in these glands called the ciliary
apparatus<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.779> flows<00:00:19.199> through<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.949> pupil<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
apparatus it flows through the pupil and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.519 
apparatus it flows through the pupil and
goes<00:00:21.510> out<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> circulation<00:00:24.230> in<00:00:25.230> glaucoma

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
goes out of the circulation in glaucoma

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.150 
goes out of the circulation in glaucoma
the<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.519> will<00:00:26.849> get<00:00:27.029> big<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.599> hard<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.170> this

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the I will get big and hard and this

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.720 
the I will get big and hard and this
instrument<00:00:29.849> measures<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.260> pressure<00:00:31.529> by<00:00:32.340> how

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
instrument measures the pressure by how

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.430 
instrument measures the pressure by how
much<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.440> deflects<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:35.730> surface<00:00:36.239> soft<00:00:37.170> eye

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
much it deflects the surface soft eye

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.549 
much it deflects the surface soft eye
it's<00:00:38.430> quite<00:00:38.730> easy<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.120> press<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.260> would

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
it's quite easy to press so that would

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.260 
it's quite easy to press so that would
register<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.129> low<00:00:41.399> pressure<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:43.379> big<00:00:43.710> old<00:00:43.950> line

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
register a low pressure the big old line

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.740 
register a low pressure the big old line
the<00:00:45.270> heart<00:00:45.570> eye<00:00:46.160> it's<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.370> easy<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.059> push<00:00:48.480> in

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the heart eye it's not easy to push in

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.040 
the heart eye it's not easy to push in
some<00:00:49.379> registers<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.100> higher<00:00:50.340> pressure<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:51.870> we

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
some registers of higher pressure so we

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.889 
some registers of higher pressure so we
give<00:00:52.230> them<00:00:52.350> drugs<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:53.129> either<00:00:53.309> help<00:00:53.789> them<00:00:53.899> stop

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
give them drugs to either help them stop

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.150 
give them drugs to either help them stop
making<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> fluid<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.390> open<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.570> these<00:00:58.160> drains

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
making the fluid or open up these drains

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.319 
making the fluid or open up these drains
or<00:00:59.579> angles<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> fluid<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.289> get<00:01:01.469> away

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
or angles so the fluid can get away

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.130 
or angles so the fluid can get away
sometimes<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:04.589> eyeball<00:01:05.180> we<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.479> can't<00:01:06.780> stop

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
sometimes the eyeball we just can't stop

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.050 
sometimes the eyeball we just can't stop
it<00:01:07.200> from<00:01:07.439> getting<00:01:07.710> big<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.070> hard<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.950> painful

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
it from getting big and hard and painful

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.410 
it from getting big and hard and painful
so<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.570> take<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> eyeball<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
so we have to take the eyeball out and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.460 
so we have to take the eyeball out and
that's<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.750> called<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.020> salvage

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that's this is called a salvage

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.730 
that's this is called a salvage
procedure<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.820> dogs<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:19.020> pretty<00:01:19.259> well<00:01:19.350> with

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
procedure but dogs do pretty well with

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.399 
procedure but dogs do pretty well with
one<00:01:20.040> eye<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.689> they<00:01:21.689> don't<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.259> do

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
one eye because they don't have to do

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.710 
one eye because they don't have to do
very<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:22.830> anymore<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.939> take<00:01:24.180> care<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.479> them

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
very much anymore we take care of them

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.310 
very much anymore we take care of them
and<00:01:25.610> people<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.909> fine<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.509> eye<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.990> dogs

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and people do fine with one eye and dogs

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.450 
and people do fine with one eye and dogs
do<00:01:28.560> fine<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.390> mostly<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.930> owners<00:01:31.460> we

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
do fine with what I mostly the owners we

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.840 
do fine with what I mostly the owners we
as<00:01:32.670> owners<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.960> pet<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.530> love<00:01:35.130> our<00:01:35.250> pets<00:01:35.490> we

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
as owners and pet and love our pets we

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.940 
as owners and pet and love our pets we
can't<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.540> don't<00:01:36.570> want<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.409> without<00:01:37.710> an<00:01:37.829> eye

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
can't we don't want to go without an eye

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.249 
can't we don't want to go without an eye
but<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.340> really<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.659> procedure<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> works

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
but it's really a procedure that works

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.060 
but it's really a procedure that works
quite<00:01:40.470> nicely<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.590> dog<00:01:43.710> comes<00:01:43.920> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
quite nicely the if your dog comes in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.889 
quite nicely the if your dog comes in
from<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> outside<00:01:44.490> holding<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> inside

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
from the outside holding the inside

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.440 
from the outside holding the inside
closed<00:01:46.310> probably<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.399> painful<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
closed probably as painful can be a

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
did not feel good in order for us to

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.030 
did not feel good in order for us to
really<00:02:13.970> look<00:02:14.150> at<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.659> eye<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.560> test<00:02:15.860> that

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
really look at the eye and to test that

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.130 
really look at the eye and to test that
we<00:02:16.190> need<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.519> put<00:02:16.700> numbing<00:02:16.970> drops<00:02:17.150> on<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:17.659> first

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
we need to put numbing drops on it first

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.410 
we need to put numbing drops on it first
in<00:02:18.590> order<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:19.099> numb<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.610> surface<00:02:20.239> of<00:02:20.360> the

in order to numb the surface of the
cornea<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.049> the<00:02:21.739> membranes<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.400> eye<00:02:22.489> so

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
cornea and the membranes of the eye so

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.940 
cornea and the membranes of the eye so
that<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.599> poor<00:02:23.810> little<00:02:24.019> dog<00:02:24.140> doesn't<00:02:24.470> mind<00:02:24.799> us

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
that the poor little dog doesn't mind us

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.520 
that the poor little dog doesn't mind us
poking<00:02:25.670> around<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.360> there<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.659> see<00:02:26.930> what<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
poking around in there to see what the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.369 
poking around in there to see what the
problem<00:02:28.069> is<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.519> we<00:02:29.239> put<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.750> drops<00:02:30.049> on<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
problem is so we put the drops on the

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.640 
problem is so we put the drops on the
surface<00:02:30.799> of<00:02:30.950> both<00:02:31.159> eyes<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.989> will<00:02:33.230> allow

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
surface of both eyes and that will allow

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.400 
surface of both eyes and that will allow
us<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.329> look<00:02:35.329> around<00:02:35.659> there

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410

that's irritating that eye in this case
it<00:02:58.460> is<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.000> glaucoma<00:02:59.740> compare<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.920> other<00:03:01.070> eye

the cornea you can see right through to
the<00:03:05.650> iris<00:03:06.650> or<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.010> colored<00:03:07.310> part<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.700> eye

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
the iris or the colored part of the eye

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.430 
the iris or the colored part of the eye
and<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.270> pupil<00:03:08.630> looks<00:03:08.810> nice<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.230> black

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
and the pupil looks nice and black

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.470 
and the pupil looks nice and black
that's<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.430> pretty<00:03:10.610> normal<00:03:10.850> part<00:03:11.240> of<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.450> eye

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
that's a pretty normal part of the eye

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.030 
that's a pretty normal part of the eye
and<00:03:11.720> don't<00:03:11.930> forget<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.350> membranes<00:03:12.800> that<00:03:12.920> are

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
and don't forget the membranes that are

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.660 
and don't forget the membranes that are
nice<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.610> pale<00:03:14.270> pink<00:03:14.690> they're<00:03:14.930> not<00:03:15.110> red<00:03:15.670> so

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
nice and pale pink they're not red so

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.699 
nice and pale pink they're not red so
we're<00:03:16.880> going<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.030> use<00:03:17.240> a<00:03:17.470> denominator<00:03:18.470> which

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
we're going to use a denominator which

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.680 
we're going to use a denominator which
is<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:18.890> pressure<00:03:19.250> instrument<00:03:19.970> which<00:03:20.270> will<00:03:20.420> push

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
is a pressure instrument which will push

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.890 
is a pressure instrument which will push
on<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.110> eyeball<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.310> let<00:03:23.270> us<00:03:23.390> know<00:03:23.600> what<00:03:23.780> the

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
on the eyeball and let us know what the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.470 
on the eyeball and let us know what the
pressure<00:03:24.140> is<00:03:24.320> in<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.920> in<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.490> eyeball<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.090> we

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
pressure is in the in the eyeball so we

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.870 
pressure is in the in the eyeball so we
have<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.780> depress<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.920> eyeball<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.550> couple

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
have to depress the eyeball a couple

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.360 
have to depress the eyeball a couple
times<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.330> believe<00:03:29.570> me<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.870> need<00:03:30.370> anesthetic

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
times and believe me you need anesthetic

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.790 
times and believe me you need anesthetic
for<00:03:31.550> this<00:03:31.700> because<00:03:31.880> no<00:03:32.120> dog<00:03:32.360> likes<00:03:32.660> it<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.080> the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
for this because no dog likes it and the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.850 
for this because no dog likes it and the
pressure<00:03:34.070> will<00:03:34.310> show<00:03:34.490> up<00:03:34.610> on<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.820> gauge<00:03:35.150> on<00:03:35.540> the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
pressure will show up on a gauge on the

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.130 
pressure will show up on a gauge on the
denominator<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.690> usually<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.810> normal

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
denominator and usually the normal

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.620 
denominator and usually the normal
pressure<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.590> around<00:03:39.740> 25<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:41.030> anything<00:03:41.480> below

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
pressure is around 25 so anything below

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.500 
pressure is around 25 so anything below
that's<00:03:42.020> good<00:03:42.440> however<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.340> left<00:03:43.580> eye<00:03:43.760> turned

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
that's good however the left eye turned

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.290 
that's good however the left eye turned
out<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.870> have<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.050> pressure<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.650> 80<00:03:45.950> to<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.340> 90

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
out to have a pressure of 80 to a 90

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.410 
out to have a pressure of 80 to a 90
which<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.110> really<00:03:48.680> high<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.310> doesn't<00:03:50.150> really

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
which is really high and doesn't really

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.080 
which is really high and doesn't really
look<00:03:50.690> good<00:03:50.750> for<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.290> eye<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.820> right<00:03:53.060> eye

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
look good for that eye so the right eye

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.479 
look good for that eye so the right eye
is<00:03:53.540> just<00:03:54.050> turned<00:03:54.500> out<00:03:54.650> to<00:03:54.800> be<00:03:54.980> we<00:03:55.130> did<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.310> few

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
is just turned out to be we did a few

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.920 
is just turned out to be we did a few
more<00:03:55.670> times<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.209> turned<00:03:56.450> out<00:03:56.570> to<00:03:56.750> be<00:03:56.900> a

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
more times and it turned out to be a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.310 
more times and it turned out to be a
little<00:03:57.260> high<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:58.040> left<00:03:58.310> eye<00:03:58.489> is<00:03:58.900> really<00:03:59.900> high

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
little high the left eye is really high

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.470 
little high the left eye is really high
so<00:04:00.650> we're<00:04:01.160> going<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.340> use<00:04:01.459> some<00:04:01.700> drops<00:04:02.030> and

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
so we're going to use some drops and

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.080 
so we're going to use some drops and
also<00:04:03.080> use<00:04:03.410> some<00:04:03.709> other<00:04:03.860> medications<00:04:04.400> for<00:04:04.940> this

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
also use some other medications for this

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.180 
also use some other medications for this
little<00:04:05.239> guy<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:06.260> see<00:04:06.470> if<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:06.709> can<00:04:06.860> lower<00:04:07.070> the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
little guy to see if we can lower the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.930 
little guy to see if we can lower the
pressure

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.790 

so<00:04:13.940> what<00:04:14.239> we<00:04:14.360> usually<00:04:14.540> use<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.080> most<00:04:15.379> common
