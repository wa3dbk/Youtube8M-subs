for the quick view and you also notice

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.270 
for the quick view and you also notice
when<00:02:18.269> we're<00:02:18.599> right<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.379> hit<00:02:19.739> one<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.099> go<00:02:20.220> to

when we're right here I hit one to go to
front<00:02:20.610> view<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:21.330> notice<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.930> see

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
front view you notice that you can see

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.790 
front view you notice that you can see
that<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.470> depth<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> box<00:02:23.489> there<00:02:24.170> if<00:02:25.170> you

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
that the depth of the box there if you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.330 
that the depth of the box there if you
hit<00:02:25.980> 5<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.940> your<00:02:27.180> number<00:02:27.540> pad<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.349> takes<00:02:29.129> away

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
hit 5 on your number pad it takes away

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.920 
hit 5 on your number pad it takes away
the<00:02:29.430> depth<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:29.790> field<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.209> makes<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.569> easier

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the depth of field that makes it easier

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.050 
the depth of field that makes it easier
for<00:02:31.140> some<00:02:31.319> editing<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.730> that's<00:02:32.879> how<00:02:33.030> I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
for some editing and that's how I

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.670 
for some editing and that's how I
usually<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.019> view<00:02:34.170> when<00:02:34.440> I'm<00:02:34.560> editing

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
usually like the view when I'm editing

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.949 
usually like the view when I'm editing
but<00:02:35.099> sometimes<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.849> hand<00:02:36.330> 5<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.810> have

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
but sometimes you like to hand 5 to have

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.539 
but sometimes you like to hand 5 to have
that<00:02:37.110> depth<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.739> can<00:02:37.860> see<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> depth<00:02:38.400> of

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
that depth so you can see the depth of

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.100 
that depth so you can see the depth of
the<00:02:38.670> box<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.060> perspective<00:02:39.599> of<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> box<00:02:40.790> so

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the box the perspective of the box so

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.650 
the box the perspective of the box so
that's<00:02:43.110> five<00:02:43.530> on<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.830> number<00:02:44.040> pad<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.519> if<00:02:45.510> you

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
that's five on the number pad and if you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.870 
that's five on the number pad and if you
try<00:02:45.900> doing<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.620> numbers<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.250> top<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.700> your

views<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:29.489> find<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.030> those<00:03:30.239> views<00:03:30.690> are

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
views and I find that those views are

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.349 
views and I find that those views are
more<00:03:30.989> important<00:03:31.440> than<00:03:31.590> layers<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.269> you

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
more important than layers so if you

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.610 
more important than layers so if you
working<00:03:33.569> on<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.690> laptop<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:34.230> may<00:03:34.349> want<00:03:34.560> to
