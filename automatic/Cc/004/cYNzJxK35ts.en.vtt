bio material science and Solar Impulse

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.189 
bio material science and Solar Impulse
is<00:00:20.430> exactly<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.240> type<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.449> project<00:00:22.140> that

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
is exactly the type of project that

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.439 
is exactly the type of project that
corresponds<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.949> our<00:00:23.160> value<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:24.060> should<00:00:24.090> meet

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
corresponds to our value you should meet

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.050 
corresponds to our value you should meet
our<00:00:24.480> management<00:00:25.160> well<00:00:26.160> he<00:00:26.340> organized<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
our management well he organized the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.710 
our management well he organized the
meeting<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> plane<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.210> now<00:00:30.210> we're

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
meeting to see the plane and now we're

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.720 
meeting to see the plane and now we're
together<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.260> partnership<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.980> think

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
together in the partnership I think

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.280 
together in the partnership I think
that's<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> type<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.300> spirit<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:34.020> love<00:00:34.200> that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that's the type of spirit we love that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290 
that's the type of spirit we love that

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
project about the future this is showing
to<00:01:13.500> people<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.100> behavior<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.909> changed

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to people how behavior can be changed

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
to people how behavior can be changed
and<00:01:15.990> how<00:01:16.229> we<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.560> reach<00:01:16.830> solutions<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and how we can reach solutions to

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.620 
and how we can reach solutions to
problems<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.200> planet<00:01:19.619> which<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.220> are

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
problems of the planet which really are

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.700 
problems of the planet which really are
sustainable<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.750> working<00:01:22.200> with<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.530> future

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
sustainable and working with the future

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.130
