00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
nine point seven millimeters 10 that's

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
nine point seven millimeters 10 that's
the<00:01:52.079> galaxy<00:01:52.409> s<00:01:52.500> advance<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.340> have<00:01:53.579> all

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the galaxy s advance and we have all

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.480 
the galaxy s advance and we have all
these<00:01:54.420> pictures<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.079> show<00:01:55.290> okay<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.219> let's

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
these pictures to show okay so let's

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.539 
these pictures to show okay so let's
start<00:01:56.640> off<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.320> um<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.310> can

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
start off with this one um as you can

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.639 
start off with this one um as you can
see<00:01:59.729> by<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.939> phone<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.390> looks<00:02:00.570> very<00:02:01.439> very

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
see by the phone it looks very very

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.109 
see by the phone it looks very very
similar<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.250> galaxy<00:02:02.969> s<00:02:03.149> phone<00:02:04.310> maybe<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.670> bit<00:02:06.030> of

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
similar to galaxy s phone maybe a bit of

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.059 
similar to galaxy s phone maybe a bit of
the<00:02:06.329> galaxy<00:02:06.719> s2<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.409> galaxy<00:02:07.740> s<00:02:07.829> phones

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the galaxy s2 and the galaxy s phones

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.059 
the galaxy s2 and the galaxy s phones
both<00:02:08.399> their<00:02:08.819> design<00:02:09.119> aspects<00:02:09.599> put<00:02:09.810> into<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.200> I

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
both their design aspects put into one I

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.610 
both their design aspects put into one I
guess<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:11.940> what<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.180> looks<00:02:12.450> like

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
guess that's what this looks like

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.649 
guess that's what this looks like
it<00:02:14.159> has<00:02:14.310> touch<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:14.760> four<00:02:15.000> point<00:02:15.239> oh<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.510> can

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
it has touch with four point oh you can

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.390 
it has touch with four point oh you can
see<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:15.840> by<00:02:16.110> looking<00:02:16.530> at<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.739> icons<00:02:17.129> in<00:02:17.310> the
