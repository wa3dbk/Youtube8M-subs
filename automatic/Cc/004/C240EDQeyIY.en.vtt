00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.560
 welcome to the world of slot racing 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.759
 an activity that offers us 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.189
 electric car racing at 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.450
 the scale 1 32nd on the occasion of the great 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.160
 the prices of the ocean and the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.620
 noves we propose to discover or 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 rediscover this well- known discipline 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 under the name of scalextric or circuit 24 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.359
 the slot is for all fans 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.640
 of mechanical sports the slots and that's 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.849
 known in France since the 60s 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.590
 that's for sure and older than my 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.980
 generation often remember 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.960
 often from the circuit 24 7 the French who 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.390
 have released this game that made known a 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.640
 great success in the 60s and then 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.260
 little by little his TV to improve and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.910
 of course now become a material 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.500
 much more sophisticated there are 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.390
 clubs that have formed of course so 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.129
 there are competitions that are in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.399
 France Interclub are even 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.920
 regional competitions and there are 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.340
 also major national events 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.829
 24-hour races like 24 hours 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.449
 from the Mans 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.550
 of endurance where drivers take turns 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.140
 as at scale 1 this is also the case 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.119
 this weekend with a run of two times 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.860
 six hours we find ten teams 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.509
 composed of two or three drivers 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.580
 from all over France to compete for the 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.560
 victory at the paluds of noves the track 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.520
 while they measure 40 m and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.470
 of the oxygen system 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.909
 a system that allows competitors to 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.560
 to overcome oneself through referrals 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.570
 scatter throughout the circuit 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.490
 something to spice up his race 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.409
 and get closer to reality 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.060
 a chance for all those passionate about 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.450
 motorsport who likes to drive their 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.799
 cars 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.799
 but who also likes to prepare them 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.270
 the age shift that can be done 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.920
 on cars on we can put 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.990
 suspensions for example on egypt 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.180
 on chassis we can adjust the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.190
 height of the front gear you can adjust it 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.690
 there are different kinds of crowns and 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.330
 gears so the transmission was going 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.490
 also variable according to the lengths 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.630
 circuit if you are dealing with 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.340
 turns to straight lines 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.340
 so I think that actually the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.870
 passionate about motorsport for a 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.230
 much more modest cost can be 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.670
 find in the jump the cost is in 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.140
 much more affordable effect than 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.610
 scale 1 it takes a count 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.170
 forty euros for a car 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.640
 new is ready to roll for leisure 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.350
 or the competition 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.660
 the handle elbows when she 100 euros 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.460
 and you will follow everywhere the slot wants to be 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.530
 realistic and offers a wide range of 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.060
 Formula 1 cars at the rally in 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.860
 going through the cars of the same world 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.660
 the nascar all categories are 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.940
 represented and each of its 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.990
 own characteristics 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.730
 we try to slats the most 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.260
 powerful in the f1 so that 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.260
 it sticks to the reality that a goose f1 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.410
 go faster than a car a gt 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.090
 for example so playing on them on 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.430
 tire quality over the width of 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.900
 tires playing on the power of the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.750
 motor we can actually get to 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.010
 of was something very realistic 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.830
 at the level of comparisons between 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.270
 different four euros to the second then 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.040
 of the EU exercised these are groups these 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.739
 cars that drove in the 24 hours of 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.959
 mans between 1982 and 1991 who are 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.610
 used we find cars that 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.209
 have marked the history of these 24 hours 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.480
 a jaguar xjr9 a mazda 787b or even 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.489
 of famous porsche 962 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.750
 now place in the competition with 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.670
 Saturday morning trials 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.019
 each crew accustomed to the tracks and 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.030
 fine tune the settings of your vehicle 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.030
 as patrick lemaire of the scot track team 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.130
 everyone cleans his vehicle from a 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.330
 to z and checks all the pieces in order to 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.430
 leave in the best conditions 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.200
 following the technical control where all the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.060
 vehicles are checked to see if they 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.130
 comply with the regulations before 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.720
 start the qualifying session on 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.490
 offers you to follow the car of the 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.060
 team copyists as if you were at the 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.060
 driver's seat 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.079
 at the end of the qualifications csp 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.730
 collectable who signs the best time 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.680
 in 10 seconds and 40 hundredths 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.329
 christopher saioni in front of scott son of 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.439
 only a hundredth of a second which 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.240
 proves that deviations are very small 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.800
 between the teams 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.570
 after the qualifications place at a 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.680
 short meal break before the big departure 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.820

 christopher saioni the pole man who takes 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.130
 the best on his opponents 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.690
 behind the fight is bitter between fabien 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.370
 tessaro of the pelican and patrick team 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.080
 the lemaire at coop piste les deux 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.280
 drivers will stay wheel in wheel in 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.780
 this first relay but the strategies 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.000
 are different in both teams 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.230
 cock track decides to change drivers 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.170
 every hour while tessaro is 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.850

 advanced tours after an hour and a half 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.419
 race but after the first relay 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.309

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:50.789
 asa based in rhône alpes who benefit 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.469

 winner since relay with fabien 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.789
 tessaro for the pelican team was born 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.060
 with gerard it's the first time 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.960
 we team up that both of us 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.909
 had thought we might be 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.789
 podium but did not see the level on 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:37.229
 quickly found 4th and with the vagaries 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:41.539
 of the race we went on the podium 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:44.490
 after we managed thanks to a crown 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:48.389
 defective copyist to pass second 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.099
 and we kept on the last hour 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:53.009
 even a 2nd place subject but it was 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:54.180
 very hard with a tony that's a few 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:55.319
 years we roll together two years and 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.520
 that we have not had a victory is his 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:00.690
 first beautiful victory is magnificent 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.550
 after being built so despite 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.349
 some technical problems everybody 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.270
 seems delighted especially anthony 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:09.370
 castany the organizer of this grand prize 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.930
 of the uet ctrc positive balance sheet 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.510
 very positive at the system level 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.070
 oxygen it's a project to be organized 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.199
 tomorrow at 6 pm with a period of 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.490
 night with lighthouses so maybe 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.740
 believe next year
