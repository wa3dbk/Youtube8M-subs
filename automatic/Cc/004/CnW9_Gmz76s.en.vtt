00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.210
 as imagine then the effect could produce an asteroid of 500 kilometers 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.210
 in diameter colliding with the earth 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.710
 This reconstruction has been carried out under the control of experts in 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.710
 geophysics 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.899
 to facilitate the understanding of the proportions the land has been 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.899
 represented as we know it today 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.960
 an asteroid 500 kilometers in diameter is for example larger than 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 any of the islands that make up Japan 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.550
 the point of impact that was located in the Pacific Ocean between Japan 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.550
 and australia 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.160
 the speed of the asteroid is 72 thousand kilometers per hour zero as it is huge 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
 everything seems to develop in slow motion 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.880
 by the effect of the impact the earth's crust of a ten kilometers 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.420
 of thickness takes off from the mantle 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.030
 producing what is known as a failure sun amy 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.120
 a tsunami of the earth's crust 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.690
 the thin white film 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.690
 they are the four thousand meters of depth of the ocean 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.920
 the archipelago of japan is automatically pulverized 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.209
 gigantic pieces are projected beyond the atmosphere to several thousand 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.120
 kilometers of the surface before falling back to earth 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.120
 producing the effect of large power pumps 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.219
 the lips of the crater form an immense chain of mountains of seven thousand 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.219
 meters high 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.539
 the crater itself is a gulf four thousand kilometers in diameter 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.959
 and this is just the first instants of the catastrophe in 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.489
 min 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.909
 mister immense incandescent dome that remains over the crater for about 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.500
 moments after the impact 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 it's the rock vapor 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.339
 one hundred billion megatone is rock instantly transformed into steam 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.339
 by the extreme heat generated by the collision 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.609
 after inflating forming a dome we are or steam rock and support and 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.609
 it expands at great speed in all directions 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.069
 just three hours after the impact on the ocean an extraordinary burst 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.569
 of rock vapor with four thousand degrees centigrade temperature and 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.090
 moving at a speed of 300 meters per second reaches the Himalayas 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:22.449
 the rock vapor now reaches the Amazon at the antipodes of the place 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.449
 where the impact occurred 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.900
 the intensity of the heat produces a phenomenon of spontaneous combustion 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.669
 in the blink of an eye the board becomes an Indian ocean 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.960
 twenty-four hours after the impact the entire planet is covered in a 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.960
 high temperature rock vapor cloud 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.080
 this cloud will cover the globe for about a year 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.080
 the ocean 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.080
 origin of life does not escape catastrophe 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.529
 while the rock vapor finishes wrapping the earth the marine surface 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.529
 Bubbles everywhere 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:39.650
 comes to a boil 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.250
 the violence of evaporation lowers the water level a rhythm 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.250
 unimaginable five centimeters per minute 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.379
 the water of the sea disappears completely 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.830
 only the salt remains 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.830
 but it also evaporates quickly 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:12.259
 the ocean floor is now bare and continues to be subjected to that 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.180
 extreme temperature 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.180
 very quickly begins to melt 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:29.969
 only one month after the impact this is the aspect that the 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.969
 earth under his rock steam shroud 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.930
 a single collision with an asteroid 500 kilometers in diameter and we have left 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.930
 a single drop of water on the entire planet 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:05.240
 When that event occurred, it must have been established as a way of life 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.979
 of the surface of the globe 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:08.180
 and yet 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.180
 We are here 

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:22.280
 but after a year 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.309
 the rock vapor dissipated 

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:27.309
 and the temperature began to decrease progressively 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.680
 two thousand years later the water evaporated from the oceans finally returned to 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.960
 condense in the form of rains and fell on the leg at a rate of 3 thousand 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.960
 millimeters per year 

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:52.519
 These precipitations are as torrential as those of our zones 

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:56.059
 tropical were the food of the oceanic vessels 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.400
 at that precise moment far below the ocean floor numerous 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.030
 microorganisms are still surviving and among them our first 

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:07.490
 ancestors
