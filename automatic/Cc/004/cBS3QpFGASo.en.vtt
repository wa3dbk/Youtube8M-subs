00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.960 
few shows that were still left in this
season<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.040> around<00:01:05.309> September

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
season because this was around September

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.690 
season because this was around September
around<00:01:06.479> late<00:01:06.810> September<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.830> season<00:01:08.580> was

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
around late September which season was

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.399 
around late September which season was
always<00:01:08.939> done<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.960> there<00:01:10.110> weren't<00:01:10.229> too<00:01:10.380> many

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
always done so there weren't too many

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
always done so there weren't too many
shows<00:01:10.740> left<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.119> one<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.540> was

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
shows left so there was one that was

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.920 
shows left so there was one that was
like<00:01:13.200> three<00:01:13.950> weeks<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.280> believe<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.720> was

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
like three weeks I believe and it was

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
like three weeks I believe and it was
like<00:01:16.110> an<00:01:16.259> 8<00:01:16.500> hour<00:01:16.710> drive<00:01:17.040> from<00:01:17.070> where<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> live

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
like an 8 hour drive from where I live

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.789 
like an 8 hour drive from where I live
so<00:01:17.909> obviously<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.049> can't<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.530> was<00:01:19.680> too

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
so obviously we can't do that I was too

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.789 
so obviously we can't do that I was too
far<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.479> after<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.900> 8-hour<00:01:22.470> Drive

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
far and the one after that 8-hour Drive

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.490 
far and the one after that 8-hour Drive
competition<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:23.759> provincials<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.290> did

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
competition was provincials which I did

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.800 
competition was provincials which I did
not<00:01:25.530> qualify<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.549> because<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
not qualify for because you have to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.170 
not qualify for because you have to
place<00:01:28.049> 1<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.439> 5<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.860> regional<00:01:29.220> show<00:01:29.430> first<00:01:30.030> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
place 1 to 5 in a regional show first to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
place 1 to 5 in a regional show first to
qualify<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.600> provincials<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.400> one

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
qualify for provincials and then the one

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.230 
qualify for provincials and then the one
after<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.850> was<00:01:34.070> was<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> show<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.700> Windsor<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
after that was was a show in Windsor it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.870 
after that was was a show in Windsor it
was<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> four-hour<00:01:37.380> drive<00:01:37.500> from<00:01:38.430> where<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> live

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
was a four-hour drive from where I live

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
was a four-hour drive from where I live
which<00:01:39.030> wasn't<00:01:39.270> too<00:01:39.540> bad<00:01:39.720> compared<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.350> 8

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
which wasn't too bad compared to the 8

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.219 
which wasn't too bad compared to the 8
hour<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> decided<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.810> would<00:01:42.840> sign<00:01:43.110> up

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
hour one so I decided I would sign up

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.010 
hour one so I decided I would sign up
for<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.500> show<00:01:43.799> from<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.540> 8

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
for that show from there on I was like 8

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.590 
for that show from there on I was like 8
to<00:01:46.229> 9<00:01:46.409> weeks<00:01:46.649> out<00:01:46.920> which<00:01:47.729> wasn't<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.329> whole<00:01:48.570> lot

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
to 9 weeks out which wasn't a whole lot

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
to 9 weeks out which wasn't a whole lot
of<00:01:48.990> time<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.259> prep<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.310> enough

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
of time to prep but it was just enough

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.420 
of time to prep but it was just enough
because<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.820> liked<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.939> stay<00:01:51.270> fairly<00:01:52.049> lean

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
because I liked to stay fairly lean

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.249 
because I liked to stay fairly lean
throughout<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> year<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.060> was<00:01:54.299> during

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
throughout the year and this was during

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.319 
throughout the year and this was during
summer<00:01:55.560> saw<00:01:55.920> during<00:01:56.520> summer<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.850> usually<00:01:57.149> stay

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
summer saw during summer I usually stay

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.289 
summer saw during summer I usually stay
pretty<00:01:57.659> lean<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.369> wasn't<00:01:59.549> too<00:01:59.939> big<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.210> an

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
pretty lean so this wasn't too big of an

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.319 
pretty lean so this wasn't too big of an
issue<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.600> me<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:01.740> biggest<00:02:01.979> issue<00:02:02.399> was

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
issue for me my biggest issue was

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.120 
issue for me my biggest issue was

felt like I wasn't dark enough compared

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.649 
felt like I wasn't dark enough compared
to<00:02:36.069> other<00:02:36.340> guys<00:02:36.579> I<00:02:36.609> feel<00:02:36.849> like<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.060> came<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.420> more
