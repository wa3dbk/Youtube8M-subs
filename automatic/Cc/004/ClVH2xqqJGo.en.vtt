00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.809 
about just the whole rush part I know
our<00:02:24.799> creator<00:02:25.099> was<00:02:25.280> like<00:02:25.430> yeah<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:25.670> know

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
our creator was like yeah you know

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.190 
our creator was like yeah you know
there's<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.060> band<00:02:26.239> called<00:02:26.420> Rush<00:02:26.659> and<00:02:26.840> hopefully

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
there's a band called Rush and hopefully

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.420 
there's a band called Rush and hopefully
that<00:02:27.319> doesn't<00:02:27.500> clash<00:02:27.829> or<00:02:28.040> anything<00:02:28.159> like<00:02:28.370> that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
that doesn't clash or anything like that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.550 
that doesn't clash or anything like that
but<00:02:28.819> this<00:02:29.659> is<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.840> little<00:02:29.989> different<00:02:30.470> like

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
but this is a little different like

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.309 
but this is a little different like
big-time<00:02:30.769> Rolling<00:02:31.250> Stones<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.900> might<00:02:33.140> be<00:02:33.290> a

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
big-time Rolling Stones that might be a

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.750 
big-time Rolling Stones that might be a
little<00:02:33.500> more<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.829> a<00:02:33.860> conflict<00:02:34.189> of<00:02:34.310> interest<00:02:34.640> so

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
little more of a conflict of interest so

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.280 
little more of a conflict of interest so
you<00:02:34.819> have<00:02:34.939> a<00:02:34.970> big<00:02:35.090> time<00:02:35.269> rush<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:36.049> think

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
you have a big time rush like I think

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.449 
you have a big time rush like I think
it's<00:02:36.470> go<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.620> don't<00:02:36.799> think<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.069> ever<00:02:37.220> mind

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
it's go I don't think that ever mind

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.580 
it's go I don't think that ever mind
hopefully<00:02:38.120> we<00:02:38.329> do<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> good<00:02:38.930> enough<00:02:39.109> job<00:02:39.170> that

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
hopefully we do a good enough job that

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.259 
hopefully we do a good enough job that
they<00:02:39.680> kind<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.069> are<00:02:40.159> completely<00:02:40.760> different

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
they kind of are completely different

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.490 
they kind of are completely different
