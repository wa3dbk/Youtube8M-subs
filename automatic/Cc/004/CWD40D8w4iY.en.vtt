think in a week it felt it feels a lot

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.690 
think in a week it felt it feels a lot
longer<00:00:17.840> but<00:00:18.710> so<00:00:19.070> that's<00:00:19.130> kind<00:00:19.369> of<00:00:19.400> right<00:00:19.520> home

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
longer but so that's kind of right home

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.670 
longer but so that's kind of right home
but<00:00:19.939> no<00:00:20.119> I<00:00:20.390> just<00:00:20.660> finished<00:00:20.960> watching<00:00:21.080> Street

actually I actually think he deserves it

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.599 
actually I actually think he deserves it
because<00:00:27.320> that<00:00:27.439> hardflip<00:00:27.949> at<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.220> end<00:00:28.340> I<00:00:28.460> don't

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
because that hardflip at the end I don't

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.400 
because that hardflip at the end I don't

park is now but unless I mean it's
pretty<00:01:32.960> fun<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.410> there's<00:01:34.130> only<00:01:34.250> this<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.670> like

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
pretty fun and there's only this is like

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.760 
pretty fun and there's only this is like
the<00:01:34.880> only<00:01:35.030> spot<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.900> park<00:01:36.140> I<00:01:36.290> mean<00:01:36.470> it's<00:01:36.590> just

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
the only spot the park I mean it's just

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.430 
the only spot the park I mean it's just
um<00:01:37.040> just<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.970> one<00:01:38.180> spot<00:01:38.510> park<00:01:38.960> it's<00:01:39.110> not<00:01:39.260> like<00:01:39.350> a

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
um just a one spot park it's not like a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.810 
um just a one spot park it's not like a
whole<00:01:39.650> skate<00:01:39.950> park<00:01:40.190> with<00:01:40.340> everything<00:01:40.670> else

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
whole skate park with everything else

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.060 
whole skate park with everything else
that's<00:01:41.090> all<00:01:41.210> it's<00:01:41.870> basically<00:01:42.290> all<00:01:42.500> it<00:01:42.650> is<00:01:42.770> and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
that's all it's basically all it is and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.920 
that's all it's basically all it is and
I<00:01:43.190> think<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:43.460> just<00:01:43.700> took<00:01:43.880> my<00:01:43.940> used<00:01:44.690> reference

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
I think I just took my used reference

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.260 
I think I just took my used reference
photos<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.650> actually<00:01:45.920> create<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.340> park<00:01:46.580> so<00:01:47.240> I

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
photos to actually create the park so I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.060 
photos to actually create the park so I
tried<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.600> make<00:01:47.870> it<00:01:48.020> actually<00:01:48.230> as<00:01:48.530> possible

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
tried to make it actually as possible

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.940 
tried to make it actually as possible
but<00:01:49.250> I<00:01:49.610> don't<00:01:50.600> I<00:01:50.720> felt<00:01:51.380> like<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.680> wasn't

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
but I don't I felt like it wasn't

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.630 
but I don't I felt like it wasn't
necessary<00:01:52.400> to<00:01:52.750> remake<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.960> again<00:01:54.050> so<00:01:54.740> yeah

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
necessary to remake it again so yeah

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.360 
necessary to remake it again so yeah
there's<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.650> what<00:01:57.650> else<00:01:57.830> is<00:01:58.040> there<00:01:58.190> to

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
there's that and what else is there to

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.399 
there's that and what else is there to
talk<00:01:58.400> about<00:01:58.820> I'm<00:01:59.090> trying<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.510> thank<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.930> well

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979
