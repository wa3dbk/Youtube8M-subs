much if you want to be still so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.630 
much if you want to be still so
basically<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.750> I've<00:00:30.869> done<00:00:31.140> here<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
basically what I've done here is it this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.180 
basically what I've done here is it this
this<00:00:33.149> thing<00:00:33.180> acts<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> X<00:00:34.710> pretty<00:00:35.040> much

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
this thing acts like a X pretty much

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 
this thing acts like a X pretty much
like<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> screw<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.360> when<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.600> put<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> stock

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
like a screw so when you put the stock

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.760 
like a screw so when you put the stock
in<00:00:38.000> you<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.300> screw<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.620> it's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
in you can screw it up I know it's

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.119 
in you can screw it up I know it's
pretty<00:00:41.340> noobish<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.530> that's<00:00:43.530> how<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.920> it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
pretty noobish but that's how I do it

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.299 
pretty noobish but that's how I do it
that's<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:45.059> way<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.510> thinking<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:49.309> anyways

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
that's my way of thinking so anyways

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.130 
that's my way of thinking so anyways
this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.390> pretty<00:00:51.600> much<00:00:51.719> acts<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
this is this pretty much acts like a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.170 
this is this pretty much acts like a
screw<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.680> I'll<00:00:53.460> show<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.820> I've<00:00:53.969> done

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
screw and I'll show you what I've done

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.650 
screw and I'll show you what I've done
here<00:00:55.520> so<00:00:56.520> I've<00:00:56.760> actually<00:00:57.120> done<00:00:59.239> we<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.449> take

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
here so I've actually done we just take

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.130 
here so I've actually done we just take
this<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:01.079> I've<00:01:01.320> actually<00:01:02.010> done<00:01:02.780> two<00:01:03.780> holes

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
this out I've actually done two holes

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.810 
this out I've actually done two holes
over<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> use<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.600> them

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820

need to wait for them to dry so need
patience<00:01:31.920> will<00:01:32.070> discuss<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> slowly

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
patience will discuss so you slowly

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.340 
patience will discuss so you slowly
screw<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.079> then<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:38.299> you<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.840> pod

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
screw it and then as you as a pod

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.639 
screw it and then as you as a pod
becomes<00:01:40.680> bigger<00:01:41.540> you<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.750> get<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> bigger

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
becomes bigger you just get a bigger

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.700 
becomes bigger you just get a bigger
screwdriver<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.990> screw<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.320> then<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
screwdriver and screw it in and then the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.590 
screwdriver and screw it in and then the
last<00:01:46.890> thing<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.250> used<00:01:48.110> was<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.380> pencil<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.600> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
last thing I used was the pencil so the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.940 
last thing I used was the pencil so the
last<00:01:51.750> thing<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.020> used<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:54.140> when<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> run<00:01:55.710> this

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
last thing I used and when you run this

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
last thing I used and when you run this
up<00:01:56.189> make<00:01:56.430> sure<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.880> perfect<00:02:00.390> size<00:02:00.630> for

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
up make sure that it's perfect size for

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.080 
up make sure that it's perfect size for
the<00:02:01.020> whole<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.520> too<00:02:02.700> tight<00:02:02.909> that's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the whole so it's not too tight that's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.920 
the whole so it's not too tight that's
what<00:02:03.270> she<00:02:03.450> said<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.250> it's<00:02:05.250> not<00:02:05.520> too<00:02:05.869> not<00:02:06.869> too

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
what she said and it's not too not too

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.320 
what she said and it's not too not too
small<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
small for the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.940 
small for the
for<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> whole<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:12.840> you'll<00:02:13.840> need<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.530> fit

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
for the whole so you'll need it to fit

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.330 
for the whole so you'll need it to fit
in<00:02:15.130> just<00:02:15.209> right<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:20.080> need<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.500> be<00:02:20.620> able<00:02:20.800> to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
in just right and you need to be able to

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.940 
in just right and you need to be able to
film<00:02:21.700> from<00:02:22.000> both<00:02:22.240> sides<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.890> it

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
film from both sides like that so it

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.199 
film from both sides like that so it
comes<00:02:27.130> through<00:02:27.900> from<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.989> other<00:02:29.140> side<00:02:30.209> so

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
comes through from the other side so

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.250 
comes through from the other side so
that's<00:02:31.510> my<00:02:32.319> update<00:02:32.650> from<00:02:33.340> there<00:02:34.050> if<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.170> guys

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
that's my update from there if you guys

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.069 
that's my update from there if you guys
enjoyed<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.680> by
