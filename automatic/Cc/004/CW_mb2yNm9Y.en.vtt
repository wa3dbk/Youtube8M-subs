exposure chances are you going to get a
very<00:00:17.100> wobbly<00:00:17.430> picture<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.230> like<00:00:19.470> heavy

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
very wobbly picture now I like heavy

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.370 
very wobbly picture now I like heavy
tripods<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:21.029> heavier<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.900> better<00:00:22.080> as

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
tripods the heavier it is the better as

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.529 
tripods the heavier it is the better as
far<00:00:22.529> as<00:00:22.590> I'm<00:00:22.800> concerned<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.850> Manfrotto<00:00:24.390> is

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
far as I'm concerned this Manfrotto is

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.300 
far as I'm concerned this Manfrotto is
made<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.840> aluminium<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.500> actually<00:00:26.189> it's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
made of aluminium and actually it's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.189 
made of aluminium and actually it's
probably<00:00:26.400> half<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> weight<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:28.080> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
probably half the weight of the one that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.839 
probably half the weight of the one that
I<00:00:28.260> carry<00:00:28.619> around<00:00:28.710> even<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> light<00:00:29.460> lighter

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
I carry around even the light lighter

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.810 
I carry around even the light lighter
weight<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.269> my<00:00:30.390> two<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.859> reason<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.399> heavy

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
weight of my two the reason I like heavy

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.970 
weight of my two the reason I like heavy
is<00:00:33.000> because<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> keeps<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.989> well<00:00:34.200> planted<00:00:34.829> on

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
is because it keeps it well planted on

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
is because it keeps it well planted on
the<00:00:35.130> ground<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.910> don't<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.360> your<00:00:36.450> tripod<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the ground you don't want your tripod to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.869 
the ground you don't want your tripod to
wobble<00:00:37.320> look<00:00:37.649> if<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.950> stick<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.250> down<00:00:38.399> there

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
wobble look if I stick that down there

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.690 
wobble look if I stick that down there
put<00:00:39.360> my<00:00:39.420> hand<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> top<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.469> look<00:00:41.129> it's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
put my hand on the top and look it's

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.549 
put my hand on the top and look it's
next<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> no<00:00:42.180> movement<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.780> tripod

it<00:03:19.700> because<00:03:20.359> as<00:03:20.510> soon<00:03:20.599> as<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.840> walk<00:03:20.989> away<00:03:21.169> from

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
it because as soon as I walk away from

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.039 
it because as soon as I walk away from
the<00:03:21.560> monopod<00:03:22.690> it's<00:03:23.690> going<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.870> fall<00:03:24.019> over

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
the monopod it's going to fall over

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.140 
the monopod it's going to fall over
isn't<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:25.160> me<00:03:25.280> that's<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.609> bit<00:03:25.730> pointless

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
isn't it to me that's a bit pointless

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.909 
isn't it to me that's a bit pointless
I'm<00:03:26.419> afraid<00:03:27.849> now<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.870> other<00:03:30.079> part<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
I'm afraid now the other part of the

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.069 
I'm afraid now the other part of the
whole<00:03:31.069> tripod<00:03:31.639> camera<00:03:31.940> stability<00:03:32.630> thing<00:03:32.930> is

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
whole tripod camera stability thing is

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.650 
whole tripod camera stability thing is
the<00:03:33.919> head<00:03:34.190> tripods<00:03:34.940> come<00:03:35.120> in<00:03:35.239> two<00:03:35.389> parts

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
the head tripods come in two parts

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.199 
the head tripods come in two parts
you've<00:03:36.319> got<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.650> legs<00:03:36.889> and<00:03:37.280> you've<00:03:37.880> also<00:03:38.030> got

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
you've got the legs and you've also got

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.390 
you've got the legs and you've also got
the<00:03:38.750> head<00:03:39.019> now<00:03:39.680> here's<00:03:40.549> one<00:03:40.760> over<00:03:40.940> here<00:03:42.400> it's

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the head now here's one over here it's

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.770 
the head now here's one over here it's
worth<00:03:43.519> taking<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.940> bit<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.209> look<00:03:44.389> at<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
worth taking a bit of a look at the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.539 
worth taking a bit of a look at the
tripod<00:03:45.230> heads<00:03:45.470> you're<00:03:45.919> going<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:46.130> spend<00:03:46.370> about

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
tripod heads you're going to spend about

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.159 
tripod heads you're going to spend about
the<00:03:46.609> same<00:03:46.940> amount<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.329> money<00:03:47.480> on<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.690> head<00:03:47.989> as

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
the same amount of money on a head as

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.550 
the same amount of money on a head as
you<00:03:48.290> probably<00:03:48.530> will<00:03:48.829> on<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.220> tripod<00:03:49.700> itself

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
you probably will on the tripod itself

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.960 
you probably will on the tripod itself
first<00:03:51.560> thing<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:51.859> look<00:03:51.980> for<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.609> a

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
first thing to look for is a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.629 
first thing to look for is a
quick-release<00:03:53.299> plate<00:03:53.919> this<00:03:54.919> one<00:03:55.129> has<00:03:55.310> one<00:03:55.519> you

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
quick-release plate this one has one you

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.580 
quick-release plate this one has one you
press<00:03:55.970> that<00:03:56.120> down<00:03:56.329> put<00:03:56.599> a<00:03:56.660> little<00:03:56.870> spring

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
press that down put a little spring

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.680 
press that down put a little spring
forward<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.099> this<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.849> the<00:03:58.940> plate<00:03:59.180> comes<00:03:59.480> off

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
forward and this is the plate comes off

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.409 
forward and this is the plate comes off
then<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.739> can<00:04:00.889> screw<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.519> into<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.970> bottom

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
then you can screw that into the bottom

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.479 
then you can screw that into the bottom
of<00:04:02.540> your<00:04:02.599> camera<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:03.379> it's<00:04:03.500> permanently<00:04:04.099> fixed

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
of your camera so it's permanently fixed

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.670 
of your camera so it's permanently fixed
there<00:04:04.730> which<00:04:05.510> is<00:04:05.690> really<00:04:06.109> really<00:04:06.230> useful

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
there which is really really useful

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.770 
there which is really really useful
because<00:04:06.980> you're<00:04:07.549> out<00:04:07.730> taking<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:08.209> shot<00:04:08.449> this<00:04:08.660> is

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
because you're out taking a shot this is

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.119 
because you're out taking a shot this is
what<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:08.930> do<00:04:09.049> anyway<00:04:09.410> I'm<00:04:09.590> often<00:04:09.980> looking

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
what I do anyway I'm often looking

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.770 
what I do anyway I'm often looking
through<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.609> camera<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.150> lining<00:04:11.480> up<00:04:11.629> on

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
through the camera and lining up on

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.330 
through the camera and lining up on
taking<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.139> picture<00:04:12.440> of<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:12.919> like<00:04:13.069> this

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.819 
and then I'll move my tripod in
underneath<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.389> camera<00:04:17.660> and<00:04:18.079> it's<00:04:18.560> really

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
underneath the camera and it's really

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.770 
underneath the camera and it's really
easy<00:04:19.130> just<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:20.060> put<00:04:20.659> that<00:04:20.780> on<00:04:20.930> there

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780
