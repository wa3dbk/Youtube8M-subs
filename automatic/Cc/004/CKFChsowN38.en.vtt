00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello friends today I bring you a video 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.119
 different in this video we're going to see the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.350
 coloration and discoloration process 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.720
 our friend claudia 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.880
 it looked a little weird the voice because I have 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.630
 a lot of flu and I have super covered the 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:24.039
 nose she is our friend claudia 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.720
 and is our victim I say our model 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.840
 good as you can see she has the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.500
 black hair was dyed that color 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.710
 about 11 to 12 months ago something 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.620
 and we in the black paint is 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.350
 very difficult to extract 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.079
 however it is not impossible and less 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.510
 because she had several months without 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.000
 do anything in the hair however 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.699
 then the black paint let's say it was 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.949
 going down according to growth ideas 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.610
 washing a little but not in your 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.610
 whole 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.910
 our friend claudia wants to be 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:09.760
 will give a California wicks in color 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:14.140
 turquoise like these girls 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:17.350
 as we know turquoise is a color is 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.290
 a color that although many could say 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.750
 which is blue because it comes more from the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.580
 range of green is a green let's say 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.980
 washed away 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.810
 what we are going to use to do this 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.380
 process is as always our bowl 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.140
 our pallet our gloves yo 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.350
 I used the stick to bleach 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.430
 which his parasol and I also used the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.600
 peroxide 30 volumes of the strain 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.390
 and our cool tint in green tone and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.660
 we know that this tone if we dilute it with 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.950
 conditioner we can achieve that color 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.500
 turquoise we want and good we start 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.479
 with the procedure the first thing that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.290
 we have to do is make a kind 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.530
 of crepe from points upwards so that 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.350
 the hair that is down to the bottom is what 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.950
 that we are going to bleach and stay more 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.560
 degraded effect that we seek this 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.290
 we will do it for all the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.280
 hair until the whole head is left 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.590
 completely fluffed 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.600
 the truth is going to entangle a little bit of the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.130
 hair but good using a lot 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.520
 conditioner we will be able to 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.069
 develop very easy then then 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.350
 well you have to do this for all 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.319
 hair we repeat the process over and over 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.140
 you can do it with a brush 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.600
 crepe like the one I 'm occupying or with 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.020
 a comb although good at best with the 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.020
 comb take a little longer but from 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.950
 which can then once we 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.110
 all the hair with crepe and very very 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.090
 fluffy 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.990
 now it is time to start 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.140
 apply the discoloration 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.960
 as you can see I only apply it in 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.180
 the part that is of sunred adita and not 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.070
 in everything we did crepe only 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.830
 on the bottom of the hair of 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.590
 our friend claudia so that 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.569
 degraded and there are some claritas parts and 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.879
 dark and so 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.099
 then we are going to do this for everything 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.489
 the hair remembers that you have to use 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.829
 the opaque part of aluminum foil 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.580
 to close the packets where we are going to 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.200
 put the hair with decolorizing 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.330
 the way I am 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.150
 doing 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.800
 You must use gloves to me 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.410
 they forgot and then I had to 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.330
 put some plastic bags but it 's 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.950
 very important that you cover your hands 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.010
 because apart from that you're working 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.710
 with chemicals you can get stained and 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.800
 irritate and we do not want that 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.440
 the end result is not as expected 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.640
 it was precisely the blond platinum that 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.390
 we wanted but we stayed this blonde 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.520
 coppery with some golden sparkles 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.850
 when to apply a cute 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:16.480
 turquoise it is necessary that we have a 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.350
 platinum tone a blond platinum like 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.180
 this 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.989
 so that the color takes hold 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.090
 turquoise 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.520
 what is this 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.810
 and actually this good tone happened that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.990
 we got in theory it was like I tell them a 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.420
 Copper blond 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.420
 to what applying the turquoise took us 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:42.880
 a kind of greenish tone 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.880
 here you can see as an event 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:51.920
 and how do you apply the dye 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:54.139
 if you put turquoise dye on it 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:59.249
 yellowish hair 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:00.930
 or reddish is we get a greenish color 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.979
 like this 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.790
 a moment what is more to your side as 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.970
 the one they wanted 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.490
 however on this same tone we 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:17.710
 there is a blue tint we apply a cute 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:23.110
 directly color blue a purple a 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:25.270
 agent a dark green a red even and 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.910
 there are several shades that we grab would make 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.210
 very well in this tone this is the photo 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.430
 of the final result as you can see it 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.380
 go green and here is our friend 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.310
 Claudia already after a few days with the 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.310
 washed out tone 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.930
 but that the lack is not reached 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.240
 distinguish the tones very well but 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.720
 let's say it was a green light with a 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.720
 little darker green more or less 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.880
 as you can see in the photo and 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.960
 here after this picture I'm going to put 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.300
 some examples of a tone similar to 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.260
 that the one that we had the turquoise font 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:13.090
 clarito at his side is the background turning 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.090
 more greenish like these 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.200
 finally the tone was the most 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.530
 similar to what we were looking for but it was not 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.980
 exactly in tone that we wanted and then 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:30.670
 that would be all of the video I hope that you 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.740
