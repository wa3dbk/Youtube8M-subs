very small and i think that the

very small and i think that the

domestically<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.739> will<00:02:59.040> continue<00:02:59.790> to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
domestically and this will continue to

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.660 
domestically and this will continue to
challenge<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.810> some<00:03:01.049> degree<00:03:01.230> also<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.890> european

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
challenge to some degree also a european

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.220

their the growth of the middle class
that's<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.250> way<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.489> going<00:03:09.290> absolutely<00:03:10.290> so

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
that's the way it's going absolutely so

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.860 
that's the way it's going absolutely so
but<00:03:10.829> for<00:03:11.370> me<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.640> main<00:03:11.849> issue<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.720> which

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
but for me the main issue is to which

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.199 
but for me the main issue is to which
degree<00:03:13.079> china<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.829> going<00:03:14.159> to<00:03:14.340> rebalance<00:03:14.790> its

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
economy will also would like to

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.270 
economy will also would like to
rebalance<00:04:49.700> okay<00:04:50.860> let<00:04:51.860> me<00:04:51.919> bring<00:04:52.040> Jonathan

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280

holes<00:04:52.580> like<00:04:52.790> back<00:04:53.360> into<00:04:54.290> this<00:04:54.440> I<00:04:54.650> mean<00:04:54.770> there

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
holes like back into this I mean there

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.490 
holes like back into this I mean there
there<00:04:55.160> is<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.340> premium<00:04:56.180> on<00:04:56.360> on<00:04:56.810> a<00:04:56.840> European

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
there is a premium on on a European

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.680 
there is a premium on on a European
brand<00:04:58.070> if<00:04:58.370> if<00:04:58.550> that's<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:59.120> trend<00:04:59.330> that<00:04:59.450> grows

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
brand if if that's a trend that grows

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.530 
brand if if that's a trend that grows
would<00:04:59.900> that<00:05:00.020> change<00:05:00.229> your<00:05:00.350> opinion<00:05:01.510> well<00:05:02.510> I

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
would that change your opinion well I

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.659 
would that change your opinion well I
think<00:05:02.720> what<00:05:03.290> is<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.800> most<00:05:04.010> important

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
think what is the most important

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.960 
think what is the most important
challenge<00:05:04.970> for<00:05:05.750> European<00:05:06.290> and<00:05:06.790> markets<00:05:07.790> for

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
challenge for European and markets for

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.879 
challenge for European and markets for
European<00:05:08.419> society<00:05:08.930> is<00:05:09.020> not<00:05:09.229> so<00:05:09.440> much<00:05:09.650> whether

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
European society is not so much whether

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.190 
European society is not so much whether
we<00:05:10.130> sell<00:05:10.520> products<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.210> China<00:05:11.510> but<00:05:11.750> whether<00:05:11.990> we

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
we sell products to China but whether we

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.200 
we sell products to China but whether we
will<00:05:12.380> also<00:05:12.740> be<00:05:12.919> able<00:05:13.220> to<00:05:13.370> keep<00:05:13.639> some<00:05:13.910> of<00:05:14.060> the

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
will also be able to keep some of the

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.120 
will also be able to keep some of the
production<00:05:14.810> activities<00:05:15.380> in<00:05:15.620> Europe<00:05:15.979> I<00:05:16.100> think

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
production activities in Europe I think

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.629 
production activities in Europe I think
that<00:05:17.030> basically<00:05:17.630> the<00:05:18.260> issue<00:05:18.380> is<00:05:18.770> in<00:05:19.430> that

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
that basically the issue is in that

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.450 
that basically the issue is in that
regard<00:05:20.030> that<00:05:20.260> European<00:05:21.280> companies<00:05:22.280> are

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
regard that European companies are

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.490 
regard that European companies are
increasingly<00:05:22.640> asked<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:23.780> demanded<00:05:24.350> to

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
increasingly asked and demanded to

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.740 
increasingly asked and demanded to
relocate<00:05:25.370> part<00:05:25.669> of<00:05:25.789> the<00:05:25.880> production<00:05:26.090> to<00:05:26.720> China

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
relocate part of the production to China

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.170 
relocate part of the production to China
if<00:05:27.320> they<00:05:27.530> want<00:05:27.770> to<00:05:27.890> become<00:05:28.220> part<00:05:28.490> of<00:05:28.700> the

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
if they want to become part of the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.779 
if they want to become part of the
burgeoning<00:05:29.720> Chinese<00:05:30.289> market<00:05:30.860> so<00:05:31.340> all<00:05:31.520> in<00:05:31.669> all

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
burgeoning Chinese market so all in all

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.880 
burgeoning Chinese market so all in all
a<00:05:31.850> lot<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.300> companies<00:05:32.840> are<00:05:33.050> making<00:05:33.200> profits

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
a lot of companies are making profits

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.460 
a lot of companies are making profits
but<00:05:34.100> returns<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:35.000> European<00:05:35.539> societies<00:05:36.200> in

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
but returns to European societies in
