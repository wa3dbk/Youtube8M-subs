 is mobotix I know mothers 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:14.599
 do not say otherwise 2013 hannover 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.640
 here in germany it is terrible 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.040
 that's why we're in 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.170
 The hall is in hall 23 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.460
 intel has ridden properly before 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.740
 for us and from here drifted like 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.580
 By the way, even later we only have that 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.670
 old bock that is it panasonic x2 one 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.260
 the most compact and lightest age 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.830
 box are currently available 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.240
 the thing and victor 1150 grams 11.6 in 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:44.510
 13 66 x 768 is the resolution and we 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.970
 Let's go straight for the device 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.120
 in cheap kilo karimi exit two 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.620
 usb 3 0 we then have here in front 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.000
 Her on and off switch different 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.320
 status leds here could also be the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.390
 make volume control 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.390
 on the side we arrive at the wlan 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.360
 switch off connection via the headset for 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.070
 microphone sd cardreader vga output 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.520
 Internet connector and natural 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.159
 connection for the power supply what all 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.729
 exciting is next to the fact that that 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.850
 in the variants with cry 3 537 goes 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.880
 different ssds 128 starts 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.009
 By the way samsung ssds also gives a 256 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.450
 gigabyte drama is but now looks 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.609
 Here's where the battery is 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.069
 I've lost the battery 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.569
 Just funny enough rausgenommen there 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:32.179
 You see, that's a 30-watt-hour 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.799
 battery and it is still a 17 watt hours 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.959
 your built-in battery means that you can 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.979
 during operation simply the battery 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.439
 what I change a whole 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.329
 exciting history dollars as 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.249
 look at exciting story what too 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.119
 you are still very interesting here you see 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:46.599
 the mechanism 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.729
 we have that for the first time at the 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.259
 Lenovo Yoga Series Seen As You Can 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.499
 Just fold that thing backwards 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.539
 and could theoretically as 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:58.939
 use tablet as it can see here 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.279
 Of course, touchscreen as I said 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.630
 just under $ 2,000 is all the fun 

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:04.399
 is going on already 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.899
 available at your must come there 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.550

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.490

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.830

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.550
