00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
going to do is measure to find out where

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.469 
going to do is measure to find out where
to<00:00:45.250> put<00:00:45.699> the<00:00:46.420> ribbons<00:00:46.750> so<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:49.030> I<00:00:49.059> went<00:00:49.420> ahead

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
to put the ribbons so what I went ahead

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.859 
to put the ribbons so what I went ahead
it<00:00:49.690> did<00:00:49.870> was<00:00:50.170> take<00:00:50.830> the<00:00:51.159> two<00:00:51.369> pieces<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.330> I<00:00:52.629> put

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:52.869 
it did was take the two pieces and I put

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:54.630 
it did was take the two pieces and I put
them<00:00:53.019> right<00:00:53.170> sides<00:00:53.229> together<00:00:53.589> and<00:00:53.890> then<00:00:54.610> I

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
them right sides together and then I

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.079 
them right sides together and then I
pinned<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.119> on<00:00:55.269> one<00:00:55.780> of<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.320> short<00:00:56.769> ends<00:00:57.250> just

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
pinned it on one of the short ends just

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.630 
pinned it on one of the short ends just
so<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.390> way<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.659> stays<00:00:58.900> together<00:00:59.400> then<00:01:00.400> I'm

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
so that way it stays together then I'm

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.890 
so that way it stays together then I'm
going<00:01:00.909> to<00:01:00.970> measure<00:01:01.239> about<00:01:01.690> 5<00:01:02.110> inches<00:01:03.150> from<00:01:04.150> the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
going to measure about 5 inches from the

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.380 
going to measure about 5 inches from the
edge<00:01:05.049> and<00:01:05.530> I'm<00:01:06.040> going<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.250> have<00:01:06.430> that<00:01:06.580> 5<00:01:06.820> H<00:01:07.060> be

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
edge and I'm going to have that 5 H be

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.230 
edge and I'm going to have that 5 H be
right<00:01:07.659> in<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.049> middle<00:01:08.310> there<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:09.610> that's

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
right in the middle there and that's

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.760 
right in the middle there and that's
where<00:01:10.540> I'm<00:01:10.630> going<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.870> put<00:01:11.050> my<00:01:11.200> ribbon<00:01:11.560> and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
where I'm going to put my ribbon and

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.950 
where I'm going to put my ribbon and
this<00:01:12.220> ruin<00:01:12.580> you<00:01:12.820> know<00:01:12.940> is<00:01:13.120> long<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:13.630> those<00:01:13.810> all

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
this ruin you know is long so those all

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.630 
this ruin you know is long so those all
the<00:01:14.050> way<00:01:14.140> through<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.590> don't<00:01:15.100> really<00:01:15.310> want<00:01:15.550> it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
the way through I don't really want it

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.810 
the way through I don't really want it
to<00:01:15.760> do<00:01:15.940> that<00:01:16.150> so<00:01:16.540> I'm<00:01:16.750> probably<00:01:16.930> going<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.820> pin

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
to do that so I'm probably going to pin

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.040 
to do that so I'm probably going to pin
it<00:01:18.850> here<00:01:19.150> in<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.330> middle<00:01:19.450> I'm<00:01:19.690> going<00:01:19.750> to<00:01:19.900> have

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
it here in the middle I'm going to have

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.660 
it here in the middle I'm going to have
a<00:01:20.080> little<00:01:20.440> bit<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.590> like<00:01:20.830> a<00:01:20.860> half-inch<00:01:21.400> hang

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
a little bit of like a half-inch hang

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.880 
a little bit of like a half-inch hang
off<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.210> then<00:01:22.780> I'm<00:01:22.930> going<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.170> pin<00:01:23.410> it<00:01:23.440> here<00:01:23.740> in

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
off and then I'm going to pin it here in

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.730 
off and then I'm going to pin it here in
the<00:01:23.980> middle<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.430> it<00:01:24.580> doesn't<00:01:25.060> get<00:01:25.450> sewn<00:01:25.840> when<00:01:26.710> I

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
the middle so it doesn't get sewn when I

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.520 
the middle so it doesn't get sewn when I
go<00:01:27.040> through<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.490> sew<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.820> side<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:29.260> then<00:01:29.470> I'm

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
go through and sew the side and then I'm

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.130 
go through and sew the side and then I'm
going<00:01:29.620> to<00:01:29.680> do<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.920> same<00:01:30.130> thing<00:01:30.370> to<00:01:30.730> this<00:01:30.910> side

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
going to do the same thing to this side

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.190 
going to do the same thing to this side
I'm<00:01:32.140> going<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.410> measure<00:01:32.560> 5<00:01:33.330> inches<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.690> put

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.570 
I'm going to measure 5 inches and put
this<00:01:35.320> right<00:01:35.440> in<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.710> middle<00:01:35.980> so<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:39.400> then

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.810 
this right in the middle so and then
again<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:39.850> will<00:01:40.090> have<00:01:40.360> this<00:01:40.510> hang<00:01:40.840> off<00:01:41.110> about<00:01:41.820> an

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
again I will have this hang off about an

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.600 
again I will have this hang off about an
inch<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.390> half<00:01:43.510> an<00:01:43.630> inch<00:01:43.750> whatever<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:45.400> then<00:01:45.580> I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
will pin this in the middle so it

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.180 
will pin this in the middle so it
doesn't<00:01:48.790> get<00:01:49.000> caught<00:01:49.930> when<00:01:50.440> I'm<00:01:50.560> sewing<00:01:50.860> I

going to do now is I'm just going to sew
along<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:40.020> edge<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:41.930> might<00:02:42.930> need<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.140> press

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
along the edge I might need to press

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.350 
along the edge I might need to press
this<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.920> little<00:02:44.130> bit<00:02:44.370> with<00:02:44.520> my<00:02:44.700> iron<00:02:44.880> because

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
this a little bit with my iron because

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.800 
this a little bit with my iron because
it's<00:02:45.540> starting<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.990> curl<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:47.750> kind<00:02:48.750> of

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
it's starting to curl this is a kind of

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.880 
it's starting to curl this is a kind of
like<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.050> soft<00:02:49.620> cotton<00:02:51.230> maybe<00:02:52.230> maybe<00:02:52.680> almost

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
like a soft cotton maybe maybe almost

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.180 
like a soft cotton maybe maybe almost
like<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.190> flannel<00:02:54.110> but<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.260> very<00:02:55.500> soft<00:02:55.920> and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
like a flannel but it's very soft and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.710 
like a flannel but it's very soft and
that's<00:02:56.310> why<00:02:56.550> it's<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.360> kind<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.750> curling<00:02:58.170> so

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
that's why it's it's kind of curling so

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.650 
that's why it's it's kind of curling so
I'm<00:03:00.720> going<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.230> start<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.010> one<00:03:02.040> end<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.670> sew

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
I've right sided it out and I have one

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.300 
I've right sided it out and I have one
end<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:10.049> is<00:04:10.230> still<00:04:10.709> open

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
end that is still open

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.370 
end that is still open
everything<00:04:11.880> else<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.269> closed<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.230> can

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
everything else is closed and you can

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.870 
everything else is closed and you can
see<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.830> ties<00:04:14.930> hang<00:04:15.930> out<00:04:16.140> quite<00:04:16.500> nicely<00:04:16.880> now

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
see the ties hang out quite nicely now

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.580 
see the ties hang out quite nicely now
I'm<00:04:17.970> going<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.239> take<00:04:18.450> my<00:04:18.630> fiberfill<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.350> then

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
I'm going to take my fiberfill and then

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.370 
I'm going to take my fiberfill and then
I'm<00:04:19.739> just<00:04:19.950> going<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.400> stuff<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.299> like<00:04:22.290> a

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
I'm just going to stuff this like a

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
I'm just going to stuff this like a
pillow<00:04:23.870> now<00:04:24.870> I've<00:04:25.050> gone<00:04:25.200> ahead<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.560> slept<00:04:26.220> it

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
pillow now I've gone ahead and slept it

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.060 
pillow now I've gone ahead and slept it
with<00:04:26.550> my<00:04:26.729> fiber<00:04:26.970> filament

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
with my fiber filament

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.340 
with my fiber filament
I<00:04:28.130> used<00:04:28.430> quite<00:04:28.640> a<00:04:28.730> bit<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.090> bag<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:31.160> it's

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
I used quite a bit of the bag so it's

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.960 
I used quite a bit of the bag so it's
fluffy<00:04:33.350> but<00:04:33.650> it's<00:04:33.800> also<00:04:34.010> kind<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.550> flat

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
fluffy but it's also kind of flat

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.000 
fluffy but it's also kind of flat
because<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.750> know<00:04:35.870> your<00:04:36.050> seatbelt<00:04:36.410> flat<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:36.980> I

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
because you know your seatbelt flat so I

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.950 
because you know your seatbelt flat so I
just<00:04:37.310> figured<00:04:37.610> it'd<00:04:37.730> be<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:38.120> lot<00:04:38.570> easier<00:04:38.600> for

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
just figured it'd be a lot easier for

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.300 
just figured it'd be a lot easier for
the<00:04:39.620> straps<00:04:39.980> to<00:04:40.280> stay<00:04:41.650> if<00:04:42.650> this<00:04:42.920> is<00:04:43.100> something

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
the straps to stay if this is something

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.070 
the straps to stay if this is something
that's<00:04:43.520> light<00:04:43.790> but<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.030> mean<00:04:44.300> obviously<00:04:44.540> the

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
that's light but I mean obviously the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.800 
that's light but I mean obviously the
pillow<00:04:45.260> can<00:04:45.530> be<00:04:45.760> simulated<00:04:49.210> as<00:04:50.210> you're<00:04:50.510> using

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
pillow can be simulated as you're using

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.010 
pillow can be simulated as you're using
it<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.290> went<00:04:51.500> ahead<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:51.740> I<00:04:52.010> pinned<00:04:52.400> down<00:04:53.020> the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
it I went ahead and I pinned down the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.350 
it I went ahead and I pinned down the
end<00:04:54.170> that<00:04:54.440> I<00:04:54.470> need<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.790> can<00:04:56.000> hand

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
end that I need to so you can hand

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.550 
end that I need to so you can hand
stitch<00:04:56.480> this<00:04:56.810> you<00:04:57.020> can<00:04:57.170> run<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.410> through<00:04:57.440> your

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
stitch this you can run it through your

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.020 
stitch this you can run it through your
machine<00:04:57.950> because<00:04:58.100> you<00:04:58.280> can<00:04:58.460> move<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.700> batting

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
machine because you can move the batting

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.580 
machine because you can move the batting
around<00:04:59.120> I'm<00:04:59.840> going<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.260> run<00:05:00.350> it<00:05:00.440> through<00:05:00.530> my

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
around I'm going to run it through my

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.380 
around I'm going to run it through my
machine<00:05:00.980> obviously<00:05:01.250> taking<00:05:01.820> the<00:05:01.850> pins<00:05:02.090> out<00:05:02.240> as

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
machine obviously taking the pins out as

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.550 
machine obviously taking the pins out as
I<00:05:02.510> go

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
I go

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.690 
I go
but<00:05:04.550> either<00:05:04.940> way<00:05:05.150> works<00:05:05.600> fine<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.700> once

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
but either way works fine and once

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.190 
but either way works fine and once
you're<00:05:07.820> done<00:05:07.940> with<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.120> so<00:05:08.810> then<00:05:09.020> your

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
you're done with that so then your

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.290 
you're done with that so then your
pillow<00:05:09.410> is<00:05:09.590> ready<00:05:09.830> to<00:05:09.980> use<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.670> I<00:05:10.790> will<00:05:10.850> show

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
pillow is ready to use and I will show

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.520 
pillow is ready to use and I will show
you<00:05:11.330> what<00:05:11.540> it<00:05:11.630> looks<00:05:11.780> like<00:05:11.960> when<00:05:12.380> I'm<00:05:12.500> done

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
you what it looks like when I'm done

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.460 
you what it looks like when I'm done
okay<00:05:13.210> went<00:05:14.210> ahead<00:05:14.300> and<00:05:14.540> sewed<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.900> end<00:05:15.110> there

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
okay went ahead and sewed the end there

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.920 
okay went ahead and sewed the end there
and<00:05:15.710> now<00:05:16.520> as<00:05:16.880> you<00:05:17.060> can<00:05:17.210> see<00:05:17.270> that<00:05:17.630> pillow<00:05:17.840> is

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
and now as you can see that pillow is

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.170 
and now as you can see that pillow is
ready<00:05:18.440> for<00:05:18.680> use<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.580> only<00:05:19.790> other<00:05:19.940> thing<00:05:20.150> that

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
ready for use the only other thing that

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.210 
ready for use the only other thing that
I<00:05:20.390> should<00:05:20.690> mention<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.530> ends<00:05:21.920> of<00:05:22.070> your

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
I should mention is the ends of your

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.270 
I should mention is the ends of your
ribbon<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:23.570> may<00:05:23.780> want<00:05:24.140> to<00:05:24.230> fold<00:05:24.710> them<00:05:24.890> under

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
ribbon you may want to fold them under

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.530 
ribbon you may want to fold them under
and<00:05:25.520> do<00:05:26.270> a<00:05:26.300> quick<00:05:26.480> sew<00:05:26.810> through<00:05:28.060> across<00:05:29.060> just

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
and do a quick sew through across just

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.010 
and do a quick sew through across just
because<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:31.370> could<00:05:31.610> help<00:05:32.390> it<00:05:32.570> not<00:05:32.690> fray

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
because that could help it not fray

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.270 
because that could help it not fray
especially<00:05:33.560> if<00:05:33.650> you<00:05:33.740> throw<00:05:33.920> this<00:05:34.070> in<00:05:34.220> the

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
especially if you throw this in the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.310 
especially if you throw this in the
washing<00:05:34.490> machine<00:05:34.640> so<00:05:35.060> these<00:05:35.600> ends<00:05:35.900> will<00:05:36.050> fray

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
washing machine so these ends will fray

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.140 
washing machine so these ends will fray
unless<00:05:36.740> you<00:05:37.330> secure<00:05:38.330> them<00:05:38.510> down<00:05:40.000> people<00:05:41.000> have

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
unless you secure them down people have

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.600 
unless you secure them down people have
also<00:05:41.420> been<00:05:42.320> known<00:05:42.440> to<00:05:42.500> burn<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:43.040> engine<00:05:43.400> and

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
also been known to burn the engine and

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.870 
also been known to burn the engine and
edges<00:05:44.360> um<00:05:45.050> I<00:05:45.380> don't<00:05:45.800> do<00:05:45.980> that<00:05:46.160> I'll<00:05:46.670> probably

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
edges um I don't do that I'll probably

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.720 
edges um I don't do that I'll probably
so<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.510> end<00:05:47.660> but<00:05:47.990> know<00:05:48.950> that<00:05:48.980> that's<00:05:49.430> one

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
so the end but know that that's one

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.430 
so the end but know that that's one
extra<00:05:50.420> step<00:05:50.690> if<00:05:51.110> you<00:05:51.410> want<00:05:52.130> to<00:05:52.220> go<00:05:52.310> that<00:05:52.520> far

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
extra step if you want to go that far

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.560 
extra step if you want to go that far
now<00:05:54.440> to<00:05:54.470> show<00:05:54.860> you<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:55.220> pillow<00:05:55.580> in<00:05:55.850> action<00:05:56.360> as

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
now to show you the pillow in action as

now to show you the pillow in action as
you<00:05:57.380> can<00:05:57.560> see<00:05:57.740> it's<00:05:57.890> attached<00:05:58.570> on<00:05:59.570> one<00:05:59.630> side<00:06:00.230> is

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
you can see it's attached on one side is

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.500 
you can see it's attached on one side is
where<00:06:01.010> the<00:06:01.040> pillow<00:06:01.310> is<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.940> straps<00:06:02.240> come
