00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 if he returns to the physical part 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.210
 Imagine we had to make your first one open and all of them still 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.680
 some time in Brazil, but there are new findings in the south of the country. 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.469
 speaks that wants to talk next phase virtually missed the first 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.469
 humans 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.400
 this valley in the center of the rio grande do sul 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.550
 it's a window into the past 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.880
 along this road known as straw is opaque are discovered 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.420
 to understand how life on earth was to more than 200 million people. 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.379
 The most recent years have been headline around the world this week easy to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.600
 cat of the last one to clear even more in a team of dinosaurs 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.550
 is a well-preserved innovation in the salt found every one hundred years the goal is 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.570
 preserve your past does not interest me, it's so different 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.450
 this animal 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.440
 he was buried 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.620
 by a flood 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.080
 a few days after his death 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.160
 it was this fast burial event 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.530
 that allowed him to do 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.530
 this journey of 238 million years 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.409
 In perfect condition 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.630
 at the end of the match because 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.610
 They are finding it strange 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.360
 the northern roof were 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.440
 tutu the food chain the more timid creature to step on the surface of the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.220
 planet 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.820
 if I was 80 million years old 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.020
 before the tyrannosaurus rex 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.430
 people find it incredible time travel that makes the discoveries here in the south of 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.710
 Brazil so important 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 is that here the fossils found I am denying 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.600
 the transition link between reptiles 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.990
 and mammals 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.360
 the first step of an incredible process of evolution 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.399
 he is good until 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.399
 this week's creation 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.450
 Yes it would be up to you to unite to reproduce this incredible bug 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.550
 it's like alligator having parts over body 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.210
 six to eight feet in length almost a ton of weight 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.850
 Algiers 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.589
 and with a relentless bite 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.989
 in Germany also holder 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.059
 I'm also about a 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.679
 six or eight cents 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.009
 of lenght 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:21.479
 is a power factor this should very powerful in the retina 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.209
 resident in the form of rainwater 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.039
 and are neither concentrated on the edge 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.369
 if you look at that if you will see a recurring ringworm on the border as well 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.579
 financially 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.019
 the action would be to allow those residents 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.730
 penetrate into the duct including the bony tissue of precar wheels 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.869
 correct neiro a flood took a bridge and killing six people 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.110
 but the flood that caused the tragedy also dropped and sediments of the terrain 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.270
 in the municipality of dona francisca where other countries had already been found 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.930
 the eyes of the paleontologist Sergio Cabreira 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.719
 was revealed by the waters 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.219
 this part to which it was exposed 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.769
 Maria appeared that we got that job 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.419
 the contraband they were discovering whole skeleton that was protected with 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.549
 This one goes up to be taken from the laboratory. A quick explanation shows how 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.709
 place and full of treasures 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.499
 viseu 31 years is a fragment 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:27.129
 on one side and a rib that belonged 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.129
 there is a vertebrate that lived here 238 million 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.729
 asked about life in the time that passed from our 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.659
 trying to print the material 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.819
 by formula 1 we also stayed here as we as government and as a 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.849
 act of love a kind of shielding of the spine a protection 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.829
 As for the bites of the enemies I will confirm the serve to defeat by 2 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.360
 1 74 dollars in front of other races even greater this abundance of smoke 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:02.559
 expelled because here was beside the artist 850 million years 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:05.579
 so far had only the accident numbers 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.669
 I do not know 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:11.739
 in the center of it where today is Brazil there was a huge greater desert than 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.329
 any that ever existed 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.150
 how many continent began to separate the climate dramatically changed the 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.289
 South of Brazil has become the most suitable place for animal life 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.729
 more 238 million years in the Triassic period with this agreement before 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.589
 dominated in this region they fed on the herds of herbivores 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:36.839
 In the Cretaceous, dinosaurs spread throughout the territory 

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.249
 to become brazil 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.969
 the ground literally trembled when the biggest of them all passed the 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.009
 titanosaur was over 14 meters long 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:50.900
 the most feared carnivore of the summer season the spiny dinosaur 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:58.099
 those of the ivory commanded by the flying reptiles. 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.679
 which ensures everything was covered by a large layer of volcanic rock 

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:07.690
 dozens of Minas Gerais cities from the ancestral river before a shop 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.779
 event cancellation 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:14.689
 we are well delineated - it is a proof of the fuvest moods of the dinosaurs 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.259
 ancient of the world 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.930
 the last resort brasilia - brazil is the country of all 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.969
 the others in the balance 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:26.539
 bruni means southern cruise he was small the size of a dog 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.030
 his favorite prey is a health risk and fed himself bands show and 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.639
 common in the region 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.639
 Just like the driver said. 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.030
 here in this regard 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.680
 in acute a few kilometers from the other 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.960
 a rarity was found 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.830
 it's gonna be awesome 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.590
 much with nine cities all probably reserved by landslide 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.659
 and deforestation 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.020
 there are several places here in the region 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.690
 in which the lows of the triassic period the lighthouse and each place has 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.220
 different characteristics of both the geological formation and the type of 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.560
 fossils found in this one for example predominate the easy ones of teaching 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.740
 of the type Dantesque scene to say inside a car and it is precisely this vertebrate 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.520
 which already had characteristics later found of mammals 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.630
 pressed before they had the brain much bigger than the animals of the same party 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:26.110
 scientists believe they were already warm-blooded animals 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.080
 but it was still missing once 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.889
 the national museum of rio de janeiro 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.719
 every discovery is received with enthusiasm 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:37.099
 is certain that the identity of the nation is being erected 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.460
 wonderful posts with lots of information having been discovered in the 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.229
 over the last ten years 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.960
 that leads to believing that yes and the researches were intensified as each 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.740
 because it is a number that is found by the little boys who play in 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.159
 excavations but apparently in the process of launching the research estimate 

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:02.219
 For you have already decided what it is you will be when you grow up to calm the 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.769
 Brazil will need these talents blood of many investments to 

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:09.769
 reveal the one that housed another is earned 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.889
