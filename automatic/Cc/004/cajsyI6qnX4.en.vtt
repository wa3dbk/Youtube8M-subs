00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.870
 4 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.359
 and what, of course, at one percent 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.189
 interesting and worth knowing 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:11.849
 the multitasking 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.589
 every 300 million 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.919
 Prof who went swimming and children 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.919
 all votes were opened 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.399
 from their income do not clarify whether this December 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.230
 that's just like Wells Fargo but also the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.859
 by Karsten RÃ¶bisch 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.609
 So now you can change a few very quickly 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.160
 without a long and how often 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.860
 Percent revised browser maker will pick three points to include 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.760
 from t 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.810
 to run your Flash version of reasons 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.480
 So it really looks very good from the caves of meat products conspiracy too 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.480
 very fluid 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.920
 HM Wuerselen 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.520
 annoying is that 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.890
 Naturally 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.070
 four times wm-gold we call the mobile web page calls 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.940
 in 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.390
 For example, on our side of course this could be anything 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.060
 optimized for smartphones optimized for small screens 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.180
 that's about it 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.030
 where can 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.090
 it's not quite as fast as semper-opera housework is spreading in the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.090
 Lift landscape mode 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.350
 that it already 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.740
 The historical from not so nice that you can not 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.050
 really switching 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.050
 if I'm being managed here 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.450
 when we come back 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.789
 but otherwise it is actually somehow much improved and a 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.500
 a bit overworked 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.400
 that is no comparison to take 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 Smartphone Browser 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.959
 Bookmarks 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.179
 more speed so totally okay 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.269
 Unfortunately the official version does not apply to a screen 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.649
 especially good is really a pity 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:42.289
 therefore you can of course take along alternative browsers like Opera so on 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.599
 Help create 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.949
 Euro that is 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.539
 also in the 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:49.179
 new browser
