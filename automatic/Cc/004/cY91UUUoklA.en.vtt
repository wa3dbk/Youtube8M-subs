green lamp pulls once you turn the power
on<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:23.160> get<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> those<00:00:23.730> little<00:00:23.910> face

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
on you get one of those little face

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.660 
on you get one of those little face
crawlers<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.930> stick<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.590> your<00:00:25.710> face<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.099> then

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
crawlers to stick to your face and then

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.939 
crawlers to stick to your face and then
go<00:00:27.660> underneath<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.109> lamp<00:00:28.289> pole<00:00:28.470> he'll<00:00:28.650> create

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
go underneath the lamp pole he'll create

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.440 
go underneath the lamp pole he'll create
a<00:00:29.189> hole<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:29.970> will<00:00:30.060> actually<00:00:30.179> create<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.869> a

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
a hole and it will actually create a a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.819 
a hole and it will actually create a a
supposed<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> war<00:00:33.960> /<00:00:34.140> or<00:00:34.260> some<00:00:34.440> shit<00:00:34.620> but

supposed to be a war / or some shit but
it<00:00:35.010> didn't<00:00:35.280> work<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.410> right

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
it didn't work so and you can see right

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.569 
it didn't work so and you can see right
here<00:00:37.620> i'm<00:00:37.710> staying<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.010> top<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.370> doesn't

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
here i'm staying on top and it doesn't

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.920 
here i'm staying on top and it doesn't
want<00:00:38.700> me<00:00:38.790> anywhere<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> ended<00:00:39.719> up

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
want me anywhere so what I ended up

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
want me anywhere so what I ended up
doing<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.350> finding<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.800> way<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
doing is finding a way to do this and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.940 
doing is finding a way to do this and
you<00:00:42.300> guys<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.719> try<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> mimic<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.649> did<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you guys can try to mimic what I did and

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.650 
you guys can try to mimic what I did and
I<00:00:44.010> bet<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:44.340> work<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.210> guys<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.539> an

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
I bet it will work if you guys have an

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.180 
I bet it will work if you guys have an
easier<00:00:45.930> way<00:00:46.050> let<00:00:46.230> me<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.620> what<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> did

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.310 
understand why it didn't work the other
handful<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> times<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:24.930> I've<00:01:25.020> tried<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
handful of times but I've tried is a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
handful of times but I've tried is a
dozen<00:01:25.860> times<00:01:26.040> elsewhere<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.210> didn't<00:01:27.420> work

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
dozen times elsewhere and it didn't work

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
dozen times elsewhere and it didn't work
I<00:01:27.810> probably<00:01:28.590> should<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:28.860> broken<00:01:29.310> down<00:01:29.460> my

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
I probably should have broken down my

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.660 
I probably should have broken down my
turbine<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> didn't<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.290> once<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> portal

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
turbine but I didn't and once the portal

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.740 
turbine but I didn't and once the portal
is<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.180> don't<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
is there then you don't really have to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.030 
is there then you don't really have to
worry<00:01:33.810> about<00:01:34.200> breaking<00:01:34.409> down<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> turbine

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
worry about breaking down the turbine

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.609 
worry about breaking down the turbine
