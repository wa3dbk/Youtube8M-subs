00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.740 
know if you can put it into the freezer
or<00:05:59.530> not<00:05:59.710> to<00:06:00.220> make<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:00.490> a<00:06:00.550> little<00:06:00.730> harder<00:06:01.210> cuz<00:06:01.630> I

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
or not to make it a little harder cuz I

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.270

but<00:06:02.020> even<00:06:02.290> then<00:06:02.500> I<00:06:02.620> think<00:06:02.800> it'll<00:06:02.980> still<00:06:03.160> be

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280

but even then I think it'll still be
creamy<00:06:03.580> but<00:06:04.300> definitely<00:06:04.990> be<00:06:05.350> wary<00:06:05.920> of<00:06:06.070> that<00:06:06.370> I

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
creamy but definitely be wary of that I

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.770
