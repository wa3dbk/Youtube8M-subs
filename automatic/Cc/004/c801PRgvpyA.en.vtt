licky doesn't explode you know kind of
blows<00:02:14.810> up<00:02:15.079> everywhere<00:02:17.410> trim<00:02:18.410> protects<00:02:18.890> itself

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
blows up everywhere trim protects itself

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.000 
blows up everywhere trim protects itself
and<00:02:22.160> because<00:02:22.970> uses<00:02:23.360> Rick<00:02:23.690> ways<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.200> mean<00:02:24.230> he's<00:02:24.980> a

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.510 
turn into a son I feel like do you like
a<00:03:45.720> swarm<00:03:46.020> and<00:03:46.230> they<00:03:46.590> both<00:03:46.739> transform<00:03:47.340> back

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
a swarm and they both transform back

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.760 
a swarm and they both transform back
into<00:03:47.580> their<00:03:47.940> secondary<00:03:48.300> forms<00:03:48.739> yeah<00:03:49.739> yeah

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
into their secondary forms yeah yeah

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.080 
into their secondary forms yeah yeah
luckily<00:03:52.770> though<00:03:53.040> ice<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.520> still<00:03:53.849> normal

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
luckily though ice is still normal

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.240 
luckily though ice is still normal
effective<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.989> sunlight<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.860> think<00:03:56.130> its

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
effective in the sunlight I think its

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.430 
effective in the sunlight I think its
water<00:03:56.610> that's<00:03:56.760> weekend<00:03:57.330> but<00:03:57.450> not<00:03:57.569> ice<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:58.110> don't

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
water that's weekend but not ice I don't

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.690 
water that's weekend but not ice I don't
really<00:03:58.650> know<00:03:58.860> why<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.069> just<00:03:59.459> want<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.640> be

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
really know why I just want to be

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.160 
really know why I just want to be
affected<00:04:00.150> either<00:04:00.270> but<00:04:00.540> whatever<00:04:00.780> I<00:04:00.900> get<00:04:01.080> the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
affected either but whatever I get the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.780 
affected either but whatever I get the
leech<00:04:01.350> seed<00:04:01.560> off<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.709> lugia<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.550> can't

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
leech seed off a lugia and you can't

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.430 
leech seed off a lugia and you can't
switch<00:04:03.090> out<00:04:03.270> looky<00:04:03.569> anymore<00:04:03.959> because<00:04:04.080> he<00:04:04.230> just

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
switch out looky anymore because he just

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.580 
switch out looky anymore because he just
lost<00:04:04.620> you<00:04:05.550> know<00:04:05.700> his<00:04:06.630> third<00:04:06.840> Pokemon<00:04:07.319> so<00:04:07.470> now

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
he can't get the rid of the lead sheet

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.300 
he can't get the rid of the lead sheet
which<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.750> good<00:04:09.930> because<00:04:10.110> loogie<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> pretty

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
which is good because loogie is a pretty

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.949 
which is good because loogie is a pretty
defensive<00:04:11.610> Pokemon<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.390> lead<00:04:12.540> sheet<00:04:12.780> is

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
defensive Pokemon and lead sheet is

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.960 
defensive Pokemon and lead sheet is
gonna<00:04:13.380> drain<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.739> pretty<00:04:14.100> well<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.670> that's<00:04:14.850> a

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
gonna drain it pretty well so that's a

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.300 
gonna drain it pretty well so that's a
good<00:04:15.000> move<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:15.930> got<00:04:16.109> lucky<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.739> I'll<00:04:17.010> tires

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.390 
back but why don't you call it all tire
I'll<00:04:20.340> tarija<00:04:21.530> okay<00:04:22.530> so<00:04:22.590> it's<00:04:22.800> good<00:04:23.010> for<00:04:23.160> Scylla

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
in sense of attacking at me I mean he's

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.640 
in sense of attacking at me I mean he's
more<00:05:29.250> of<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.370> defensive<00:05:29.600> legendarium<00:05:30.600> in<00:05:30.840> but<00:05:31.620> I

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
more of a defensive legendarium in but I

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.500 
more of a defensive legendarium in but I
mean<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:31.979> you<00:05:32.760> could<00:05:32.910> probably<00:05:33.120> make<00:05:33.330> him

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
mean I you could probably make him

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.640 
mean I you could probably make him
pretty<00:05:33.810> power

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
pretty power

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.450 
pretty power
I<00:05:35.720> offensively<00:05:36.720> to<00:05:37.050> it<00:05:37.680> just<00:05:37.919> seems<00:05:38.100> like<00:05:38.160> he's

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
I offensively to it just seems like he's

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.629 
I offensively to it just seems like he's
better<00:05:39.030> defensively<00:05:39.660> and<00:05:40.380> you<00:05:40.949> know<00:05:41.070> I<00:05:41.130> can't

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
better defensively and you know I can't

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.800 
better defensively and you know I can't
really<00:05:41.729> do<00:05:41.910> much<00:05:41.940> of<00:05:42.060> anything<00:05:42.330> so<00:05:42.509> I<00:05:42.570> just<00:05:42.690> go

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
really do much of anything so I just go

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.740 
really do much of anything so I just go
for<00:05:42.930> an<00:05:43.050> ice<00:05:43.139> beam<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:44.009> solar<00:05:44.699> beam<00:05:45.000> because

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
for an ice beam and solar beam because

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.350 
for an ice beam and solar beam because
he's<00:05:46.710> locked<00:05:47.009> on<00:05:47.250> it<00:05:47.490> and<00:05:47.729> Sharon<00:05:48.180> doesn't

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
he's locked on it and Sharon doesn't

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.540 
he's locked on it and Sharon doesn't
really<00:05:48.570> have<00:05:48.810> many<00:05:49.050> attacks<00:05:49.530> to<00:05:49.770> go<00:05:49.949> with<00:05:50.190> but

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
really have many attacks to go with but

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.980 
really have many attacks to go with but
this<00:05:50.850> is<00:05:51.000> pretty<00:05:51.120> much<00:05:51.240> the<00:05:51.330> last<00:05:51.479> year

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
this is pretty much the last year

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.290 
this is pretty much the last year

flower<00:06:09.840> power<00:06:10.199> gives<00:06:10.979> you<00:06:11.130> defense<00:06:11.580> power<00:06:11.850> too

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
flower power gives you defense power too

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.189

I know gives you a tad fire but not the

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.870 
I know gives you a tad fire but not the
defense<00:06:16.199> but<00:06:16.530> Litzy<00:06:17.039> finish<00:06:17.370> it<00:06:17.520> off<00:06:17.669> so<00:06:17.850> that

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
defense but Litzy finish it off so that

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.360 
defense but Litzy finish it off so that
