before you add any water otherwise it
just<00:02:33.250> doesn't<00:02:33.730> mix<00:02:33.880> up<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.270> get<00:02:34.390> big

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
just doesn't mix up and you get big

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.450 
just doesn't mix up and you get big

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
lines off you know make these a little

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.300 
lines off you know make these a little
bit<00:03:25.480> rougher<00:03:25.959> do<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.620> do<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:26.890> at<00:03:27.070> this<00:03:27.250> stage

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
bit rougher do it do it at this stage

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.640 
bit rougher do it do it at this stage
here<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.540> see<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:28.840> these<00:03:29.050> are<00:03:29.200> pretty<00:03:29.470> big

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
here and see like these are pretty big

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.310 
here and see like these are pretty big
holes<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.250> but<00:03:30.880> then<00:03:31.239> that's<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.510> big<00:03:31.690> plate<00:03:32.110> mom

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
holes it but then that's a big plate mom

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.500 
holes it but then that's a big plate mom
but<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:33.160> know<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:33.519> can<00:03:33.640> add<00:03:33.760> smaller<00:03:34.209> holes

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
but you know you can add smaller holes

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.590 
but you know you can add smaller holes
in<00:03:35.050> there<00:03:35.290> too<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:36.010> flake<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> couple<00:03:37.390> of<00:03:37.450> these

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
in there too and flake a couple of these

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.360 
in there too and flake a couple of these
so<00:03:37.810> that<00:03:37.959> they<00:03:38.110> look<00:03:38.290> like<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.769> in<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.070> smaller

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
so that they look like this in a smaller

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.520 
so that they look like this in a smaller
scale<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.209> then<00:03:40.720> goop<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.080> all<00:03:41.170> over<00:03:41.440> again

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
scale and then goop it all over again

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.009 
scale and then goop it all over again
you<00:03:41.950> know<00:03:42.070> some<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.340> those<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:43.030> don't<00:03:43.870> go<00:03:43.989> to

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
you know some of those and don't go to

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.229 
you know some of those and don't go to
fine<00:03:44.410> with<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.769> details<00:03:45.160> at<00:03:45.580> this<00:03:45.910> stage
