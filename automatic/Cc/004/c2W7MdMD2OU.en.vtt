older version of windows sometimes it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.140 
older version of windows sometimes it
becomes<00:00:18.420> important<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.859> make<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> computer

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
becomes important to make the computer

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.359 
becomes important to make the computer
shut<00:00:21.420> down<00:00:21.449> automatically<00:00:22.220> especially<00:00:23.220> if

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
shut down automatically especially if

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.450 
shut down automatically especially if
you<00:00:23.670> produce<00:00:24.359> something<00:00:24.800> you<00:00:25.800> leave<00:00:26.250> for

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
you produce something you leave for

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.640 
you produce something you leave for
somewhere<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:27.119> you're<00:00:27.420> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.599> sleep<00:00:27.840> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
somewhere or you're going to sleep it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.439 
somewhere or you're going to sleep it
becomes<00:00:29.039> important<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.090> create<00:00:30.390> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
becomes important that you create a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.139 
becomes important that you create a
function<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:30.990> will<00:00:31.349> make<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.009> computer<00:00:32.850> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
function that will make the computer to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.690 
function that will make the computer to
shut<00:00:33.390> down<00:00:33.420> automatically<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.489> video

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
shut down automatically so in this video

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.000 
shut down automatically so in this video
