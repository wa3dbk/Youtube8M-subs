that also are claiming to have this kind
of<00:03:35.890> moisturizing<00:03:36.340> power<00:03:36.670> now<00:03:37.150> if<00:03:37.240> you<00:03:37.360> don't

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
of moisturizing power now if you don't

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.770 
of moisturizing power now if you don't
know<00:03:37.900> lore'l<00:03:38.560> actually<00:03:38.950> owns<00:03:39.190> why<00:03:40.090> us<00:03:40.270> out<00:03:40.510> so

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
know lore'l actually owns why us out so

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.300 
know lore'l actually owns why us out so
this<00:03:40.900> is<00:03:41.050> probably<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.470> reason<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:41.980> the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
this is probably the reason for the

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.670 
this is probably the reason for the
formula<00:03:42.820> being<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.120> similar<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.690> believe<00:03:44.560> it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
formula being so similar I believe it

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.240 
formula being so similar I believe it
was<00:03:44.800> a<00:03:44.860> reach<00:03:45.130> recent<00:03:46.110> by<00:03:47.110> by<00:03:47.470> L'Oreal<00:03:47.890> so<00:03:48.100> it

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
was a reach recent by by L'Oreal so it

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.850 
was a reach recent by by L'Oreal so it
hasn't<00:03:48.430> been<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.940> think<00:03:49.060> like<00:03:49.900> them<00:03:50.530> being

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
hasn't been I think like them being

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.820 
hasn't been I think like them being
owned<00:03:51.250> by<00:03:51.430> L'Oreal<00:03:51.850> together<00:03:52.260> for<00:03:53.260> the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
owned by L'Oreal together for the

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.210 
owned by L'Oreal together for the
longest<00:03:54.160> time<00:03:54.310> however<00:03:55.300> if<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.680> do<00:03:56.860> get<00:03:57.010> this

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
longest time however if you do get this

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.730 
longest time however if you do get this
it<00:03:58.030> does<00:03:58.270> have<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> very<00:03:58.750> similar<00:03:58.960> formula<00:03:59.440> a

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
it does have a very similar formula a

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.500 
it does have a very similar formula a
