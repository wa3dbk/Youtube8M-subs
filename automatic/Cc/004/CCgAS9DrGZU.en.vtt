 particulate filter pipe 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:36.330
 then start washing the soot 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.640
 filter washing is done with liquid 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.360
 for cleaning the particulate filter flushing 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.330
 liquid in this case is presented 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.340
 washing the 5 liter capacity of this 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.550
 enough to clean 1 carbon black 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.550
 filter 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:58.560
 a pure particulate filter usually takes 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:03.570
 more than 10 hours after this 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.170
 time the flushing fluid is drained and 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.170
 particulate filter 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:23.190
 after that the diesel particulate filter is washed 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:26.040
 clean running water your liquid 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:32.430
 loves effectively dissolves and completely 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:36.720
 then all sediment and soot residues after 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.320
 washing the particulate filter is purged 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.320
 compressed air 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:58.430
 Particulate filter washing procedure 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:05.000
 water is produced several times before 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:09.950
 complete removal of soot and residues 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.380

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.200
 pressure sensor tube and tightens 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.100
 hose clamps 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.030
 after that the washed particulate filter 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.020
 set on a regular place in 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.590
 car and the filter is fixed on 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.990

 the engine is covered with a plastic cap 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.590
 exhaust pipes are collected and 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.819

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.970
 prevent re-contamination 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:13.250
 particulate filter fluid is used 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.759
 for preventive cleaning carbon black
