00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.809
 These devices are sold by 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.580
 separate but then you 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.580
 we will teach the characteristics of each 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.670
 one as well as how to connect them from 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.460
 right way and so get the most out of them 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.800
 advantage 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.109
 how does it work 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.650
 let's start by knowing the components of 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:32.440
 our led strip this one has four 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:35.300
 cables black blue green and red 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.660
 which will serve us to feed 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.970
 our led strip 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.820
 now let's know the components of 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.610
 our controller 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.890
 here we have the controller has a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.300
 power input which comes 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.879
 of an adapter be cc 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.150
 a connector with male pins to which 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.370
 we will call comb 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.120
 our exit sign and our 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.610
 remote control 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.160
 now we are going to connect 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.230
 in the controller we identify the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.820
 output terminal that will feed the 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.460
 strip 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.890
 this terminal has four terminals 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.090
 females 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.149
 we identify the connector for purposes 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.590
 males and we connect it to the terminal 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.110
 exit 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.390
 now we will connect the led strip to 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.750
 our controller taking into account what 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.100
 following 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.420
 we take the departure terminal in it 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.720
 we locate the arrow that is recorded in 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.500
 the plastic part this indicates the pin 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.660
 number 1 which is the positive terminal 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 that will be connected to the terminal of the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.740
 LED strip 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.050
 pin number 2 will be the feed 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.550
 for the red LEDs of the strip 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.070
 lithium 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.380
 pin number 3 will be the feed 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.470
 for the green leds of the strip 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.650
 led 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.990
 pin number 4 will be the feed 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.160
 for the blue LEDs of the strip 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.440
 of led we verify that they are correct 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.960
 the connections 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.300
 in the controller we identify the 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.100
 adapter input and we connect a 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.410
 adapter that delivers the voltage 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.230
 specified in the controller which 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:27.420
 is 12 v cc6 samper connect 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.640
 ready the strip is already on now 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.940
 by means of the remote control manipulate 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.260
 we will make the led strip 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.569
 with the button today we turn on the strip and 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.549
 with the button off we turn off the strip 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.549
 with the buttons r 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:52.069
 we can select for them to learn 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:55.579
 the green ecological red blue leds 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.489
 and with the w button we will get a 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.499
 white hue the remote control 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.829
 also of the facility says that of the 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:06.849
 city ​​with different dynamic modes 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:11.750
 automatic change in seven flash colors 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.819
 havoc change of seven colors faith and 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.969
 changing three primary colors is very 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.969
 Useful 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.450
 with the brightness + and brightness buttons 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.860
 least we can reduce or increase the 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.370
 speed of light according to 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.530
 our needs this driver will 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.490
 allows to mix the primary colors and 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.630
 so get 12 different shades 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:41.770
 like dark yellow yellow orange 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:47.470

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.050
 you want and press the button 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.850
 now you can light up the area that 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.150
 you want with different colors and 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.150

 sensor for love control 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.100
 the combination of these products we 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.440
 allows to illuminate surfaces with 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.600
 different tones which you 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.260
 will allow them to be used in different

 occasions 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.140
 tips 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.960
 our led strip can be adjusted from 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.930
 according to the distance you want only 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.920
 look for the cut indication on the strip 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.830
 short and ready 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.880
 the remaining way we can still occupy 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.670
 just remove encapsulated and only a few 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.050
 cables to the terminals of the strip 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:06.510
 marked as more positive r 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:08.190
 red and we be love and ready 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.260
 you just have to use the voltage 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.180
 specified in the manual of the strip and 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.800
 of the controller since a voltage 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.620
 different can destroy the team 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.270
 When using the remote control directs 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.270
 the signal directly to the sensor
