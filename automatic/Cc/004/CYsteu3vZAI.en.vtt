here's a few things that I did to my
blade<00:00:05.930> for<00:00:06.230> 50x<00:00:07.660> figured<00:00:08.660> I'd<00:00:08.780> go<00:00:08.990> over<00:00:09.110> it<00:00:09.349> a

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960

landing<00:00:35.000> gear<00:00:35.210> on<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.719> didn't<00:00:36.140> like<00:00:36.200> the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
landing gear on it I didn't like the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.479 
landing gear on it I didn't like the
white<00:00:38.469> wish<00:00:39.469> they<00:00:39.620> made<00:00:39.649> black<00:00:40.100> gears

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
white wish they made black gears

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.229 
white wish they made black gears
actually<00:00:40.940> I'd<00:00:41.059> change<00:00:41.300> that<00:00:41.510> do<00:00:41.710> I<00:00:43.629> put<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:45.039> TM

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
actually I'd change that do I put the TM

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.200 
actually I'd change that do I put the TM

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
flight data if you can see that right

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.020 
flight data if you can see that right
there<00:01:06.760> there's<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:08.000> bit<00:01:08.330> sensor<00:01:09.049> for<00:01:09.290> the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
there there's this bit sensor for the

there there's this bit sensor for the
electronic<00:01:11.030> speed<00:01:11.270> control<00:01:15.040> put<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:31.540 

aluminum<00:01:22.119> canopy<00:01:23.119> mounts<00:01:23.479> on<00:01:23.689> it

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.460 

that's<00:01:32.550> so<00:01:33.120> far<00:01:33.330> about<00:01:33.510> it<00:01:33.780> I'd<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.260> do

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that's so far about it I'd like to do

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.700 
that's so far about it I'd like to do
the<00:01:34.650> carbon-fiber<00:01:35.580> tail<00:01:35.940> room<00:01:36.320> that's<00:01:37.320> coming

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the carbon-fiber tail room that's coming

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.630 
the carbon-fiber tail room that's coming
up<00:01:37.800> next<00:01:38.010> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:39.380> might<00:01:40.380> wait<00:01:40.620> until<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.950> then

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
up next I think might wait until I then

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.900 
up next I think might wait until I then
that<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.120> I'm<00:01:42.300> not<00:01:42.420> sure<00:01:42.480> I<00:01:43.340> even<00:01:44.340> got<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
that one up I'm not sure I even got you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:56.300 
that one up I'm not sure I even got you
can<00:01:47.910> see<00:01:49.370> lights<00:01:50.960> in<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:55.310> underneath

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
can see lights in there and underneath

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.450 
can see lights in there and underneath
the<00:01:56.610> vertical<00:01:57.300> fin<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:59.190> underneath<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:01.460> body

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the vertical fin and underneath the body

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:15.650 
the vertical fin and underneath the body
itself<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:07.970> if<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:14.060> usually<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.510> plug

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
itself so if you usually I just plug

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.910 
itself so if you usually I just plug
this<00:02:15.810> right<00:02:15.900> into<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.650> servo<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:18.740> for<00:02:19.740> now<00:02:19.890> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
this right into the servo but for now I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.610 
this right into the servo but for now I
put<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.960> battery<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.290> it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
put a battery and do it

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:41.650 
put a battery and do it
my<00:02:23.070> display<00:02:23.490> battery

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.380 

this<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.050> show<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.290> guys<00:02:44.330> how<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
this is we can show you guys how it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.949 
this is we can show you guys how it
looks

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.160 

and<00:02:53.590> this<00:02:53.799> one<00:02:54.599> burned<00:02:55.599> out<00:02:55.780> ahead<00:02:55.989> light

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
and this one burned out ahead light

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:17.280 
and this one burned out ahead light
already<00:02:59.579> anyway<00:03:02.609> change<00:03:03.609> flashing<00:03:04.150> modes<00:03:16.290> so

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
already anyway change flashing modes so

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.410 
already anyway change flashing modes so
you<00:03:17.349> can<00:03:17.530> get<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.709> little<00:03:17.969> look<00:03:18.969> at<00:03:19.090> what<00:03:19.150> it'll

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
you can get a little look at what it'll

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
you can get a little look at what it'll
look<00:03:19.480> like<00:03:19.599> in<00:03:19.840> right<00:03:20.079> here

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.190 

so<00:03:41.070> if<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.150> can<00:03:42.300> see<00:03:43.400> for<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.490> telemetry<00:03:45.200> for

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
so if you can see for the telemetry for

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.150 
so if you can see for the telemetry for
the<00:03:46.320> battery<00:03:47.040> voltage<00:03:47.570> all<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.840> do<00:03:48.990> is<00:03:49.170> solder

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
the battery voltage all you do is solder

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.200 
the battery voltage all you do is solder
the<00:03:50.640> positive<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.900> negative<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:53.060> run<00:03:54.060> it

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
the positive and negative to it run it

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.460 
the positive and negative to it run it
over<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.980> TM<00:03:55.980> 1100<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.820> plug<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.470> that

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
over to the TM 1100 and plug it in that

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.450 
over to the TM 1100 and plug it in that
will<00:03:58.560> give<00:03:58.710> you<00:03:58.830> that<00:04:00.320> for<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.410> motor<00:04:01.650> temp

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
will give you that for the motor temp

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.730 
will give you that for the motor temp
you<00:04:02.910> just<00:04:03.180> take<00:04:03.360> this<00:04:03.510> little<00:04:03.870> wire<00:04:04.380> that<00:04:04.620> they

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
you just take this little wire that they

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.550 
you just take this little wire that they
supply<00:04:05.070> with<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.430> TM<00:04:05.700> 1100<00:04:06.330> wrap<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.470> around

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
supply with the TM 1100 wrap it around

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.710 
supply with the TM 1100 wrap it around
the<00:04:07.860> very<00:04:08.070> bottom<00:04:08.460> of<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.620> tighten<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.650> up

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
the very bottom of it and tighten it up

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.780 
the very bottom of it and tighten it up
the<00:04:12.720> part<00:04:12.960> that<00:04:13.020> an<00:04:13.560> out<00:04:13.860> runner<00:04:14.130> motor<00:04:14.400> that

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
the part that an out runner motor that

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.370 
the part that an out runner motor that
doesn't<00:04:15.120> spend<00:04:15.360> put<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:15.900> way<00:04:16.020> down<00:04:16.170> on<00:04:16.350> the

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
doesn't spend put it way down on the

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.160 
doesn't spend put it way down on the
bottom<00:04:16.620> there<00:04:17.060> tighten<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.120> up<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:18.270> don't<00:04:18.720> move

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
bottom there tighten it up so don't move

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.380 
bottom there tighten it up so don't move
that'll<00:04:20.070> give<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.280> the<00:04:20.400> motor<00:04:20.580> temp<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:23.390> this

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
that'll give you the motor temp and this

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.700 
that'll give you the motor temp and this
will<00:04:24.600> give<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:24.810> battery<00:04:25.170> voltage<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:27.710> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
will give you battery voltage and the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:41.530 
will give you battery voltage and the
sensor<00:04:30.140> if<00:04:31.140> you<00:04:36.260> want<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.350> have<00:04:37.500> motor<00:04:37.800> rpm
