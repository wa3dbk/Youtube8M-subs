tech<00:00:44.129> strike<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:44.430> using<00:00:44.609> is<00:00:44.760> LD<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.090> modern

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
tech strike I'm using is LD be modern

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.490 
tech strike I'm using is LD be modern
but<00:00:45.570> I'm<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.780> about<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> switch<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
but I'm just about to switch over to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.869 
but I'm just about to switch over to
default<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> show<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.340> guys<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.730> looks

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
default to show you guys what it looks

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.790 
default to show you guys what it looks
like<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.480> okay<00:00:49.199> so<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:49.710> it

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
like in that okay so this is what it

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
like in that okay so this is what it
looks<00:00:49.949> like<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.340> default<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.449> only<00:00:51.690> real

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
looks like in default the only real

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.270 
looks like in default the only real
change<00:00:51.870> I'd<00:00:52.260> actually<00:00:52.530> make<00:00:52.769> is<00:00:52.920> instead<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
change I'd actually make is instead of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.919 
change I'd actually make is instead of
these<00:00:53.519> iron<00:00:54.000> blocks<00:00:54.210> which<00:00:54.359> are<00:00:54.480> very<00:00:54.660> wiped

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
these iron blocks which are very wiped

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.869 
these iron blocks which are very wiped
in<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.289> felt<00:00:55.530> probably<00:00:56.039> switch<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.460> over<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
in be felt probably switch that over to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
in be felt probably switch that over to
Eva<00:00:57.089> gravel<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.899> actually<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> think<00:00:58.859> probably

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
Eva gravel and actually I think probably

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.819 
Eva gravel and actually I think probably
gray<00:00:59.219> wall<00:00:59.429> do<00:00:59.670> best<00:00:59.910> gray<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.410> grey<00:01:01.620> wool

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

materials<00:01:05.100> even<00:01:05.250> cobblestone<00:01:05.670> would<00:01:05.790> work

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
materials even cobblestone would work

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.399 
materials even cobblestone would work
actually<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.300> here<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:07.110> know<00:01:07.229> it's

next we're gonna do is gonna build up so
we<00:02:43.950> find<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.189> middle<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:44.579> just<00:02:44.819> build<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
we find the middle of this just build a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.270 
we find the middle of this just build a
block<00:02:45.389> put<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.349> on<00:02:46.439> the<00:02:46.500> lower<00:02:46.650> one<00:02:46.859> then<00:02:47.159> go

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
block put one on the lower one then go

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.539 
block put one on the lower one then go
one<00:02:47.489> two<00:02:48.209> three<00:02:48.510> four<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.439> total<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.370> should

one two three four and total so should
bring<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.909> line<00:02:51.060> with<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.329> piece<00:02:51.599> here

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
bring you in line with this piece here

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.899 
bring you in line with this piece here
just<00:02:53.069> like<00:02:53.159> that<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.400> let's<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.700> same<00:02:53.849> on

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
just like that so let's do the same on

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.509 
just like that so let's do the same on
the<00:02:53.970> other<00:02:54.030> side<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.079> got<00:02:55.200> one<00:02:55.560> two<00:02:56.159> then

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
the other side so you got one two then

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.119 
the other side so you got one two then
this<00:02:56.849> when<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.090> turn<00:02:57.299> an<00:02:57.689> extra<00:02:58.620> two<00:02:58.829> slaps

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
this when you turn an extra two slaps

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.580 
this when you turn an extra two slaps
onto<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.609> front<00:02:59.760> piece<00:03:00.290> they're<00:03:01.290> gonna<00:03:01.409> use<00:03:01.560> a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
onto the front piece they're gonna use a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.379 
onto the front piece they're gonna use a
block<00:03:01.829> right<00:03:02.099> in<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.250> middle<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.730> metal

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
block right in the middle of this metal

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.199 
block right in the middle of this metal
piece<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:04.799> then<00:03:04.889> just<00:03:05.129> go<00:03:05.220> one<00:03:05.430> two<00:03:05.909> three

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
piece and then just go one two three
