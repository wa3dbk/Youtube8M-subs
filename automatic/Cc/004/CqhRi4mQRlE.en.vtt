 raspberry in the coconut type I think it's 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.449
 or something like that and well this is very 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.219
 simple to do is simply with a 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.710
 command is worth which I already applied and I'm going 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.300
 explain again and I will explain good 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.770
 It's worth the first thing I want you to have 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.870
 ok is that for example my little head here 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.460
 of cow is exactly the same as the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.799
 lemon what does that mean 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.900
 a person called alexis by 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.340
 example this guy that good in his head 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.110
 has a lemon is worth and for example there is 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.119
 another guy who has popcorn here in the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.909
 head that's why we can visualize what 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.650
 it would be these opposite miniblogs it's worth like that 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.960
 with all the children objects that we have 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.880
 here is worth the cookie with the bourgeois 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.909
 the cupcake in any case is worth 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.560
 heads of people and good the command 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.690

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.929
 valet spaces from 197 13 school go 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.330
 where it's worth and in quotes we put the 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.800
 name of the head we want to get 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.750
 for example, right now I have obtained 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.280
 the brown individual head because I've 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.649

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.619
 put it around here you know I made a 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.330
 exclusive gameplay we made heads of 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.759
 youtubers I'll leave it here because 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.280
 surely many people are interested and it is 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.509
 very curious also worth and well then what 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.950
 same as we do with the heads of 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.050
 cow so now here we have the names 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 of everything for example of the hamburger 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.590
 llama cut vale you want to check that 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.629
 it works so let's go 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.640
 let's put the command and we're going to 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.209
 change at the end between the quotes the 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.980
 I'm alive and dark and we'll put put 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.580
 in this way you have seen that I have 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.980
 obtained here is worth what would be the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.299
 hamburger you have seen we can put it 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.250
 the times we want is great 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.860
 especially in a kitchen with this super 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.420
 look 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.530
 and well so with all the objects for 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.180
 I'm going to show you the names because 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.030
 I want to see him , for example by 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.430
 what is that virtue the orange is called 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.890
 hill 232 that the cookie here you have it 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.060
 quadrat cookie and I repeated it on 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.250
 name so there are no failures 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.190
 simply for that reason the cupcake 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.840
 call you only here I have it finally you have 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.670
 to keep in mind that the capitals and 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.019
 lowercase are going to take into account the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.510
 command is to say how do you put a 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.879
 lowercase that is not then it will not work 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.099
 it's worth it and like the tiny one it's worth 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.610
 here we have the apple that is called here 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.220
 alex davies is worth thinking that the kilogram of k 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.230
 and that of finger are in upper case 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.459
 ok and the taco this is a taco I think or 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.260
 a hamburger I think it's a taco 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.690
 here we are not used to eating 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.860
 this but it is a taco vale we are going to 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.840
 put the cue for what 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.940
 to what you want I'll throw all 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.070
 heads that there are some people that 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.810
 hey hey he sees he is not ready I know 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.980
 then let's throw all the heads 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.660
 over here like that and for example let's put 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.790
 now what would be the taco we copied the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.540
 command that is to the description and the 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.080
 taco is called exactly good I'm not going to 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.840
 put the the april I'm going to put the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.050
 apple let's put what lex as is 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.820
 ok and here we have what would be the 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.650
 apple and so with everything we can 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.900
 put it from different angle 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.900
 I think it takes like eight angles 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.030
 yes I think there are eight angles I do not have it 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.319
 of course but that was great and good 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.379
 so with all the objects I'm going to show 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.420

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.150

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.630
