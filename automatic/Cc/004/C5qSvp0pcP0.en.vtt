slack over over some stones or something
that<00:01:37.829> he's<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.159> gonna<00:01:38.369> follow<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.880> contours

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that he's just gonna follow the contours

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
that he's just gonna follow the contours
isn't<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.900> gonna<00:01:40.549> look<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.670> that

isn't it it's just gonna look at that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.170 
isn't it it's just gonna look at that
okay<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.680> very<00:01:43.680> very<00:01:43.950> soft<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.430> supple<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.030> if

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you've got any kind of deviations in

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.260 
you've got any kind of deviations in
your<00:01:46.860> lake<00:01:47.009> bed<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.909> looking<00:01:48.149> at

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
your lake bed so actually looking at

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.789 
your lake bed so actually looking at
that<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.600> I'd<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.960> quite<00:01:49.170> confident<00:01:49.590> using

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that now I'd be quite confident using

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.510 
that now I'd be quite confident using
quite<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> long<00:01:50.399> length<00:01:50.640> yeah<00:01:52.009> yeah<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.340> do

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
quite a long length yeah yeah you can do

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.800 
quite a long length yeah yeah you can do
I'm<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.820> using<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.420> moments<00:01:54.600> I'm

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
I'm not using all the moments I'm

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.929 
I'm not using all the moments I'm
fishing<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.259> far<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.790> do

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
fishing so far out right but you can do

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.700 
fishing so far out right but you can do
yeah<00:01:57.090> because<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> does<00:01:57.570> seem<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.960> well<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
yeah because it does seem so well and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.649 
yeah because it does seem so well and
it's<00:01:58.860> also<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.310> tough<00:01:59.610> as<00:01:59.790> well<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.570> it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
it's also really tough as well and it

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.880 
it's also really tough as well and it
doesn't<00:02:00.899> break<00:02:01.020> apart<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.469> lot<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> them<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
doesn't break apart a lot of them at the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.109 
doesn't break apart a lot of them at the
moment<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.340> sort<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.850> they'll<00:02:03.000> get

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
moment you sort of get they'll get

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.310 
moment you sort of get they'll get
caught<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.420> weed<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.719> break<00:02:03.869> apart<00:02:04.140> you'll

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
caught in weed and break apart you'll

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.510 
caught in weed and break apart you'll
end<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.649> two<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:04.890> three<00:02:04.920> bits<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.369> your

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
end up with two or three bits up your

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.380 
end up with two or three bits up your
line<00:02:05.640> absolutely

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
line absolutely

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.419 
line absolutely
but<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.899> stiff<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.860> doesn't<00:02:08.340> do

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
but this is so stiff that it doesn't do

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.150 
but this is so stiff that it doesn't do
that<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.239> strong<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.869> strong<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.319> all<00:02:10.950> right

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
that so strong so strong so all right

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.100 
that so strong so strong so all right
now<00:02:11.580> what<00:02:12.030> about<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.360> thread<00:02:12.599> ability<00:02:13.020> of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
now what about the thread ability of

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.640 
now what about the thread ability of
it's<00:02:13.260> on

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's on

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.350 
it's on
some<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.159> other<00:02:14.280> ones<00:02:14.519> on<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.269> market

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
some of the other ones on the market

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.240 
some of the other ones on the market
again<00:02:15.959> can<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:16.230> quite<00:02:16.470> difficult<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.980> thread

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
again can be quite difficult to thread

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.860 
again can be quite difficult to thread
the<00:02:17.370> line<00:02:17.489> yeah<00:02:17.760> again<00:02:18.239> we've<00:02:18.420> tried<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
the line yeah again we've tried and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.000 
the line yeah again we've tried and
tried<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.079> tried<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.379> get<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.680> right<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
tried and tried to get this right and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.610 
tried and tried to get this right and
now<00:02:20.069> it's<00:02:20.129> perfect<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.790> line<00:02:21.090> goes<00:02:21.299> for<00:02:21.480> it

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
now it's perfect the line goes for it

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.710 
now it's perfect the line goes for it
really<00:02:22.620> does<00:02:22.799> yeah<00:02:23.010> okay<00:02:23.610> all<00:02:24.329> right<00:02:24.390> well<00:02:24.689> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
really does yeah okay all right well I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.539 
really does yeah okay all right well I
mean<00:02:24.840> that's<00:02:25.079> one<00:02:25.829> other<00:02:25.950> question<00:02:26.159> I<00:02:26.340> wanted

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
mean that's one other question I wanted

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.710 
mean that's one other question I wanted
to<00:02:26.610> ask<00:02:26.790> actually<00:02:27.150> cuz<00:02:27.269> you've<00:02:27.420> been<00:02:27.540> using

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
to ask actually cuz you've been using

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.360 
to ask actually cuz you've been using
this<00:02:27.870> timeout<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.379> it<00:02:28.530> because<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.099> is<00:02:29.189> so

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
this timeout is it because it is so

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.690 
this timeout is it because it is so
dense<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.909> heavy<00:02:30.120> adds<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.569> affect<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.959> cast

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
dense and heavy adds it affect the cast

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.920 
dense and heavy adds it affect the cast
know<00:02:32.700> if<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.060> use<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.299> in<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> limb<00:02:33.569> fly<00:02:33.750> that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
know if you use it in a limb fly that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.300 
know if you use it in a limb fly that
obviously<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.319> use<00:02:34.439> it<00:02:34.590> six<00:02:34.829> foot<00:02:35.040> it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
obviously if you use it six foot it

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.589 
obviously if you use it six foot it
would<00:02:35.459> though<00:02:35.640> because<00:02:35.939> it's<00:02:36.090> because<00:02:36.480> it's

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
would though because it's because it's

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.300 
would though because it's because it's
so<00:02:36.720> heavy<00:02:36.959> burden<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.739> don't<00:02:37.950> need<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.159> use<00:02:38.280> it

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
so heavy burden you don't need to use it

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.009 
so heavy burden you don't need to use it
that<00:02:38.489> long<00:02:38.640> as<00:02:38.760> whole<00:02:38.909> if<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.450> was<00:02:39.599> fishing<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
that long as whole if you was fishing a

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.720 
that long as whole if you was fishing a
like<00:02:40.230> maybe<00:02:40.379> that<00:02:40.680> had<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.829> leg<00:02:41.099> call<00:02:41.340> ban<00:02:41.549> would

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
like maybe that had a leg call ban would

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.940 
like maybe that had a leg call ban would
you<00:02:41.819> think<00:02:41.970> maybe<00:02:42.299> using<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:42.780> long<00:02:42.989> like<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.500> two

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
you think maybe using a long like to two

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.830 
you think maybe using a long like to two
lengths<00:02:44.280> if<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.879> feel<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> need<00:02:45.329> to<00:02:45.359> use<00:02:45.510> it

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
lengths if you feel the need to use it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.569 
lengths if you feel the need to use it
long<00:02:46.019> then<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.349> brilliant<00:02:47.010> way<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> nailing

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
long then you brilliant way of nailing

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.009 
long then you brilliant way of nailing
everything<00:02:47.940> down<00:02:48.180> if<00:02:48.329> he's<00:02:48.450> fishing<00:02:48.659> any<00:02:48.870> age

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
everything down if he's fishing any age
