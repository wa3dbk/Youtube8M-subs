00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.010
 It's been a very long time since that one 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.580
 vehicle engines with the hand crank 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.650
 today would have been unthinkable 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.830
 You only know something like that from small ones 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.820
 motors such as 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.820
 generators or lawnmowers 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.490
 for decades 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.460
 combustion engines in trucks and cars with 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.100
 Help from electric motors started like 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.200
 an electrostarter works which 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.300
 characteristics he has and which ones 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.640
 Workshop work performed on it 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.090
 can be informed about this 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.090
 Movie 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.110
 let it through a conductor current 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.110
 flow this creates a magnetic field 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.490
 Unfortunately, it turns into a coil 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.549
 to upgrade the magnetic field lines 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.830
 she bundles them inside the coil 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:05.100
 run there parallel and in the same 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.649
 Dense on a current flows through 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.170
 conductor, the magnetic field becomes a force 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.810
 who tried him out of his 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.850
 calm situation to bring 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.890
 a rotatably mounted school in one 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.170
 Magnetic field becomes in a certain 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.569
 position turned once from one 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.819
 current is flowing through to her 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.090
 generated falls the same direction 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.549
 as the fixed one falls through one 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.989
 electricity to a collector 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.209
 one by changing the current 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.569
 direction in school 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.280
 prior increased when increasing the voltage 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.280
 also the speed of the engine 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.500
 the voltage source is reversed so 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.500
 the direction of rotation of the motor changes 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.950
 With a few tools you can get one 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.910
 small electric motor itself 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.920
 assemble 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.410
 These kits should be understood 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.120
 for electrical engineering 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.640
 when creating an equal 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.080
 voltage source is needed 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.390
 demonstration construction only a small one 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.390
 and he turns without interruption 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.520
 Almost all of them work according to this principle 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.920
 be it for electric motors in the car 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.640
 window wiper or even 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.640
 as a starter 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.620
 unlike the electric one 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.480
 The state has a lot of windows 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.210
 more difficult task the whole 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.670
 Mechanism of the internal combustion engine together 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.190
 all linked aggregates to the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.680
 to bring required city â€‹â€‹speed 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.420
 in summer as in winter who ever 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.090
 had tried a resting 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.060
 motor by hand to turn the white 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.880
 which effort is necessary 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.400
 are 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.040
 So for the state is an extremely high 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.680
 electricity needed a lot by the required 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.870
 high torque to provide 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.910
 For this reason, the cable of the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.130
 Battery to start a special 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.610
 big cross section and is it possible 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.610
 short 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.330
 at the moment of the state 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.400
 intensify attacks the starter pinion with 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.620
 few teeth in the big starter 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.770
 Cog with many scenes on the 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.509
 flywheel 1 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.030
 it is a simple one 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.099
 gear in which a small driving 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.530
 rate into a bigger driven council 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.840
 engages and strengthens the torque 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.020
 the translation ratio is 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.669
 between 10 to 1 and 15 to 1 the 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.770
 means that the starter for one 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.810
 crankshaft revolutions of the engine itself 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.190
 between ten and fifteen turns 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.190
 must turn per minute
