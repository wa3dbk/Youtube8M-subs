00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.890
 black dust caused by the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.550
 brake leaves ugly traces 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.560
 the wheels of millions of cars 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.990
 problems for aat the brakes 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.480
 specialist who has the solution 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.340
 ceramic the first virtually dust-free 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.989
 brake pad for the European 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.300
 Retrofit market the ceramic principle 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.310
 reduced thanks to a novel high-tech 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.670
 coating mixture compared to conventional 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.100
 Brake pads noticeably reduce the abrasion 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.970
 high quality rims will last longer 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.550
 Another plus point is the service life 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.520
 of brake pad and brake disc is 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.740
 thanks to the technology significantly lengthens the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.920
 means less dust 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:33.140
 less noise less wear 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.480
 Brake dust is an aggressive substance 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.460
 who sticks like bad luck to fields who the 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.100
 care has neglected in the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.900
 Cleaning problems is the brake remained 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.550
 deep into the varnish layer 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.930
 rim branded enough one 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.060
 often not from around 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.190
 to remove stubborn residues 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.340
 annoying for car owners the worth on 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.790
 the optics of your vehicle set the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.290
 virtually dust-free operation of 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.300
 ceramic makes sure that rims 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.690
 be cleaned much less often 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.090
 have to 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.619
 This not only saves time, it also lowers it 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.369
 the consumption more expensive and 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.450
 polluting cleaner ate ceramic 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.510
 Brake pads thereby afford one 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.030
 important contribution to the environment 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.129
 the secret of htc ramic is the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.379
 special covering mixture with one 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.750
 Innovative fiber technology at the 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.000
 braking a transfer film on the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.860
 brake disc generates that reduces the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.690
 wear and additionally increases the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.760
 Driving comfort meets ceramic brake pads 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.670
 the strict requirements of the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.360
 Automobile manufacturer at original equipment 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.209
 Products 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.430
 that make extensive product testing 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.120
 certainly the legal standards 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.120
 excel 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.769
 this also applies to safety 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.440
 comparative test under extreme conditions 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.510
 have shown that at ceramic 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.760
 brake pads have the same braking power 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.310
 offer as standard evidence from the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.470
 initial equipment the function of 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.819
 driving dynamics control systems remains in 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.400
 received in full 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.290
 htc ramic are thanks to their coverings 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.030
 mixture while braking quieter as well 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.000
 and prevent leaching of the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.920
 rub brakes brake discs and the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.230
 thus often connected steering wheel flutter 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.230
 are past thanks to ceramic 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.940
 ate ceramic is available in specialist shops and 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.790
 when braking service the installation is in 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.159
 professional fast done kt ceramic 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.940
 No conversion requires the standard 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:35.099
 Receipts are simply exchanged 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.220
 the high tech documents are already for 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.510
 numerous models of different 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.190
 Automobile manufacturers deliver the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.190
 program is constantly expanding 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.060
 we assume that in the 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.280
 middle or far future probably 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.340
 come from the premium class over the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.500
 Middle class of this product in general 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.310
 So interspersed here at arte run it 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.799
 already today 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.120
 in maybe five to ten years 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.780
 we will probably complete it 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.780
 see everywhere
