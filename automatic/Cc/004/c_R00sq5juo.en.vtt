 i 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.709
 Hi, how about I want to share with you here 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:17.590
 when I removed the set of the nails from 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.180
 aquarium something and some that had the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.989
 curiosity about how I was going to remove him and 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.149
 then undoing is very easy is you go for 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.130
 the little bank undoing the crown with 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:29.680
 very careful not to cut of course 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.930
 I have been using the car bike for many years 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.300
 and this is why I am already very dependent on 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.670
 but if you notice, I take a 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.879
 video in front of the fat little finger for 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.710
 cover cuticle there I always like 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.159
 mania of being taking care of the cuticle 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.329
 be very careful and then practice 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:51.129
 gets better and better than anything massa 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.379
 more he also wanted to teach them the 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.059
 candy design for those who do not 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.429
 they had seen and you forget me 'last year 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.269
 In very long nails I have pictures in 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.920
 facebook I think of that nail and then now the 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.130
 I went back to doing how I had deleted that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.100
 video because it was a very long video and 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.680
 I'm trying not to do them like that I'm 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.280
 talking long 20 min 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.160
 more then here I leave you like this the video 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.750
 very fast to the point the candy does not 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.610
 it's something that you have to 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.950
 worry is very easy to do it not 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.540
 it has to be perfect they can 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.860
 do in green I've seen it in 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.860
 green color looks lovely 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.300
