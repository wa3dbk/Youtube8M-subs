00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.580
 tarbes my workshop I do not have much of 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.009
 space I show you a little trick that 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.840
 I found to save 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.419
 the space especially that there I do not need 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.119
 of the tool I would be like 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.250
 specific routers for a need that 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.730
 I hung or not it's just 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.320
 a board cut in angle and which 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.440
 fit into each other 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.150
 when this honor I have a patente soo 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.769
 kim if they are in place 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.730
 the little people they had I 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:51.309
 fell and I decided to use the same 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:54.760
 the same set up for another too this 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.430
 other tool of his premises 5 degrees he 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.350
 installs on a board makes it a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.030
 suggestions that's what I did 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.980
 install it on the ice when they 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.539
 say my acting 1 m cut off space 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.860
 to establish what I did 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:08.080
 just decided to do it the same 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.830
 thing to hang it on the wall here with a 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.810
 hot potato 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.630
 when I do not need it but I dream 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.030
 finally all of a game simply crooked 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.770
 on a swell view with last to me 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.660
 in the background you can see the earth 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.090
 and the stake of the cake is now 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.459
 hang on the wall effect the version with 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.789
 it allows me to find space for 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.179
 floor and to have my also within range 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.170
 from the hand 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:35.590
 practice anyway and that's it's a 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.750
 suggestion to save spaces thank you
