challenge<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.240> basically<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.260> was<00:00:10.440> my<00:00:10.679> idea

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
challenge and basically this was my idea

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.430 
challenge and basically this was my idea
of<00:00:11.160> bringing<00:00:11.460> awareness<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.929> difficult

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
things it is for people in other parts

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.359 
things it is for people in other parts
of<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.630> world<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.260> have<00:00:16.440> access<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.010> fresh

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
of the world to have access to fresh

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.509 
of the world to have access to fresh
water<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.539> I've<00:00:18.690> been<00:00:18.930> partaking<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.189> this

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
water so I've been partaking in this

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.960 
water so I've been partaking in this
challenge

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
challenge

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.620 
challenge
/<00:00:25.099> experiment<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.490> I've<00:00:27.119> been<00:00:27.300> learning<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
/ experiment and I've been learning a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.389 
/ experiment and I've been learning a
lot<00:00:28.160> especially<00:00:29.160> how<00:00:30.500> fantastic<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.740> hot<00:00:32.189> water

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
lot especially how fantastic a hot water

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.410 
lot especially how fantastic a hot water
heater<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.450> how<00:00:33.809> great<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.500> have

heater is and how great it is to have

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.139 
heater is and how great it is to have
regular<00:00:36.420> wine<00:00:36.899> running<00:00:37.410> water<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.969> have<00:00:38.969> been

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
regular wine running water I have been

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.889 
regular wine running water I have been
using<00:00:39.620> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> miniature<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
using this is a miniature but this is

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.889 
using this is a miniature but this is
what<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> use<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:44.120> transport<00:00:45.120> water<00:00:45.390> from<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
what I use to transport water from the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.799 
what I use to transport water from the
bathtub<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> stove<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.489> heat<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.570> order

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
bathtub to the stove to heat it in order

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.180 
bathtub to the stove to heat it in order
to<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.530> sort<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> live<00:00:51.949> similarly<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
to really sort of live similarly to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.790 
to really sort of live similarly to
people<00:00:53.550> who<00:00:54.030> don't<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.660> access<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.620> I

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
people who don't have access to it and I

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.010 
people who don't have access to it and I
mean<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.489> don't<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.789> running<00:00:57.629> water<00:00:57.780> in

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
mean it they don't have running water in

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.560 
mean it they don't have running water in
their<00:00:58.230> home<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.219> water<00:00:59.699> they<00:00:59.940> bring<00:01:00.359> in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
their home so the water they bring in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.479 
their home so the water they bring in
they<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.199> heat<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> stove<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
they have to heat it on a stove like I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060 
they have to heat it on a stove like I
do<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:03.449> takes<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.750> very<00:01:04.019> long<00:01:04.140> time<00:01:04.320> over<00:01:04.979> an

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
do it takes a very long time over an

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.450 
do it takes a very long time over an
hour<00:01:05.510> for<00:01:06.510> me<00:01:06.659> -<00:01:06.869> he<00:01:07.080> didn't<00:01:07.350> heat<00:01:07.950> an<00:01:08.189> entire

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
hour for me - he didn't heat an entire

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.810 
hour for me - he didn't heat an entire
tub<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> by<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> time<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.689> full<00:01:10.380> tub<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:11.159> heated

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
tub and by the time a full tub is heated

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.570 
tub and by the time a full tub is heated
it's<00:01:12.000> more<00:01:12.360> or<00:01:13.260> less<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.860> half<00:01:16.040> plus<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.220> minus

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it's more or less a half plus or minus

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
it's more or less a half plus or minus
and<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.720> may<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.229> appreciate<00:01:20.119> baths

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
and it's may really appreciate baths

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.920 
and it's may really appreciate baths

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
experiment and that's definitely a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.149 
experiment and that's definitely a
learning<00:01:31.170> experience<00:01:31.579> have<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.820> ever<00:01:34.159> had

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
does learning more about how difficult

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.289

it's<00:02:00.210> more<00:02:00.360> difficult<00:02:00.540> women<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.259> jobs

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it's more difficult women to have jobs

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
it's more difficult women to have jobs
