distortion<00:02:25.450> really<00:02:25.690> well<00:02:25.990> just<00:02:26.800> because<00:02:27.130> it

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
distortion really well just because it

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.210

has more of a I don't know the neck is
more<00:02:30.400> slim<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.780> it's<00:02:32.110> really<00:02:32.290> good<00:02:32.530> for

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
more slim so it's really good for
