00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
standards that I've set which is that I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.180 
standards that I've set which is that I
want<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> case<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.410> doesn't<00:00:52.739> feel<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:52.949> I

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
want a case that doesn't feel like I

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
want a case that doesn't feel like I
have<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> case<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.820> at<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.110> meets

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
have a case on at all and this one meets

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.799 
have a case on at all and this one meets
that<00:00:55.649> criteria<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.730> minimal<00:00:57.000> very

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
that criteria it is very minimal very

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
that criteria it is very minimal very
thin<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.320> fact<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.739> doesn't<00:00:58.949> really<00:00:59.190> add<00:00:59.399> much

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
thin in fact it doesn't really add much

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.450 
thin in fact it doesn't really add much
width<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.570> phone<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:01.020> all<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.980> has<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.129> nice

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
width to the phone at all it has a nice

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.130 
width to the phone at all it has a nice
feel<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.270> has<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.110> of

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
feel to it it really has it's kind of

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
feel to it it really has it's kind of
like<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> rubbery<00:01:04.650> feel<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.210> phone

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
like a rubbery feel so if the phone

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.700 
like a rubbery feel so if the phone
feels<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.689> little<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:06.960> more<00:01:07.020> stable<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.619> my

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
feels a little bit more stable in my

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.830 
feels a little bit more stable in my
hand<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.610> cameras<00:01:08.970> fine<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.479> doesn't<00:01:09.630> block

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
hand the cameras fine it doesn't block

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.359 
hand the cameras fine it doesn't block
the<00:01:09.900> camera<00:01:10.350> doesn't<00:01:10.680> block<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.860> volume

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
the camera doesn't block the volume

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.820 
the camera doesn't block the volume
buttons<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.119> bottom<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> free<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.470> clear<00:01:13.650> so

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
buttons the bottom is free and clear so

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.590 
buttons the bottom is free and clear so
I<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:13.920> plug<00:01:14.280> things<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.820> without<00:01:15.090> having<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
I can plug things in without having to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.320 
I can plug things in without having to
move<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.500> case<00:01:16.770> around<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
move the case around to get there and it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.050 
move the case around to get there and it
also<00:01:18.540> comes<00:01:18.990> off<00:01:19.290> as<00:01:19.590> easily<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.640> goes<00:01:20.820> on

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
also comes off as easily as it goes on

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.929 
also comes off as easily as it goes on
so<00:01:21.479> all<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.590> those<00:01:22.710> things<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.790> been

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so all of those things have really been

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.149 
so all of those things have really been
put<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.720> case<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.860> very

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
put into this case and it's like very

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.100 
put into this case and it's like very
inexpensive<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.030> well<00:01:27.330> under<00:01:27.570> $10

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
inexpensive like well under $10

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.620 
inexpensive like well under $10
inexpensive<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.420> something

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
inexpensive so this is really something

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
inexpensive so this is really something

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
nice job of that it does have a little

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.399 
nice job of that it does have a little
bit<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> lip<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:39.570> also<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.960> prevent<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
bit of a lip on here also to prevent the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.920 
bit of a lip on here also to prevent the
screen<00:01:40.740> from<00:01:41.070> touching<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> surface<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
screen from touching the surface of a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.240 
screen from touching the surface of a
desk<00:01:43.140> or<00:01:43.320> something<00:01:43.350> when<00:01:43.740> you're<00:01:43.860> there

desk or something when you're there
mine<00:01:44.759> doesn't<00:01:45.270> only<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
mine doesn't only because I have the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.410 
mine doesn't only because I have the
dent<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:46.890> phone<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.909> side<00:01:48.180> gets

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
dent on my phone so this side gets

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.969 
dent on my phone so this side gets
propped<00:01:48.750> up<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.170> bit<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.680> had<00:01:49.829> this

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
propped up a little bit so if I had this

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
propped up a little bit so if I had this
a<00:01:50.009> little<00:01:50.189> bit<00:01:50.369> earlier<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.939> probably<00:01:51.270> would

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
a little bit earlier I probably would

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.600 
a little bit earlier I probably would
have<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> perfect<00:01:52.320> fit<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:52.740> because<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.340> banged

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
have a perfect fit but because I banged

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.639 
have a perfect fit but because I banged
up<00:01:53.729> my<00:01:53.790> phone<00:01:54.060> ahead<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.390> time<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.259> doesn't<00:01:55.530> fit

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
up my phone ahead of time it doesn't fit

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.010 
up my phone ahead of time it doesn't fit
as<00:01:55.829> well<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.299> say<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.630> case<00:01:57.840> from

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
as well but I have to say this case from

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.499 
as well but I have to say this case from
totally<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.939> am<00:02:00.149> really

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
totally is one that I am really

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.389 
totally is one that I am really
impressed<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.680> not<00:02:01.860> overpriced

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
impressed with and it's not overpriced

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.249 
impressed with and it's not overpriced
either<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.909> really<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> fair<00:02:03.659> price

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
either this is really a fair price

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.950 
either this is really a fair price
good<00:02:04.920> minimal<00:02:05.369> case<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.479> protect<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
good minimal case that will protect the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.359 
good minimal case that will protect the
metal<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.320> your<00:02:07.409> phone<00:02:07.680> from<00:02:07.829> getting<00:02:08.160> banged

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
metal on your phone from getting banged

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.699 
metal on your phone from getting banged
up<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.810> likely<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:09.989> prevent<00:02:10.440> some

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
up and likely will prevent some

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.050 
up and likely will prevent some
scratches<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.310> screen<00:02:11.550> because<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.879> does

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
scratches on your screen because it does

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
scratches on your screen because it does
just<00:02:12.989> prop<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.379> screen

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
just slightly above the surface of a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.179
