00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:02.820
 after the first mountain abba koster 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.460
 but just see that 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.570
 the classification riders will then be 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.980
 the truck where training is going to start now the condition and the team is god 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.170
 no aches and pains no sick kim the silos that is what has been sick that 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.390
 it seems to be recovering well and for the rest everyone is fit 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.050
 twente 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.569
 I'm curious about the museum 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.640
 additionally let you know 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.489
 with doing things among others 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.539
 during the second version because it is an import referendum 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.830
 than a million because if you're being fooled, you have to be fooled 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 what is going on lives 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.520
 of course 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
 if not why not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.079
 super besse 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.250
 the first introduction to the mountains, but second category 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.020
 the first weeks of tour de france already have some steep climbs 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.570
 but are also rejected 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.570
 another analyst maarten altena 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.330
 from the repertoire 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.180
 he had been heard of what 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.260
 from a year earlier 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.320
 we have no major problems but 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.270
 the last two years to reclaim the reason 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.820
 there are always this way worldwide 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.420
 we were working 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.420
 it's this for the sprinter said 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 to hold 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.150
 the wounded, among whom Charles Doorman 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.590
 rabobank investigates the origin 9 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.790
 also comes the first Dutchman, he is now 97th in the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.460
 general classification 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.810
 the care posts also have a tough day 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.260
 on top of the site best of the rest 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.550
 and upon return 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550
 the much needed mass 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.940
 yes those are all days stay 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.489
 unfortunately had to sell 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.620
 as expected the fastest shutdown 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.389
 then bring it in the morning 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.549
 I always agree 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:15.600
 that we then 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.700
 together with 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.589
 after that time 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.769
 Every summer has its duties what you need to do in order to 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 prohibit photos to feed 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.509
 if you come late but start made 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.619
 8 i'm still a year 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.229
 you think it'll be alright for tomorrow's mounts 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.229
 a pity it the editors know 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.629
 we will certainly succeed with one
