00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
however it will only affect the player

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.080 
however it will only affect the player
when<00:00:22.140> it's<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.500> boots<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.400> comes<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.880> three

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
when it's on the boots it comes in three

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.759 
when it's on the boots it comes in three
different<00:00:24.390> levels<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.170> episode<00:00:25.350> we

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
different levels and in this episode we

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:26.990 
different levels and in this episode we
are<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.160> find<00:00:26.369> out<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> difference

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
are going to find out the difference

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.910 
are going to find out the difference
between<00:00:27.090> each<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.750> these<00:00:27.840> levels<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.320> well<00:00:28.800> as

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
between each of these levels as well as

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.470 
between each of these levels as well as
finding<00:00:29.130> out<00:00:29.340> other<00:00:29.519> useful<00:00:29.970> information

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
finding out other useful information

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.659 
finding out other useful information
about<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.990> enchantment<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:32.040> example<00:00:32.489> we

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
about this enchantment for example we

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.250 
about this enchantment for example we
want<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.940> find<00:00:33.149> out<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.690> affects<00:00:33.960> players

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
want to find out if it affects players

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.690 
want to find out if it affects players
differently<00:00:34.770> if<00:00:34.920> they<00:00:35.100> are<00:00:35.190> partially

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
differently if they are partially

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.060 
differently if they are partially
submerged<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.660> fully<00:00:36.960> submerged<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.680> water

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
submerged or fully submerged in water

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.310 
submerged or fully submerged in water
so<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.579> built<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.030> testing<00:00:39.450> facility<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.140> do

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so I built this testing facility to do

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
so I built this testing facility to do
so<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:41.010> will<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.250> players<00:00:41.520> walk<00:00:41.760> across<00:00:42.059> all

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
so we will have players walk across all

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.940 
so we will have players walk across all
of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> levels<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.350> compare<00:00:43.770> their

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
of the levels so we can compare their

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.920 
of the levels so we can compare their
speeds<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.719> all

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
speeds and we will do this with all

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.240 
speeds and we will do this with all
three<00:00:46.110> levels<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.739> depth<00:00:46.980> Strider

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
three levels of the depth Strider

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.520 
three levels of the depth Strider
enchantment<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:47.940> well<00:00:48.480> as<00:00:48.629> without<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.289> we<00:00:49.379> can

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
enchantment as well as without so we can

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
enchantment as well as without so we can
get<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> good<00:00:49.950> understanding<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.820> its<00:00:51.000> effect

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
get a good understanding of its effect

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
get a good understanding of its effect
I've<00:00:51.600> also<00:00:52.079> set<00:00:52.440> up<00:00:52.469> these<00:00:52.770> command<00:00:53.160> blocks<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I've also set up these command blocks to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.220 
I've also set up these command blocks to
teleport<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> players<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.629> facing<00:00:54.870> dead

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
teleport the players to be facing dead

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.529 
teleport the players to be facing dead
center<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.309> direction<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.820> our<00:00:57.090> test<00:00:57.360> can

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
center in this direction so our test can

00:00:57.539 --> 00:02:12.260 
center in this direction so our test can
be<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.840> accurate<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.410> possible

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.820 

our<00:02:13.270> tests<00:02:13.690> have<00:02:13.780> shown<00:02:13.810> us<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.320> depths<00:02:14.680> try

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
our tests have shown us that depths try

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.380 
our tests have shown us that depths try
to<00:02:14.890> free<00:02:15.190> will<00:02:15.370> allow<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.820> move<00:02:16.120> through

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
to free will allow you to move through

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.630 
to free will allow you to move through
water<00:02:16.570> at<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> same<00:02:17.170> speed<00:02:17.530> as<00:02:17.740> on<00:02:17.890> land<00:02:18.160> when

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
water at the same speed as on land when

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.640 
water at the same speed as on land when
fully<00:02:18.880> submerged<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:19.540> water<00:02:19.570> or<00:02:20.050> partially

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
fully submerged in water or partially

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.140 
fully submerged in water or partially
this<00:02:21.130> includes<00:02:21.640> when<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.910> player<00:02:22.120> is

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
this includes when the player is

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.660 
this includes when the player is
sprinting<00:02:22.810> or<00:02:22.990> using<00:02:23.350> speed<00:02:23.680> potions<00:02:24.190> but

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
sprinting or using speed potions but

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.610 
sprinting or using speed potions but
there<00:02:24.850> are<00:02:24.970> more<00:02:25.150> questions<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.140> ask<00:02:26.320> I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
there are more questions I have to ask I

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.320 
there are more questions I have to ask I
want<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.920> find<00:02:27.160> out<00:02:27.340> if<00:02:27.670> depth<00:02:28.000> Strider

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
want to find out if depth Strider

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.360 
want to find out if depth Strider
effects<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.870> player<00:02:29.170> when<00:02:29.440> only<00:02:29.800> their<00:02:29.980> head<00:02:30.160> is

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
effects a player when only their head is

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.400 
effects a player when only their head is
submerged<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:30.970> water<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.510> we<00:02:31.870> should<00:02:32.050> also<00:02:32.200> do

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
submerged in water and we should also do

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.260 
submerged in water and we should also do
a<00:02:32.440> test<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.860> see<00:02:33.040> how<00:02:33.220> water<00:02:33.400> streams<00:02:33.850> affect

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
a test to see how water streams affect

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.790 
a test to see how water streams affect
the<00:02:34.360> speed<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.810> player<00:02:35.020> when<00:02:35.560> they<00:02:35.680> are

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
the speed of a player when they are

00:02:35.800 --> 00:03:05.410 
the speed of a player when they are
swimming<00:02:36.070> with<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.670> current<00:02:36.970> or<00:02:37.150> against<00:02:37.720> it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.360 

so<00:03:06.080> there<00:03:06.260> was<00:03:06.350> no<00:03:06.530> difference<00:03:06.890> when<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.220> head

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
so there was no difference when the head

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.070 
so there was no difference when the head
was<00:03:07.400> submerged<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.510> could<00:03:08.690> clearly<00:03:08.990> see

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
was submerged and you could clearly see

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.780 
was submerged and you could clearly see
that<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.530> water<00:03:09.709> current<00:03:09.980> had<00:03:10.220> an<00:03:10.340> effect<00:03:10.640> on

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
that the water current had an effect on

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.820 
that the water current had an effect on
the<00:03:10.910> player<00:03:11.120> allowing<00:03:11.780> them<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.170> go<00:03:12.290> faster

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
the player allowing them to go faster

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.770 
the player allowing them to go faster
than<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.160> regular<00:03:13.520> walking<00:03:13.760> speed<00:03:14.209> but<00:03:14.660> this

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
than the regular walking speed but this

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.210 
than the regular walking speed but this
leaves<00:03:15.050> me<00:03:15.260> with<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:15.470> two<00:03:15.800> more<00:03:15.980> questions

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
leaves me with just two more questions

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.550 
leaves me with just two more questions
what<00:03:16.940> will<00:03:17.060> happen<00:03:17.390> if<00:03:17.540> we<00:03:17.569> use<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.930> cheeky

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
what will happen if we use a cheeky

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.650 
what will happen if we use a cheeky
level<00:03:18.890> ten<00:03:19.130> adept<00:03:19.610> rider<00:03:19.970> enchantment<00:03:20.600> and

level ten adept rider enchantment and

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.500 
level ten adept rider enchantment and
does<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:21.530> affect<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.100> vertical<00:03:22.640> travel<00:03:22.880> for

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
does this affect the vertical travel for

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.030 
does this affect the vertical travel for
this<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:23.870> have<00:03:23.990> set<00:03:24.170> up<00:03:24.200> two<00:03:24.440> sets<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:24.830> water

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.640 

as<00:03:57.300> you<00:03:58.300> saw<00:03:58.510> there<00:03:58.720> was<00:03:58.810> no<00:03:58.990> increased<00:03:59.410> speed

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
as you saw there was no increased speed

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.500 
as you saw there was no increased speed
from<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.890> chichi<00:04:00.280> level<00:04:00.580> 10<00:04:00.760> enchantment<00:04:01.390> and

the<00:04:05.170> questions<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.770> had<00:04:05.890> in<00:04:06.010> mind<00:04:06.190> for<00:04:06.340> this

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
the questions I had in mind for this

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.490 
the questions I had in mind for this
episode<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.210> thought<00:04:07.660> I'd<00:04:07.720> end<00:04:07.960> this<00:04:08.110> one<00:04:08.350> with

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
episode I thought I'd end this one with

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.840 
episode I thought I'd end this one with
a<00:04:08.530> little<00:04:08.680> bit<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:08.950> enchanting<00:04:09.550> to<00:04:09.700> get<00:04:09.820> a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
a little bit of enchanting to get a

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.730 
a little bit of enchanting to get a
rough<00:04:10.120> idea<00:04:10.270> of<00:04:10.510> how<00:04:10.630> common<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.230> enchantment

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
rough idea of how common the enchantment

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.310 
rough idea of how common the enchantment
is<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.460> I<00:04:12.520> enchanted<00:04:13.000> 50<00:04:13.330> boots<00:04:13.540> at<00:04:13.720> level<00:04:13.960> 30

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
is so I enchanted 50 boots at level 30

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.849 
is so I enchanted 50 boots at level 30
and<00:04:14.530> 50<00:04:15.010> at<00:04:15.190> level<00:04:15.520> 24<00:04:16.120> in<00:04:16.450> both<00:04:16.840> tests<00:04:17.320> 33

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
and 50 at level 24 in both tests 33

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.229 
and 50 at level 24 in both tests 33
percent<00:04:18.190> of<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.400> boots<00:04:18.609> had<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:19.000> depth

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
percent of the boots had the depth

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.210 
percent of the boots had the depth
Strider<00:04:19.570> enchantment<00:04:20.170> all<00:04:20.590> of<00:04:20.890> them<00:04:20.980> were<00:04:21.100> at

conclusions<00:04:30.280> from<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.520> little<00:04:30.880> test<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.330> I

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
conclusions from that little test but I

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.940 
conclusions from that little test but I
think<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:31.690> fair<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:32.020> say<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.350> in<00:04:32.500> charm<00:04:32.770> and

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
think it's fair to say the in charm and

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.800 
think it's fair to say the in charm and
his<00:04:33.010> frequent<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.640> not<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.120> rare<00:04:34.420> one<00:04:34.630> to

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
his frequent and not a rare one to

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.750 
his frequent and not a rare one to
obtain<00:04:35.200> but<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.800> wraps<00:04:36.010> things<00:04:36.130> up<00:04:36.430> for<00:04:36.640> this
