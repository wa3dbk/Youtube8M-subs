 of Tubas a news about is the rockstar 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.039
 games how true is personal 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.230
 rockstar is present in two times 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.809
 for example I do not know if it reaches the disk 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.489
 already over but the September rockstar or 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.340
 is present right 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.240
 games as personal have been filtered from 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.420
 images within dengue how to where civil 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.520
 is a logo of none of the plates that is 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.479
 completely enclosed completely 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.650
 closed is a rockstar logo then 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.939
 this means that rockstar is 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.900
 present at the event but many people 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.630
 to think that it 's rockstar could say 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.689
 something about new luces 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.509
 project is the 5 subway network within 2 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:39.240
 or even gta 6 a new gta maybe 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.780
 for the pc or the consoles or what 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.360
 for 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.850
 In this games call I 'm not sure if 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.610
 they have spoken something or not 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.860
 good to talk at the end of the event or not 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.930
 river with the feeling that they did not 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.149
 nothing will happen in this event, I 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.810
 simply wanted to be present 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:00.030
 to give that I will say 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.560
 something extra 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.290
 do not know 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.119
 Who knows anything I do not know if I 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.489
 I already saw something like that they already spoke 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.140
 last night or something like that 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.270
 I do not know how you do not have to 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.920
 but if they have already spoken about 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.760
 something related to games call me 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.650
 tell us in the comments 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.810
 You already know it or not, but I have to 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.580

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.780

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.410
 the staff come there i do not know how to book 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.720

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.180
 announce nothing because the only thing that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.410
 was made so far of the new gta I do not know 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.230
 It's going to be newspaper 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.810
 but the only new thing made about the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.130
 new gta is that I'm already starting to 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.769
 history or design is produced or 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.780
 whatever i do not know what i know is that already 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:54.569
 is starting to be produced the new 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:57.660
 gta gta is not a new or 36 GTA 5 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.690
 Your grandfather gta5 adventures for example 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.480

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.190
 I know is that is coming and this is the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.510
 reason of this video comes a new god and 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.940
 single player 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.459
 is not a new god and with new cars 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.150
 new things is not a new god ever 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:22.799
 online is a new god and for the single 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.880
 player or is that the thing that comes there 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.810
 crazy and new to trevor franklin and 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.620
 michael 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.790
 or it will be coming crazy new missions 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:41.060
 and sentra frontier is to see the chicken and 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:46.079
 promaica on will one of them go 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:50.670
 revolutionary with a new character 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:53.280
 in gt I get a new story there in a 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.120
 new fully modified story 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.340
 or can it be thousands of things 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.500
 the more likely it is that they will be 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.600
 gave new missions of new 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.290
 history or the continuation of the history of 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.420
 franklin michael idriver being michael 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.430
 in the end michael not a franklin in the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.700
 have chosen not to kill any of the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.110
 two 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.049
 protagonists neither the coach nor 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.739
 michael ball goes to those who still 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.600
 did not arrive 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.639
 I visited the five were to know now 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.220
 which may have multiple endings 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.960
 gt is so good it's basically that 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.460
 There is not much else to see this 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.050
 video is more than anything news 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.930
 More little I want to know more 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.060
 than all your opinion and create me 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.340
 talk also about my personal opinion 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.740
 in fact I wish there was a 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.690
 new character to have so is very 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.120
 impossible that it will happen but 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.010
 never wait is phenom is the possibility 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.090
 that there is a new character to 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.970
 possibility of new 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.639
 layoffs for training mike franklin and the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.950
 more likely it is that I will 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.960
 to like, I'll be able to go back to 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.389
 play with the single player new thing to 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.910
 do new missions with several new 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.040
 map missions new characters that 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.650
 we can find the map to 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.169
 ask if you have any kind of mission 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.820
 If you want to do with us, I know a lot. 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:11.970

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.820
 little god in strength of teaching in this 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.530
 gta5 is for example gymnasiums that kind of 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.660
 things that come down so we can 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.610
 to train our muscles that kind of 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.560
 things thing that is not going to happen anymore 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.350
 happen at gta san andreas 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.550
 Yeah you remember but that's it. 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.440
 staff does not have much else to say 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.789

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.370

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:25.270

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:42.220
 time making gta5 become gta san 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.350
 with the character of the site and 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.710
 make the missions decide this is a 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.720
 absurd i would be brutal series crazy 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.430

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.660
 Guys, I did some things here. 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.370

 Yes, you wish there were bells and 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.360
 would like type of moose to force 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.040
 you would like to see a new gta 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.990
 you would like to see money 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.820
 a remastering of having this 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.540
 average if you would like there to be a 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:19.480
 Retreat of 22 or if it was a new game 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:22.960
 completely random was signed with 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.060
 gta also the intention of the state is secular 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.530
 per item as in plus 900 by you 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.430
 You liked it today, we're going to have five 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.820
 videos on the channel 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:33.520
 This is the 2nd way, let's have more of the video. 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:37.900
 in a different game very crazy 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.210
 Let's have a neighbor, it 's super sweet. 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.980
 and we will also have another neighbor of tea 

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.180
 today is good, that's it but others 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.800
 so many proposals have a character 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.800
 procedural well
