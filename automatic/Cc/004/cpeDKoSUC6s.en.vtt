00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
this one's definitely different I don't

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.839 
this one's definitely different I don't
even<00:04:00.560> really<00:04:00.709> smell<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.160> cinnamon<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:01.700> one

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
even really smell the cinnamon this one

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.390 
even really smell the cinnamon this one
it<00:04:02.000> kind<00:04:02.180> of<00:04:02.329> smells<00:04:02.510> like<00:04:02.690> banana<00:04:03.139> bread<00:04:03.470> but

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
it kind of smells like banana bread but

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.339 
it kind of smells like banana bread but
it<00:04:04.489> has<00:04:04.579> like<00:04:04.760> bad<00:04:04.940> nutty<00:04:05.209> flavor<00:04:05.569> as<00:04:05.840> well<00:04:05.870> and

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
it has like bad nutty flavor as well and

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.319 
it has like bad nutty flavor as well and
I<00:04:06.380> just<00:04:06.560> think<00:04:06.769> this<00:04:06.859> one<00:04:07.040> smells<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.940> good<00:04:08.209> if

which<00:04:17.359> is<00:04:17.479> completely<00:04:17.900> fine<00:04:18.109> so<00:04:18.349> I<00:04:18.380> wanted<00:04:18.650> to

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
which is completely fine so I wanted to

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.690

this candle last spring when it came out

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.360 
this candle last spring when it came out
and<00:04:29.720> it<00:04:30.140> smells<00:04:30.470> good<00:04:30.710> but<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:30.980> wasn't<00:04:31.100> for<00:04:31.340> me

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
and it smells good but it wasn't for me
