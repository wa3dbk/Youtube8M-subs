00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.970
 I was born in Brazil and started playing soccer when I was eight years old 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.010
 I love football and I had a lot of fun training and having a good time 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.249
 that was the purpose of football in my life when 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.499
 Currently in my life and my career, I set goals and objectives 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.910
 and this is why everything I do has a direction and purpose 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.420
 I think this is what gives me the motivation to strive for my 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.420
 dreams 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.420
 in 2000 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.070
 I played for the youth team of Sao Paulo 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.240
 and in the middle of the championship he received a yellow card 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.929
 he was suspended for a game 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.119
 so I took advantage of the free weekend I had to visit my 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.520
 grandparents 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.750
 my brother and I were an amusement water park 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.490
 and landslides or bread 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.100
 the blow to the head with the bottom of the pool 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980
 my neck broke 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.980
 he had fractured the sixth vertebra 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.980
 I returned to the training sessions Sao Paulo but I could not stand the 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.760
 pain all including doctors 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.010
 they told me that I was very lucky 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.180
 I could be paralyzed and lose my ability to walk and play soccer 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.750
 but I do not think it was luck, I think God works 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.710
 I started playing again in 2001 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.590
 and almost after two weeks they called me to play on the team 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.780
 professional sao paulo 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.950
 I believe that God had a following initial purpose 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.710
 and I think it was not a coincidence, it was something that happened just before we started 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.740
 blessing of my career as a professional player 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.840
 It was a great scene 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 whether in my life 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.520
 kakÃ¡ is a very special person 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.259
 since the qualifiers of the world cup in 2001 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.559
 we played together in the national team of brazil 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.419
 we are friends your character 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.799
 It is faultless 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.829
 and all the time I've known him his walk with God 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.900
 is an example for all of us 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.900
 lime 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.769
 losing is part of the game 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.749
 we play two or three games a week and we have some and we lose others 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.849
 but defeats can teach us 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.689
 the team of your time for reflection 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.619
 it's hard 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:46.119
 I have defeats that have marked my life like losing the cup final 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.119
 World of 2006 against France 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.129
 I have also had many victories 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.129
 but the defeats an old woman 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:07.289
 in 2002 I played for the Brazilian team for the first time I was 20 years old 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.609
 it's a feeling that goes beyond words 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.749
 the first time I heard the national anthem the foot singing it with the 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.159
 National selection 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.919
 and with the whole stadium 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.919
 It gave me great emotion 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:30.859
 in the 2002 world cup I played only 25 minutes in a game against 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:31.809
 Costa Rica 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.469
 but I felt like a world champion 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:38.510
 when the final whistle sounded in the last match per day the court and 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.509
 The only thing I could do was to purify and thank God 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.009
 I knew that everyone was watching the game millions of people 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.199
 glued to the television 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.199
 the great emotion of being a champion was almost too much 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.989
 inter neither the sun nor illusion by masters points 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.719
 for me and it was really special to be in that group and be world champion 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.719
 example 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:05.499
 the fact of playing with a great team 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.709
 playing in the national team the fact of having a wife and family that 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.579
 support 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.939
 it just shows me that I need God even more for all these demands 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.699
 I think it's in these moments that we need more assets, I always tell him 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.730
 to people including my wife and children who need to search first 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.800
 pockets and he will take care of what remains 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.809
 regardless of what you have who you are where you grimace what does that 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:36.809
 part of your job or your profession 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
 jesus figa lover the same way 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.189
 for me I see this when he won 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.189
 when I lose or even when he died 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.889
 in the eyes of God I am the same person and the menu will continue to command 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.490
 in the same way 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.490
 I think this is what brings us all to him 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.509
 we have a father who loves us and has a plan for us 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.259
 I'm not talking about a fairy tale god 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.090
 I'm talking about a god that I experienced and that has changed my life 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.629
 and that changes and transforms me every day in a very ugly way 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.650
 I want to share with you a spiritual secret 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.740
 when we got married my wife and I were virgins 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.440
 I'm not going to tell you that it was easy because there were many temptations 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.270
 We spent a lot of time praying and walking near Jesus 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.109
 It was a great challenge but it was worth having waited 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:43.650
 I am living many of my dreams 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.000
 the bible tells us that God is capable of doing immensely more than what 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.520
 we ask or imagine 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.520
 and I think that's what has happened in my life 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.319
 I play soccer because I have a talent given by God and professionally or that 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:03.029
 individual talent jesus said apart from it can do anything and I believe it 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:08.679
 jesus said I am the way the truth and life nobody comes to the father but is for 

00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:09.180
 my 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.630
 God gave me a second chance and accepted me as his 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.229
 he made a sacrifice on the cross for me 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.500
 if only football had fame to the title if it had no god it would not be 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:23.689
 happy without a doubt 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:27.759
 Today I can say that God has done things in my life that I could never have 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.419
 imagined 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.189
 in the end 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:34.430
 mates do well 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.430
 10 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.560
 three campaigns
