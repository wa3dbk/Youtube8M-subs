00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
hi and in this video I'm going to be

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.820 
hi and in this video I'm going to be
talking<00:00:05.549> about<00:00:05.879> what<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.960> muscle<00:00:07.410> imbalance

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
talking about what a muscle imbalance

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.410 
talking about what a muscle imbalance
actually<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:09.230> so<00:00:10.250> to<00:00:11.250> give<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.610> an<00:00:11.670> example<00:00:12.059> I

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
actually is so to give you an example I

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.740 
actually is so to give you an example I
have<00:00:13.049> my<00:00:13.230> arm<00:00:13.590> here<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.610> every<00:00:14.969> time<00:00:15.000> I<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.570> to

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
have my arm here so every time I have to

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.040 
have my arm here so every time I have to
bend<00:00:16.020> my<00:00:16.170> arm<00:00:16.410> my<00:00:17.220> bicep<00:00:17.760> muscle<00:00:18.150> has<00:00:18.690> to

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
bend my arm my bicep muscle has to

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.620 
bend my arm my bicep muscle has to
contract<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.189> order<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.789> bend<00:00:21.000> my<00:00:21.119> elbow<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
contract in order to bend my elbow and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.200 
contract in order to bend my elbow and
every<00:00:22.140> time<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.380> straighten<00:00:22.980> out<00:00:23.100> my<00:00:23.130> elbow<00:00:23.730> my

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
every time I straighten out my elbow my

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.070 
every time I straighten out my elbow my
tricep<00:00:24.840> has<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.380> tighten<00:00:25.800> up<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:27.080> straighten

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
tricep has to tighten up to straighten

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.859 
tricep has to tighten up to straighten
out<00:00:28.260> my<00:00:28.609> elbow<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.760> arm<00:00:29.970> okay<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
out my elbow my arm okay but a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.770 
out my elbow my arm okay but a
phenomenon<00:00:31.439> happens<00:00:31.890> where<00:00:32.189> whenever<00:00:32.669> I

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
phenomenon happens where whenever I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
time I straighten out my tricep the same

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.580 
time I straighten out my tricep the same
same<00:00:47.160> thing<00:00:47.460> happens<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.510> tricep<00:00:49.110> has<00:00:49.320> to

that<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.539> happen<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.579> what<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:56.940> call

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that to happen now that is what we call

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.760 
that to happen now that is what we call
a<00:00:57.180> reciprocal<00:00:57.840> inhibition<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
a reciprocal inhibition which is a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.189 
a reciprocal inhibition which is a
technical<00:00:59.250> term<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.879> every<00:01:00.480> single<00:01:00.750> time<00:01:00.960> one

is when it's a muscle imbalance where
whenever<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.890> bicep<00:01:17.310> Titans<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.360> then<00:01:18.540> tries

whenever my bicep Titans but then tries
to<00:01:18.869> extend<00:01:19.700> I'm<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:21.119> able<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.689> extend<00:01:22.140> my

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
to extend I'm not able to extend my

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.520 
to extend I'm not able to extend my
elbow<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.850> way<00:01:24.000> okay<00:01:24.750> now<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
elbow all the way okay now that's what a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
elbow all the way okay now that's what a
muscle<00:01:25.860> imbalance<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.640> i<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.299> range

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
muscle imbalance is so i can have range

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.740 
muscle imbalance is so i can have range
of<00:01:27.720> motion<00:01:28.020> through<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.650> because<00:01:29.579> my<00:01:29.850> biceps

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
of motion through here because my biceps

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.530 
of motion through here because my biceps
overworked<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.310> extremely<00:01:33.119> hard<00:01:33.390> for

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
overworked but it's extremely hard for

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
overworked but it's extremely hard for
me<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.930> straighten<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.680> arm<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.340> way

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
me to straighten out my arm all the way

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.390 
me to straighten out my arm all the way
so<00:01:36.360> i'm<00:01:36.750> lacking<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.500> range<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.979> motion

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
so i'm lacking this range of motion

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.240 
so i'm lacking this range of motion
that's<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.479> call<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.930> muscle<00:01:40.439> imbalance

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that's what we call a muscle imbalance

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.760 
that's what we call a muscle imbalance
is<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.210> bicep<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.020> stronger<00:01:43.500> than<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
is when the bicep is stronger than the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.179 
is when the bicep is stronger than the
tricep<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.640> i<00:01:45.420> don't<00:01:45.899> no<00:01:46.200> longer<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.890> this

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
tricep and i don't no longer have this

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.999 
tricep and i don't no longer have this
range<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.700> motion<00:01:48.060> okay<00:01:48.659> now<00:01:49.140> i<00:01:49.470> want<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
range of motion okay now i want you to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.310 
range of motion okay now i want you to
think<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.520> concept<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.930> that's

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
think about that concept because that's

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.929 
think about that concept because that's
what's<00:01:52.560> good<00:01:52.710> happening<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.369> over<00:01:53.430> our

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
what's good happening all over our

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.020 
what's good happening all over our
bodies<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.840> time<00:01:55.579> depending<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.729> what

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
bodies all the time depending on what

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.760 
bodies all the time depending on what
profession<00:01:57.570> we're<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.899> depend<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.619> we're

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
profession we're in depend on what we're

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
profession we're in depend on what we're
doing<00:01:59.040> every<00:01:59.369> single<00:01:59.490> day<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.909> our<00:02:00.000> life

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
doing every single day of our life

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.520 
doing every single day of our life
repetitive<00:02:02.790> movements<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:04.079> work<00:02:04.259> more

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
repetitive movements we work more

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.800 
repetitive movements we work more
muscles<00:02:04.979> more<00:02:05.189> than<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> other<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> lot

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
muscles more than the other like a lot

example of a muscle imbalance that now

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.370 
example of a muscle imbalance that now
there's<00:02:18.130> three<00:02:18.190> different<00:02:18.460> kinds<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.420> muscle

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
there's three different kinds of muscle

there's three different kinds of muscle
imbalances<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.520> want<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.030> teach<00:02:22.240> you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
imbalances that I want to teach you

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.390 
imbalances that I want to teach you
about<00:02:22.510> I'm<00:02:23.410> going<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.620> put<00:02:23.860> all<00:02:24.130> three<00:02:24.340> of

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
about I'm going to put all three of

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.730 
about I'm going to put all three of

sometimes headaches and the trapezius

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.850 
sometimes headaches and the trapezius
you<00:02:37.000> need<00:02:37.180> massage<00:02:37.959> who<00:02:38.470> doesn't<00:02:38.770> need

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
you need massage who doesn't need

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.699 
you need massage who doesn't need
massage<00:02:39.160> right<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.350> upper

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
massage right that is the upper

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.220 
massage right that is the upper
extremities<00:02:42.340> posture<00:02:43.270> ok<00:02:43.780> now<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
extremities posture ok now the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.560 
extremities posture ok now the
lumbo-pelvic<00:02:44.860> hip<00:02:45.430> complex<00:02:45.940> which<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.270> just<00:02:46.450> a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
lumbo-pelvic hip complex which is just a

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.030 
lumbo-pelvic hip complex which is just a
testicle<00:02:48.570> terminology<00:02:49.570> for<00:02:49.870> your<00:02:49.930> hips<00:02:50.320> and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
testicle terminology for your hips and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.330 
testicle terminology for your hips and
your<00:02:51.400> lower<00:02:51.550> back<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:53.290> can<00:02:53.560> deviate<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.190> like

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
your lower back that can deviate so like

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.580 
your lower back that can deviate so like
if<00:02:54.459> your<00:02:54.580> pelvis<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.239> tilted<00:02:55.480> forward<00:02:55.900> that's

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
if your pelvis is tilted forward that's

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.380 
if your pelvis is tilted forward that's
what<00:02:56.770> we<00:02:56.860> call<00:02:57.100> an<00:02:57.250> anterior<00:02:57.850> pelvic<00:02:58.030> tilt

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
what we call an anterior pelvic tilt

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.380 
what we call an anterior pelvic tilt
tilt<00:02:59.010> anterior<00:03:00.010> meeting<00:03:00.280> forward<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.180> that

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
tilt anterior meeting forward and that

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.330 
tilt anterior meeting forward and that
can<00:03:01.630> actually<00:03:02.140> cause<00:03:02.350> some<00:03:02.620> lower<00:03:02.800> back<00:03:03.040> pain

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
can actually cause some lower back pain

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.030 
can actually cause some lower back pain
in<00:03:03.520> reverse<00:03:04.390> if<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.230> have<00:03:05.380> too<00:03:05.590> much<00:03:05.800> of<00:03:05.980> a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
in reverse if you have too much of a

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.970 
in reverse if you have too much of a
posterior<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:07.450> know<00:03:07.570> just<00:03:07.930> your<00:03:08.320> spine<00:03:08.620> isn't

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
posterior you know just your spine isn't

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.100 
posterior you know just your spine isn't
doesn't<00:03:09.459> have<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.880> good<00:03:10.150> arch<00:03:10.420> support<00:03:10.480> and

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
doesn't have that good arch support and

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.350 
doesn't have that good arch support and
you<00:03:11.500> start<00:03:11.739> getting<00:03:11.890> pain<00:03:12.220> as<00:03:12.370> well<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:13.120> those

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
you start getting pain as well so those

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.210 
you start getting pain as well so those
are<00:03:13.390> two<00:03:13.660> different<00:03:14.110> deviations<00:03:14.620> in<00:03:14.830> the

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
are two different deviations in the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.699 
are two different deviations in the
middle<00:03:15.549> section<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.030> our<00:03:16.150> body<00:03:16.360> okay<00:03:16.989> then<00:03:17.500> we

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
middle section of our body okay then we

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.620 
middle section of our body okay then we
have<00:03:17.950> our<00:03:18.100> lower<00:03:18.340> extremities<00:03:19.060> which<00:03:19.209> are<00:03:19.420> our

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
have our lower extremities which are our

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.530 
have our lower extremities which are our
feet<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:21.040> you've<00:03:21.400> probably<00:03:21.730> seen<00:03:22.000> people<00:03:22.360> if

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
feet so you've probably seen people if

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.320 
feet so you've probably seen people if
not<00:03:22.570> yourself<00:03:23.170> where<00:03:23.799> your<00:03:23.920> feet<00:03:24.190> are

not yourself where your feet are

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.110 
not yourself where your feet are
outlined<00:03:25.330> like<00:03:25.630> this<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.170> as<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.130> walk<00:03:27.400> you

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
outlined like this and as you walk you

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.970 
outlined like this and as you walk you
might<00:03:28.360> roll<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:28.959> which<00:03:29.170> is<00:03:29.290> called<00:03:29.500> pronation

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
might roll in which is called pronation

some<00:03:30.640> people<00:03:31.090> supinate<00:03:31.690> where<00:03:31.840> they<00:03:31.930> roll<00:03:32.170> out

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
some people supinate where they roll out

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.560 
some people supinate where they roll out
words<00:03:32.799> too<00:03:33.070> much<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.580> they<00:03:33.850> get<00:03:34.000> ankle<00:03:34.390> pain

words too much and they get ankle pain

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.630 
words too much and they get ankle pain
shin<00:03:35.019> splints<00:03:35.440> sometimes<00:03:35.830> even<00:03:36.070> need<00:03:36.310> pain

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
shin splints sometimes even need pain

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.600 
shin splints sometimes even need pain
from<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.480> you'll<00:03:38.230> also<00:03:38.470> notice<00:03:38.890> some

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
from that and you'll also notice some

wear and tear on the treads of your
shoes<00:03:42.239> those<00:03:43.239> are<00:03:43.390> three<00:03:43.600> different<00:03:43.930> symptoms

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
shoes those are three different symptoms

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.699 
shoes those are three different symptoms
of<00:03:44.910> muscle<00:03:45.910> imbalances<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:46.959> we're<00:03:47.560> going<00:03:47.680> to

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
of muscle imbalances and we're going to

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.180 
of muscle imbalances and we're going to
go<00:03:48.100> into<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.700> video<00:03:49.120> for<00:03:49.420> each<00:03:49.600> one<00:03:50.160> break<00:03:51.160> that

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
go into a video for each one break that

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.660 
go into a video for each one break that
down<00:03:51.730> even<00:03:52.269> further<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:53.110> explain<00:03:54.010> why<00:03:54.610> you

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
down even further and explain why you

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.500 
down even further and explain why you
get<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.650> what<00:03:56.650> muscles<00:03:57.250> are<00:03:57.489> working<00:03:57.850> in

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
get that what muscles are working in

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.620 
get that what muscles are working in
order<00:03:59.320> I<00:03:59.560> mean<00:03:59.860> are<00:04:00.100> too<00:04:00.459> tight<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.299> reasons

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
order I mean are too tight the reasons

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.090 
order I mean are too tight the reasons
why<00:04:01.750> you<00:04:01.810> have<00:04:02.019> it<00:04:02.170> what<00:04:02.410> muscles<00:04:02.829> are<00:04:03.070> not

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
why you have it what muscles are not

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.270 
why you have it what muscles are not
strong<00:04:03.670> enough<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.780> what<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.829> can<00:04:06.040> do
