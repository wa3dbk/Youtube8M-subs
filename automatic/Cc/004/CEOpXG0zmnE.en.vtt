00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hi girls, everything is good today, I decided 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.349
 save the party invitation video 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.410
 lili if her party went early from the small 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.379
 mermaid but she decided to switch to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.020
 France and even having already made several 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.550
 Have a few little things, I'll solve it. 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.130
 let him change 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.869
 so I'm making an invitation I 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.660
 wanted to make an invitation and with more 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.420
 straight because I bought you silo that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.430
 that cutting machine but I do not like it 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.760
 very worn blade and the base of it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.730
 because there is only one then I try to do the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.579
 what can i do if hatch i do only 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.140
 Bad things are flimsy lines like that 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.770
 who has how 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.870
 but it's the invitation I thought it was a 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 Grace I got an idea on the internet, I 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.020
 I've been adapting and I'm going to show you 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.640
 I cut a rectangle of paper 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.340
 metallic blue and even 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.549
 invitation over the invitation comes so it is 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.140
 what game do you want to play in the snow 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.450
 So come and celebrate my four 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.979
 I'm from and I have a time and address 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.659
 Well, I also do not want to look like 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.650
 invitation completed 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.070
 It's like this, it's just a card, you see the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.840
 side on top of each other and I did this 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 tie with that snowy focus so am I 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.950
 I cut two pieces of tape on the lowest 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.630
 or greater or is involved to call and 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.020
 another to take a shot 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.180
 then who tip 6 to the fray and a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.409
 I made a loop with this line but what 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.720
 it gets easier 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:52.259
 there I put this stone in the middle of the flake 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.570
 And that 's where I put it. 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.659
 also where there are snowflakes in the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.579
 invitation a glitter penguin convert 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.640
 why they are there are 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.250
 drying up until I'm co everything then I 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:12.840
 I leave it to you, I used this paper here. 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.710
 is to place metallic light at 4 in 180 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.680
 grams 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.380
 to make the background and to make the flake 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.060
 and I used it to print the invitation. 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:27.120
 just a little girl 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.580
 the paper vg to 4 and if that it the 180 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.000
 also did not need their 180 because it was 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.670
 what I had and I decided to do it myself 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.680
 I wanted to blog but I did not and 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.580
 I decided to take advantage of this role of showing 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.540
 for you 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.720
 on one side he the intense stripes and 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:52.830
 on the other side it is smooth so print on the side 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:55.140
 It's beautiful the first flat side and stayed 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.820
 very cool I did several tests and found 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.240
 that was very nice the impression was 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.240
 good 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.420
 all right and little bones sections 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.540
 man I liked, I think the deal 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.510
 It would look even better but I think so. 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.000
 How do you like the brightness of the metallic has brilliance? 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.720
 I liked this paper to be more frosted in 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.330
 pressure has become a little dull 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.540
 Then he finished, stayed like this. 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.640
 simple beautiful and different from others 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.670
 I always do envelope every year. 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.400
 do it anyway it 's the same things right? 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.180
 so I decided to do something 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:44.130
 different is with my 6 2 180 grams it 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.310
 It got worse and worse. 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.790
 cool was this because i left more 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.430
 luxurious wine and you glue stick glue and 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.580
 You do not need to paste exactly all of it. 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.630
 because if not one looks so cool 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.540
 leaves it thus superimposed and glued 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.640
 so nice, but do not be 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:11.610
 card issue altogether. 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.050
 so that's what I hope you have 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.060
 I like to link to my 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.489
 page below and there I'll provide 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.170
 all the molds that I'm going to use that do not 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.900
 There are going to be many that I do not think 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.630
 I do not know if I have a mold but what 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.030
 I use her party, I'll post it there. 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.710
 for you are good good 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.330
 in court and until the next videos of 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.330
