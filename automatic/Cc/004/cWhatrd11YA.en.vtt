all of a sudden when I want to emphasize

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.729 
all of a sudden when I want to emphasize
something<00:02:22.519> my<00:02:22.760> voice<00:02:22.970> raises<00:02:23.450> up<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:24.560> then

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739

when I want to come back down it comes
back<00:02:26.150> down<00:02:26.209> like<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:26.870> it's<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.049> natural

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
back down like that but it's a natural

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.800 
back down like that but it's a natural
thing<00:02:27.470> on<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.430> site<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.030> saxophone<00:02:29.330> just

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
thing on the site on the saxophone just

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.780 
thing on the site on the saxophone just
like<00:02:29.900> any<00:02:30.080> other<00:02:30.200> instrument<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:31.190> want<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.640> do

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
like any other instrument you want to do

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.960 
like any other instrument you want to do
this<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:33.590> would<00:02:33.680> like<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.980> figure<00:02:34.760> out<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.940> way

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
this you would like to figure out a way

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.820 
this you would like to figure out a way
of<00:02:35.150> doing<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.600> way<00:02:35.900> because<00:02:36.140> naturally<00:02:36.739> you

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
of doing this way because naturally you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.960 
of doing this way because naturally you
don't<00:02:36.950> have<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.220> think<00:02:37.400> about<00:02:37.519> you<00:02:37.760> just

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
don't have to think about you just

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.509 
don't have to think about you just
naturally<00:02:38.150> do<00:02:38.569> it<00:02:40.299> this<00:02:41.299> is<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:42.190> double<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.340> is

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
naturally do it this is a double this is

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:59.610 
naturally do it this is a double this is
another<00:02:43.670> two<00:02:43.940> images<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:44.720> is

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.920 

Oh

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.480 

if<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.110> notice<00:03:06.440> when<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.710> notes<00:03:06.890> go<00:03:07.040> up<00:03:07.310> in

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
if you notice when the notes go up in

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.700 
if you notice when the notes go up in
the<00:03:07.730> high<00:03:07.910> register<00:03:08.180> I<00:03:08.630> start<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.290> swoop<00:03:09.500> up

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
the high register I start to swoop up

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.040 
the high register I start to swoop up
higher<00:03:09.950> with<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.310> nose<00:03:10.720> that's<00:03:11.720> very

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
higher with the nose that's very

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.300 
higher with the nose that's very
important<00:03:12.500> because<00:03:12.560> that's<00:03:12.770> how<00:03:12.950> somebody

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
important because that's how somebody

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.190 
important because that's how somebody
was<00:03:13.490> seeing<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.790> song<00:03:14.030> if<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:14.750> think<00:03:14.960> about<00:03:15.140> a

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
was seeing the song if you think about a

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.790 
was seeing the song if you think about a
famous<00:03:16.070> singer<00:03:16.490> like<00:03:16.670> Carmen<00:03:17.510> McRae<00:03:17.870> unlike

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
famous singer like Carmen McRae unlike

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.250 
famous singer like Carmen McRae unlike
Sarah<00:03:19.010> Vaughn<00:03:19.280> they<00:03:20.270> will<00:03:20.480> use<00:03:20.720> these

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
Sarah Vaughn they will use these

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.710 
Sarah Vaughn they will use these
techniques<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.910> will<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:23.390> make<00:03:23.570> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
techniques and it will just make the
