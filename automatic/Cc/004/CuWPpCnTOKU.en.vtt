 size letter size office reduces 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.190
 amplify has mode mode text mode 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.250
 has the crystal beam what is 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.050
 letter size or official size here we go 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.270
 to place the original that is size 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.850
 letter we close 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.910
 We can sort by units or by 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.920
 laser descents we cancel that we're going 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.089
 to order two copies 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.089
 in tray 1 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.750
 we're going to give you the green start button 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.120
 the copier only scans once 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.400
 the image so he will photocopy and 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.310
 subsequently he throws the amount of 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.720
 copies that you define 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.720
 here we have the quality 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.229
 and here we have 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.229
 The origin 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.950
 the copier also has a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.080
 ADH which at 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.080
 that we can place up to 30 originals 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.070
 turn on the feeder button but 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.560
 we can also order two or one 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.590
 copy according to the quantity that we want already 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.509
 be 23 for we leave them two dozen three 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.750
 units in this case we're going to order you 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.220
 a 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.220
 we start with green button 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.119
 as we can see the photocopier 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.540
 it takes around 30 to 40 seconds in 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.860
 to warm 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.730
 we have units 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.280
 tens 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.670
 the zoom that helps us to amplify or 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.610
 reduce as the need 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.230
 here we can amplify and with this 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.810
 we can reduce 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.570
 point by point this means that the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.810
 one's time is not the enlargement that 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.250
 I want in reduction I'm going to a student 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.800
 until the reduction that I want with the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.000
 that we canceled twice and also trace 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.690
 his reductions fixed at 78 64 25 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.910
 expansion to 400 and expansion to 129 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.370
 here also has what is size 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.820
 letter or the side tray that 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.500
 would be trade for about 30 sheets we have 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.870
 the automatic mode in which 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.670
 start at the start when you turn on the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.850
 computer but also has the manual mode 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.090
 in manual mode towards 2 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.570
 I can clarify this is 1 on 2 on 3 what 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.930
 normal 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.390
 I can darken to 4 or 5 but that already 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.190
 it would be a lot of density we also have the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.870
 photography mode to grow the reader 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.190
 so that it gives a better contrast to the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.830
 Photography 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.530
 is the photocopier of the seat brand 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.200
