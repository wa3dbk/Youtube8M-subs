00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:18.410
 first how come to an unboxing resp 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:18.410
 view today mother dx 3c from spectrum 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.230
 More are supplied with three handles 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.230
 with me behind with big grip on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.110
 best fits the differences between 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.110
 the grips are the distance to the rear 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.909
 here and here do not play any here 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.809
 because then and so long has then give 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:52.670
 medium size meet by a distance to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.670
 to provide 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:02.159
 Also included are four 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:13.530
 alkaline batteries as usual the 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:17.159
 weinstädter 1 sr 301 receiver 3 channel 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.619
 like the law and what I do 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.329
 now unusual finds one 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.329
 Switch also know included 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:39.710
 then these points came even the has 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.509
 Samuel store here a rolling suitcase 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.119
 means you can rotate it, and even 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.649
 no German to select and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.399
 then three seconds on it stays then 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:58.170
 comes back mainz or menu 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:02:01.619
 then it's past the golf moment say 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.209
 I just pull off easily 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.600
 here's gumminoppen with these 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:09.569
 plugged in here is a sd card 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.519
 interface for possible updates 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.110
 to install 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.890
 currently, there is here no 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:23.160
 last spark when everything comes out 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:34.290
 you are on spectrum rc point com to 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:39.870
 disposal then you can to 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:44.040
 Processing that has spark is with 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:48.600
 four more powered ext4 hammer batteries 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.150
 Fair value for milliamps I think 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.659
 the good that only four needs 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.720
 at the 8-foot by which we need 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:01.810
 just too many batteries one 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:12.659
 switch is down here with here with 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:17.700
 a signal light yes then exactly the 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.700
 antenna rotatable 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.800
 then here are individual ones you turn 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.540
 move about the menu itself can move 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.540
 like here is the third channel 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:47.060
 switch can be in two directions resp 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:50.590
 push around that said nice 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.420
 the steering wheel 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:01.890
 is very good in my opinion 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:01.890
 processed as the brake 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:14.650
 You can also use this spark with marine 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:17.799
 The recipients included the marine receivers 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:23.910
 the receivers have two attacks and 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.910
 are designed for ships for exactly 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.690
 dollar 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.910
 do you have the foil on it until the end? 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:37.200
 protection 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:42.110
 you can see with this spark 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.110
 do not select a username 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:52.870
 right here unboxing he does not pull 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.600
 beware made and the individual 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.270
 Models can also behave gent gent 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:03.510
 Here you can see a relaxation display 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.550
 the spark and 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:10.070
 You can adjust what voltage then 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.070
 An alarm goes off so a beep 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.440
 you have in the books 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:25.810
 may arise as to the language the 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:27.960
 languages ​​english french and 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.960
 Italian 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.560
 and German 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.250
 Contrast and here you can too 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:41.300
 at which we are exciting the 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.300
 alarm sound starts 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.220
 Here then becomes the name of the model 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.379
 a timer 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:05.539
 theme either down or count up 

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:08.029
 let can be used for example or 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:14.019
 You can use it if you know 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:15.919
 how long a tank charge 11 or 

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:20.169
 Electric models that you know how long 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:23.169
 holding the battery and then beeping and then three 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.169
 models 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.190
 20 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.070
 1 sa 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:41.750
 This wooden barrel therefore takes some getting used to 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:44.070
 find the exponential and different 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.520
 different attitudes and here 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.860
 Proud to come set pictures which 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.060
 Movements of this old bunny is here 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.790
 this button and here are the 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.800
 letters / indicated 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.800
 bc and d 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:08.870
 exactly what you want, according to first to 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:12.130
 by the way , one more sticker 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.130
 supplied with quite a lot of effort
