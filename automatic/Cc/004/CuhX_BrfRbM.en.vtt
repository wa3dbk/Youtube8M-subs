00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
full keyboard all the way across this is

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.870 
full keyboard all the way across this is
on<00:03:10.560> its<00:03:10.739> lowest<00:03:11.070> setting<00:03:11.130> I've<00:03:11.519> got<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> light

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
on its lowest setting I've got a light

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.750 
on its lowest setting I've got a light
on<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.390> can<00:03:12.600> see<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:14.519> know<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
on so you can see that you know the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.970 
on so you can see that you know the
difference<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.690> final<00:03:15.900> setting<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.920> a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
difference and the final setting is a

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.740 
difference and the final setting is a
little<00:03:17.280> bit<00:03:17.370> pretentious<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:18.330> glows<00:03:18.720> from

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
little bit pretentious it glows from

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.100 
little bit pretentious it glows from
lowest<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.680> brightest<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.430> whole<00:03:20.580> keyboard

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
lowest to brightest the whole keyboard

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.930 
lowest to brightest the whole keyboard
there<00:03:22.110> really<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.440> no<00:03:22.620> use<00:03:22.830> for<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.160> setting

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
there really is no use for this setting

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.150 
there really is no use for this setting
I<00:03:24.120> would<00:03:24.360> never<00:03:24.510> use<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.830> never<00:03:25.980> know

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
I would never use it but you never know

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.560 
I would never use it but you never know
in<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.459> land<00:03:26.640> party<00:03:26.700> if<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.090> want<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.299> show<00:03:27.420> off

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
know hey look my keyboard gloves I could

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.030 
know hey look my keyboard gloves I could
see<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.030> using<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.720> then<00:03:34.620> back<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
see you using that and then back to the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.949 
see you using that and then back to the
offsetting<00:03:35.489> if<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:35.970> notice<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.420> 1x

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
offsetting if you notice the 1x

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.320 
offsetting if you notice the 1x
multiplier<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.730> illuminated<00:03:38.730> constantly

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
multiplier is illuminated constantly

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.240 
multiplier is illuminated constantly
there<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.140> no<00:03:40.320> way<00:03:40.470> for<00:03:40.500> me<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.739> turn<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.070> off

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
there is no way for me to turn that off

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.150 
there is no way for me to turn that off
I<00:03:41.519> don't<00:03:41.730> know<00:03:41.790> how<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.000> turn<00:03:42.209> it<00:03:42.330> off

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
I don't know how to turn it off

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.830 
I don't know how to turn it off
essentially<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.670> key<00:03:45.030> repeat<00:03:45.420> rate

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
essentially this is the key repeat rate

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.800 
essentially this is the key repeat rate
so<00:03:46.320> 1x<00:03:46.799> means<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.280> hold<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.580> down<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.030> it

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
so 1x means you hold it down and it

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.050 
so 1x means you hold it down and it
repeats<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.290> key<00:03:49.530> one<00:03:50.070> time<00:03:50.340> two<00:03:51.030> times

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
repeats that key one time two times

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.780 
repeats that key one time two times
three<00:03:51.780> times<00:03:51.989> four<00:03:52.260> times<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:53.310> there's<00:03:53.700> a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
three times four times so there's a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.990 
three times four times so there's a
multiplier<00:03:55.040> ideally<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.250> would<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.700> set<00:03:56.880> this

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
multiplier ideally I would just set this

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.570 
multiplier ideally I would just set this
in<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.510> software<00:03:57.950> it<00:03:58.950> doesn't<00:03:59.250> really<00:03:59.370> work

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
in the software it doesn't really work

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.949 
in the software it doesn't really work
on<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.820> Mac<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.360> haven't<00:04:00.570> figured<00:04:00.690> out<00:04:00.840> how

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
on the Mac and I haven't figured out how

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.039 
on the Mac and I haven't figured out how
to<00:04:01.019> work<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.320> get<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.830> work<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.280> windows<00:04:03.049> so

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
to work it get it to work on windows so

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.289 
to work it get it to work on windows so
it's<00:04:04.320> somewhat<00:04:04.920> useless<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:05.940> let's<00:04:06.180> go<00:04:06.269> back

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
it's somewhat useless so let's go back

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.960 
it's somewhat useless so let's go back
to<00:04:06.709> this<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:07.950> setting<00:04:08.310> i<00:04:08.370> usually<00:04:08.700> leave<00:04:08.820> it

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
to this is a setting i usually leave it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.270 
to this is a setting i usually leave it
at<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.180> whole<00:04:09.299> keyboard<00:04:09.480> eliminated<00:04:10.280> again

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
at the whole keyboard eliminated again

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.340 
at the whole keyboard eliminated again
this<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.519> lowest<00:04:12.150> brightness<00:04:12.299> so<00:04:12.870> let's<00:04:13.170> turn

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
this is lowest brightness so let's turn

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.470 
this is lowest brightness so let's turn
it<00:04:13.410> up<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.670> setting<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.720> setting<00:04:16.019> three

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
it up and setting to setting three

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.430 
it up and setting to setting three
setting<00:04:18.480> for<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.840> believe<00:04:19.139> that's<00:04:19.350> the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
setting for I believe that's the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.229 
setting for I believe that's the
brightest

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
brightest

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.480 
brightest
that's<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.690> brightest<00:04:21.079> so<00:04:21.829> it's<00:04:22.190> it's

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
that's the brightest so it's it's

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.540 
that's the brightest so it's it's
extremely<00:04:23.210> bright<00:04:23.449> the<00:04:24.080> keys<00:04:24.319> glow<00:04:24.919> you<00:04:25.430> know

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.360 
extremely bright the keys glow you know
you<00:04:25.610> can<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.720> look<00:04:26.930> down<00:04:27.080> at<00:04:27.349> it<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.740> next
