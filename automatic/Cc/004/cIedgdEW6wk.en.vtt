00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
you can see it's a drill bit encased by

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.760 
you can see it's a drill bit encased by
this<00:00:47.310> adapter<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.750> adapter<00:00:49.290> would<00:00:49.440> slide

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
this adapter and as adapter would slide

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.979 
this adapter and as adapter would slide
right<00:00:49.800> over<00:00:50.040> your<00:00:50.399> shaft<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.540> it<00:00:51.750> perfectly

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
right over your shaft and it perfectly

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.740 
right over your shaft and it perfectly
aligns<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:53.700> drill<00:00:53.970> bit<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.450> center<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
aligns the drill bit in the center of

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.350 
aligns the drill bit in the center of
your<00:00:54.930> nock<00:00:55.280> whether<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> flat<00:00:56.880> knock<00:00:57.120> or

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
your nock whether it's a flat knock or

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.590 
your nock whether it's a flat knock or
moon<00:00:57.630> knock<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:59.309> first<00:00:59.550> step<00:00:59.790> is<00:01:00.360> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
moon knock and the first step is to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.520 
moon knock and the first step is to
drill<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.700> hole<00:01:02.700> and<00:01:03.090> you're<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.530> pretty

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
drill out a hole and you're not pretty

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.600 
drill out a hole and you're not pretty
simple<00:01:05.899> step<00:01:06.899> two<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> take<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.920> adapter

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
simple step two is to take this adapter

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
simple step two is to take this adapter
which<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> tap<00:01:09.810> built<00:01:10.200> right<00:01:10.440> into<00:01:10.649> it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
which has a tap built right into it

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010 
which has a tap built right into it
again<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.850> slides<00:01:12.149> right<00:01:12.360> over<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.750> shaft

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
again it slides right over the shaft

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.230 
again it slides right over the shaft
nice<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> tight<00:01:13.740> aligns<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.490> perfectly<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
nice and tight aligns you perfectly and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.990 
nice and tight aligns you perfectly and
then<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> would<00:01:16.170> thread<00:01:17.630> your<00:01:18.630> nock<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.500> that

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
then you would thread your nock so that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.109 
then you would thread your nock so that
it'll<00:01:21.000> fit<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.600> last<00:01:21.840> piece<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> kit

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
it'll fit the last piece of the kit

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
it'll fit the last piece of the kit
which<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.299> steel<00:01:24.750> nock<00:01:25.020> adopted<00:01:25.590> adapter

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
which is the steel nock adopted adapter

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
which is the steel nock adopted adapter
and<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> has<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.170> little

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and you can see it has this little

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
and you can see it has this little
compression<00:01:29.220> washer<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.810> got<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
compression washer on there it's got a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
compression washer on there it's got a
little<00:01:31.200> rubber<00:01:31.530> o-ring<00:01:32.010> in<00:01:32.130> between<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
little rubber o-ring in between the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.789 
little rubber o-ring in between the
washer<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.119> what<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.840> allows<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
washer and what that allows you to do is

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.160

degree you need it to so that your cock

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.719 
degree you need it to so that your cock
fan<00:01:42.420> always<00:01:42.689> lines<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.580> when<00:01:44.580> you're

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
fan always lines up down when you're

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.789 
fan always lines up down when you're
reflecting<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.390> arrow<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.080> I'm<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.740> to

okay pretty simple you can see perfectly

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.570 
okay pretty simple you can see perfectly
centered<00:02:16.300> we<00:02:16.630> got<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.840> hole<00:02:17.050> now<00:02:18.900> step<00:02:19.900> two<00:02:20.580> take

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
centered we got a hole now step two take

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.850 
centered we got a hole now step two take
your<00:02:21.790> tap<00:02:22.750> tool<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.350> apply<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> little

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
your tap tool just to apply a little

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.040 
your tap tool just to apply a little
pressure<00:02:27.010> it'll<00:02:27.790> kind<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.120> bite<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.570> start<00:02:28.960> to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
pressure it'll kind of bite and start to
