soldering iron now you can use an

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.950 
soldering iron now you can use an
alcohol<00:01:01.440> lamp<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:03.120> spatula<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.750> also

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
stick and the soldering iron should I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.770 
stick and the soldering iron should I
grab<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.880> bit<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.420> there

cools<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.530> may<00:01:22.650> want<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.040> shrink<00:01:23.310> down<00:01:23.580> in

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
cools it may want to shrink down in

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.350 
cools it may want to shrink down in
there<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> little<00:01:24.030> bit<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.380> need<00:01:25.560> to

there a little bit so if you need to
come<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.570> place<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> little<00:01:28.049> bit<00:01:28.229> more<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.530> there

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.400 

so<00:01:38.200> once<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.620> lacquer<00:01:38.830> is<00:01:39.100> dried<00:01:39.510> come<00:01:40.510> in<00:01:40.750> and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
so once the lacquer is dried come in and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.010 
so once the lacquer is dried come in and
just<00:01:41.590> use<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.770> sanding<00:01:42.250> block<00:01:42.460> to<00:01:43.020> level

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
just use a sanding block to level

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.810 
just use a sanding block to level
everything<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:50.440> after<00:01:50.860> sanding<00:01:51.340> this<00:01:51.520> is<00:01:51.670> what

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
everything so after sanding this is what

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.580 
everything so after sanding this is what
it<00:01:51.910> looks<00:01:52.120> like<00:01:52.330> you<00:01:52.780> can<00:01:52.930> see<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.200> gap<00:01:53.380> is

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
it looks like you can see the gap is

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.800 
it looks like you can see the gap is
completely<00:01:54.040> filled<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:55.120> we<00:01:55.270> are<00:01:55.390> now<00:01:55.570> ready

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
completely filled and we are now ready

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.700 
completely filled and we are now ready
to<00:01:55.960> continue<00:01:56.350> our<00:01:56.500> finish<00:01:56.860> work<00:01:58.230> so<00:01:59.230> Dave<00:01:59.530> in

as you can see using lacquer burning

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.950 
as you can see using lacquer burning
sticks<00:02:03.880> is<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> very<00:02:04.300> efficient<00:02:04.810> way<00:02:04.930> of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
sticks is a very efficient way of

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.350 
sticks is a very efficient way of
filling<00:02:05.380> gaps<00:02:05.530> as<00:02:05.940> always<00:02:06.940> though<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.120> want
