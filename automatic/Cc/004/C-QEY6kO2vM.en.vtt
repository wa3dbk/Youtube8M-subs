00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.640
 new guild wars 2 video this time 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.189
 I show you how to get to this 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.070
 crafting points up here in the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.259
 snow cool heights comes you go 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.089
 just here at this point so you 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.490
 Just walk this mountain along here 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.859
 that in addition to this cent in stock 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.750
 at the top of the northwest and then finds 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.439
 her this input forth visible because if 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.480
 I also attacked and there will be 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.310
 Just like here, just get in there 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.570
 here in this entrance go in the is 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.340
 here always good you do not see now 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.880
 all too much but I think that should 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 you find it in the game and then you have to 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.790
 do not chase that carey of the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.110
 is a bit wrong 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.260
 at least that's how I get to 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.629
 crafting points but just has to 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.370
 these countries are so hard here but now 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.940
 you just have to go here 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.789
 then do this little john passage 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.260
 Go up here and then you are too 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.899
 Almost there so here again 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.039
 jump up here 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.010
 So you have to go first 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.489
 show a little bit that you can jump 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.580
 and now here and here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.010
 now the craft point at the very end 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.080
 but only then you have to 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.909
 run and this is here as you see 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.229
 You do not have to have a crafting point there 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.450
 somehow defeat somehow 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.560
 but just like me now 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.200
 a moment stop here 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.979
 this beautiful point and zack there 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.250
 Do you already have this one? 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.320
 crafting points is so easy and so 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.890
 that 's what it was with this one 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.180
 Video 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.720
 so you get to this 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.079
 crafting points i want in the future 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.460
 several crafting points and also 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.250
 Views in guild wars 2 show 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.740
 at least just show how to get there 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.450
 come and this is just this 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.479
 craft must point to consider again 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.470
 how I'm doing exactly that all 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.360
 crafting points in a video or 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.560
 for each crafting point an extra 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.479
 video but we will see that later 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.960
 that's definitely something with this 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.159
 Video 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.159
 until next time bye
