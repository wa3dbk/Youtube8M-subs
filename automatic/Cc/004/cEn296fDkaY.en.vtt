there's a bigger install base and the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.480 
there's a bigger install base and the
games<00:04:31.660> will<00:04:31.840> sell<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:32.920> again<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.370> know<00:04:33.460> that

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
could do with the fact that the Wii U is

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.790 
could do with the fact that the Wii U is
is<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.310> step<00:04:36.730> behind<00:04:37.380> graphically<00:04:38.380> than<00:04:38.680> the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
is a step behind graphically than the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.460 
is a step behind graphically than the
Xbox<00:04:39.250> one<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.760> PlayStation<00:04:39.820> 4<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.840> even

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
Xbox one and PlayStation 4 and even

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.170 
Xbox one and PlayStation 4 and even
though<00:04:41.740> they've<00:04:42.070> differentiated<00:04:43.000> themselves

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
though they've differentiated themselves

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.810 
though they've differentiated themselves
like<00:04:43.900> I've<00:04:44.080> said<00:04:44.290> in<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.500> past<00:04:44.740> if<00:04:45.070> they<00:04:45.580> made

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
like I've said in the past if they made

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.610 
like I've said in the past if they made
the<00:04:46.000> Wii<00:04:46.180> U's<00:04:46.360> Hardware<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:46.960> par<00:04:47.260> with<00:04:47.500> the

the Wii U's Hardware on par with the
Xbox<00:04:48.100> one<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.550> ps4<00:04:48.700> I<00:04:49.360> think<00:04:49.930> they<00:04:50.080> would<00:04:50.320> have

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.530 
Xbox one and ps4 I think they would have
the<00:04:50.890> great<00:04:51.220> exclusives<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.030> iconic

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
exclusives and they would have the

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.790 
exclusives and they would have the
third-party<00:04:54.640> games<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.660> would<00:04:56.050> really<00:04:56.410> draw

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
third-party games that would really draw

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.140
