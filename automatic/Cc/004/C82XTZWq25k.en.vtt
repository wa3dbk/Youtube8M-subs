00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.939
 but this our super powerful guy with 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.100
 hyaluronic acid also has clay 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.700
 which will start by replacing all 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.729
 nutrients and rebuild that hair that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.520

 hair aged people already lost good 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.420
 part of the healthy effect 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.780
 besides being more brittle may occur 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.299
 hair loss he also suffers on the hour 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.420
 to grow affects hair growth 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.479
 and the nice people here this shampoo shampoo 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.700
 revitalizing it has an effect of 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.229
 return these 11 to hair and improve 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.450
 also the growth for those who 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.340
 Feels like this, my hair looks like 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.930
 does not grow, it may be a symptom of 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.090

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.299
 good thing that every step of the treatment 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.229
 will complement the shampoo as well 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.300
 transparent people it is smelly but 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.700
 he these caddy products are super 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.560
 generous I like him a lot 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.110
 texture 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.870
 It looks like a gel only if you look like this. 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.640
 It looks like a gel is very light it does not weigh 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.310
 the washing process for you 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.380
 clean your yarn is from the back of the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.700
 shampoo twice passes once more 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.340
 enough a mass and remove tea 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.340
 water and repeats tamassa operation is already well 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.920
 you can already activate the nutrients that 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.930
 have a product you massaging that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.110
 zinho heat is not super important and 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.989
 there step 2 is very important of 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.239
 mask people remove well is this 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.670
 wet excess moisture then 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.680
 It's good that you take a towel and take it out. 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.750
 a little of this excess water to 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.340
 that the mask is more in contact with 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.739
 the hair strands are very wet 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.299
 you do not have the same effect you can trust 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.250
 that doing this will give much more 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.440
 Right and another great tip sang to 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.910
 You are a new hair leak that 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.560
 what I always say what I said 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.480
 this technical word that sometimes 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.920
 people do not understand but now that 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.569
 people have been in contact for longer I 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.489
 Can I explain it better to you? 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.340
 winding that movement when 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.359
 you take a fine wick with one or two 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.190
 the little fingers are wide and you make those 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:29.959
 repetitive movements here by hand 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.640
 that is you apply the mask is that 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.310
 you apply small amounts and 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.160
 makes up novamento wick wick that that 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.370
 it does it will cause all 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.190
 of the product to penetrate better with 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.870
 you get more wire count 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.150
 so you have a lot more treatment 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.310
 is to stay and know what we see a lot 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.200
 done in salons but it's what you can 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.670
 do at home we will transform 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.920
 hydration independent of the product 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.109
 that you use by doing a survey with 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.989
 patience with fine wicks throughout the 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.850
 hair and doing the recommended break 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.790
 for each type of product you will have 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.100
 another hydration another reconstruction is 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.350
 another much better treatment then it was 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.930
 What I did with step 2 is that the 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.150
 but our guy I was going to lock 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.190
 sheila lock of hair resting on 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.470
 they recommend that you let 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.049
 Five minutes, so it's something for those who have 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.840
 laziness and yes to who buys 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.389
 this is super fast and offers a 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.729
 mega nutrition here people I used by 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.620
 twice it's something you're going to do 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.080
 all week for example my hair 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.940
 twice a goal of good size this 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.530
 go of the need for your hair is cool 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.389
 you ask for a professional is 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.430
 I need to do week studies is not something 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.629
 for you to do every time you go to wash 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.270
 then the professional can diagnose 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.889
 better the state of your hair 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.500
 guide how many times you will use 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.360
 cool people before removing mask 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.860
 all gives an excited dies an 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.650
 little does it again a little 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.419
 wrapping and rinsing takes everything away 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.139
 again you download the excess 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.909
 apply moisture to the hair 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.849
 finisher and you will massage but the 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.560
 gem can already comb we look great 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.080
 these dots for the planting of 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.659
 He also helps dogs. 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.610
 Seal the cuticles so it's cool so 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.620
 For you guys having a shower because it helps. 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.330
 God damn it, but you passing it. 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.500
 after the mask has not yet gained a 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.430
 little finalizer is for who 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.620
 really is asking West West so 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.990
 with my hair, I do not need it so much 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.060
 I did not make this step the ideal that he 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.990
 recommended for those who need it a lot 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.449
 treatment 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.180
 He took off the mask goes a little fluid 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.370
 Chago massage comes out of the bath when he 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.889
 Is your hair wet? 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.590
 new and know as usual or dry 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.289
 become blind with a dryer make a 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.289
 Brush gives only one dried by tops and have 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.719
 these options for my hair that is not 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.729
 so damaged is not so powerful I 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.039
 I did not do this step of passing the fluid 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.590
 still in the shower then you have these two 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:59.050
 options but you can diagnose the 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.599
 that really there hair needs good I did 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.370
 the clay in my hair and the 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.900
 other days in the sequence was using the 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.060
 also bossa nova line of the caduceus that 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.330
 I love it because it's for wavy hair. 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.009
 give me a balance of mine I like 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.960
 quite a lot then I went reviewing some 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.400
 15 days only 20 days 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.279
 I'll do the clay again 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.020
 but we are very sure this kit 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.969
 cost a little more than 100 reais 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.729
 110 more out there mean 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:26.710
 I found an excellent value for money 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.039
 for those who seek treatment to make 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.480
 house gave much result quite bright 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.720
 my car 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.150
 You can tell that frizz has improved. 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.490
 so I think a lot of the porosity 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.550
 strip the hair shine has been recovered 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.620
 with this treatment then look at note 10 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.900
 I really liked it so it's something I think 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.760
 that for those who really seek practicality 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.920
