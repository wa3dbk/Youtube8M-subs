drawing let's go so first of all you
want<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.310> draw<00:00:20.520> flappy<00:00:21.029> birds<00:00:21.300> body<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
want to draw flappy birds body and the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.620 
want to draw flappy birds body and the
best<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.160> do<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.060> imagine<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
best way to do that is to imagine a

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.439 
best way to do that is to imagine a
short<00:00:24.990> bent<00:00:25.439> cucumber<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.910> bigger<00:00:27.210> at

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
short bent cucumber that is bigger at

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.480 
short bent cucumber that is bigger at
one<00:00:27.720> end<00:00:27.960> than<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.380> at<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> other<00:00:28.830> end<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
one end than it is at the other end and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.229 
one end than it is at the other end and
you'll<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> perfect<00:00:30.779> shape<00:00:32.030> fantastic

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
you'll have the perfect shape fantastic

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.240 
you'll have the perfect shape fantastic
next<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.960> want<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.200> draw<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.530> eyes<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.190> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
next you want to draw the eyes and you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.549 
next you want to draw the eyes and you
want<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:35.940> slightly<00:00:36.329> bigger<00:00:36.809> error<00:00:37.140> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
want to do one slightly bigger error and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.139 
want to do one slightly bigger error and
more<00:00:38.100> circle<00:00:38.640> here

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
more circle here

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.440 
more circle here
and<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.590> other<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.430> squash<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and then the other one more squash and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.690 
and then the other one more squash and
this<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.110> give<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> free<00:00:43.829> D<00:00:44.070> sense<00:00:44.489> of

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
this is to give a free D sense of

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.090 
this is to give a free D sense of
direction<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:46.140> flappy<00:00:46.649> bird<00:00:46.860> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
direction as to which way flappy bird is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700 
direction as to which way flappy bird is
flapping<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.879> next<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.840> want<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> take<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> free

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
flapping in next you want to take a free

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
flapping in next you want to take a free
D<00:00:49.890> line<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.399> separate<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> smaller<00:00:51.449> end<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
D line and separate the smaller end of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.670 
D line and separate the smaller end of
the<00:00:52.020> cucumber<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.800> form<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.610> free<00:00:54.090> D<00:00:54.149> face<00:00:54.719> now

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the cucumber to form a free D face now

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.830 
the cucumber to form a free D face now
you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:56.100> use<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.430> face<00:00:56.730> splitting<00:00:57.329> technique

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you can use the face splitting technique

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.110 
you can use the face splitting technique
which<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.500> where<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> draw<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> free<00:00:59.430> D<00:00:59.609> line<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
which is where you draw a free D line to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.150 
which is where you draw a free D line to
make<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.300> look<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> face<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.469> splitting

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
make it look like the face is splitting

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.850 
make it look like the face is splitting
in<00:01:02.340> half<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.329> no<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.260> splitting<00:01:04.680> in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
in half but no it's not splitting in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.219 
in half but no it's not splitting in
half<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.640> professional<00:01:06.299> free<00:01:06.630> D<00:01:06.840> mouth

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
half it's a professional free D mouth

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.490 
half it's a professional free D mouth
wow<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.520> looks<00:01:08.760> beautiful<00:01:09.260> next<00:01:10.260> I'm<00:01:10.380> going

orange e afridi flappy yellow for his
beak<00:01:36.920> perfect<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.520> need<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.880> draw<00:01:39.090> his

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
beak perfect now we need to draw his

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.719 
beak perfect now we need to draw his
wings<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.280> gonna<00:01:41.400> draw

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
wings and to do that I'm just gonna draw

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.539 
wings and to do that I'm just gonna draw
a<00:01:41.909> wing<00:01:42.299> shape<00:01:42.689> using<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.350> winging<00:01:43.950> technique

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
a wing shape using the winging technique

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.670 
a wing shape using the winging technique
you<00:01:45.119> obviously<00:01:45.600> only<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.170> draw<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.380> of

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you obviously only have to draw one of

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
you obviously only have to draw one of
them<00:01:47.040> because<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> game<00:01:48.119> he<00:01:48.390> only<00:01:48.720> has<00:01:48.930> one

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
them because in the game he only has one

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.859 
them because in the game he only has one
wing<00:01:49.770> we'll<00:01:50.310> never<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.820> quite<00:01:51.090> how<00:01:51.450> he<00:01:51.509> lost
