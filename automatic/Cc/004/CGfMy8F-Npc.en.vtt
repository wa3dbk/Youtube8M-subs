00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that I wasn't expecting the series has

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.050 
that I wasn't expecting the series has
been<00:01:55.439> incredibly<00:01:55.860> fast<00:01:56.130> paced<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.579> far<00:01:56.820> which

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
been incredibly fast paced so far which

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.810 
been incredibly fast paced so far which
could<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.329> seen<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.899> good<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.740> bad<00:01:59.009> thing<00:01:59.250> a

could be seen as a good or a bad thing a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.870 
could be seen as a good or a bad thing a
good<00:01:59.969> thing<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.439> anime<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.310> only<00:02:02.520> 11

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
good thing because the anime is only 11

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.810 
good thing because the anime is only 11
episodes<00:02:03.509> long<00:02:03.719> plus<00:02:04.110> two<00:02:04.409> movies<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.070> bad
