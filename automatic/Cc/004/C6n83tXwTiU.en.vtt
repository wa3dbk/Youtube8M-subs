it's<00:00:22.020> going<00:00:22.200> to<00:00:23.060> be<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> portion<00:00:24.420> where<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.920> go

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
it's going to be the portion where we go

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.010 
it's going to be the portion where we go
ahead<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.220> complete<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.820> rear<00:00:27.090> hub<00:00:27.480> carriers

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and then mount them on to the a arms we

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.630 
and then mount them on to the a arms we
are<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.680> need<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.860> couple<00:00:32.160> different

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
are going to need a couple different

are going to need a couple different
parts

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
parts

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.810 
parts
we're<00:00:33.480> gonna<00:00:33.630> need<00:00:33.870> parts<00:00:34.290> 85<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.750> 24<00:00:36.770> -<00:00:37.820> one

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
we're gonna need parts 85 for 24 - one

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.360 
we're gonna need parts 85 for 24 - one
and<00:00:39.540> there's<00:00:39.720> two<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.079> these<00:00:40.230> units<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:41.220> on

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
and there's two of these units one on

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.310 
and there's two of these units one on
each<00:00:41.550> trait<00:00:41.940> let's<00:00:42.690> go<00:00:42.870> ahead<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.200> remove

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
each trait let's go ahead and remove

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.830 
each trait let's go ahead and remove
them<00:00:46.940> from<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> trees<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:50.600> then<00:00:51.600> at<00:00:51.719> this

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
them from the trees and then at this

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.139 
them from the trees and then at this
point<00:00:52.109> we're<00:00:52.410> also<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.859> go<00:00:53.100> ahead<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.489> trim

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
point we're also gonna go ahead and trim

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
point we're also gonna go ahead and trim
off<00:00:54.210> any<00:00:54.570> Spurs<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.530> here<00:00:55.769> from<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
off any Spurs that are on here from the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.599 
off any Spurs that are on here from the
tree<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.500> helps<00:00:58.500> make<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> nice<00:00:59.280> build

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
to use the toe adjustments and the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.980 
to use the toe adjustments and the
manual<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.920> calling<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.300> part<00:01:15.660> number

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
manual is calling for the part number

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.200 
manual is calling for the part number
four<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.820> manual<00:01:18.120> or<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.810> this

four on this manual or on this

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.120 
four on this manual or on this
particular<00:01:21.210> step<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> manual<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:23.100> I

particular step in the manual and that I

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.130 
particular step in the manual and that I
believe<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> thickest<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
believe is going to be the thickest you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.260 
believe is going to be the thickest you
can<00:01:25.320> take<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> look<00:01:26.280> at<00:01:26.460> each<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.150> there's

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
can take a look at each one and there's

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.440 
can take a look at each one and there's
a<00:01:27.329> varying<00:01:27.900> degree<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> toe<00:01:29.130> angle<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:30.329> each

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
a varying degree of toe angle for each

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.289 
a varying degree of toe angle for each
one<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.810> these<00:01:30.960> units<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.060> going

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
one of these units on and we are going

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.139 
one of these units on and we are going
to<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.600> using<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.130> instructions<00:01:35.700> say<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
to be using as the instructions say the

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.749 
to be using as the instructions say the
unit<00:01:36.479> number<00:01:36.630> four<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> let's<00:01:38.280> go<00:01:38.520> ahead<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
unit number four so let's go ahead and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.810 
unit number four so let's go ahead and
clip<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.390> unit<00:01:39.630> number<00:01:39.780> fours<00:01:40.170> off<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.860> both

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
clip the unit number fours off of both

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.840 
clip the unit number fours off of both
of<00:01:41.850> our<00:01:42.119> trees<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.680> we're<00:01:44.490> gonna<00:01:44.579> go<00:01:44.820> ahead

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
of our trees and we're gonna go ahead

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.399 
of our trees and we're gonna go ahead
and<00:01:45.509> set<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:47.610> rest<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.000> these<00:01:48.149> aside<00:01:48.659> into<00:01:49.259> our

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
and set the rest of these aside into our

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
and set the rest of these aside into our
spare<00:01:49.740> parts<00:01:50.219> because<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.850> may<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.329> may<00:01:51.540> not

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
spare parts because we may or may not

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.780 
spare parts because we may or may not
later<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.469> decide<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.280> want<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.520> change

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
later on decide that we want to change

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.810 
later on decide that we want to change
the<00:01:54.210> toe<00:01:54.390> angle<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.960> we're<00:01:55.110> using<00:01:55.700> so<00:01:56.700> we're

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the toe angle that we're using so we're

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
the toe angle that we're using so we're
gonna<00:01:56.909> go<00:01:57.090> ahead<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.360> set<00:01:57.630> these<00:01:57.840> into<00:01:58.200> our

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
gonna go ahead and set these into our

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.399 
gonna go ahead and set these into our
spare<00:01:58.710> parts<00:01:59.070> bucket<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.420> go<00:02:01.049> ahead<00:02:01.289> and

in the up and down position you do not

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.300 
in the up and down position you do not
want<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.120> mount<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.630> on<00:04:51.750> sideways<00:04:52.290> you<00:04:53.010> want<00:04:53.190> to

want to mount it on sideways you want to

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.610 
want to mount it on sideways you want to
mount<00:04:53.430> it<00:04:53.640> on<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:54.450> that<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.750> hinge<00:04:54.960> pins<00:04:55.320> are

in<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.980> up<00:04:56.130> or<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.760> down<00:04:56.970> position<00:04:57.560> we're

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
in the up or the down position we're

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.440 
in the up or the down position we're
gonna<00:04:58.650> go<00:04:58.830> ahead<00:04:58.950> and<00:04:59.190> slide<00:04:59.460> this<00:04:59.670> in<00:04:59.910> through

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
gonna go ahead and slide this in through

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.760 
gonna go ahead and slide this in through
the<00:05:00.600> back<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:02.790> then<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.390> lines<00:05:03.630> up<00:05:03.840> with<00:05:04.080> the

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
the back and then it lines up with the

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.060 
the back and then it lines up with the
four<00:05:05.010> holes<00:05:05.190> that<00:05:05.460> are<00:05:05.520> in<00:05:05.640> here<00:05:06.860> at<00:05:07.860> this

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
four holes that are in here at this

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.150 
four holes that are in here at this
point<00:05:08.990> we're<00:05:09.990> gonna<00:05:10.050> do<00:05:10.290> four<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.830> bolts

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
point we're gonna do four of the bolts

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.380 
point we're gonna do four of the bolts
that<00:05:11.310> are<00:05:11.370> in<00:05:11.700> our<00:05:11.850> bucket<00:05:14.030> go<00:05:15.030> ahead<00:05:15.270> and

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
that are in our bucket go ahead and

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.480 
that are in our bucket go ahead and
insert<00:05:15.690> them<00:05:15.900> in<00:05:16.170> you<00:05:16.650> could<00:05:16.830> start<00:05:17.100> them<00:05:17.280> up<00:05:17.370> a

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
insert them in you could start them up a

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.730 
insert them in you could start them up a
little<00:05:17.610> bit<00:05:17.760> by<00:05:18.000> hand<00:05:18.240> if<00:05:18.420> you<00:05:18.450> would<00:05:18.660> like

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.440 

slide<00:05:22.740> those<00:05:23.010> in<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.820> we're<00:05:23.940> gonna<00:05:24.030> use<00:05:24.300> our

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
slide those in and we're gonna use our

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.870 
slide those in and we're gonna use our
wrench<00:05:24.720> to<00:05:24.930> tighten<00:05:25.110> them<00:05:25.380> up<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:26.220> can<00:05:26.550> use<00:05:26.850> a

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
wrench to tighten them up you can use a

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.420 
wrench to tighten them up you can use a
power<00:05:27.300> wrench<00:05:27.660> if<00:05:28.140> you<00:05:28.500> would<00:05:28.650> like<00:05:28.890> to<00:05:29.220> in

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
power wrench if you would like to in

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.570 
power wrench if you would like to in
this<00:05:30.390> step<00:05:30.690> however<00:05:30.990> I'm<00:05:31.410> going<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.800> recommend

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
this step however I'm going to recommend

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.270 
this step however I'm going to recommend
against<00:05:33.180> it<00:05:33.360> because<00:05:34.260> we<00:05:34.440> do<00:05:34.620> want<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:34.919> tighten

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
against it because we do want to tighten

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.340 
against it because we do want to tighten
them<00:05:35.430> up<00:05:35.580> just<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:36.090> little<00:05:36.120> bit<00:05:36.510> at<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.750> time<00:05:36.780> so

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
them up just a little bit at a time so

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.330 
them up just a little bit at a time so
that<00:05:38.280> we<00:05:38.370> don't<00:05:38.520> warp<00:05:39.380> the<00:05:40.380> plastic<00:05:40.860> units<00:05:41.220> by

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
that we don't warp the plastic units by

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.900 
that we don't warp the plastic units by
over<00:05:41.640> tightening<00:05:42.150> one<00:05:43.080> a<00:05:43.610> little<00:05:44.610> bit<00:05:44.730> too

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
over tightening one a little bit too

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.490 
over tightening one a little bit too
tight<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.510> others<00:05:45.750> not<00:05:45.900> tight<00:05:46.169> enough<00:05:46.320> so

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
tight and others not tight enough so

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.720 
tight and others not tight enough so
we're<00:05:46.740> actually<00:05:46.890> going<00:05:47.160> to<00:05:47.280> use<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.430> little

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
we're actually going to use a little

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.909 
we're actually going to use a little
star<00:05:48.030> pattern<00:05:48.480> to<00:05:49.110> go<00:05:49.230> ahead<00:05:49.470> and<00:05:49.590> tighten

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
star pattern to go ahead and tighten

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.400 
star pattern to go ahead and tighten
these<00:05:50.070> up<00:05:50.600> just<00:05:51.600> to<00:05:51.720> save<00:05:51.930> a<00:05:51.960> little<00:05:52.169> bit<00:05:52.290> of

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
these up just to save a little bit of

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.030 
these up just to save a little bit of
time<00:05:53.060> I'm<00:05:54.060> going<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.450> go<00:05:54.750> ahead<00:05:55.080> and<00:05:55.500> prep<00:05:55.860> the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
time I'm going to go ahead and prep the

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.580 
time I'm going to go ahead and prep the
other<00:05:56.190> unit<00:05:56.669> here<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.930> get<00:05:58.050> to<00:05:58.200> set<00:05:58.410> that<00:05:58.530> down

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
other unit here you get to set that down

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.070 
other unit here you get to set that down
prep<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.580> other<00:05:59.729> unit<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.300> again<00:06:00.930> we're

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.409 
prep the other unit and again we're
going<00:06:01.169> to<00:06:01.229> make<00:06:01.410> sure<00:06:01.729> that<00:06:02.729> one<00:06:03.690> unit<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:06.150> tab

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
going to make sure that one unit the tab

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.560 
going to make sure that one unit the tab
is<00:06:07.110> pointing<00:06:07.560> one<00:06:07.710> direction<00:06:08.340> and<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.360> other

is pointing one direction and the other

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.590 
is pointing one direction and the other
unit<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.560> tab<00:06:10.800> is<00:06:11.220> pointing<00:06:11.640> in<00:06:11.850> the<00:06:12.120> opposite

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
unit the tab is pointing in the opposite

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.880 
unit the tab is pointing in the opposite
direction<00:06:13.250> gonna<00:06:15.260> take<00:06:16.260> a<00:06:16.290> look<00:06:16.500> at<00:06:16.680> these<00:06:16.830> and
