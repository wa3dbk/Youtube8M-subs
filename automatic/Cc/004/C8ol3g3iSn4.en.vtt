00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.580 
now that you got them open they should
be<00:02:27.550> like<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.239> that's<00:02:28.810> how<00:02:29.020> much<00:02:29.260> longer

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
be like that and that's how much longer

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.290 
be like that and that's how much longer
the<00:02:29.860> skirt<00:02:30.130> would<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.400> if<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.850> want<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.180> you

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
the skirt would be if you want it you

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.210 
the skirt would be if you want it you
can<00:02:31.390> make<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.690> shorter<00:02:31.720> or<00:02:32.530> whatever<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:33.010> want

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
can make it shorter or whatever you want

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.580 
can make it shorter or whatever you want
but<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.480> what<00:02:34.690> you<00:02:34.810> want<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.050> do<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.440> want

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
but so what you want to do is you want

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.390 
but so what you want to do is you want
to<00:02:35.620> place<00:02:35.890> right<00:02:36.160> sides<00:02:36.489> together<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:39.130> for

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
to place right sides together and so for

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.360 
to place right sides together and so for
this<00:02:39.580> one<00:02:40.380> I'm<00:02:41.380> just<00:02:41.440> going<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.709> put<00:02:41.890> two<00:02:42.070> pins

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
this one I'm just going to put two pins

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.880 
this one I'm just going to put two pins
right<00:02:42.760> here<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.330> I'm<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.470> sew<00:02:44.650> that

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
right here and I'm going to sew that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.970 
right here and I'm going to sew that
down<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.140> will<00:02:47.350> be<00:02:47.500> longer<00:02:47.830> like

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
down and then so you will be longer like

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.330 
down and then so you will be longer like
that<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.930> going<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.140> be<00:02:50.230> nice<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:51.130> those

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
that it's going to be nice to have those

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.400 
that it's going to be nice to have those
seams<00:02:51.610> through<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.600> for<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> next<00:02:53.230> one

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
seams through it and so for the next one

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.350 
seams through it and so for the next one
I'm<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:54.040> going<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.430> do<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> same<00:02:54.880> thing<00:02:55.150> I'm

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.880 
going to put the right sides together
put<00:02:59.410> two<00:02:59.650> pins<00:03:01.440> super<00:03:02.440> simple<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.900> then<00:03:04.900> it's

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
put two pins super simple and then it's

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.340 
put two pins super simple and then it's
got<00:03:06.160> longer<00:03:06.430> like<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.330> also<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.230> guys

you<00:03:27.290> how<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.530> make<00:03:27.830> it<00:03:28.010> without<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.280> pattern

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
you how to make it without a pattern

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.760 
you how to make it without a pattern
like<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.110> you're<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:30.260> going<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.620> slow

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
like that and you're just going to slow

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.840 
like that and you're just going to slow
down<00:03:30.950> that<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.310> then<00:03:31.430> you're<00:03:31.550> going<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.700> have

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
down that and then you're going to have

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.010 
down that and then you're going to have
a<00:03:31.880> long<00:03:32.210> strip<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:34.010> after<00:03:34.460> this<00:03:34.810> then<00:03:35.810> you're

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
a long strip so after this then you're

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.430 
a long strip so after this then you're
going<00:03:36.140> to<00:03:36.200> take<00:03:36.410> these<00:03:36.740> two<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:38.410> you're<00:03:39.410> going

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
going to take these two and you're going

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.180 
going to take these two and you're going
to<00:03:39.620> slow<00:03:39.830> down<00:03:39.980> this<00:03:40.250> one<00:03:40.430> also<00:03:42.040> then<00:03:43.040> you're

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
to slow down this one also then you're

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.620 
to slow down this one also then you're
going<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.430> have<00:03:43.550> an<00:03:43.700> even<00:03:44.030> longer<00:03:44.270> strip<00:03:46.630> like

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
going to have an even longer strip like

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.410 
going to have an even longer strip like
that<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.710> should<00:03:48.950> be<00:03:49.160> longer<00:03:49.550> than<00:03:50.210> the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
that and it should be longer than the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.210 
that and it should be longer than the
skirt<00:03:50.750> because<00:03:51.350> you're<00:03:51.650> going<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:51.830> have<00:03:51.980> like

so<00:05:49.189> it's<00:05:49.430> super<00:05:49.909> simple<00:05:50.330> and<00:05:50.419> fast<00:05:50.719> like<00:05:51.169> the

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
so it's super simple and fast like the

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
then the side now for the side you would

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.080 
then the side now for the side you would
just<00:05:56.870> put<00:05:57.379> some<00:05:57.560> more<00:05:57.590> pleats<00:05:58.009> in<00:05:58.219> it<00:05:58.400> this

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
just put some more pleats in it this

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.480 
just put some more pleats in it this
make<00:05:59.659> them<00:05:59.780> as<00:05:59.960> big<00:06:00.259> or<00:06:00.469> as<00:06:00.529> small<00:06:00.680> as<00:06:01.039> you<00:06:01.310> want

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
make them as big or as small as you want

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.059

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
so I'm gonna pull this flat and then I'm

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.330 
so I'm gonna pull this flat and then I'm
going<00:06:04.189> to<00:06:04.219> put<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.370> fleet<00:06:04.699> in<00:06:04.879> it<00:06:05.029> right<00:06:05.180> there

going to put a fleet in it right there

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.800 
going to put a fleet in it right there
so<00:06:07.340> maybe<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.729> sides<00:06:08.000> I<00:06:08.240> will<00:06:08.419> have<00:06:08.569> two

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
so maybe the sides I will have two

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.899 
so maybe the sides I will have two
pleats<00:06:09.139> in<00:06:09.469> them<00:06:11.560> so<00:06:12.560> you<00:06:13.159> can<00:06:13.340> go<00:06:13.490> whatever
