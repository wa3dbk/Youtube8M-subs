00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.740

in the classic section the rain took the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.780 
in the classic section the rain took the
advantage<00:01:48.930> away<00:01:49.409> from<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.740> big<00:01:49.920> Ozzy<00:01:50.190> v8<00:01:50.550> and

advantage away from the big Ozzy v8 and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.610 
advantage away from the big Ozzy v8 and
handed<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.479> back<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.990> better<00:01:52.229> handling

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
handed it back to the better handling

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:04.940 
handed it back to the better handling
911s<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.430> they're<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.180> skilled<00:01:54.510> drivers

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950

water<00:02:05.549> rain<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.420> first<00:02:06.659> time<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
water rain for the first time on the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.600 
water rain for the first time on the
target<00:02:07.439> Osmania<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.069> maybe<00:02:08.250> takes<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
target Osmania that maybe takes the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.160 
target Osmania that maybe takes the
advantage<00:02:08.819> away<00:02:09.179> from<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.420> big<00:02:09.569> ol<00:02:09.690> deviates

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
advantage away from the big ol deviates

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.160 
advantage away from the big ol deviates
yes<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.910> me<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.150> doesn't<00:02:12.330> make<00:02:12.569> any<00:02:12.840> sense

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
yes but for me it doesn't make any sense

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.559 
yes but for me it doesn't make any sense
because<00:02:13.410> I'm<00:02:13.739> too<00:02:13.920> far<00:02:14.130> away<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.640> anyways

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
because I'm too far away but anyways

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.059 
because I'm too far away but anyways
maybe<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.170> little<00:02:16.290> bit<00:02:16.410> more<00:02:16.650> found<00:02:16.950> at

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
maybe it's a little bit more found at

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.420 
maybe it's a little bit more found at
all

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
all

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
all
and<00:02:17.580> faster<00:02:18.090> enjoy

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.900 

and<00:02:23.660> water<00:02:24.110> plainly<00:02:24.620> was<00:02:24.860> having<00:02:25.250> fun<00:02:25.430> setting

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
and water plainly was having fun setting

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.089 
and water plainly was having fun setting
to<00:02:26.300> faster<00:02:27.080> stage<00:02:29.650> certainly<00:02:30.650> come<00:02:30.890> down

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
to faster stage certainly come down

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.640 
to faster stage certainly come down
hasn't<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:31.610> yeah<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.780> think<00:02:33.050> we've<00:02:33.349> got<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> bit

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
hasn't it yeah I think we've got a bit

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.790 
hasn't it yeah I think we've got a bit
of<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.800> break<00:02:34.069> now<00:02:34.310> already<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.989> we're

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
of a break now already so it's we're

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.100 
of a break now already so it's we're
going<00:02:36.950> into<00:02:37.160> conservation<00:02:37.520> mode<00:02:38.090> yeah<00:02:38.630> and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
going into conservation mode yeah and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.750 
going into conservation mode yeah and
how<00:02:39.560> about<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.800> conditions<00:02:40.220> out<00:02:40.370> there<00:02:40.400> I

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
how about the conditions out there I

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.210 
how about the conditions out there I
read<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:41.600> they<00:02:42.319> really<00:02:42.650> are<00:02:42.800> look<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.069> got

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
read this they really are look we got

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.040 
read this they really are look we got
Dunlop<00:02:43.640> Zahn<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:43.910> they<00:02:44.150> seem<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.540> be<00:02:44.660> really

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
Dunlop Zahn and they seem to be really

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.770 
Dunlop Zahn and they seem to be really
really<00:02:45.170> good<00:02:45.350> but<00:02:45.910> there's<00:02:46.910> enough<00:02:47.209> water<00:02:47.510> to

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
really good but there's enough water to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.080 
really good but there's enough water to
actually<00:02:47.930> act<00:02:48.319> for<00:02:48.500> playing<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.940> that's

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
actually act for playing and that that's

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.820 
actually act for playing and that that's
always<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.510> worry

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.400 

those<00:02:54.340> conditions<00:02:54.850> didn't<00:02:55.150> stop<00:02:55.390> Rex<00:02:55.930> posting

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
those conditions didn't stop Rex posting

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.740 
those conditions didn't stop Rex posting
