a thousand or so you can you get squad
fitness<00:04:32.289> cards<00:04:32.740> which<00:04:32.979> you<00:04:33.100> can<00:04:33.250> self<00:04:33.520> like

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
fitness cards which you can self like

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.740 
fitness cards which you can self like
maybe<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:35.050> thousand<00:04:35.590> maybe<00:04:35.830> a<00:04:35.949> bit<00:04:36.099> more<00:04:36.750> you

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
maybe a thousand maybe a bit more you

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.839 
maybe a thousand maybe a bit more you
can<00:04:37.810> get<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.110> coins<00:04:38.380> plus<00:04:38.710> something<00:04:38.979> so<00:04:39.460> the

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
can get the coins plus something so the

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.159 
can get the coins plus something so the
bronze<00:04:40.090> plaque<00:04:40.300> method<00:04:40.630> really<00:04:40.780> does<00:04:40.990> work

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
bronze plaque method really does work

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.070 
bronze plaque method really does work
it's<00:04:41.620> probably<00:04:42.479> probably<00:04:43.479> better<00:04:43.750> than<00:04:43.960> the

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
it's probably probably better than the

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.110 
it's probably probably better than the
contract<00:04:44.560> method<00:04:44.949> seeing<00:04:45.220> it's<00:04:45.580> not<00:04:45.699> really

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
contract method seeing it's not really

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.189 
contract method seeing it's not really
working<00:04:46.330> right<00:04:46.780> now<00:04:47.340> but<00:04:48.340> hopefully<00:04:49.300> that

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
working right now but hopefully that

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.740 
working right now but hopefully that
will<00:04:50.349> have<00:04:50.500> given<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:51.699> some<00:04:52.030> more<00:04:52.210> ideas<00:04:52.419> on

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
will have given you some more ideas on

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.529 
will have given you some more ideas on
how<00:04:53.110> to<00:04:53.139> start<00:04:53.590> off<00:04:53.889> with<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.550> lower<00:04:54.789> budget<00:04:55.090> I

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
how to start off with a lower budget I

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.420 
how to start off with a lower budget I
mean<00:04:55.900> I'll<00:04:56.470> hit<00:04:57.190> my<00:04:57.310> on<00:04:57.430> my<00:04:57.580> desk<00:04:57.819> and<00:04:59.430> like

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
mean I'll hit my on my desk and like

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.850 
mean I'll hit my on my desk and like
I'll<00:05:00.729> bet<00:05:00.970> on<00:05:01.090> that<00:05:01.120> guy<00:05:01.389> fair<00:05:01.720> enough<00:05:01.960> but<00:05:01.990> if

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
I'll bet on that guy fair enough but if

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.629 
I'll bet on that guy fair enough but if
you<00:05:03.310> can<00:05:05.220> if<00:05:06.220> you<00:05:06.460> if<00:05:06.669> you<00:05:06.820> like<00:05:08.520> practice<00:05:09.520> how

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
you can if you if you like practice how

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.279 
you can if you if you like practice how
to<00:05:09.669> do<00:05:09.910> these<00:05:10.120> methods<00:05:10.740> effectively<00:05:11.740> and

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
to do these methods effectively and

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.719 
to do these methods effectively and
efficiently<00:05:16.110> then<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.710> can<00:05:17.949> get<00:05:18.280> quite<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.610> lot

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
efficiently then you can get quite a lot

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.749 
efficiently then you can get quite a lot
of<00:05:18.849> money<00:05:18.940> quite<00:05:19.389> quickly<00:05:19.750> in<00:05:20.430> on<00:05:21.430> my<00:05:21.550> last
