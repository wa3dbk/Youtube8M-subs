00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.090
 orange to make a white lamp 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.869
 bone flour 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.000
 to make an orange lamp 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.150
 bone meal must be replaced by 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.130

 1 siren is a serial howler so I 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.579

 any boards and red dust this here 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.320

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.460
 settings you can specify the range 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:29.830
 sound imagine 128 blocks 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:32.530
 such a sound will be like that 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.319
