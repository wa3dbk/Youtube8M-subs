00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.770 
if you really want you can go out at
this<00:01:37.700> I'm<00:01:37.910> not<00:01:38.060> sure<00:01:38.240> if<00:01:38.360> there's<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.630> much

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
this I'm not sure if there's that much

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.290 
this I'm not sure if there's that much
train<00:01:39.110> left<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.560> wanted<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.220> make<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:40.790> that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
train left I wanted to make it so that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.270 
train left I wanted to make it so that
there'd<00:01:41.630> be<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.110> park<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.710> could<00:01:42.920> skate

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
there'd be the park that could skate

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.580 
there'd be the park that could skate
really<00:01:43.490> well<00:01:43.640> but<00:01:43.910> then<00:01:44.030> on<00:01:44.210> each<00:01:44.360> side<00:01:44.660> of<00:01:44.930> the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
really well but then on each side of the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.930 
really well but then on each side of the
street<00:01:45.920> there'd<00:01:46.160> be<00:01:46.280> at<00:01:46.400> least<00:01:46.550> something

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
street there'd be at least something

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.150 
street there'd be at least something
around<00:01:47.480> it<00:01:47.690> then<00:01:47.870> give<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.290> illusion<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.770> it

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
around it then give the illusion that it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.760 
around it then give the illusion that it
would<00:01:49.310> keep<00:01:49.730> that<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.780> part<00:01:51.140> continues<00:01:51.620> out

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
would keep that that part continues out

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.020 
would keep that that part continues out
and<00:01:51.950> as<00:01:52.010> I've<00:01:52.130> said<00:01:52.190> before<00:01:52.370> in<00:01:52.790> my<00:01:52.940> videos<00:01:54.010> so
