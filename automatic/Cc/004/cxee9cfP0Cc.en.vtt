to make sure that they don't fall out

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.670 
to make sure that they don't fall out
and<00:04:18.549> once<00:04:19.549> they<00:04:19.880> are<00:04:19.910> completely<00:04:20.690> set<00:04:21.140> in<00:04:21.440> I

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
and once they are completely set in I

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.420 
and once they are completely set in I
decided<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.820> add<00:04:23.000> in<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.480> little<00:04:23.690> bit<00:04:23.930> more

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
decided to add in a little bit more

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:34.200 
decided to add in a little bit more
liner<00:04:25.430> so<00:04:25.910> that<00:04:25.940> any<00:04:26.360> gaps<00:04:26.840> could<00:04:27.680> be<00:04:27.740> hidden

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.480 

so<00:04:35.210> this<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.840> my<00:04:36.020> favorite<00:04:36.650> part<00:04:36.890> of<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.220> look

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
so this is my favorite part of the look

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.220 
so this is my favorite part of the look
and<00:04:37.760> this<00:04:37.910> is<00:04:37.970> what<00:04:38.240> makes<00:04:38.570> all<00:04:38.840> the

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
and this is what makes all the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.610 
and this is what makes all the
difference<00:04:39.380> this<00:04:40.130> is<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:41.150> Stila<00:04:41.720> liquid

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620

difference this is the Stila liquid
lipstick<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.400> think<00:04:43.790> this<00:04:43.910> is<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.180> stay<00:04:44.419> all
