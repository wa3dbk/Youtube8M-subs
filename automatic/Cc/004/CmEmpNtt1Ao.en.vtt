00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.640

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.400
 which says the 3.5 mm body 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.730
 to place it and put headphones or 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.250

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.590
 of external music here already so that is 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.930

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.060
 microphone and here come the outputs 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.430
 audio and here the port 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.190
 lightning can see that it is the size or 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.200
 is smaller than the video is not so 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.450

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.099
 each one comes a little different in this 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.319
 part we do not find an amount of 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.350
 3.5 mm but two in the part 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.180
 down here 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.940
 and I met the voter slip 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.360
 that was always there from the iphone 4 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.730

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.410
 the camera and the flash and this is another 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.280
 microphone that will help for the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.990
 voice knowledge and will help us to 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.630
 decrease environmental sounds sounds 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.700
 externalities when calling or making a 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.490
 video here we have the apple 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.680
 and here we give ourselves more data and there 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.680
 it worked and now it tells us how many 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.930
 Full history expression is 64 GB 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.510
 here comes what is the port for 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.460
 the harmful mine that we already see that we 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.280
 square completely but it has a 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.070
 small beveled to give it a touch me 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.380
