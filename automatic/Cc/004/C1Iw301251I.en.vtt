for<00:01:09.479> combination<00:01:10.080> skin<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.119> oh

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
for combination skin and I was like oh

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.539 
for combination skin and I was like oh

really ok so as you guys know have
combination<00:01:15.119> skin<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.159> typically

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
combination skin and so I typically

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.990 
combination skin and so I typically
actually<00:01:18.600> use<00:01:18.950> fair<00:01:19.950> angels<00:01:22.369> start<00:01:23.369> angels<00:01:23.850> on

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
this is phenomenal for days that I feel

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.660 
this is phenomenal for days that I feel
the<00:02:11.580> oily<00:02:12.120> ER<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:13.500> actually<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:13.950> charcoal<00:02:14.430> and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the oily ER and actually is charcoal and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.450 
the oily ER and actually is charcoal and
it<00:02:14.790> which<00:02:14.910> absorbs<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.020> excess<00:02:16.860> oils<00:02:17.220> on<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
it which absorbs the excess oils on the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.780 
it which absorbs the excess oils on the
skin<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:19.230> bit<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.760> know

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
skin and it is a little bit you know

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.430 
skin and it is a little bit you know
does<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.240> texture<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.840> da<00:02:21.960> know<00:02:22.020> if<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.290> can

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
does have texture to da know if you can

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.770 
does have texture to da know if you can
see<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.770> but<00:02:23.180> actually<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.240> will<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.540> getting

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
see this but actually I will be getting

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.120 
see this but actually I will be getting
a<00:02:24.810> new<00:02:25.790> camera<00:02:26.790> actually<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.600> me<00:02:27.750> my<00:02:28.680> bday

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
a new camera actually for me my bday

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.850 
a new camera actually for me my bday
coming<00:02:29.490> up<00:02:29.610> but<00:02:30.260> hopefully<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> quality<00:02:31.740> will

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
coming up but hopefully the quality will

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.930 
coming up but hopefully the quality will
improve<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:33.500> that's<00:02:34.500> stuck<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.790> does

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
improve but that's stuck but it does

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.340 
improve but that's stuck but it does
have<00:02:36.150> texture<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:36.960> don't<00:02:37.020> know<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.260> you

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
have texture to it I don't know if you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.670 
have texture to it I don't know if you
can<00:02:37.500> see<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.280> has<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> texture<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
can see that but it has a texture to it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.870 
can see that but it has a texture to it
well<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.770> guess<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.040> can<00:02:41.190> see<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.400> as<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.490> song

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
well I guess you can see it as a song

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.300 
well I guess you can see it as a song
but<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:42.990> it<00:02:43.080> does<00:02:43.200> exfoliate<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.950> little<00:02:44.160> bit

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
but so it does exfoliate a little bit

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.910 
but so it does exfoliate a little bit
and<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.700> actually<00:02:46.040> won<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.460> hooked<00:02:48.000> up<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
and this actually won it hooked up the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.520 
and this actually won it hooked up the
excess<00:02:49.920> oils<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.240> two<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.630> didn't<00:02:52.020> dry<00:02:52.170> out<00:02:52.500> my

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
excess oils the two it didn't dry out my

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.650 
excess oils the two it didn't dry out my
dry<00:02:52.920> parts<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.550> mean<00:02:53.940> again<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.210> still<00:02:54.450> had<00:02:54.570> to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
but I was really surprised i picked up

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.090 
but I was really surprised i picked up
the<00:03:02.130> excess<00:03:02.400> oil<00:03:02.700> did<00:03:02.910> not<00:03:03.120> make<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:04.620> dry<00:03:04.830> part
