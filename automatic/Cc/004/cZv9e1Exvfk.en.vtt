00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.130
 down there are going to be the ingredients 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.770
 Lady for that I'm aiming 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.220
 with all the calm is the recipe is 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.650
 very mishima is very healthy but also the 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.390
 we can do endow exact action very 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.390
 well in two companies I was not so know 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.060
 with the instructions that you gave me 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.000
 I'm going to start frying chorizo 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.770
 although the chorizo bogado their own 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.140
 fat the truth is beaten because the 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.750
 chorizo already brings its fat then as 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.670
 so that we add more fat intact 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.859
 mind in I let loose that let go 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.300
 so let loose that building be released 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.649
 of turkey for his grace 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.989
 then there begins to release the 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.239
 fat and this is the fatty medium that we 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.890
 will allow cooking to all 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.960
 other ingredients very well we go before 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.699
 before adding the mushrooms I'm going to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.559
 tell what you tell me what happened to you 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.289
 the ages that it occurs to me to do it 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.710
 they already know about me and I know the recipe and 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.089
 that I put to wet the mushrooms the rinse 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.440
 wisely do not go to do that at home 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.539
 which in the mushrooms such any 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.250
 they would make their cava because they know how 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.430
 ashore when women 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.710
 come and I do not put a function there 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.020
 have to do so that he does not hard it like that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.120
 Do not wet the mushrooms because there are 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.070
 mushrooms and any other type of mushrooms 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.440
 They are like little sponges that's why they knew 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 the earth rightly bourgeois classes of 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.550
 this vile and any other type of fungus 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.740
 they do not have to get wet they absorb a lot 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.180
 and that's why they know how much the mushrooms 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.890
 that you can and continue to mix or what 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.020
 that I arrived giving the vélez mixing and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.280
 See it as chopping I hope it does not 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.320
 they are small that will be the others 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.360
 big exactly because this later 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.160
 they know how to answer they are left taiz is a 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.290
 very fleshy saucer for the secretary 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.240
 not knowing is to take out exactly I tell them 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.610
 that mushrooms and mushrooms and any 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.320
 another of these should not be wet again 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.540
 because it absorbs water and tastes 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.670
 earth then how did you take away the earth 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.130
 that is attached to the mushrooms good very 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.350
 simple put a bowl with flour the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.060
 they roll the flour in the flour 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.770
 it's going to leave the earth they 're going to 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.990
 hit and you are going to throw that land away and without 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.910
 Touch with a dry cloth 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.850
 bursting all the earth and so 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:08.840
 never ever soak or disinfect 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.890
 while the mushrooms are not going to remove 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.989
 because the same dish as the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.340
 exact cocoons in the fat was not 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.470
 enough of the fake because it was a 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.330
 chorizo ​​of payment and as it is a recipe that 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.120
 it comes very healthy because that's why it did not reach 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.299
 fat but let's put a little bit 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.760
 Look sounds thin or little diet nadita 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.200
 nothing but nothing there begin to 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.540
 mix in an enveloping way so as not to 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.420
 hurt the mushrooms and keep mixing 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.930
 you keep mixing you do not get out in this 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.519
 instant 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.410
 tábata if you know why not why 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.989
 because if I step to salt in this 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.000
 moment he began to withdraw all the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.100
 moisture of the mushrooms then that's why 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.530
 we are going to burst it dries because it took him out 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.730
 all water will not be for fungi 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.459
 always until the end is when 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.970
 seasoned then there they start to take 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.549
 cooking and then added the peppers 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.410
 in this order to elevate because 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.110
 I want the peppers to stay 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.590
 crunchy then to first added the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.660
 mushrooms 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.030
 so they start taking that they like 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.950
 how is it more seeing the school I take them 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.709
 a little more time the zeta if what 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.200
 see yes exact for this we need a 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.060
 saucepan that has a large mouth and walls 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.620
 low because after we are going to add 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.200
 something that is great that is the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.569
 infinite the wine then I need that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.879
 evaporate and to evaporate in this 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.099
 low walls floating connection also 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.650
 abandon us at tables to one that is 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.349
 wide because they are with half a kilo of 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.330
 mushrooms looks a lot but then reduces 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.660
 a little shamble perhaps chiquitas 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.760
 then it's not too much then he added 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.860
 the next pepper I suggest you 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.630
 that red and yellow pepper he took 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.450
 that others to rosita like that goes more with 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.190
 the salt that experience as more spicy 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.950
 we can not add the green 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.629
 for example with a little parsley or with 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.220
 a little bit of steps because as a 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.959
 we are playing with the taste of chorizo 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.489
 it beats me that it happened to him that it would give him good 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.410
 I have done well now that 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.209
 make them nothing of him in this sense 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.010
 take the mushrooms cooking the 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.170
 peppers go the second step so that 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.130
 I'm growing web balls I'm going to 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.670
 add 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.670
 White wine 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.280
 and the white wine no longer I put cover not 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.840
 He left nothing else I start to my plate the wine 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.780
 white will also help to give 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.290
 cooking then there I keep mixing 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.940
 without being crushed too much so that 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.180
 Do not let me get lost in your eyes or 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.180
 eyes 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.770
 very small 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:40.590
 it smells so rich then it's cambric 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.590
 parsley today step that you prefer 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.570
 then add the step of taba tita 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.640
 and then we let the cooking finish and 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.920
 Now I'm going to ask you how you serve it 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.080
 you usually do what I do is 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.760
 buy hot and crunchy success bread 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.820
 I put a little butter and 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.110
 garlic powder loves it I put the ethics and 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.240
 It tastes delicious 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.500
 in the bank he feels it in that truth I 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:12.060
 I buy myself a baguette 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.060
 Give me a little garlic and butter 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.670
 Tell us 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:24.190
 the one that I made 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:27.790
 today I'm going to eat, not me, I'm not hungry 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.950
 today we share you anise the option is already 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.350
 You gave him your as you serve him 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.450
 it is shared what I serve on toast 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.940
 I put some cheese rolls and I put it 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.770
 to the electric oven or with tortillitas 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.510
 flour we make some taquitos for 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:47.340
 see football and today I need to prove ourselves 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.340
 they showed that if it's delicious
