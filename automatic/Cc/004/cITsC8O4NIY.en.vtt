00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
and it looks like I'm not sure if this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.139 
and it looks like I'm not sure if this
is<00:00:34.770> tape<00:00:35.040> residue<00:00:35.309> or<00:00:35.989> something<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.140> here<00:00:38.149> but

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
is tape residue or something on here but

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
is tape residue or something on here but

everything feels solid

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.560

and then this has been it looks like

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.420 
and then this has been it looks like
it's<00:00:53.920> been<00:00:54.150> not<00:00:55.150> sure<00:00:55.650> maybe<00:00:56.650> a<00:00:56.740> boxy<00:00:57.220> or

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
something or maybe it wasn't cracked all

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.740 
something or maybe it wasn't cracked all
the<00:00:59.620> way<00:00:59.680> through<00:00:59.890> I'm<00:01:00.100> not<00:01:00.250> sure<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:01.510> you<00:01:01.540> can

to<00:01:30.550> mention<00:01:31.000> there<00:01:31.990> are<00:01:32.020> some<00:01:32.500> little<00:01:32.790> chips

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
to mention there are some little chips

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.400 
to mention there are some little chips
in<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.060> paint<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.690> some<00:01:34.840> scratches<00:01:35.380> and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
in the paint and some scratches and

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.790 
in the paint and some scratches and
stuff<00:01:37.320> but<00:01:38.320> overall<00:01:39.420> starts<00:01:40.420> right<00:01:40.600> up<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:41.110> I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
stuff but overall starts right up and I

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.719 
stuff but overall starts right up and I
drive<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.280> anywhere

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
drive it anywhere

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.820 
drive it anywhere
honestly<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.869> front<00:01:44.140> suspension<00:01:44.710> is<00:01:44.770> a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
honestly the front suspension is a

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.650 
honestly the front suspension is a
little<00:01:45.160> bit<00:01:45.310> soft<00:01:45.640> for<00:01:45.910> my<00:01:46.149> taste

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
little bit soft for my taste

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.410 
little bit soft for my taste
I'm<00:01:47.110> not<00:01:47.259> sure<00:01:47.500> if<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.710> can<00:01:47.890> kind<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.250> give<00:01:49.240> you

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
I'm not sure if I can kind of give you

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.780 
I'm not sure if I can kind of give you
an<00:01:49.509> idea<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.160> can't<00:01:51.399> really<00:01:51.610> get<00:01:51.759> a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
an idea because I can't really get a

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.719 
an idea because I can't really get a
hand<00:01:52.060> on<00:01:52.210> them<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.649> guess<00:01:56.890> he<00:01:57.069> had<00:01:57.190> it<00:01:57.369> set<00:01:57.399> up

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
hand on them so I guess he had it set up

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.120 
hand on them so I guess he had it set up
maybe<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.179> little<00:01:58.300> bit<00:01:58.600> lighter<00:01:58.840> Rider<00:01:59.679> but

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
maybe a little bit lighter Rider but

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.490 
maybe a little bit lighter Rider but
that's<00:02:00.670> just<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:01.000> matter<00:02:01.149> of<00:02:01.300> how<00:02:02.050> much<00:02:02.200> fluid

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
that's just a matter of how much fluid

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.169 
that's just a matter of how much fluid
you<00:02:02.709> got<00:02:02.890> in<00:02:03.039> there<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.459> that's<00:02:03.759> not<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.030> big

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
you got in there so that's not a big

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.190 
you got in there so that's not a big
deal

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
deal

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.900 
deal
depends<00:02:05.860> I'm<00:02:06.009> just<00:02:06.190> going<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.340> be<00:02:06.429> riding<00:02:06.610> it

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
depends I'm just going to be riding it

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.400

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410

you<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.880> up<00:02:24.090> over<00:02:24.900> five<00:02:25.440> or<00:02:25.470> six<00:02:25.740> thousand

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
you get up over five or six thousand

you get up over five or six thousand
rpms<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.880> run<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.600> wind<00:02:27.840> up<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.470> I

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
probably go ahead and check the go ahead

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:26.650 
probably go ahead and check the go ahead
and<00:03:18.330> check<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.980> brake<00:03:19.980> fluid<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.550> stuff<00:03:20.790> too

to it when I stop I'm going to go ahead
and<00:05:14.639> check<00:05:14.849> out<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:15.389> see<00:05:15.570> if<00:05:15.750> it's<00:05:15.990> just<00:05:16.380> from

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
sitting or if it does need pads I can't

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.560 
sitting or if it does need pads I can't
imagine<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.520> they're<00:05:20.760> very<00:05:20.940> expensive<00:05:21.210> for

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
imagine that they're very expensive for

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.570

this<00:05:21.690> bike<00:05:21.960> yeah<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:23.099> looks<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.430> me<00:05:23.490> like

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
this bike yeah it looks to me like

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.120 
this bike yeah it looks to me like
there's<00:05:23.940> plenty<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.330> heat<00:05:24.630> on<00:05:24.810> that<00:05:24.840> pad<00:05:25.260> so

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130
