so<00:06:03.770> I've<00:06:04.100> noticed<00:06:04.310> a<00:06:04.610> huge<00:06:04.760> change<00:06:05.150> we<00:06:05.840> put

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
so I've noticed a huge change we put

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.580 
so I've noticed a huge change we put
these<00:06:06.440> blinds<00:06:07.130> in<00:06:07.280> these<00:06:08.050> verticals<00:06:09.050> in<00:06:09.290> and

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
these blinds in these verticals in and

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.740 
these blinds in these verticals in and
paid<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.220> money<00:06:10.310> for<00:06:10.580> that<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:11.090> then<00:06:11.330> realize

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
paid the money for that and then realize

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.030 
paid the money for that and then realize
we<00:06:11.930> didn't<00:06:12.140> even<00:06:12.230> really<00:06:12.470> want<00:06:12.560> to<00:06:12.680> use<00:06:12.830> them

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
we didn't even really want to use them

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.280 
we didn't even really want to use them
because<00:06:13.130> it<00:06:13.340> blocks<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.700> view<00:06:14.030> the<00:06:14.420> film<00:06:14.660> kind
