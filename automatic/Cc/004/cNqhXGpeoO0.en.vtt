00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.810 
sits in the end of a pin broke table it
might<00:01:33.229> have<00:01:33.469> a<00:01:33.500> little<00:01:33.799> breakfast<00:01:34.219> silverware

the sides of this drawer are are brought
in<00:01:42.049> at<00:01:42.200> 5/16<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.159> an<00:01:43.280> inch<00:01:43.579> I<00:01:43.759> think<00:01:44.390> that's

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
in at 5/16 of an inch I think that's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.480 
in at 5/16 of an inch I think that's
heavy<00:01:44.960> enough<00:01:45.289> to<00:01:45.350> carry<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:46.039> weight<00:01:46.219> that's

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
heavy enough to carry the weight that's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.789 
heavy enough to carry the weight that's
it's<00:01:46.880> going<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.210> have<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.079> carry<00:01:48.469> and

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
it's going to have to carry and

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.569 
it's going to have to carry and
certainly<00:01:49.729> look<00:01:50.299> somewhat<00:01:50.899> delicate<00:01:51.579> many

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
certainly look somewhat delicate many

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.700 
certainly look somewhat delicate many
would<00:01:52.880> agree<00:01:53.179> that<00:01:53.210> an<00:01:53.479> awfully<00:01:53.960> nice<00:01:54.109> detail

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
would agree that an awfully nice detail

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.630 
would agree that an awfully nice detail
is<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.670> detail<00:01:56.149> called<00:01:56.929> beating<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.679> this

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
is a detail called beating and this

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.209 
is a detail called beating and this
drawer<00:01:59.090> has<00:01:59.869> beading<00:02:00.380> around<00:02:01.009> the

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
drawer has beading around the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.520 
drawer has beading around the

you how to prepare how to join and how
to<00:02:12.170> install<00:02:12.409> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
to install that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.800 
to install that
another<00:02:14.830> characteristic<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:16.239> fine<00:02:16.510> drawer

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
another characteristic of a fine drawer

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.190 
another characteristic of a fine drawer
to<00:02:17.050> me<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.400> solid<00:02:18.970> wood<00:02:19.150> bottom<00:02:21.989> here<00:02:22.989> you

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
to me is a solid wood bottom here you

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.220 
to me is a solid wood bottom here you
can<00:02:23.230> see<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.709> hand<00:02:24.010> fine<00:02:24.370> work<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:25.060> goes<00:02:25.930> in

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
can see the hand fine work that goes in

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.259 
can see the hand fine work that goes in
to<00:02:26.409> letting<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.010> bottom<00:02:27.459> slide<00:02:27.760> smoothly

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
to letting that bottom slide smoothly

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.530 
to letting that bottom slide smoothly
into<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.780> grooves<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:32.640> if<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.819> can<00:02:34.030> go<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.299> a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
into the grooves so if you can go to a

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.800 
into the grooves so if you can go to a
drawer<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:36.069> can<00:02:36.250> open<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.730> from<00:02:37.269> one<00:02:37.540> hand
