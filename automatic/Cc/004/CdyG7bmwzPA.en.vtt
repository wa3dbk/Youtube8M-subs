boy<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.560> Giuliana's<00:04:08.220> been<00:04:08.370> lucky<00:04:08.580> sure

boy that Giuliana's been lucky sure

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.330 
boy that Giuliana's been lucky sure
she's<00:04:09.090> got<00:04:09.239> a<00:04:09.270> lock<00:04:09.570> or<00:04:09.750> twice<00:04:10.050> but<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.680> had<00:04:11.160> we

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
she's got a lock or twice but we had we

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.309 
she's got a lock or twice but we had we
didn't<00:04:11.670> open<00:04:11.970> all<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.300> them<00:04:12.420> at<00:04:12.540> once<00:04:12.870> because

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
didn't open all of them at once because

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.900 
didn't open all of them at once because
I<00:04:13.410> think<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.739> might<00:04:13.950> be<00:04:13.980> just<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.610> little

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
I think that might be just a little

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.449 
I think that might be just a little
overwhelming<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.380> we're<00:04:16.590> gonna<00:04:16.680> interchange

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
overwhelming so we're gonna interchange

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.900 
overwhelming so we're gonna interchange
them<00:04:17.760> within<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.660> next<00:04:18.810> few<00:04:19.109> months<00:04:19.290> but<00:04:19.910> this

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
them within the next few months but this

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.960 
them within the next few months but this
is<00:04:21.209> cool<00:04:21.510> it's<00:04:21.540> I<00:04:22.320> believe<00:04:22.620> is<00:04:23.130> also<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.640> Baby

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
is cool it's I believe is also a Baby

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.170 
is cool it's I believe is also a Baby
Einstein<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:25.200> it's<00:04:26.160> just<00:04:26.610> like<00:04:26.760> it<00:04:26.970> has<00:04:27.150> a

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
Einstein and it's just like it has a

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.130
