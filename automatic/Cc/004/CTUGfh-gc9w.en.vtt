know that the typical steel and leather

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600 
know that the typical steel and leather
things<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.680> you're<00:00:55.800> familiar<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
things that you're familiar with and

somebody<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.150> kind<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:57.750> lot<00:00:58.079> of

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
somebody can kind of with a lot of

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.100 
somebody can kind of with a lot of
effort<00:00:58.940> move<00:00:59.940> around<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.840> very

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
effort move around in a not very

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.560 
effort move around in a not very
effective<00:01:01.649> way<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.579> looked<00:01:03.060> at<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.360> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
effective way we looked at that and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.070 
effective way we looked at that and
realized<00:01:04.019> around<00:01:04.800> 2005<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.150> much

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
realized around 2005 or so that much

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
realized around 2005 or so that much
better<00:01:07.290> technology<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:07.979> available<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
better technology was available and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
better technology was available and
that's<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:09.750> compelled<00:01:10.080> us<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.229> start

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that's really what compelled us to start

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:29.580 
that's really what compelled us to start
working<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:10.950> this

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.730

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
put this on the first time stand up and

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.130 
put this on the first time stand up and

see<00:03:47.560> today<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.610> first<00:03:48.819> prototype<00:03:49.060> it's

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
see today is the first prototype it's

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.089 
see today is the first prototype it's
basically<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.079> prototype<00:03:50.560> as<00:03:50.769> it<00:03:50.980> was

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
basically the prototype as it was

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.460 
basically the prototype as it was
developed<00:03:51.519> at<00:03:51.640> Vanderbilt<00:03:52.090> University<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.989> I

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
developed at Vanderbilt University and I

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.869 
developed at Vanderbilt University and I
was<00:03:53.590> part<00:03:53.859> of<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.160> but<00:03:54.489> I'm<00:03:54.670> even<00:03:54.760> more

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
was part of that but I'm even more

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.699 
was part of that but I'm even more
excited<00:03:55.090> about<00:03:55.420> what<00:03:55.569> we've<00:03:56.019> done<00:03:56.260> at<00:03:56.440> Parker

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
excited about what we've done at Parker

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.559 
excited about what we've done at Parker

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
improve the user experience so that they

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.190 
improve the user experience so that they
can<00:04:03.549> truly<00:04:03.849> experience<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.540> independence

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
can truly experience the independence

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.289 
can truly experience the independence
that<00:04:05.379> they<00:04:05.560> once<00:04:05.829> had<00:04:05.950> by<00:04:06.609> using<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.970> Indigo
