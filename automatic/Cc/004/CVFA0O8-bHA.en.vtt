entries we had over six thousand entries
can't<00:01:09.780> possibly<00:01:10.200> predict<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.890> but<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.670> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
can't possibly predict it but what you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.300 
can't possibly predict it but what you
can<00:01:12.030> predict<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> variety<00:01:13.100> not<00:01:14.100> sure

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
can predict is the variety not sure

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.070 
can predict is the variety not sure
exactly<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> judges<00:01:15.270> will<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.750> looking

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
exactly what the judges will be looking

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.380 
exactly what the judges will be looking
for<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> think<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:18.270> know

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
for but I think when we see it will know

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.940 
for but I think when we see it will know
straight<00:01:18.689> away<00:01:18.720> whether<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.320> all<00:01:19.409> agree<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
straight away whether we all agree that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.410 
straight away whether we all agree that
will<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.310> interesting<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:20.909> discussion

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
will be interesting what discussion

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.929 
will be interesting what discussion
