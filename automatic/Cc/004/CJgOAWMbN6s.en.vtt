new writers especially will sort of

new writers especially will sort of
depend<00:01:02.120> on<00:01:02.330> it<00:01:02.510> right

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
depend on it right

breaking<00:01:05.690> techniques<00:01:06.250> they'll<00:01:07.250> be<00:01:07.430> able<00:01:07.520> to

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
breaking techniques they'll be able to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.810 
breaking techniques they'll be able to
just<00:01:07.940> jam<00:01:08.300> on<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.720> brakes<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:10.250> not<00:01:10.550> worry

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
just jam on the brakes and not worry

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.340 
just jam on the brakes and not worry
about<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.090> brakes<00:01:11.390> locking<00:01:11.840> up<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.170> going

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
about the brakes locking up and going

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.680 
about the brakes locking up and going
into<00:01:12.500> his<00:01:12.680> skid<00:01:12.980> very<00:01:13.580> nice<00:01:13.730> I<00:01:13.850> like<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:14.030> and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
into his skid very nice I like that and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.300 
into his skid very nice I like that and
then<00:01:14.960> they<00:01:15.080> kind<00:01:15.320> of<00:01:15.350> become<00:01:15.620> dependent<00:01:15.920> on<00:01:16.250> it

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
then they kind of become dependent on it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.550 
then they kind of become dependent on it
and<00:01:16.870> basically<00:01:17.870> throughout<00:01:18.260> their<00:01:18.440> entire

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
and basically throughout their entire

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.110 
and basically throughout their entire
writing<00:01:19.190> career<00:01:19.460> they're<00:01:19.670> gonna<00:01:19.790> be<00:01:19.940> limited

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
writing career they're gonna be limited

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.970 
writing career they're gonna be limited
to<00:01:20.450> only<00:01:20.480> ABS<00:01:21.140> bikes<00:01:22.930> in<00:01:23.930> my<00:01:24.380> opinion<00:01:24.800> that's

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
to only ABS bikes in my opinion that's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.160 
to only ABS bikes in my opinion that's
 this<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.500> ABS<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.840> know<00:01:29.870> and<00:01:30.110> I

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
 this is ABS you know and I

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.930 
 this is ABS you know and I
don't<00:01:30.230> think<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.710> I'm<00:01:30.830> any<00:01:30.980> less<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.790> a

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
don't think that I'm any less of a

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.010 
don't think that I'm any less of a
breaker<00:01:32.210> than<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:34.100> average<00:01:34.580> non-abs<00:01:35.210> rider<00:01:35.750> I

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
breaker than the average non-abs rider I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.969 
breaker than the average non-abs rider I
think<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:38.200> what<00:01:39.200> people<00:01:39.470> are<00:01:39.590> saying<00:01:39.860> about

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
think that what people are saying about

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.050 
think that what people are saying about
ABS<00:01:40.400> can<00:01:40.760> be<00:01:40.970> true<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:43.130> depends<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.850> rider

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
ABS can be true it depends on the rider

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.250 
ABS can be true it depends on the rider
though<00:01:44.300> it<00:01:44.420> has<00:01:44.600> nothing<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:44.960> do<00:01:45.080> with<00:01:45.110> the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
though it has nothing to do with the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.570 
though it has nothing to do with the
bike<00:01:45.470> has<00:01:45.740> everything<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.100> do<00:01:46.160> with<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.369> rider

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
bike has everything to do with the rider

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.170 
bike has everything to do with the rider
so<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.900> way<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.080> did<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.560> is<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:49.340> didn't<00:01:50.000> want

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
so the way I did it is I didn't want

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.670 
so the way I did it is I didn't want
that<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.390> happen<00:01:50.509> obviously<00:01:51.229> I<00:01:51.290> don't<00:01:51.380> know<00:01:51.560> if

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
that to happen obviously I don't know if

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.010 
that to happen obviously I don't know if
my<00:01:51.770> next<00:01:52.009> bike<00:01:52.160> will<00:01:52.369> have<00:01:52.400> abs<00:01:52.880> I'm<00:01:53.210> hoping<00:01:53.900> it

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
my next bike will have abs I'm hoping it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.170 
my next bike will have abs I'm hoping it
will<00:01:54.200> on<00:01:54.440> thinking<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.460> will<00:01:55.610> but<00:01:55.880> I'm<00:01:56.030> not

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
will on thinking it will but I'm not

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.889 
will on thinking it will but I'm not
sure<00:01:57.130> horsies

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.270 

you<00:02:01.899> know<00:02:01.990> but<00:02:02.170> basically<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.799> way<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:02.950> do<00:02:03.130> it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
you know but basically the way I do it

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.040 
you know but basically the way I do it
is<00:02:03.490> if<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.509> I<00:02:05.490> practice<00:02:06.490> proper<00:02:07.479> braking<00:02:07.750> we'll

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
is if I I practice proper braking we'll

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.540 
is if I I practice proper braking we'll
say<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.319> know<00:02:08.530> I'm<00:02:08.649> mixing<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.129> front<00:02:09.369> brake

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
say you know I'm mixing the front brake

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.150 
say you know I'm mixing the front brake
and<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.849> back<00:02:10.060> brake<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.629> I'm<00:02:11.590> applying<00:02:11.890> with

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
and the back brake and I'm applying with

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.589 
and the back brake and I'm applying with
so<00:02:12.370> much<00:02:12.489> pressure<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.090> don't<00:02:13.360> want<00:02:13.540> my

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
so much pressure that I don't want my

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.190 
so much pressure that I don't want my
brakes<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.110> lot<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.769> if<00:02:15.640> my<00:02:15.910> ABS<00:02:16.360> does<00:02:16.690> kick<00:02:17.019> in

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
brakes a lot and if my ABS does kick in

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.770 
brakes a lot and if my ABS does kick in
you<00:02:17.379> can<00:02:17.530> feel<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.980> when<00:02:18.099> it<00:02:18.250> kicks<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:19.540> does

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
you can feel it when it kicks in it does

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.729 
you can feel it when it kicks in it does
like<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.959> pulsating<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.840> does<00:02:23.080> kick<00:02:23.530> in

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
like a pulsating and if it does kick in

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.430 
like a pulsating and if it does kick in

happy I had it for those two times again

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.800 
happy I had it for those two times again
it's<00:02:42.459> not<00:02:42.640> like<00:02:42.700> every<00:02:43.090> time<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.360> break<00:02:43.599> I'm

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
it's not like every time I break I'm

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.110 
it's not like every time I break I'm
engaging<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.440> or<00:02:44.980> anything<00:02:45.190> like<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:46.090> I

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
engaging it or anything like that so I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.970 
engaging it or anything like that so I
personally<00:02:46.720> agree<00:02:47.019> with<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.620> think<00:02:47.890> it's

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
personally agree with that I think it's

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.339 
personally agree with that I think it's
a<00:02:48.069> great<00:02:48.280> thing<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.519> have<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.940> bike

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
a great thing to have on a bike

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.250 
a great thing to have on a bike
especially<00:02:50.349> for<00:02:50.920> beginners<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:51.760> learners

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
especially for beginners and learners

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.920 
especially for beginners and learners
the<00:02:53.260> way<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.440> see<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.829> is<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.190> if<00:02:54.700> abs<00:02:55.239> seems<00:02:55.750> to

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
the way I see it is that if abs seems to

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.690 
the way I see it is that if abs seems to
me<00:02:56.079> you<00:02:56.590> know<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.860> costs<00:02:57.129> an<00:02:57.220> extra<00:02:57.310> five

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
me you know it costs an extra five

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.330 
me you know it costs an extra five
hundred<00:02:57.730> dollars

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
hundred dollars

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.530 
hundred dollars
and<00:02:59.430> if<00:03:00.030> abs<00:03:00.599> can<00:03:00.810> save<00:03:01.080> me<00:03:01.319> just<00:03:01.560> once<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:03.269> has

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
and if abs can save me just once it has

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.229 
and if abs can save me just once it has
done<00:03:03.780> its<00:03:03.989> job<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.769> is<00:03:04.920> paid<00:03:05.160> itself<00:03:05.550> off<00:03:05.819> and

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
done its job it is paid itself off and

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.750 
done its job it is paid itself off and
I'm<00:03:06.629> glad<00:03:06.870> glad<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.590> have<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.129> anything<00:03:08.610> that

that's why would you do that when you

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.580 
that's why would you do that when you
have<00:04:21.430> two<00:04:21.639> wheels<00:04:21.880> instead<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.389> four<00:04:22.509> I<00:04:22.930> think

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
have two wheels instead of four I think

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.860 
have two wheels instead of four I think
everybody<00:04:24.039> is<00:04:24.130> just<00:04:24.310> so<00:04:24.550> focused<00:04:25.030> on<00:04:25.180> their

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
everybody is just so focused on their

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.680 
everybody is just so focused on their
skill<00:04:26.349> level<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:27.270> flaunting<00:04:28.270> their<00:04:28.419> skill

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
skill level and flaunting their skill

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.240 
skill level and flaunting their skill
level<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.229> comparing<00:04:29.650> their<00:04:29.800> chicken<00:04:30.160> to

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
level and comparing their chicken to

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.300 
level and comparing their chicken to
strips<00:04:31.560> then<00:04:32.560> they<00:04:32.680> are<00:04:32.800> just<00:04:33.070> being<00:04:33.340> safe

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.980 

I<00:04:36.340> smell<00:04:37.270> horse<00:04:37.570> food<00:04:39.360> now<00:04:40.360> don't<00:04:40.630> get<00:04:40.810> me

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
I smell horse food now don't get me

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.320 
I smell horse food now don't get me
wrong<00:04:41.020> I'm<00:04:41.410> not<00:04:41.440> downplaying<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.880> importance

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
wrong I'm not downplaying the importance

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.060 
wrong I'm not downplaying the importance
of<00:04:43.450> proper<00:04:43.810> braking<00:04:44.050> or<00:04:44.380> developing<00:04:44.950> that

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
of proper braking or developing that

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.780 
of proper braking or developing that
skill<00:04:45.150> not<00:04:46.150> at<00:04:46.540> all<00:04:46.860> but<00:04:47.860> I'm<00:04:48.010> gonna<00:04:48.130> saying<00:04:48.460> I

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
skill not at all but I'm gonna saying I

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.830 
skill not at all but I'm gonna saying I
think<00:04:49.389> that<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.990> would<00:04:50.889> rather<00:04:51.040> have<00:04:51.840> proper

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
think that I would rather have proper

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.159 
think that I would rather have proper
skill<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.380> abs<00:04:54.330> that's<00:04:55.330> an<00:04:55.570> extra<00:04:55.930> safety

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
skill and abs that's an extra safety

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.620 
skill and abs that's an extra safety
blanket<00:04:58.470> why<00:04:59.470> not<00:04:59.680> I<00:05:00.060> think<00:05:01.060> you<00:05:01.210> can't<00:05:01.450> have

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
blanket why not I think you can't have

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.590 
blanket why not I think you can't have
both<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:02.080> think<00:05:02.110> you<00:05:02.410> can<00:05:02.590> proper<00:05:03.010> proper<00:05:03.340> but<00:05:03.760> I

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
both I think you can proper proper but I

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.300 
both I think you can proper proper but I
think<00:05:05.200> you<00:05:05.350> can<00:05:05.590> practice<00:05:06.540> proper<00:05:07.540> braking

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
think you can practice proper braking

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.970 
think you can practice proper braking
while<00:05:09.310> having<00:05:09.730> an<00:05:09.820> ABS<00:05:10.180> bike<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:11.230> I<00:05:11.710> think

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
while having an ABS bike and I think

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.800 
while having an ABS bike and I think
that<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.250> should<00:05:12.490> do<00:05:12.700> that<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:13.510> you<00:05:13.630> should

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
that you should do that and you should

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:23.270 
that you should do that and you should
stay<00:05:13.990> alive<00:05:14.290> and<00:05:14.530> you<00:05:14.680> should<00:05:14.890> ride<00:05:15.100> longer

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.620 

now<00:05:24.280> I<00:05:24.310> could<00:05:24.640> have<00:05:24.730> jumped<00:05:24.970> on<00:05:25.150> them<00:05:25.300> harder

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
now I could have jumped on them harder

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.220 
now I could have jumped on them harder
than<00:05:26.200> that<00:05:26.410> but<00:05:27.150> that's<00:05:28.150> still<00:05:28.450> pretty<00:05:28.660> good

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
than that but that's still pretty good

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.440 
than that but that's still pretty good
can't<00:05:29.680> complain<00:05:29.950> with<00:05:30.130> that<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:30.910> guys<00:05:31.060> even<00:05:31.240> an

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
can't complain with that so guys even an

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.390 
can't complain with that so guys even an
instance<00:05:31.810> like<00:05:31.870> this<00:05:32.200> you<00:05:33.190> know<00:05:33.250> you're

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
instance like this you know you're

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.860 
instance like this you know you're
coming<00:05:33.580> down<00:05:33.820> a<00:05:33.850> big<00:05:34.090> hill<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:37.570> suddenly

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
coming down a big hill and you suddenly

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.420 
coming down a big hill and you suddenly
have<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.110> stomp<00:05:40.740> maybe<00:05:41.740> ice<00:05:41.950> allows<00:05:42.220> you<00:05:42.340> to

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
have to stomp maybe ice allows you to

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.050 
have to stomp maybe ice allows you to
stop<00:05:42.670> really<00:05:42.880> quick<00:05:43.210> so<00:05:43.870> like<00:05:44.700> the<00:05:45.700> only<00:05:45.850> thing

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
stop really quick so like the only thing

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.730 
stop really quick so like the only thing
that<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.240> ask<00:05:46.510> is<00:05:46.750> when<00:05:47.350> you<00:05:47.440> make<00:05:47.560> your

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
that I ask is when you make your

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.920 
that I ask is when you make your
decision<00:05:48.220> of<00:05:48.370> whether<00:05:48.670> or<00:05:48.850> not<00:05:48.940> to<00:05:49.120> get<00:05:49.210> abs

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
decision of whether or not to get abs

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.210 
decision of whether or not to get abs
or<00:05:51.259> if<00:05:52.100> you're<00:05:53.080> gonna<00:05:54.080> formulate<00:05:54.620> an<00:05:54.800> opinion

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
or if you're gonna formulate an opinion

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.850 
or if you're gonna formulate an opinion
on<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:55.400> just<00:05:56.240> consider<00:05:56.960> all<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.350> options<00:05:57.380> that

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
on it just consider all the options that

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.040 
on it just consider all the options that
considered<00:05:58.250> all<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.490> vantage<00:05:58.790> points<00:05:59.180> you

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
considered all the vantage points you

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.969 
considered all the vantage points you
still<00:06:00.410> can<00:06:00.710> develop<00:06:01.130> skills<00:06:01.490> while<00:06:01.789> using<00:06:02.060> abs

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
still can develop skills while using abs

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.760 
still can develop skills while using abs
both<00:06:03.979> are<00:06:04.220> important

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
both are important

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.850 
both are important
consider<00:06:06.770> a<00:06:06.830> BS<00:06:07.960> itools<00:06:08.960> supplement<00:06:09.740> you're

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
consider a BS itools supplement you're

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.800 
consider a BS itools supplement you're

breaking not to replace proper breaking
and<00:06:12.020> I<00:06:12.440> think<00:06:12.680> we'll<00:06:12.800> be<00:06:12.919> okay<00:06:13.250> but<00:06:14.120> by<00:06:14.690> having

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
and I think we'll be okay but by having

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.659 
and I think we'll be okay but by having
it<00:06:15.320> you're<00:06:15.440> not<00:06:15.590> only<00:06:15.650> potentially<00:06:16.190> saving

it you're not only potentially saving

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
too you saw you know how quick the bikes

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:23.409

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
doing so so if I didn't have abs I might

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.480 
doing so so if I didn't have abs I might
be<00:06:32.030> a<00:06:32.060> little<00:06:32.330> bit<00:06:32.449> more<00:06:32.600> hesitant<00:06:33.169> to<00:06:33.490> you

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
be a little bit more hesitant to you

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.939 
be a little bit more hesitant to you
know<00:06:34.610> to<00:06:35.120> force<00:06:35.600> a<00:06:35.780> quick<00:06:35.990> stop<00:06:36.320> like<00:06:36.560> that<00:06:36.740> and

know to force a quick stop like that and

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.860 
know to force a quick stop like that and
in<00:06:37.310> doing<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:37.669> I'm<00:06:37.940> kind<00:06:38.419> of<00:06:38.479> putting<00:06:38.660> other
