00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
I actually started with dear diary

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.760 
I actually started with dear diary
so<00:06:23.730> I<00:06:23.790> guess<00:06:23.970> I<00:06:24.120> kept<00:06:24.330> Diaries<00:06:24.570> for<00:06:25.560> a<00:06:25.620> while

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
so I guess I kept Diaries for a while

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.980 
so I guess I kept Diaries for a while
and<00:06:26.130> then<00:06:26.310> I<00:06:26.340> would<00:06:26.580> go<00:06:26.790> a<00:06:27.000> start<00:06:27.510> and<00:06:27.750> then<00:06:27.840> I'd

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
and then I would go a start and then I'd

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.780 
and then I would go a start and then I'd
stop<00:06:28.230> because<00:06:28.560> things<00:06:28.920> would<00:06:29.070> get<00:06:29.190> crazy<00:06:29.400> I

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
stop because things would get crazy I

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.580 
stop because things would get crazy I
wish<00:06:30.390> I'd<00:06:30.570> been<00:06:30.720> more<00:06:30.780> consistent<00:06:31.260> though

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
wish I'd been more consistent though

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.790 
wish I'd been more consistent though
because<00:06:32.450> it'd<00:06:33.450> be<00:06:33.810> interesting<00:06:34.110> to<00:06:34.500> go<00:06:34.620> back

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
because it'd be interesting to go back

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.290 
because it'd be interesting to go back
and<00:06:35.100> read<00:06:35.520> it<00:06:35.580> because<00:06:35.640> when<00:06:35.850> I<00:06:35.880> have<00:06:36.090> gone

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300
