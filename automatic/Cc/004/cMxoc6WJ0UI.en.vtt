00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
compare the size with the this is a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.859 
compare the size with the this is a
previous<00:02:09.629> generation

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
previous generation

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.259 
previous generation
she<00:02:11.049> was<00:02:12.010> released<00:02:12.310> exactly<00:02:12.849> kind<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.120> like

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
she was released exactly kind of like

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.070 
she was released exactly kind of like
one<00:02:13.510> year<00:02:13.659> ago<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.629> have<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:16.900> size

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
one year ago and here you have the size

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.130 
one year ago and here you have the size
difference<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.360> we're<00:02:19.599> putting<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.989> up<00:02:20.110> for

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
difference so we're putting it up for

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.110 
difference so we're putting it up for
the<00:02:20.349> first<00:02:20.560> time<00:02:20.709> hopefully<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.519> battery<00:02:21.879> is

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
the first time hopefully this battery is

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.670 
the first time hopefully this battery is
enough<00:02:22.690> battery<00:02:23.019> in<00:02:23.110> there<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:26.470> see

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
enough battery in there this you see

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.589 
enough battery in there this you see
it's<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:29.230> more<00:02:29.470> compact<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
it's it's more compact so it's it's the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.770 
it's it's more compact so it's it's the
new<00:02:31.750> omap<00:02:32.049> 3630<00:02:32.829> which<00:02:33.129> is<00:02:33.540> I'm<00:02:34.540> going<00:02:34.690> to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
new omap 3630 which is I'm going to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.119 
new omap 3630 which is I'm going to
calibrate<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.440> screen<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:38.319> longer<00:02:38.739> press<00:02:38.980> on

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
calibrate the screen the longer press on

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:47.250 
calibrate the screen the longer press on
the<00:02:39.220> cross<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:45.150> once<00:02:46.150> I've<00:02:46.599> calibrated

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
the cross like this once I've calibrated

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.180 
the cross like this once I've calibrated
the<00:02:47.590> screen<00:02:47.890> okay<00:02:48.400> come<00:02:48.670> on<00:02:48.790> there

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the screen okay come on there

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.520 
the screen okay come on there
calibration<00:02:51.190> done<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:51.910> now<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.530> welcome

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
calibration done so now you have welcome

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.330 
calibration done so now you have welcome

time<00:03:02.220> let's<00:03:03.220> install<00:03:03.670> all<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.849> applications

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
time let's install all the applications

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.420 
time let's install all the applications
so<00:03:07.060> we<00:03:07.390> can<00:03:07.540> get<00:03:07.659> the<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.319> bunch<00:03:09.310> of

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
so we can get the a bunch of

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.640 
so we can get the a bunch of
applications<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.209> they<00:03:10.359> included<00:03:10.750> but<00:03:10.930> of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
applications that they included but of

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.430 
applications that they included but of
course<00:03:12.040> these<00:03:12.819> devices<00:03:13.209> who<00:03:13.750> check<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.379> out

here as well so here is third party

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.720 
here as well so here is third party
application<00:03:34.389> is<00:03:34.569> installed<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:35.410> nut<00:03:36.250> demo<00:03:36.579> mode

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
application is installed a nut demo mode

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:44.119 
application is installed a nut demo mode
okay<00:03:37.269> okay<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.970> accelerator<00:03:41.400> they<00:03:42.400> have<00:03:42.639> it

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
okay okay the accelerator they have it

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.300 
okay okay the accelerator they have it
okay<00:03:45.129> there<00:03:45.160> is<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:47.319> let's<00:03:47.590> try<00:03:47.859> to<00:03:47.919> compare

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
okay there is so let's try to compare

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.069 
okay there is so let's try to compare
the<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.790> screen<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.359> quality<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> screen

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
the the screen the quality of the screen

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.589 
the the screen the quality of the screen
oh<00:03:50.410> if<00:03:51.400> it's<00:03:51.549> a<00:03:51.609> full<00:03:51.819> brightness<00:03:52.060> mode<00:03:52.239> right

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
oh if it's a full brightness mode right

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.839 
oh if it's a full brightness mode right
now<00:03:55.379> let<00:03:56.379> me<00:03:56.410> try<00:03:56.799> to<00:03:56.859> just<00:03:57.099> check<00:03:57.370> if<00:03:57.549> their

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
now let me try to just check if their

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.199 
now let me try to just check if their
settings<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:58.870> we<00:03:58.989> go<00:03:59.169> in<00:03:59.379> sound<00:03:59.889> display<00:04:00.250> and

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
settings and we go in sound display and

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.360 
settings and we go in sound display and
we<00:04:01.329> go<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.569> brightness<00:04:02.349> I<00:04:03.209> put<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.299> up<00:04:04.359> okay

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
we go to brightness I put it up okay

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.920 
we go to brightness I put it up okay
like<00:04:06.370> this<00:04:06.579> there<00:04:06.970> so<00:04:07.269> there's<00:04:07.690> still<00:04:07.810> a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
like this there so there's still a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.420 
like this there so there's still a
screen<00:04:08.470> protector<00:04:08.620> on<00:04:09.069> top<00:04:11.160> what<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.310> this

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
screen protector on top what is this

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.219 
screen protector on top what is this
plastic<00:04:13.060> thing<00:04:13.859> OOP<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.970> this<00:04:16.209> maybe<00:04:17.199> I

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
plastic thing OOP like this maybe I

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.839 
plastic thing OOP like this maybe I
should<00:04:17.410> redo<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.829> screen<00:04:18.579> calibration

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
should redo the screen calibration

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.320 
should redo the screen calibration
without<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:19.719> so<00:04:20.500> now<00:04:20.880> you're<00:04:21.880> going<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.120> try

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
without it so now you're going to try

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.520 
without it so now you're going to try
and<00:04:22.360> compare<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.380> screen<00:04:23.650> quality

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
and compare the screen quality

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.490 
and compare the screen quality
check<00:04:26.530> this<00:04:26.650> out<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:28.230> it<00:04:29.230> is<00:04:29.830> very<00:04:30.160> responsive

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
check this out and it is very responsive

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:40.080 
check this out and it is very responsive
kind<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:33.750> touch<00:04:34.750> screen<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:38.880> don't<00:04:39.880> have<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
kind of touch screen I don't have the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.870 
kind of touch screen I don't have the
same<00:04:40.270> video<00:04:40.540> in<00:04:40.690> here<00:04:41.370> but
