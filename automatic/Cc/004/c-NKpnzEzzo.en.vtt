intelligent running comm today I'm going
to<00:00:06.850> show<00:00:06.970> you<00:00:07.029> how<00:00:07.270> to<00:00:07.330> do<00:00:07.600> a<00:00:07.810> glute<00:00:08.260> activator

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
to show you how to do a glute activator

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.089 
to show you how to do a glute activator
now<00:00:09.970> when<00:00:10.630> you<00:00:10.870> spend<00:00:11.349> all<00:00:11.410> day<00:00:11.469> sitting<00:00:11.920> down

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
now when you spend all day sitting down

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:13.919 
now when you spend all day sitting down
there<00:00:12.519> what<00:00:12.730> happens<00:00:13.059> to<00:00:13.179> your<00:00:13.240> gluts<00:00:13.599> is<00:00:13.809> the

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
there what happens to your gluts is the

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.930 
there what happens to your gluts is the
muscles<00:00:14.290> tend<00:00:14.500> to<00:00:14.590> shut<00:00:14.860> down<00:00:14.889> they<00:00:15.429> switch

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
muscles tend to shut down they switch

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.429 
muscles tend to shut down they switch
off<00:00:16.150> and<00:00:16.330> then<00:00:16.450> they<00:00:16.720> don't<00:00:16.960> really<00:00:17.140> want<00:00:17.349> to

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
off and then they don't really want to

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.500 
off and then they don't really want to
contribute<00:00:17.800> to<00:00:18.039> anything<00:00:18.279> much<00:00:18.609> let<00:00:19.300> alone

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
contribute to anything much let alone

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.840 
contribute to anything much let alone
running<00:00:19.810> so<00:00:20.560> it's<00:00:20.949> quite<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.220> smart<00:00:21.520> move<00:00:21.820> to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
running so it's quite a smart move to

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.640 
running so it's quite a smart move to
spread<00:00:22.210> a<00:00:22.240> few<00:00:22.449> minutes<00:00:22.750> just<00:00:22.840> waken<00:00:23.529> those

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
spread a few minutes just waken those

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.470 
spread a few minutes just waken those
muscles<00:00:24.010> up<00:00:24.100> switching<00:00:24.880> them<00:00:25.000> on<00:00:25.119> or<00:00:25.269> off<00:00:25.330> as

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
muscles up switching them on or off as

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.960 
muscles up switching them on or off as
we<00:00:25.660> say<00:00:25.980> activating<00:00:26.980> them<00:00:27.130> before<00:00:27.550> you<00:00:27.760> head

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
we say activating them before you head

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.519 
we say activating them before you head
out<00:00:28.090> the<00:00:28.210> door

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
training from so this is how you do a

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.639 
training from so this is how you do a
good<00:00:42.129> active<00:00:42.610> it's<00:00:42.850> really<00:00:43.149> simple<00:00:43.649> like

again<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:19.450> that's<00:01:20.020> pretty<00:01:20.259> much<00:01:20.439> all

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
again that's that's pretty much all

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.530 
again that's that's pretty much all
there<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.799> to<00:01:20.860> glute<00:01:21.430> activation<00:01:21.580> there<00:01:22.390> is

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
there is to glute activation there is

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.640 
there is to glute activation there is
another<00:01:22.750> way<00:01:22.930> you<00:01:22.990> can<00:01:23.290> do<00:01:23.439> it<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.619> is

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
another way you can do it it is

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.100 
another way you can do it it is
inconvenient<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:25.090> lie<00:01:25.270> down<00:01:25.330> there's<00:01:26.049> another

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
inconvenient to lie down there's another

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.350 
inconvenient to lie down there's another
way<00:01:26.439> you<00:01:26.470> can<00:01:26.710> activate<00:01:27.100> your<00:01:27.220> glutes<00:01:27.549> we<00:01:28.210> can

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
way you can activate your glutes we can

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.640 
way you can activate your glutes we can
do<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.540> from<00:01:28.659> kneeling<00:01:29.049> or<00:01:29.140> spanning<00:01:29.530> I'm

they<00:02:14.540> give<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.870> good<00:02:14.990> ol<00:02:15.140> punch<00:02:15.740> for<00:02:16.640> about

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
they give it a good ol punch for about

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.270 
they give it a good ol punch for about
ten<00:02:17.030> seconds<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.599> then<00:02:17.870> relax<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.560> do<00:02:19.099> that

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
ten seconds and then relax and do that

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.070 
ten seconds and then relax and do that
two<00:02:19.520> or<00:02:19.670> three<00:02:19.700> times<00:02:20.090> what<00:02:20.630> that's<00:02:20.840> going<00:02:21.020> to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
two or three times what that's going to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.420 
two or three times what that's going to
do<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.380> sent<00:02:21.590> this<00:02:21.709> signal<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.250> brain

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
do is it sent this signal to the brain

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.300 
do is it sent this signal to the brain
so<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> muscle<00:02:23.930> this<00:02:24.500> is<00:02:24.709> where<00:02:24.980> I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
so this is the muscle this is where I

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.979 
so this is the muscle this is where I
want<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:26.000> switch<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.630> these<00:02:26.840> are<00:02:26.930> the

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
want you to switch on these are the

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.479 
want you to switch on these are the
buzzers<00:02:27.319> are<00:02:27.440> want<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.709> activate<00:02:28.130> and

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
buzzers are want you to activate and

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.580 
buzzers are want you to activate and
that<00:02:28.970> again<00:02:29.270> just<00:02:29.300> increases<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> amount<00:02:30.410> of

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
that again just increases the amount of

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.010 
that again just increases the amount of
activations<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.670> can<00:02:31.819> get<00:02:32.060> if<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.810> can

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
activations you can get if you can

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.170 
activations you can get if you can
activate<00:02:33.410> those<00:02:33.590> muscles<00:02:33.650> if<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:34.100> can<00:02:34.370> switch

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
activate those muscles if you can switch

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.910 
activate those muscles if you can switch
them<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.540> before<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:36.050> go<00:02:36.200> running<00:02:36.380> when

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
them on before you go running when

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.800 
them on before you go running when
you're<00:02:37.069> out<00:02:37.220> there<00:02:37.550> those<00:02:38.239> muscles<00:02:38.660> have<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
you're out there those muscles have a

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.990 
you're out there those muscles have a
much<00:02:39.200> much<00:02:39.500> greater<00:02:39.739> chance<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.250> contributing

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
much much greater chance of contributing

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.240 
much much greater chance of contributing
to<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.810> running<00:02:42.110> action<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.620> that's<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.010> good

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
to the running action and that's a good

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.890 
to the running action and that's a good
thing<00:02:43.519> we<00:02:43.640> don't<00:02:43.849> want<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.269> hamstrings<00:02:44.750> to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
thing we don't want the hamstrings to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.380 
thing we don't want the hamstrings to
take<00:02:45.110> over<00:02:45.349> we<00:02:45.920> want<00:02:46.190> strong<00:02:46.730> glutes<00:02:47.150> when

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
take over we want strong glutes when

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.120 
take over we want strong glutes when
we're<00:02:47.690> running<00:02:47.810> your<00:02:48.380> first<00:02:48.500> muscles<00:02:48.920> aren't

much<00:02:51.410> at<00:02:51.590> all<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.010> take<00:02:52.459> some<00:02:52.730> time<00:02:52.760> before<00:02:53.120> you

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
much at all so take some time before you
