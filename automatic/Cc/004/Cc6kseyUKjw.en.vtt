tell us what's so special about the
elite<00:00:11.570> seventh<00:00:12.020> HDI<00:00:12.680> the<00:00:13.370> elite<00:00:13.550> seven<00:00:13.940> is<00:00:14.120> a

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
elite seventh HDI the elite seven is a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.020 
elite seventh HDI the elite seven is a
unit<00:00:14.570> that<00:00:14.600> has<00:00:15.080> built-in<00:00:15.680> GPS<00:00:16.190> broadband

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.030 
unit that has built-in GPS broadband

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.630 
unit that has built-in GPS broadband
sonar<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:17.750> down<00:00:18.140> view<00:00:18.470> we<00:00:19.310> have<00:00:19.430> two

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
sonar and down view we have two

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.670 
sonar and down view we have two
different<00:00:19.970> price<00:00:20.450> points<00:00:20.900> so<00:00:21.110> there's<00:00:21.590> a

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
different price points so there's a

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.260 
different price points so there's a
$5.99<00:00:22.370> version<00:00:22.760> that's<00:00:22.880> going<00:00:23.030> to<00:00:23.090> come<00:00:23.240> with

you buy the $5.99 version you can always
buy<00:00:37.730> this<00:00:37.970> transducer<00:00:38.360> later<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:39.500> add<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.860> to

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
buy this transducer later and add it to

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.130 
buy this transducer later and add it to
the<00:00:40.280> elite<00:00:40.520> 7<00:00:40.820> HDI<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:41.570> then<00:00:41.750> you'll<00:00:41.930> have

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
the elite 7 HDI and then you'll have

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.030 
the elite 7 HDI and then you'll have
mapping<00:00:43.090> broadband<00:00:44.090> sonar<00:00:44.540> and<00:00:44.809> down<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.010> you

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
mapping broadband sonar and down so you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.069 
mapping broadband sonar and down so you
have<00:00:46.250> all<00:00:46.460> those<00:00:46.700> things<00:00:46.760> built<00:00:47.360> into<00:00:47.630> the<00:00:47.690> HDI

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
have all those things built into the HDI

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.340 
have all those things built into the HDI
um<00:00:48.440> yes<00:00:48.829> sir<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:53.239> first<00:00:53.600> thing<00:00:53.780> I<00:00:53.930> noticed

um yes sir the first thing I noticed

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.610 
um yes sir the first thing I noticed
about<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:54.829> elite<00:00:55.130> 7<00:00:55.550> HDI<00:00:55.969> is<00:00:56.540> this<00:00:56.809> big<00:00:57.140> wide

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
about this elite 7 HDI is this big wide

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.700 
about this elite 7 HDI is this big wide
screen<00:00:58.190> you<00:00:58.879> know<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.390> widescreen<00:00:59.750> format<00:01:00.410> is

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
screen you know the widescreen format is

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.299 
screen you know the widescreen format is
found<00:01:01.250> in<00:01:01.460> TVs<00:01:01.940> your<00:01:02.510> iPads<00:01:03.020> all<00:01:03.469> your<00:01:03.710> tablets

widescreen format when we have this in a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.129 
widescreen format when we have this in a
three<00:01:12.950> panel<00:01:13.189> split<00:01:13.759> you<00:01:14.479> can<00:01:14.539> have<00:01:14.810> your<00:01:14.959> map

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:15.139 
three panel split you can have your map

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:17.769 
three panel split you can have your map
your<00:01:15.979> traditional<00:01:16.490> sonar<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:17.240> your<00:01:17.630> down

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:17.779 
your traditional sonar and your down

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:19.809 
your traditional sonar and your down
view<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.469> it<00:01:18.590> fits<00:01:18.829> real<00:01:19.039> nicely<00:01:19.249> on<00:01:19.579> one

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819

screen<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.600> sonar<00:01:20.840> expel<00:01:21.289> tin<00:01:21.560> is<00:01:21.920> broadband

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
screen the sonar expel tin is broadband

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.580 
screen the sonar expel tin is broadband
sonar<00:01:22.969> so<00:01:23.119> it's<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.299> same<00:01:23.479> fluid<00:01:23.689> at<00:01:23.929> each<00:01:24.020> DSS

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
sonar so it's the same fluid at each DSS

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.039 
sonar so it's the same fluid at each DSS
