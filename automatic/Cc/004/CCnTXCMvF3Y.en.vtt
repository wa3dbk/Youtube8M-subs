00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.750 
then certainly we can be as humans how
how<00:02:28.049> can<00:02:28.110> this<00:02:28.380> happen<00:02:28.560> Karen<00:02:29.100> it's<00:02:29.459> pretty

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
how can this happen Karen it's pretty

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.210 
how can this happen Karen it's pretty
amazing<00:02:30.060> well<00:02:30.630> what<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:31.769> that's

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
amazing well what it is is that that's

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.050 
amazing well what it is is that that's
the<00:02:32.519> primary<00:02:33.090> sense<00:02:33.720> for<00:02:34.470> them<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.950> smell<00:02:35.610> so

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
the primary sense for them is smell so

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.420 
the primary sense for them is smell so
their<00:02:36.630> brain<00:02:37.019> is<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.440> part<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:37.980> their<00:02:38.130> brain<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
their brain is a part of their brain the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.630 
their brain is a part of their brain the
olfactory<00:02:38.850> lobe<00:02:39.150> which<00:02:40.109> detects<00:02:40.859> smell<00:02:41.310> is

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
olfactory lobe which detects smell is

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.900 
olfactory lobe which detects smell is
the<00:02:42.299> size<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.870> walnut<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.709> ours<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
the size of a walnut and ours is the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.410 
the size of a walnut and ours is the
size<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.359> a<00:02:45.480> pea<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.829> they<00:02:47.250> really<00:02:47.700> their<00:02:48.209> sense

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
size of a pea so they really their sense

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420 
size of a pea so they really their sense
of<00:02:48.540> smell<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.930> about<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.170> hundred<00:02:49.739> thousand

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
of smell is about a hundred thousand

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.630 
of smell is about a hundred thousand
times<00:02:50.840> better<00:02:51.840> than<00:02:52.140> ours<00:02:52.380> what<00:02:53.040> happens<00:02:53.400> is

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
times better than ours what happens is

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.819 
times better than ours what happens is
there's<00:02:54.329> certain<00:02:54.630> chemicals<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.709> are

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
there's certain chemicals that are

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.190 
there's certain chemicals that are
emitted<00:02:56.280> when<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:56.910> cancer<00:02:57.239> or<00:02:57.959> when<00:02:58.109> you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
emitted when you have cancer or when you

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.870 
emitted when you have cancer or when you
have<00:02:58.350> low<00:02:58.620> blood<00:02:58.829> sugar<00:02:59.250> before<00:02:59.489> you're<00:02:59.790> going

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
have low blood sugar before you're going

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.360 
have low blood sugar before you're going
to<00:02:59.940> seizure<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.170> dogs<00:03:01.470> can<00:03:01.859> actually

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
to seizure that the dogs can actually

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.910 
to seizure that the dogs can actually
pick<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:02.670> through<00:03:03.239> smelling<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.260> then<00:03:04.829> it

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
pick up through smelling it and then it

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.470 
pick up through smelling it and then it
goes<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.310> their<00:03:05.459> brain<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.000> signals

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
goes to their brain and that signals

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.630 
goes to their brain and that signals
that<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.900> gets<00:03:07.079> stored<00:03:07.650> so<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.370> can

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
that and it gets stored so you can

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.370 
that and it gets stored so you can
actually<00:03:08.820> teach<00:03:09.450> these<00:03:09.840> pets<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:11.750> alert<00:03:12.750> when

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
actually teach these pets to alert when

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.620 
actually teach these pets to alert when
something's<00:03:13.890> happening<00:03:14.459> she<00:03:15.000> doesn't<00:03:15.329> know

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
something's happening she doesn't know

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.270 
something's happening she doesn't know
that<00:03:15.660> you're<00:03:16.170> having<00:03:16.470> breast<00:03:16.650> cancer<00:03:16.739> what<00:03:17.190> it

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.390 
Susan's normal smell and then something
smelled<00:03:21.660> abnormal<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.680> that's<00:03:22.799> why<00:03:22.950> she<00:03:23.160> kept
