00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.580 
master for me whenever I started
shooting<00:03:31.150> someone<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.569> pretty<00:03:31.810> much<00:03:31.900> froze<00:03:32.349> and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
shooting someone I pretty much froze and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.470 
shooting someone I pretty much froze and
it<00:03:32.709> was<00:03:32.799> hard<00:03:32.980> for<00:03:33.040> me<00:03:33.159> to<00:03:33.340> move<00:03:33.489> this<00:03:34.000> requires

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
it was hard for me to move this requires

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.270 
it was hard for me to move this requires
you<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.810> use<00:03:34.870> both<00:03:35.199> analog<00:03:35.739> sticks<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.190> you

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
you to use both analog sticks and you

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.369 
you to use both analog sticks and you
able<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.549> move<00:03:36.730> side<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.030> side<00:03:37.239> as<00:03:37.659> well<00:03:38.199> as

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
able to move side to side as well as

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.289 
able to move side to side as well as
keep<00:03:38.530> your<00:03:38.680> aim<00:03:38.829> on<00:03:39.040> target<00:03:39.459> it's<00:03:39.970> very

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
keep your aim on target it's very

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.089 
keep your aim on target it's very
difficult<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.810> track<00:03:41.109> person<00:03:41.590> who's<00:03:41.739> moving

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
difficult to track person who's moving

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.409 
difficult to track person who's moving
around<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.519> lot<00:03:42.639> while<00:03:42.879> you're<00:03:43.060> trying<00:03:43.269> to

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
around a lot while you're trying to

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.360 
around a lot while you're trying to
shoot<00:03:43.690> them<00:03:43.900> that's<00:03:44.409> why<00:03:44.590> this<00:03:44.650> technique<00:03:45.250> is

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
shoot them that's why this technique is

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.969 
shoot them that's why this technique is
so<00:03:45.819> very<00:03:46.359> good<00:03:46.659> but<00:03:47.199> it<00:03:47.290> may<00:03:47.470> take<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:47.799> some

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:47.979 
so very good but it may take you some

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.069 
so very good but it may take you some
time<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.220> get<00:03:48.459> used<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.819> it<00:03:48.849> really<00:03:49.540> good<00:03:49.750> for

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
time to get used to it really good for

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.860 
time to get used to it really good for
hip<00:03:50.650> firing<00:03:50.979> with<00:03:51.310> SMGs<00:03:51.909> and<00:03:52.150> assault<00:03:52.449> rifles

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
hip firing with SMGs and assault rifles

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.080 
hip firing with SMGs and assault rifles
I<00:03:53.169> was<00:03:53.530> also<00:03:53.709> very<00:03:53.859> effective<00:03:54.489> for<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:54.819> but

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
I was also very effective for that but

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.520 
I was also very effective for that but
it<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:55.239> a<00:03:55.269> very<00:03:55.599> very<00:03:55.900> powerful<00:03:56.169> technique

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
it is a very very powerful technique

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.369 
it is a very very powerful technique
that<00:03:56.949> may<00:03:57.129> take<00:03:57.340> some<00:03:57.519> time<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:57.879> get<00:03:58.000> used<00:03:58.060> to

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
that may take some time to get used to

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.990 
that may take some time to get used to
