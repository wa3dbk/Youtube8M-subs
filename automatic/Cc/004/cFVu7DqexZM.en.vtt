00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
call maybe a little less for emergency

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.170 
call maybe a little less for emergency
situations<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.330> aspect<00:02:11.180> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
situations so I like that aspect the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.780 
situations so I like that aspect the
other<00:02:12.300> thing<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.629> like<00:02:12.810> about<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:13.349> is

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
other thing I like about this is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.089 
other thing I like about this is
is<00:02:13.849> made<00:02:14.120> out<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.569> aluminum<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.409> hole<00:02:15.590> casings

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
is made out of aluminum the hole casings

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.910 
is made out of aluminum the hole casings
may<00:02:16.250> had<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.519> looming<00:02:16.939> aluminum<00:02:17.780> although<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
may had a looming aluminum although the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.479 
may had a looming aluminum although the
actual<00:02:19.099> Dino<00:02:19.730> crank<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.299> plastic<00:02:20.980> I'm<00:02:21.980> pretty

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
actual Dino crank is plastic I'm pretty

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.009 
actual Dino crank is plastic I'm pretty
positive<00:02:22.939> it's<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:24.650> plastic<00:02:25.280> so<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:26.780> matte

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
positive it's it's plastic so it's matte

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.750 
positive it's it's plastic so it's matte
plastic<00:02:27.650> but<00:02:27.799> it's<00:02:27.920> real<00:02:28.129> heavy-duty<00:02:28.459> it's

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
plastic but it's real heavy-duty it's

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.869 
plastic but it's real heavy-duty it's
probably<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.239> lot<00:02:29.450> better<00:02:30.159> than<00:02:31.159> most<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.670> your

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
probably a lot better than most of your

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.199 
probably a lot better than most of your
radios<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.079> things<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:33.439> that<00:02:33.500> as<00:02:34.010> far<00:02:35.000> as

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
radios and things like that as far as

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.649 
radios and things like that as far as
the<00:02:35.510> Dino<00:02:35.780> crank<00:02:36.459> again<00:02:37.459> it's<00:02:37.909> aluminum<00:02:38.420> so

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
the Dino crank again it's aluminum so

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.629 
the Dino crank again it's aluminum so
it's<00:02:38.780> not<00:02:38.930> too<00:02:39.260> heavy<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.829> would<00:02:40.280> say<00:02:40.489> this

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
it's not too heavy I would say this

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.399 
it's not too heavy I would say this
weighs<00:02:40.909> a<00:02:40.939> little<00:02:41.389> bit<00:02:41.510> more<00:02:41.750> than<00:02:42.230> your

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
weighs a little bit more than your

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.000 
weighs a little bit more than your
average<00:02:43.060> iPhone<00:02:44.260> probably<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.469> little<00:02:45.620> heavier

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
average iPhone probably a little heavier

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.059 
average iPhone probably a little heavier
maybe<00:02:46.370> about<00:02:46.609> an<00:02:46.730> iPhone<00:02:46.909> and<00:02:47.389> a<00:02:47.420> half<00:02:47.629> or<00:02:48.230> your

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
maybe about an iPhone and a half or your

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.629 
maybe about an iPhone and a half or your
smart<00:02:49.430> phone<00:02:49.639> probably<00:02:50.359> similar<00:02:51.519> other<00:02:52.519> than

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
smart phone probably similar other than

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.780 
smart phone probably similar other than
that<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:52.819> think<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.269> great<00:02:53.480> device<00:02:53.689> to<00:02:54.790> plug

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
that I think it's a great device to plug

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.550 
that I think it's a great device to plug
it<00:02:55.939> up<00:02:56.060> you'll<00:02:56.329> need<00:02:56.540> your<00:02:56.780> own<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.290> plug<00:02:57.439> it

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
it up you'll need your own to plug it

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.960 
it up you'll need your own to plug it
into<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.859> wall<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.459> can<00:02:58.609> use<00:02:58.730> your<00:02:58.819> computer

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
into the wall you can use your computer

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.300 
into the wall you can use your computer
or<00:02:59.659> you'll<00:02:59.959> need<00:03:00.169> your<00:03:00.319> own<00:03:00.439> little<00:03:00.650> USB

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
or you'll need your own little USB

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.399 
or you'll need your own little USB
charging<00:03:01.879> plug<00:03:02.859> so<00:03:03.859> you<00:03:03.889> just<00:03:04.069> plug<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.310> up

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
charging plug so you just plug it up

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.020 
charging plug so you just plug it up
then<00:03:06.409> you'll<00:03:06.590> take<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:06.919> cord<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.819> comes

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
with plug it into the wall and then

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.619 
with plug it into the wall and then
you'll<00:03:16.609> plug<00:03:16.849> it<00:03:16.970> into<00:03:17.120> your<00:03:17.299> device<00:03:22.389> as<00:03:23.389> you

you'll plug it into your device as you

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.140 
you'll plug it into your device as you
can<00:03:23.810> see<00:03:24.019> it's<00:03:24.199> charging<00:03:24.729> so<00:03:25.729> when<00:03:25.909> it<00:03:26.030> gets

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150
