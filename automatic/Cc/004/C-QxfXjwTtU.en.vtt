Hi, my name's Marie,

00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:07.548
I work as a Room Attendant for Club Med,

00:00:07.548 --> 00:00:09.734
I'm going to tell you a little bit 
about my job.

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:12.273
I spent 15 years working in catering,

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:14.163
but then my personal circumstances changed,

00:00:14.203 --> 00:00:17.477
I'm not young anymore and I wondered 
whether I'd be able to get a job.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.660
That's what's so great about Club Med, 

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:22.338
they don't discriminate.

00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:25.419
It doesn't matter whether you're 20 or 45

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:27.465
or where you're from.

00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:28.630
Everyone is treated equally.

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:31.044
Initially, I applied to Club Med,

00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:33.251
for a catering position, but they told me

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:34.485
"they were looking for Room Attendants"

00:00:34.516 --> 00:00:35.823
So I thought "why not do something different?"

00:00:35.873 --> 00:00:37.350
I was willing to learn a new role

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:39.238
Everything moved so quickly.

00:00:39.327 --> 00:00:41.329
I attended a two-day training course,

00:00:41.427 --> 00:00:43.310
It's great if you like meeting other people,

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:45.415
and everyone is easy to get along with.

00:00:45.573 --> 00:00:47.059
I come into the room with 
one thought in my mind:

00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:49.893
to clean it really well 
so that the guests are be happy.

00:00:50.095 --> 00:00:51.697
The most important thing is discretion,

00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:55.950
followed by a determination 
to do a good job.

00:00:56.403 --> 00:00:58.501
I'm responsible for my own work, 
which is great.

00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:01.945
The room has to be spotless, 
and it's my job to make sure it is.

00:01:02.138 --> 00:01:03.717
Here at Club Med,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.802
you get recognised for working hard.

00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:08.694
It has changed me as a person. 
Now I'm much more sociable.

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:11.903
The job involves working closely with other people.

00:01:12.723 --> 00:01:15.520
Last week, I was cleaning a room for some Belgian guests. 
They said hello to me every day,

00:01:16.522 --> 00:01:18.574
and, when they left, they came to find me 
as I was cleaning another room

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:20.858
to say goodbye. 
It was a really nice touch.

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:21.703
Sincerely.

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:23.596
When I first arrived I was a little unsure,

00:01:23.818 --> 00:01:26.102
but gradually I realised that I could fit in here.

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:28.348
Eventually, I'd like to become an
Assistant Housekeeping Manager

00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:31.388
and train new recruits.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:33.876
There are lots of opportunities at Club Med.

00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:34.816
Even though I work on my own during the day,

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.552
there's a real team spirit here.

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:40.661
My roommate is Italian, 
and I've taught her to speak French,

00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:42.786
I've also learned a bit of Italian from her.

00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:44.277
It's a great opportunity to broaden your horizons.

00:01:44.448 --> 00:01:46.831
What do I like most about working for Club Med? 
You can really develop your potential.

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:51.365
I'm doing things I'd never have thought possible before.

00:01:51.825 --> 00:01:53.825
Well, that's my experience anyway!
