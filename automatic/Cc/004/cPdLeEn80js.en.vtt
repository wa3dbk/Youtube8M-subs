00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.610
 we love welcome again 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.400
 at day design today, we'll go there 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.710
 abbe there an Indian court and me 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.599
 look at the ingredients to about one 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.060
 kilogram oka Schouten who gets her 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.560
 at the Indian or Turkish invite one 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.849
 large garlic clove 1 teaspoon turmeric 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.279
 half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.669
 two teaspoons ginger fit and three 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.559
 teaspoon cumin ground naturally 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.120
 rice of rice fit and 500 grams of yogurt 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.840
 Again and again we start our roof 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.039
 so that we heat oil in the pan 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.289
 add the ocher pods and these 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.660
 about two to three minutes something 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.219
 sear 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.590
 only a little until she is so light 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.520
 get color and then you bring the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.620
 whole again out of the pan 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.210
 next 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.860
 Guess the garlic clove with the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.860
 ginger fits a bit 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.260
 are all the spices added to 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.360
 and mix the whole thing up right there 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.600
 a spice smell comes out so briefly 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.340
 before to the pan to be and 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.110
 This clears 20 milliliters of water 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.080
 then you keep listening to this for so long 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.869
 until the green seal, so to speak 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.450
 dissolves around no thick lumps anymore 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.659
 the fit to see 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.880
 the whole takes her from the stove and 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.880
 slowly add the yoghurt 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.479
 stir all the time 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.780
 so do not forget here that must of 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.460
 take the hearth plate because otherwise it will catch 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.390
 to cook and we want it to do 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.149
 be no case 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.220
 stir all the time until the 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:14.080
 yogurt is completely in it and then 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.800
 puts her out of the panne 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.060
 hearth itself with salt 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.090
 and it keeps on that all the time 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.800
 low temperature around then the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.800

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:37.340
