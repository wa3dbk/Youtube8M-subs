00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.000
 Tells people to come back with another video. 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.070
 of the channel revealed games for you and today 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.119
 I'll show you how I 'm running the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:26.519
 hunter 3 above 30 fps in my and 5 650 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 of the first generation with r 7 260 x from amd 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:35.219
 how we are here to show them options 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.010
 gameplay gives a deal here the clod 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.800
 everything on the bass with the maximum of frames 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.980
 per second which is the walk if limited to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.489
 resolution 231 78 because my monitor does not 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 is hd and we will find that how to ping the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.660
 game 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.680
 I 'm on a trophy horse and I'm in a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.829
 environment on the vegetation map or 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 - helton in an open environment and I will 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.750
 also show you install in the cottages 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.810
 In an enclosed setting there is a lot of 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:13.260
 the pixels get much heavier then 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.540
 Let's take a vow here by climbing horse 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.380
 come on 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.680
 You see we have saline in the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.680
 fgts 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.009
 The game is running quiet here. 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.130
 PraÃ§a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:34.020
 sometimes they may even have a one latch 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.770
 Lightweight milk but you can spin it and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.119
 also gives the album name a bit of 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.220
 4546 because I'm using the program 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.680
 here to record gameplay 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.820
 When I'm playing the game without using 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.399
 no problem 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.950
 the recording is at fsl 50 55 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.960
 in this lower configuration that I 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.579
 I put it as it is here. 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.670
 houses just connect has already declined a lot 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:07.250
 when the environment is closed and even 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.250
 a boy but they had already 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.310
 confusion 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.750
 hakim as the 15th in this episode of 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.480
 first generation with rr 765 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:26.170
 also how that give a crush 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:32.150
 Aquino does not even get off the horse paper 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:36.950
 which is also being above the 30 pts 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:40.070
 give to play I care a lot about the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.280
 graphics so fashion the game clear if I 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.360
 have a top-of-the-room processor or 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.850
 third generation 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.090
 of course I want to play a game 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.790
 117 interferes more for those who do not have and have 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.310
 a weak processor mine can run 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.500
 the game in this population that I 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.690
 It gives you to play quiet you do not 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.460
 they made me a player to run smoothly 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.740
 because the problem that everyone here still 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.990
 is thinking a little bit but is not 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.250
 This is what I hope you liked. 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.970
 like the whole country writes the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.040
 channel 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.780
 Give me your opinion of the enemy as a thing 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.020
 that you are running in games where 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.630
 You see if someone is running the 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.540
 world silver processor and also 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.030
 come on and let's play the game're gil 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.680
 cute owl top 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.020
 Unfortunately I can not use the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.330
 graphene another assembly will not use the 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.330
 School might not like the cou
