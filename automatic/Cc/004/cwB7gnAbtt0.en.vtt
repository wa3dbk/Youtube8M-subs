line the the blue one is called burst
and<00:04:21.480> that<00:04:22.480> does<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:24.360> you<00:04:25.360> can<00:04:25.540> do<00:04:25.660> circle<00:04:26.320> and

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
and that does and you can do circle and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.310 
and that does and you can do circle and
like<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.390> star<00:04:28.840> shape<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:31.780> pattern<00:04:31.990> there

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
like a star shape and that pattern there

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.750 
like a star shape and that pattern there
and<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:34.450> orange<00:04:35.050> one<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:36.210> called<00:04:37.620> across<00:04:38.760> so

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
and the orange one is called across so

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.659 
and the orange one is called across so
you<00:04:39.790> can<00:04:40.120> do<00:04:41.520> criss<00:04:42.520> cross<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:44.520> slanted<00:04:45.520> to

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
you can do criss cross and slanted to

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.770 
you can do criss cross and slanted to
say<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:45.910> don't<00:04:46.240> know<00:04:46.330> what<00:04:46.450> they're<00:04:46.600> called

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
slanted the slanted stitch and I think

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.130 
slanted the slanted stitch and I think
