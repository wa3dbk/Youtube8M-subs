00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
on our main screen so I find this is a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.960 
on our main screen so I find this is a
little<00:02:54.890> bit<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.100> heads-up<00:02:55.490> display<00:02:55.910> so

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
little bit like a heads-up display so

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.300 
little bit like a heads-up display so
when<00:02:56.240> you're<00:02:56.360> driving<00:02:56.740> it's<00:02:57.740> easier<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.190> do

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
when you're driving it's easier to do

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.860 
when you're driving it's easier to do
those<00:02:58.490> on<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.850> fly<00:02:59.060> rather<00:02:59.390> than<00:02:59.630> have<00:02:59.810> to

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
those on the fly rather than have to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.540 
those on the fly rather than have to
look<00:03:00.110> over<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.560> main<00:03:00.710> navigation<00:03:00.740> screen

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
look over to the main navigation screen

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.440 
look over to the main navigation screen
alright<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:02.930> kind<00:03:03.140> of<00:03:03.290> mix<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.740> match

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
alright so you can kind of mix and match

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.950 
alright so you can kind of mix and match
where<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.480> want<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.930> information<00:03:06.200> displayed
