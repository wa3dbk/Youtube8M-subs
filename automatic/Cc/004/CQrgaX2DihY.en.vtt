00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:13.999 
leader also is cost reduction and

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.809 
leader also is cost reduction and
affordability<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.590> for<00:01:15.859> us<00:01:15.979> in<00:01:16.189> our<00:01:16.310> industry

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
affordability so for us in our industry

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.629 
affordability so for us in our industry
it's<00:01:17.030> all<00:01:17.179> about<00:01:17.389> scale<00:01:17.719> you<00:01:18.560> can't<00:01:18.920> really<00:01:19.249> do

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
it's all about scale you can't really do

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.819 
it's all about scale you can't really do
cost<00:01:19.969> reduction<00:01:20.539> on<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.689> thousand<00:01:21.380> or<00:01:21.619> five

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
cost reduction on a thousand or five

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.620 
cost reduction on a thousand or five
thousand<00:01:22.429> or<00:01:22.579> even<00:01:22.639> ten<00:01:23.029> thousand<00:01:23.479> vehicles

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
thousand or even ten thousand vehicles

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.410 
thousand or even ten thousand vehicles
you<00:01:24.350> have<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.619> do<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.159> hundred<00:01:25.729> thousand

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
you have to do it a hundred thousand

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.209 
you have to do it a hundred thousand
five<00:01:26.689> hundred<00:01:26.719> thousand<00:01:27.499> and<00:01:27.770> eventually

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
five hundred thousand and eventually

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.309 
five hundred thousand and eventually
really<00:01:28.429> a<00:01:28.459> million<00:01:28.969> so<00:01:29.539> what<00:01:29.689> Nissan<00:01:30.049> and

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
really a million so what Nissan and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.319 
really a million so what Nissan and
Renault<00:01:30.560> are<00:01:30.770> doing<00:01:31.100> together<00:01:31.279> is<00:01:31.639> looking<00:01:32.149> at

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
Renault are doing together is looking at

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.269 
Renault are doing together is looking at
about<00:01:32.689> five<00:01:32.990> hundred<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.409> fifty<00:01:33.679> thousand

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:34.279 
about five hundred and fifty thousand

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:37.209 
about five hundred and fifty thousand
vehicles<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:35.090> annual<00:01:35.539> capacity<00:01:36.009> put<00:01:37.009> in<00:01:37.130> that

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
vehicles of annual capacity put in that

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.849 
vehicles of annual capacity put in that
kind<00:01:37.459> of<00:01:37.579> infrastructure<00:01:38.479> in<00:01:38.659> the<00:01:38.749> ground

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
kind of infrastructure in the ground

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.199 
kind of infrastructure in the ground
actual<00:01:39.859> plants<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.639> be<00:01:40.729> able<00:01:40.789> to<00:01:40.880> do<00:01:41.029> that

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
actual plants to be able to do that

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:43.449 
actual plants to be able to do that
because<00:01:41.569> that<00:01:41.689> allows<00:01:42.170> us<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.649> lower<00:01:42.889> costs

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
because that allows us to lower costs

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.580 
because that allows us to lower costs
makes<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.209> car<00:01:44.389> more<00:01:44.420> affordable<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:45.349> gets

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
makes the car more affordable and gets

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.819 
makes the car more affordable and gets
us<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:46.310> really<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:46.669> we're<00:01:46.819> trying<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:47.060> do<00:01:47.829> so

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
always get this question why do I always

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.080 
always get this question why do I always
have<00:02:29.959> to<00:02:30.110> hit<00:02:30.470> YES<00:02:30.769> on<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.220> sign<00:02:31.519> on<00:02:31.549> screen

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
have to hit YES on that sign on screen

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.210 
have to hit YES on that sign on screen
every<00:02:32.510> time<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.750> turn<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.230> car<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.470> well<00:02:34.069> you're

every time I turn the car on well you're

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.800 
every time I turn the car on well you're
doing<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:35.090> you're<00:02:35.299> giving<00:02:35.569> us<00:02:35.659> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
doing that because you're giving us the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.110 
doing that because you're giving us the
ability<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.530> let<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.370> data<00:02:37.640> go<00:02:37.849> up<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.090> a

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
ability to let the data go up to a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.240 
ability to let the data go up to a
satellite<00:02:38.390> go<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> data<00:02:39.409> center<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:39.829> come

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
satellite go to a data center and come

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.580 
satellite go to a data center and come
back<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:40.730> we're<00:02:40.849> capturing<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.569> kind<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.349> in

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
back so we're capturing that kind of in

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.140 
back so we're capturing that kind of in

length 37 miles 7 miles power on power
off<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:02.959> if<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.319> think<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.739> square<00:03:04.069> they're

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
off so if you think of a square they're

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.479 
off so if you think of a square they're
doing<00:03:04.670> seven<00:03:05.060> kind<00:03:05.450> of<00:03:05.599> miles<00:03:05.840> each<00:03:06.409> time<00:03:06.799> two

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
doing seven kind of miles each time two

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.099 
doing seven kind of miles each time two
to<00:03:07.609> three<00:03:07.819> hours<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.359> charging<00:03:08.659> overnight

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
to three hours of charging overnight

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.660 
to three hours of charging overnight
that's<00:03:09.260> all<00:03:09.500> they're<00:03:09.650> doing<00:03:09.950> in<00:03:10.159> the<00:03:10.459> car

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
that's all they're doing in the car

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.119 
that's all they're doing in the car
again<00:03:11.359> it<00:03:11.599> kind<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.840> fits<00:03:12.019> with<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.230> 37<00:03:12.950> miles

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
again it kind of fits with that 37 miles

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.099 
again it kind of fits with that 37 miles
worth<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.549> round-trip<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.510> it's<00:03:14.900> kind<00:03:15.049> of

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
worth of round-trip and it's kind of

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.660 
worth of round-trip and it's kind of
funny<00:03:15.349> we're<00:03:15.560> turned<00:03:15.859> into<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.159> source<00:03:16.519> of
