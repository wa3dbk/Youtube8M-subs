that I have all of mac brushes I think

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.380 
that I have all of mac brushes I think
except<00:01:05.260> for<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.740> 175<00:01:06.729> which<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.090> think<00:01:07.270> it's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
except for the 175 which I think it's

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.930 
except for the 175 which I think it's
really<00:01:07.600> too<00:01:07.840> big<00:01:08.200> for<00:01:08.470> anything<00:01:08.740> that<00:01:09.250> would

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
really too big for anything that would

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.460 
really too big for anything that would
need<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:10.330> for<00:01:10.630> but<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:10.869> have<00:01:11.170> something

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
need it for but I have something

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.350 
need it for but I have something
comparable<00:01:12.010> that's<00:01:12.400> kind<00:01:12.610> of<00:01:12.640> like<00:01:12.790> a<00:01:12.850> paddle

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
comparable that's kind of like a paddle

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.100 
comparable that's kind of like a paddle
shape<00:01:13.570> that's<00:01:13.780> angled<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:16.060> then<00:01:16.659> this<00:01:16.960> is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
shape that's angled so and then this is

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.230 
shape that's angled so and then this is
the<00:01:17.140> only<00:01:17.470> other<00:01:17.860> brush<00:01:18.369> that<00:01:18.610> I've<00:01:18.760> been<00:01:18.970> like

a<00:03:59.000> little<00:03:59.030> bit<00:03:59.329> more<00:03:59.419> comparable<00:03:59.870> to<00:04:00.139> this

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
a little bit more comparable to this

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.020 
a little bit more comparable to this
this<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.799> closer<00:04:01.069> one<00:04:01.459> which<00:04:01.699> is<00:04:01.879> the

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
this is the closer one which is the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.659 
this is the closer one which is the
blush<00:04:02.239> brush<00:04:02.540> okay<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.769> like<00:04:04.069> i<00:04:04.099> said<00:04:04.400> it's

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
blush brush okay and like i said it's

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.099 
blush brush okay and like i said it's
definitely<00:04:05.090> softer<00:04:05.329> on<00:04:05.599> your<00:04:05.750> skin<00:04:06.079> it

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
definitely softer on your skin it

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.780 
definitely softer on your skin it
doesn't<00:04:06.470> pick<00:04:06.620> up<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.829> smudge<00:04:07.129> color<00:04:07.459> because

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
doesn't pick up a smudge color because

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.629 
doesn't pick up a smudge color because
it's<00:04:07.940> not<00:04:08.239> as<00:04:08.480> dense<00:04:08.810> now<00:04:09.560> this<00:04:09.739> is<00:04:09.799> synthetic

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
it's not as dense now this is synthetic

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.089 
it's not as dense now this is synthetic
the<00:04:11.030> black<00:04:11.299> one<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.690> this<00:04:12.109> one's<00:04:12.349> glow<00:04:12.620> tear

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
the black one and this one's glow tear

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.920 
the black one and this one's glow tear
which<00:04:13.459> is<00:04:13.609> natural<00:04:14.030> fiber<00:04:14.269> and<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.629> synthetic

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
which is natural fiber and the synthetic

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.069 
which is natural fiber and the synthetic
fiber<00:04:15.440> which<00:04:15.739> is<00:04:15.889> fo<00:04:16.239> alright<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:17.539> that's

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
fiber which is fo alright so that's

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.219 
fiber which is fo alright so that's
difference<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:18.979> this<00:04:19.310> one<00:04:19.549> as<00:04:19.810> you<00:04:20.810> can<00:04:20.989> see

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
difference and this one as you can see

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.750 
difference and this one as you can see
this<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:21.979> first<00:04:22.220> thing<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.669> you're

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
this is the first thing that you're

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.029 
this is the first thing that you're
going<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:23.330> notice<00:04:23.510> when<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.960> wash<00:04:24.169> these<00:04:24.620> is

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
going to notice when you wash these is

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.540 
going to notice when you wash these is
that<00:04:25.460> you're<00:04:25.760> going<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.180> get<00:04:27.010> shedding<00:04:28.010> all

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
that you're going to get shedding all

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.399 
that you're going to get shedding all
right<00:04:28.699> like<00:04:28.909> right<00:04:29.599> off<00:04:29.659> the<00:04:29.960> bat<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.320> then

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
right like right off the bat and then

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.500 
right like right off the bat and then
again<00:04:30.740> because<00:04:31.159> it's<00:04:31.400> dense<00:04:31.789> it's<00:04:32.120> really

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
again because it's dense it's really

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.500 
again because it's dense it's really
really<00:04:32.840> dense<00:04:33.020> okay<00:04:33.620> so<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:35.210> then<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.479> course

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
really dense okay so and then of course

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.430 
really dense okay so and then of course
nature<00:04:36.199> of<00:04:36.289> natural<00:04:36.770> here<00:04:37.310> is<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:38.930> they're

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
nature of natural here is that they're

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.260 
nature of natural here is that they're
going<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.770> get<00:04:39.919> breakage<00:04:40.370> just<00:04:40.729> like<00:04:40.940> regular

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
going to get breakage just like regular

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.480 
going to get breakage just like regular
hair<00:04:41.720> if<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:41.900> don't<00:04:42.080> condition<00:04:42.440> it<00:04:42.830> you're

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
hair if you don't condition it you're

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.010 
hair if you don't condition it you're
going<00:04:43.639> to<00:04:43.699> get<00:04:43.789> breakage<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.630> then<00:04:44.840> you're

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
going to get breakage and then you're

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.679 
going to get breakage and then you're
going<00:04:45.169> to<00:04:45.260> notice<00:04:45.500> more<00:04:46.930> shedding<00:04:47.930> on

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:48.689 
going to notice more shedding on

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.049 
going to notice more shedding on
alright<00:04:48.959> so<00:04:49.559> that's<00:04:49.979> kind<00:04:50.789> of<00:04:50.849> like<00:04:50.999> the

00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:51.059 
alright so that's kind of like the

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:52.669 
alright so that's kind of like the
difference<00:04:51.419> on<00:04:51.749> that<00:04:51.779> no<00:04:52.110> as<00:04:52.229> far<00:04:52.349> as<00:04:52.559> the

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:52.679 
difference on that no as far as the

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:54.649 
difference on that no as far as the
application<00:04:53.399> is<00:04:53.489> concerned<00:04:53.939> I<00:04:54.119> really<00:04:54.479> did

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
application is concerned I really did

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.459 
application is concerned I really did
not<00:04:54.689> notice<00:04:55.259> any<00:04:55.469> difference<00:04:55.979> again<00:04:56.819> you<00:04:57.239> know

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469 
not notice any difference again you know

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
not notice any difference again you know
there<00:04:58.469> are<00:04:58.499> almost<00:04:58.799> like<00:04:59.069> two<00:04:59.279> different

00:04:59.479 --> 00:04:59.489 
there are almost like two different

00:04:59.489 --> 00:05:01.279 
there are almost like two different
kinds<00:04:59.759> of<00:04:59.969> brushes<00:05:00.389> but<00:05:00.599> they<00:05:00.809> can<00:05:01.019> have

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
kinds of brushes but they can have

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.489 
kinds of brushes but they can have
similar<00:05:02.249> purposes<00:05:02.819> or<00:05:02.999> uses<00:05:03.509> and<00:05:03.689> as<00:05:04.199> far<00:05:04.439> as

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:04.499 
similar purposes or uses and as far as

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.850 
similar purposes or uses and as far as
the<00:05:04.679> application<00:05:05.339> is<00:05:05.519> concerned<00:05:06.679> like<00:05:07.679> I<00:05:07.799> said

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
the application is concerned like I said

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.009 
the application is concerned like I said
I<00:05:08.189> really<00:05:08.579> did<00:05:08.729> not<00:05:08.759> notice<00:05:09.389> any<00:05:09.599> difference

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:10.019 
I really did not notice any difference

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:13.759 
I really did not notice any difference
i'm<00:05:10.139> going<00:05:10.349> to<00:05:10.469> use<00:05:10.709> my<00:05:11.989> MSF<00:05:12.989> trio<00:05:13.409> and<00:05:13.709> i'm

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:13.769 
i'm going to use my MSF trio and i'm

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:17.299 
i'm going to use my MSF trio and i'm
just<00:05:13.949> going<00:05:14.099> to<00:05:14.159> demonstrate<00:05:15.259> the<00:05:16.259> my<00:05:17.129> duo

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:17.309 
just going to demonstrate the my duo

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.759 
just going to demonstrate the my duo
fiber<00:05:17.610> brush<00:05:17.759> brush<00:05:18.269> okay<00:05:19.079> I'm<00:05:19.349> just<00:05:19.409> going<00:05:19.679> to

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:19.769 
fiber brush brush okay I'm just going to

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:22.939 
fiber brush brush okay I'm just going to
apply<00:05:20.099> this<00:05:20.249> see<00:05:21.179> how<00:05:21.360> nicely<00:05:21.809> applies<00:05:22.619> color

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
apply this see how nicely applies color

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.309 
apply this see how nicely applies color
and<00:05:23.249> it<00:05:23.309> looks<00:05:23.459> airbrushed<00:05:23.699> right<00:05:24.329> away<00:05:24.659> all

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
and it looks airbrushed right away all

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.249 
and it looks airbrushed right away all
right<00:05:25.469> because<00:05:25.800> the<00:05:26.579> bristles<00:05:27.059> are<00:05:27.479> really

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
right because the bristles are really

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.529 
right because the bristles are really
nice<00:05:28.409> and<00:05:28.469> softened<00:05:29.219> fiber<00:05:29.579> optics<00:05:30.149> really

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
nice and softened fiber optics really

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.619 
nice and softened fiber optics really
giving<00:05:30.809> you<00:05:30.989> a<00:05:31.289> little<00:05:31.889> bit<00:05:32.129> of<00:05:32.309> that<00:05:32.849> fact<00:05:33.269> all

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
right okay now we're going to use the

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.709 
right okay now we're going to use the
131<00:05:37.369> okay<00:05:38.369> it's<00:05:38.519> a<00:05:38.639> little<00:05:38.669> bit<00:05:39.119> more<00:05:39.389> dense

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
131 okay it's a little bit more dense

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:41.149 
131 okay it's a little bit more dense
that's<00:05:39.959> going<00:05:40.229> to<00:05:40.319> give<00:05:40.499> you<00:05:40.649> a<00:05:40.679> lot<00:05:40.949> more

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
that's going to give you a lot more

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.699 
that's going to give you a lot more
color<00:05:41.489> so<00:05:41.759> you<00:05:41.819> have<00:05:42.209> to<00:05:42.419> be<00:05:42.449> careful<00:05:42.839> all

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:43.709 
color so you have to be careful all

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:47.929 
color so you have to be careful all
right<00:05:43.769> in<00:05:44.069> same<00:05:44.309> thing<00:05:46.429> it<00:05:47.429> does<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.909> same

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 
right in same thing it does the same

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:49.969 
right in same thing it does the same
exact<00:05:48.539> thing<00:05:48.689> except<00:05:49.079> he<00:05:49.169> can<00:05:49.349> feel<00:05:49.649> a<00:05:49.679> little

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
exact thing except he can feel a little

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.279 
exact thing except he can feel a little
bit<00:05:50.249> of<00:05:50.459> that<00:05:50.729> density<00:05:51.299> all<00:05:51.779> right<00:05:51.989> on<00:05:52.169> your

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
bit of that density all right on your
