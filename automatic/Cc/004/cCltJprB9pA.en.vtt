00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.410
 It is difficult to keep track of taxes and keeping balance 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.130
 on 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.320
 that's one thing 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.829
 very firmly in 6 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:12.339
 were presented movement so to speak from the awakening and hip area 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.199
 Baloise new year high 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.210
 we see there are two to three inches apart here 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.229
 that says you will not be on one for at least the next three years 

00:00:24.229 --> 00:00:25.269
 imagine 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.259
 13 Michelle Bucken will 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.640
 foreignness still 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.310
 the host 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.310
 what does it cost to sip? 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.590
 Brussels - in the 56th 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.830
 green base 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.570
 that is very expensive 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.390
 Welzow one year 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.250
 there were 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.770
 I am not at all 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.190
 Company 2 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.840
 for optimal sledges a building block on the way to success 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.860
 dapd after the final siren both teams have the already high respect 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.650
 further enhanced 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.010
 no matter from which camp they came the spectators just thrilled 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.830
 even neutral viewers in the sold-out arena 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.460
 Germany in white as in the 2 2 0 victory in group match with real 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.420
 Flash start against the USA then two goals in the first five minutes this time 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.410
 with the 1 0 after just 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.760
 71 seconds 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.540
 after protection unworthiness exploited Sebastian Kessler knows the 25-year-old 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.820
 The Americans from the Effeff leaves several times in the winter months 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.880
 decided against the Chicago Blackhawks and Yemen in the US 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.750
 the concept of coach Michel, based on Auxerre Siebels before the Czech Republic 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.829
 Budzinski 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.180
 seemed to work 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.180
 However, the Americans also understood to hold against 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.790
 After paralympics gold in 2002, they did not go home without a medal 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.659
 drive 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.079
 After all, it was still about words of the Kamener Sven Sturm 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.079
 I had my hands full in this scene 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.720
 early against here 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.180
 completely out of itself 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.280
 US equal opportunity presented by their own teammate on the German 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.539
 Tor steered the Americans now left hand pushing enormously 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.939
 Josef Norz prevails 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.339
 formed without a clear and then the ProB lands 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.100
 a very lucky hit for the Americans 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.860
 because under the torso of goalkeeper and under the lugging of Kunduz 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.000
 Eclat through the mens protesting the disc across the line 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.239
 the German team but unimpressed 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.819
 we have rattled off with flops of the thought quickly continue to Sebastian 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.779
 Kessler and Dr back 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.779
 on the first 16-year-old first after 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.439
 Frank nh 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.239
 rapid combination game that made hope for the middle third 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.589
 but once the Americans turned on in the second third 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.309
 or adult 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:03.050
 the top striker Ernst 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.300
 with last use prevented but that we had on the backlog 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.189
 there is 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.399
 an open slugfest this game 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:18.419
 Sven Stumpe from the band sees the 30-year-old in the middle and made 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.079
 just all alone 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.779
 two numbers she renewed leadership Germany surrounded by complete 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:30.090
 us team sets the striker the advertiser Jens Kahl I said irresistible 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:32.359
 by faith on board percent 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.359
 the name list forms 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.570
 Greul Traber should not come to rest yet 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.029
 Lucky for swords 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:45.419
 semi-final-out against Canada outstanding goalkeeper in the street to go 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.089
 the balance was in the air 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.549
 Germany in outnumber can not free itself again crew is immense 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.019
 GrÃ¼ttners from Celle is further to Storr l 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:01.589
 blocked 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.419
 Lippstadt 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.699
 2 0 2 earned at this time 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.189
 no question 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.109
 Sebastian Kessler and Ludo they still fought in the shot 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.519
 but then any help came too late on this third so ends in a draw 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.749
 the anticipation of the showdown 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.749
 Butz 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.550
 this over had use of Josef Hauer against Robert Park 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.419
 two minutes penalty lurking 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.360
 the chances for Germany 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.770
 July in front of the restaurant 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.909
 but then 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.669
 the liberation of Perin Hunt very much behind 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.189
 Here he explains and Nahles had been there 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:58.099
 similar behavior 13 2 the US first time in the lead of the preliminary round f 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.240
 German stock market overpayment game and this time 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.090
 Backfired that is certainly always very very bitter 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.909
 they hold that 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.410
 but she did not suspect me anything that Lorre 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.240
 The medical journalist QS last managed for the first time since its inception 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.129
 what we take 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.499
 what a 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:21.740
 Shot hissed 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.070
 Maybe so Dreyer year just did not want to add a little team in 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.069
 This madness is a rousing match 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.630
 1 because the guys from the US from my experience in the "leak" 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.720
 yes and that does not matter so completely unusual Gallo 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.909
 and actually it was nice 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.850
 who performs well in the US 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.600
 again overpayment for Germany this time it hit from the perspective of the testers 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:50.599
 there the flash player 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.680
 he has increased boosting tingling screenshots has risen 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.759
 three minutes and seven seconds before the end of regular time 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.319
 JOI 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.610
 RTS 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.990
 Shiatsu 3 lead again 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.620
 had just been able to ward off but then the puck out of sight 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.369
 lost 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:10.650
 but these days 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.930
 nothing was decided in the game Germany was at full risk 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.189
 then already more than 2 million 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:19.919
 Newton before the end the goalkeeper of the ice all or nothing irrepressible fighting spirit 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.919
 for self-abandonment 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:28.309
 a little luck 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:30.169
 give them to your party 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.860
 Instead, the Americans cheered in the end, knowing how close they were 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.860
 had come from it 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:40.330
 Liberman raises 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.040
 Whoever has the Elbe for the Russians is the third as a few years ago 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.800
 which in turn did not want oil 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.229
 Nevertheless, the 16-year-old can drive heartbrokenly 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:51.009
 only which is the right one 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.009
 and the other experienced just found the right words 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:57.710
 that alone the performance and not so much the result counts 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.270
 They are so excited that it does not hurt that much anymore 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.419
 After I say why this was around 2 we are now here in the world around that 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:10.650
 Heart Burda before so that no one restrained the water 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:14.680
 it's super seen a few percent whole 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.139
 the Americans have complimented and said great 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:22.780
 played and was since then undertook aldi recognize achievement on the other hand 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.490
 get to be in these countries
