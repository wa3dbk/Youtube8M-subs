then you take pictures and you look at

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.590 
then you take pictures and you look at
on<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:19.890> camera<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:20.970> face<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
on your camera and your face is like a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.359 
on your camera and your face is like a
ghost<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.500> pale<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
ghost and you look pale and it's like I

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670 
ghost and you look pale and it's like I
just<00:01:23.400> tanned<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:24.270> I'm<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.229> pale<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
just tanned or I'm not that pale and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
just tanned or I'm not that pale and
your<00:01:25.950> makeup<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.430> kind<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.640> disappears<00:01:27.119> as

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
your makeup just kind of disappears as

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.819 
your makeup just kind of disappears as
far<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> coverage<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.320> don't<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.710> it's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
far as the coverage I don't think it's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.190 
far as the coverage I don't think it's
buildable<00:01:29.130> too<00:01:29.400> full<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.909> personally<00:01:30.840> only<00:01:30.990> get

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
buildable too full I personally only get

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230 
buildable too full I personally only get
about<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.439> medium<00:01:31.920> coverage<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.759> but

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
about a medium coverage out of this but

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.580 
about a medium coverage out of this but
that's<00:01:33.360> fine<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.659> think<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.200> looks<00:01:34.350> really

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
that's fine I think it looks really

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.560 
that's fine I think it looks really
flawless<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> skin<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> still<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.479> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
flawless on the skin but I still have to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.940 
flawless on the skin but I still have to
put<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:36.930> bit<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> concealer<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.799> have

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
put a little bit of concealer if I have

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.620 
put a little bit of concealer if I have
a<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.250> bad<00:01:38.369> break<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:39.210> far<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
a really bad break out as far as the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.749 
a really bad break out as far as the
wear<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.500> normal<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> combination<00:01:41.189> oily

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
wear I have normal to combination oily

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.990 
wear I have normal to combination oily
skin<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:43.079> lasts<00:01:43.470> on<00:01:43.560> me<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.920> good<00:01:44.159> 7<00:01:44.610> hours

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
skin and this lasts on me a good 7 hours

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.450 
skin and this lasts on me a good 7 hours
before<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.420> starts<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> fade<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> usually

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
before it starts to fade so I usually

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.560 
before it starts to fade so I usually
will<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.850> set<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> little<00:01:48.390> bit<00:01:48.509> of

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
will just set it with a little bit of

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.389 
will just set it with a little bit of
powder<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.020> my<00:01:49.259> t-zone<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> I'm<00:01:50.040> good<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.369> go

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399

for people with oily skin and it's weird

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.380 
for people with oily skin and it's weird
because<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.520> oil-free<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.240> would<00:02:03.360> think

you would be able to wear it but it's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.249 
you would be able to wear it but it's

extremely<00:03:16.519> oily<00:03:16.790> skin<00:03:17.180> because<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.630> looks

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
extremely oily skin because it looks

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.900 
extremely oily skin because it looks
beautiful<00:03:18.080> in<00:03:18.530> photography<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.430> it<00:03:19.760> looks

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
beautiful in photography and it looks

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.660 
beautiful in photography and it looks
beautiful<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:20.630> camera<00:03:20.980> but<00:03:21.980> most<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.400> us<00:03:22.519> don't

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
beautiful on camera but most of us don't

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.580 
beautiful on camera but most of us don't
need<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.880> be<00:03:23.090> an<00:03:23.209> HD<00:03:23.720> every<00:03:23.989> day<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.200> mean

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590

need to be an HD every day I mean
walking<00:03:25.010> around<00:03:25.310> unless<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:25.730> just<00:03:25.880> want<00:03:25.970> to

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
walking around unless you just want to

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.240 
walking around unless you just want to
feel<00:03:26.360> like<00:03:26.540> you're<00:03:26.690> in<00:03:26.780> HD<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.410> don't<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.130> you

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
feel like you're in HD I don't think you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.620 
feel like you're in HD I don't think you
need<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.519> product<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:29.090> don't<00:03:29.360> wear<00:03:29.510> this

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
need the product I don't wear this

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.630 
need the product I don't wear this
foundation<00:03:30.110> every<00:03:30.350> day<00:03:30.380> I<00:03:30.769> usually<00:03:31.310> only<00:03:31.400> wear

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
foundation every day I usually only wear

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640 
foundation every day I usually only wear
it<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:31.880> special<00:03:32.150> occasions<00:03:32.690> or<00:03:32.989> if<00:03:33.350> I'm<00:03:33.470> gonna

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
it for special occasions or if I'm gonna

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.710 
it for special occasions or if I'm gonna
be<00:03:33.830> in<00:03:33.950> pictures<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.489> I<00:03:34.549> know<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:35.030> then<00:03:35.540> I'll

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
be in pictures and I know it then I'll

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.449 
be in pictures and I know it then I'll
wear<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:36.140> but<00:03:36.560> it's<00:03:36.709> not<00:03:36.890> something<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.220> I

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
wear it but it's not something that I

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.280 
wear it but it's not something that I
would<00:03:37.610> wear<00:03:37.700> everyday<00:03:37.970> because<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.660> just<00:03:39.140> don't

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
would wear everyday because I just don't

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.810 
would wear everyday because I just don't
have<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.560> $42<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.400> keep<00:03:40.549> replenishing

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
have the $42 to keep replenishing

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.360 
have the $42 to keep replenishing
something<00:03:41.480> that<00:03:42.049> isn't<00:03:42.560> really<00:03:42.860> giving<00:03:43.250> me

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
something that isn't really giving me

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.850 
something that isn't really giving me
something<00:03:44.049> more<00:03:45.049> special<00:03:45.500> than<00:03:45.620> other

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
something more special than other

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.039 
something more special than other
foundations<00:03:46.580> in<00:03:46.880> my<00:03:47.090> opinion<00:03:47.480> if<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:47.870> makes

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
foundations in my opinion if that makes

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:48.370 
foundations in my opinion if that makes
sense

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
sense

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.350 
sense
so<00:03:48.920> I<00:03:48.950> have<00:03:49.310> lots<00:03:49.489> of<00:03:49.610> other<00:03:49.700> foundations<00:03:50.299> that

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
so I have lots of other foundations that

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.750 
so I have lots of other foundations that
I<00:03:50.510> just<00:03:51.049> as<00:03:51.230> much<00:03:51.410> love<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.709> finish<00:03:52.010> they<00:03:52.489> just

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
I just as much love the finish they just

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.910 
I just as much love the finish they just
aren't<00:03:52.970> good<00:03:53.209> for<00:03:53.420> photography<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.530> if<00:03:54.799> you

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
aren't good for photography so if you

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.560 
aren't good for photography so if you
need<00:03:55.100> this<00:03:55.220> for<00:03:55.430> pictures<00:03:55.730> definitely<00:03:56.360> try<00:03:56.540> it

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
need this for pictures definitely try it

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.360 
need this for pictures definitely try it
out<00:03:56.750> like<00:03:57.140> for<00:03:57.350> prom<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.590> stuff<00:03:58.040> like<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.340> I

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
out like for prom and stuff like that I

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.580 
out like for prom and stuff like that I
think<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.850> would<00:03:58.910> be<00:03:59.060> awesome<00:03:59.570> but<00:04:00.200> if<00:04:00.470> you

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
think it would be awesome but if you

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.199 
think it would be awesome but if you
just<00:04:00.799> want<00:04:00.980> something<00:04:01.130> everyday<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.730> think

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
just want something everyday I think

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.940 
just want something everyday I think
that<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.390> could<00:04:02.630> find<00:04:02.870> something<00:04:03.110> cheaper<00:04:03.680> or

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
that you could find something cheaper or

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.680 
that you could find something cheaper or
with<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.519> different<00:04:04.730> finish<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.390> you'll<00:04:05.480> like

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
with a different finish that you'll like

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.569 
with a different finish that you'll like
a<00:04:05.870> little<00:04:06.200> bit<00:04:06.350> better<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:07.130> that's<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:07.400> my

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
a little bit better but that's just my

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.650 
a little bit better but that's just my
personal<00:04:08.030> opinion

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
personal opinion

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.360 
personal opinion
so<00:04:08.810> if<00:04:09.049> you<00:04:09.200> really<00:04:09.410> love<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:09.799> and<00:04:10.040> you<00:04:10.190> love
