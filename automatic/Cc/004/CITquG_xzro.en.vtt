00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
the side of the truck I put it on there

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.000 
the side of the truck I put it on there
I<00:04:43.990> let<00:04:44.290> it<00:04:44.410> sit<00:04:44.680> for<00:04:44.710> about<00:04:46.380> not<00:04:47.380> even<00:04:47.560> five

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
I let it sit for about not even five

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.930 
I let it sit for about not even five
minutes<00:04:48.040> and<00:04:48.760> I<00:04:49.330> can<00:04:49.750> rub<00:04:50.020> on<00:04:50.229> it<00:04:50.260> and<00:04:50.940> it'll

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
minutes and I can rub on it and it'll

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.760 
minutes and I can rub on it and it'll
take<00:04:52.240> right<00:04:52.479> off<00:04:52.630> the<00:04:52.870> paint<00:04:53.140> spots<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.740> can

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
take right off the paint spots you can

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.070 
take right off the paint spots you can
see<00:04:54.130> I've<00:04:54.760> already<00:04:55.030> done<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.630> back<00:04:55.810> of<00:04:55.990> the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
see I've already done the back of the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.460 
see I've already done the back of the
truck<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:56.410> it<00:04:56.650> looks<00:04:56.860> excellent<00:04:58.470> it's

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
truck and it looks excellent it's

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.400 
truck and it looks excellent it's
raining<00:04:59.919> out<00:05:00.070> that's<00:05:00.340> not<00:05:00.550> I'm<00:05:00.729> not<00:05:01.410> standing

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
raining out that's not I'm not standing

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.500 
raining out that's not I'm not standing
out<00:05:02.560> there<00:05:02.669> but<00:05:03.669> I<00:05:03.880> just<00:05:03.970> want<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.330> give<00:05:04.479> you

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
out there but I just want to give you

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.990 
out there but I just want to give you
this<00:05:04.690> update<00:05:05.229> if<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:05.710> run<00:05:06.160> into<00:05:06.340> this<00:05:06.550> problem

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
this update if you run into this problem

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.969 
this update if you run into this problem
like<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.360> said<00:05:07.570> I'm<00:05:07.690> dealing<00:05:07.990> with<00:05:08.020> latex<00:05:08.680> paint

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
like I said I'm dealing with latex paint

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.260 
like I said I'm dealing with latex paint
so<00:05:09.130> it's<00:05:09.250> probably<00:05:09.490> a<00:05:09.550> little<00:05:09.640> easier<00:05:09.880> than

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
so it's probably a little easier than

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.920 
so it's probably a little easier than
oil-based<00:05:10.810> paint<00:05:11.140> so<00:05:12.039> I<00:05:12.490> put<00:05:12.970> that<00:05:13.150> on<00:05:13.360> there<00:05:13.390> I

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
oil-based paint so I put that on there I

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.779 
oil-based paint so I put that on there I
let<00:05:14.200> it<00:05:14.289> bubble<00:05:14.470> up<00:05:14.770> and<00:05:15.010> then<00:05:15.160> you<00:05:15.340> just<00:05:15.550> rub

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
let it bubble up and then you just rub

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.170 
let it bubble up and then you just rub
on<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.360> I<00:05:17.260> think<00:05:17.710> it's<00:05:17.979> easy<00:05:18.520> on<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:18.940> paint

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
on it and I think it's easy on the paint

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.840 
on it and I think it's easy on the paint
and<00:05:19.390> it<00:05:19.510> comes<00:05:19.720> right<00:05:19.840> off<00:05:19.990> I'm<00:05:20.710> also<00:05:20.950> using<00:05:21.130> a

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
and it comes right off I'm also using a

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.500 
and it comes right off I'm also using a
a<00:05:23.070> buffer<00:05:24.070> pad<00:05:24.430> which<00:05:24.910> makes<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.330> lot<00:05:25.450> easier

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
a buffer pad which makes it a lot easier

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.360 
a buffer pad which makes it a lot easier
but<00:05:26.020> you<00:05:26.140> can<00:05:26.289> do<00:05:26.410> it<00:05:26.530> by<00:05:26.650> hand<00:05:26.890> that's<00:05:27.220> how<00:05:27.340> I

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
but you can do it by hand that's how I

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.080 
but you can do it by hand that's how I
did<00:05:27.700> it<00:05:27.820> first<00:05:28.140> so<00:05:29.140> I<00:05:29.770> hope<00:05:30.550> this<00:05:30.700> helps<00:05:31.030> you

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
did it first so I hope this helps you

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.810 
did it first so I hope this helps you

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.370 
so here's a look at a panel I haven't
done<00:05:43.240> yet<00:05:43.539> and<00:05:43.950> this<00:05:44.950> is<00:05:45.280> the<00:05:45.760> panel<00:05:46.350> that<00:05:47.350> I

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
done yet and this is the panel that I

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.950 
done yet and this is the panel that I
just<00:05:47.740> showed<00:05:47.950> you<00:05:47.979> and<00:05:48.610> you<00:05:48.669> could<00:05:49.270> clearly

just showed you and you could clearly
see<00:05:50.200> that<00:05:50.860> that<00:05:51.789> is<00:05:52.000> looking<00:05:52.390> good<00:05:52.660> I<00:05:53.050> don't

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
see that that is looking good I don't

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.260 
see that that is looking good I don't
know<00:05:53.650> how<00:05:53.800> well<00:05:54.010> you<00:05:54.130> can<00:05:54.190> see<00:05:54.400> the<00:05:54.550> specs<00:05:54.970> on

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
know how well you can see the specs on

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.360 
know how well you can see the specs on
that<00:05:55.510> because<00:05:56.110> that<00:05:56.349> wasn't<00:05:56.560> done<00:05:56.860> but<00:05:57.070> over

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
that because that wasn't done but over

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.370 
that because that wasn't done but over
here<00:05:57.840> it's<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:58.900> nice<00:05:59.110> glossy<00:05:59.470> finish

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
here it's a nice glossy finish

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.440 
here it's a nice glossy finish
and<00:06:00.650> this<00:06:01.370> stuff<00:06:01.670> here<00:06:01.700> this<00:06:02.120> is<00:06:02.270> actually

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
and this stuff here this is actually

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.640 
and this stuff here this is actually
just<00:06:02.780> some<00:06:03.050> bubbles<00:06:03.500> from<00:06:03.650> degreaser<00:06:04.580> but

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
just some bubbles from degreaser but

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.090 
just some bubbles from degreaser but
yeah<00:06:06.650> it<00:06:06.800> stuff<00:06:07.010> works<00:06:07.250> great<00:06:07.610> and<00:06:08.320> I<00:06:09.320> like<00:06:09.920> the

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
yeah it stuff works great and I like the

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.650 
yeah it stuff works great and I like the
fact<00:06:10.310> that<00:06:10.490> it's<00:06:10.670> kind<00:06:10.910> of<00:06:10.970> slippery<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:11.570> it

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
fact that it's kind of slippery and it

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.380 
fact that it's kind of slippery and it
lubricates<00:06:12.350> as<00:06:12.590> you<00:06:12.740> take<00:06:12.950> it<00:06:13.070> off<00:06:13.220> so<00:06:13.580> you

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
lubricates as you take it off so you

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.600 
lubricates as you take it off so you
know<00:06:14.510> I<00:06:14.540> feel<00:06:14.780> like<00:06:14.960> it's<00:06:15.110> not<00:06:15.490> hurting<00:06:16.490> the

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
know I feel like it's not hurting the

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.470 
know I feel like it's not hurting the
paint<00:06:16.940> like<00:06:17.330> that<00:06:18.160> isopropyl<00:06:19.160> alcohol<00:06:19.480> might

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480 
paint like that isopropyl alcohol might

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.020 
paint like that isopropyl alcohol might
be<00:06:20.780> it's<00:06:21.350> at<00:06:21.560> least<00:06:21.680> taken<00:06:22.100> off<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.460> wax<00:06:22.700> I

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
be it's at least taken off the wax I

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.600 
be it's at least taken off the wax I
know<00:06:23.090> that<00:06:23.390> so<00:06:24.320> I<00:06:24.350> will<00:06:24.710> wax<00:06:24.980> this<00:06:25.250> when<00:06:25.490> I'm

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
know that so I will wax this when I'm

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.140 
know that so I will wax this when I'm
done<00:06:25.820> but<00:06:27.160> that's<00:06:28.160> just<00:06:28.340> a<00:06:28.490> little<00:06:28.610> update<00:06:31.150> I'm
