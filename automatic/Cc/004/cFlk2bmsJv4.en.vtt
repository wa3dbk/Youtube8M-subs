those children often deserve a blood

those children often deserve a blood
count<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.280> present<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.789> those

symptoms in the blood count may show

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.299 
symptoms in the blood count may show
lymphoma<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.579> leukemia<00:00:56.780> when<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> occurs

another<00:00:59.309> thing<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.699> will<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.390> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
another thing that will see is a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.180 
another thing that will see is a
reduction<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> number<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.530> platelets

these are the blood cells that help form

these are the blood cells that help form
blood<00:01:04.439> clots<00:01:04.500> they're<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> ones<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.700> keep

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
blood clots they're the ones that keep

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.090 
blood clots they're the ones that keep
you<00:01:06.119> from<00:01:06.150> bleeding<00:01:06.630> when<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> platelets<00:01:08.010> are

you from bleeding when the platelets are
low<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.430> course<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.060> problems<00:01:09.570> with

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
low of course you have problems with
