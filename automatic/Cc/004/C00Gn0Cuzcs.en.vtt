the<00:00:32.070> channeling<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:33.180> Dominion<00:00:33.570> points<00:00:34.460> as<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the channeling on Dominion points as you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.150 
the channeling on Dominion points as you
can<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.450> video<00:00:36.690> brand<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.590> ignited

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
can see in this video brand is ignited

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160 
can see in this video brand is ignited
but<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.700> still<00:00:38.969> able<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.390> capture<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.989> point

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
but it's still able to capture the point

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.380 
but it's still able to capture the point
so<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> want<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> stop<00:00:42.059> someone

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.630 
so when you want to stop someone
capturing<00:00:42.899> don't<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:43.770> ignite<00:00:43.950> because

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
capturing don't just use ignite because

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
capturing don't just use ignite because
you<00:00:44.850> will<00:00:45.120> fail<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.940> third<00:00:48.180> thing<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> may

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
you will fail the third thing you may

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.869 
you will fail the third thing you may
not<00:00:48.719> know<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:49.050> law<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.890> brans<00:00:50.219> passive

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
not know about law is that brans passive

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.869 
not know about law is that brans passive
burn<00:00:51.120> actually<00:00:51.829> triggers<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.070> electric

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
burn actually triggers the electric

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.000 
burn actually triggers the electric
charge<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> middle<00:00:54.690> buffing<00:00:54.930> Dominion<00:00:55.350> so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
charge on the middle buffing Dominion so

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.819 
charge on the middle buffing Dominion so
as<00:00:56.250> tannin<00:00:56.910> runs<00:00:57.120> away<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.690> my<00:00:58.050> dot<00:00:58.289> ticks<00:00:58.590> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
as tannin runs away as my dot ticks it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.330 
as tannin runs away as my dot ticks it
does<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.699> enough<00:00:59.969> damage<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.710> trigger<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
does just enough damage to trigger the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.920 
does just enough damage to trigger the
electric<00:01:03.000> charge<00:01:03.239> from<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> middle<00:01:03.719> buffing

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
electric charge from the middle buffing

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.850 
electric charge from the middle buffing
Dominion<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> kill<00:01:04.619> him

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
Dominion to kill him

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.960 
Dominion to kill him
so<00:01:05.159> even<00:01:05.790> dots<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.510> trigger<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.350> middle<00:01:07.710> buff

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
so even dots can trigger the middle buff

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.300 
so even dots can trigger the middle buff
lightning<00:01:08.970> shock<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> fourth<00:01:10.680> thing<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.979> may

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
lightning shock the fourth thing you may

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
lightning shock the fourth thing you may
not<00:01:11.400> know<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.700> Lowell<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.600> Gallio<00:01:12.990> not

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
not know about Lowell is that Gallio not

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
not know about Lowell is that Gallio not
only<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.520> go<00:01:14.640> into<00:01:14.790> negative<00:01:15.299> magic

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
only can go into negative magic

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.230 
only can go into negative magic
resistance<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.890> he<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.220> drop<00:01:17.400> into<00:01:17.640> negative

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
resistance but he can drop into negative

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.380 
resistance but he can drop into negative
ability<00:01:18.869> power<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.670> here<00:01:21.000> as

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
ability power as we can see here as

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.230 
ability power as we can see here as
Soraka<00:01:21.869> uses<00:01:22.350> star<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.920> reducing<00:01:23.759> gallio's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
Soraka uses star for reducing gallio's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.810 
Soraka uses star for reducing gallio's
magic<00:01:24.750> resistance<00:01:25.140> his<00:01:25.619> ability<00:01:26.220> power<00:01:26.430> also

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
magic resistance his ability power also

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.649 
magic resistance his ability power also
reduces<00:01:27.570> below<00:01:27.720> zero<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.700> also<00:01:29.970> makes

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
reduces below zero now this also makes

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.039 
reduces below zero now this also makes
his<00:01:30.869> moose<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.590> negative<00:01:31.920> damage<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.909> well<00:01:33.150> for

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
his moose do negative damage as well for

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.520 
his moose do negative damage as well for
example<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:34.740> he<00:01:34.829> had<00:01:35.150> -3<00:01:36.150> ability<00:01:36.600> power<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
example if he had -3 ability power this

example if he had -3 ability power this
minus<00:01:38.040> 3<00:01:38.369> would<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.610> applied<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.479> his<00:01:39.659> moves

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
minus 3 would be applied to his moves

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.219 
minus 3 would be applied to his moves
with<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> same<00:01:40.619> AP<00:01:41.189> ratio<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.750> would<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.079> if
