00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
phones like a laptop warranty

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.960 
phones like a laptop warranty
information<00:01:16.220> hold<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.610> many

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
information hold on to that many

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
information hold on to that many
different<00:01:18.300> languages<00:01:18.570> including<00:01:19.110> Chinese

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
different languages including Chinese

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.000 
different languages including Chinese
Japanese<00:01:19.770> all<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
Japanese all that so here it is as you

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.420 
Japanese all that so here it is as you
can<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.540> completely<00:01:25.500> flat<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
can see it is completely flat for the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.590 
can see it is completely flat for the
most<00:01:26.580> part<00:01:26.730> so<00:01:27.660> it<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.950> essentially<00:01:29.730> a<00:01:29.940> flat

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
most part so it is essentially a flat

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.230 
most part so it is essentially a flat
cover<00:01:30.960> but<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.590> does<00:01:31.890> act<00:01:32.190> as<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.580> keyboard<00:01:33.180> so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
cover but it does act as a keyboard so

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.680 
cover but it does act as a keyboard so
when<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> go<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> type<00:01:34.940> you<00:01:35.940> just<00:01:36.150> kind<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.420> tap

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
when you go to type you just kind of tap

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.600 
when you go to type you just kind of tap
it<00:01:36.930> um<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.890> takes<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.160> little<00:01:38.280> bit<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.460> getting

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it um it takes a little bit of getting

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.610 
it um it takes a little bit of getting
used<00:01:38.760> to<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> saw<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.450> our<00:01:39.690> RT<00:01:40.020> review<00:01:40.200> but

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
used to as you saw in our RT review but

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.380 
used to as you saw in our RT review but
this<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.000> really<00:01:42.150> good<00:01:42.270> idea

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this I think it's a really good idea

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.710 
this I think it's a really good idea
because<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:43.290> razor<00:01:43.650> thin<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:45.060> also<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
because it is razor thin and it also is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.260 
because it is razor thin and it also is
full<00:01:46.200> microfiber<00:01:46.800> so<00:01:47.190> it's<00:01:47.370> very<00:01:47.700> soft<00:01:48.030> if

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
full microfiber so it's very soft if

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.640 
full microfiber so it's very soft if
anything<00:01:48.660> when<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.900> close<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.590> just

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
anything when you close this it's just

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.890 
anything when you close this it's just
gonna<00:01:49.890> clean<00:01:50.280> your<00:01:50.490> screen<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.780> good

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
gonna clean your screen so really good

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.360 
gonna clean your screen so really good
idea<00:01:52.200> everything<00:01:52.950> gets<00:01:53.100> communicated

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
idea everything gets communicated

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.670 
idea everything gets communicated
through<00:01:53.910> these<00:01:54.090> six<00:01:54.690> pins<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.170> at<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.440> top

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680

snaps<00:01:56.370> on<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:57.000> easily<00:01:57.030> don't<00:01:57.660> even<00:01:57.870> really

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
snaps on really easily don't even really

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.270 
snaps on really easily don't even really
