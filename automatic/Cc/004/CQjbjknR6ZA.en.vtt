00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:03.439 
how well you do an exercise is the

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.830 
how well you do an exercise is the
foundation<00:00:03.979> to<00:00:04.160> your<00:00:04.189> success<00:00:04.840> technique

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:05.840 
foundation to your success technique

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.879 
foundation to your success technique
isn't<00:00:06.319> everything<00:00:06.800> it's<00:00:07.340> the<00:00:07.490> only<00:00:07.819> thing

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
isn't everything it's the only thing

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.289 
isn't everything it's the only thing
this<00:00:09.889> video<00:00:10.160> we're<00:00:10.309> talking<00:00:10.669> about<00:00:10.759> your

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
this video we're talking about your

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.539 
this video we're talking about your
chains<00:00:11.870> being<00:00:12.349> able<00:00:12.620> to<00:00:12.740> send<00:00:13.070> the<00:00:13.160> most

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
chains being able to send the most

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.840 
chains being able to send the most
strength<00:00:14.419> and<00:00:14.690> tension<00:00:15.469> going<00:00:16.190> through<00:00:16.670> your

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
strength and tension going through your

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.600 
strength and tension going through your
links<00:00:17.240> by<00:00:17.810> working<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.290> entire<00:00:18.680> chain<00:00:19.010> one<00:00:19.460> is

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
links by working the entire chain one is

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.150 
links by working the entire chain one is
it<00:00:19.760> keeps<00:00:20.030> the<00:00:20.210> stress<00:00:20.510> out<00:00:20.750> of<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.110> joints<00:00:21.620> so

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
it keeps the stress out of the joints so

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.600 
it keeps the stress out of the joints so
you<00:00:22.880> save<00:00:23.090> your<00:00:23.240> joints<00:00:23.660> tissue<00:00:24.350> to<00:00:25.010> much

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
you save your joints tissue to much

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.820 
you save your joints tissue to much
shorter<00:00:25.970> workouts<00:00:26.360> three<00:00:26.780> much<00:00:27.170> stronger

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
shorter workouts three much stronger

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.820 
shorter workouts three much stronger
muscles<00:00:28.430> much<00:00:29.030> bigger<00:00:29.450> muscles<00:00:29.930> functional

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
muscles much bigger muscles functional

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.409 
muscles much bigger muscles functional
strength<00:00:31.130> I<00:00:31.280> mean<00:00:31.460> it's<00:00:31.580> just<00:00:31.610> everything

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
strength I mean it's just everything

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:33.520 
strength I mean it's just everything
that<00:00:32.450> you<00:00:32.629> ever<00:00:32.809> wanted<00:00:33.109> from<00:00:33.199> strength

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
that you ever wanted from strength

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.660 
that you ever wanted from strength
training<00:00:33.710> comes<00:00:34.010> from<00:00:34.190> this<00:00:34.309> sort<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.609> thing

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
training comes from this sort of thing

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.849 
training comes from this sort of thing
and<00:00:34.940> everything<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:35.780> don't<00:00:35.989> want<00:00:36.260> is<00:00:36.440> prevent

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
and everything you don't want is prevent

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.220 
and everything you don't want is prevent
it<00:00:37.039> so<00:00:37.609> these<00:00:37.730> are<00:00:37.910> your<00:00:38.030> major<00:00:38.329> chains<00:00:38.839> number

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
it so these are your major chains number

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.779 
it so these are your major chains number
one<00:00:39.440> is<00:00:39.649> your<00:00:39.800> coal<00:00:40.159> chain<00:00:40.519> this<00:00:40.730> is

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
one is your coal chain this is

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.810 
one is your coal chain this is
upper-body<00:00:41.440> your<00:00:42.440> bull<00:00:42.710> chain<00:00:42.980> is<00:00:43.219> most

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
upper-body your bull chain is most

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.750 
upper-body your bull chain is most
efficiently<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:44.780> effectively<00:00:45.019> work<00:00:45.499> with

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
efficiently and effectively work with

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.000 
efficiently and effectively work with
pull-ups<00:00:46.760> you<00:00:47.350> just<00:00:48.350> look<00:00:48.499> at<00:00:48.589> the<00:00:48.710> range<00:00:48.890> of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
pull-ups you just look at the range of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.559 
pull-ups you just look at the range of
motion<00:00:49.069> okay<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:49.550> you're<00:00:50.059> pulled<00:00:50.329> chain

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:50.569 
motion okay so you're pulled chain

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:53.020 
motion okay so you're pulled chain
includes<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.379> muscles<00:00:51.710> in<00:00:51.800> your<00:00:51.920> hand<00:00:52.249> your

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
includes the muscles in your hand your

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.750 
includes the muscles in your hand your
forearms<00:00:53.600> biceps<00:00:54.159> to<00:00:55.159> a<00:00:55.190> certain<00:00:55.519> degree<00:00:55.729> a

a<00:01:06.350> certain<00:01:06.680> degree<00:01:06.770> may<00:01:07.009> be<00:01:07.040> glutes<00:01:07.460> and

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
a certain degree may be glutes and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.880 
a certain degree may be glutes and
hamstrings<00:01:08.000> just<00:01:08.119> a<00:01:08.360> little<00:01:08.630> little<00:01:08.810> bit<00:01:09.079> the

hamstrings just a little little bit the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.020 
hamstrings just a little little bit the
reason<00:01:10.100> why<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:10.250> pull-up<00:01:10.610> works<00:01:10.820> optimally

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
reason why the pull-up works optimally

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.620 
reason why the pull-up works optimally
for<00:01:11.540> this<00:01:11.659> is<00:01:11.840> because<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:13.240> uses<00:01:14.240> everything

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
for this is because it uses everything

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.330 
for this is because it uses everything
for<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.020> complete<00:01:15.380> full<00:01:15.590> range<00:01:15.829> of<00:01:15.950> motion

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
for a complete full range of motion

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.300 
for a complete full range of motion
people<00:01:17.329> like<00:01:17.450> rows<00:01:18.140> work<00:01:18.619> one<00:01:18.920> muscle<00:01:19.280> group

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
people like rows work one muscle group

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.240 
people like rows work one muscle group
pull-ups<00:01:19.939> work<00:01:20.119> another<00:01:20.390> they<00:01:20.840> should<00:01:21.079> be

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
pull-ups work another they should be

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.160 
pull-ups work another they should be
identical<00:01:22.250> if<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:23.180> if<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.570> get<00:01:23.780> on<00:01:23.930> like<00:01:24.140> a

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
identical if I if you get on like a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.990 
identical if I if you get on like a
horizontal<00:01:24.590> row<00:01:25.009> machine<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:25.579> you<00:01:25.640> do<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.789> pull

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
horizontal row machine and you do a pull

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.330 
horizontal row machine and you do a pull
down<00:01:26.119> shoot<00:01:26.390> they<00:01:26.659> should<00:01:26.840> feel<00:01:27.170> exactly<00:01:27.770> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
down shoot they should feel exactly the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.010 
down shoot they should feel exactly the
same<00:01:28.670> because<00:01:29.210> they're<00:01:29.390> using<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.780> same

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
same because they're using the same

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.990 
same because they're using the same
muscles<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.500> using<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.859> same<00:01:31.070> chain<00:01:31.460> if<00:01:31.640> it's

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
muscles and using the same chain if it's

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.420 
muscles and using the same chain if it's
different<00:01:32.409> something's<00:01:33.409> off<00:01:33.619> on<00:01:33.859> one<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.100> them

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
different something's off on one of them

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.370 
different something's off on one of them
and<00:01:35.060> they<00:01:35.180> should<00:01:35.420> not<00:01:35.539> feel<00:01:35.600> really<00:01:36.229> that

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
and they should not feel really that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.679 
and they should not feel really that
different<00:01:36.770> all<00:01:37.189> of<00:01:37.399> these<00:01:37.789> muscles<00:01:38.119> should<00:01:38.539> be

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
different all of these muscles should be

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.520 
different all of these muscles should be
working<00:01:38.930> in<00:01:39.380> unison<00:01:40.130> equally<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:41.869> is<00:01:42.020> again

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
working in unison equally this is again

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.950 
working in unison equally this is again
the<00:01:42.740> idea<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.420> different<00:01:44.420> grips<00:01:44.689> on<00:01:44.869> the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
the idea of different grips on the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.389 
the idea of different grips on the
pull-up<00:01:45.170> bar<00:01:45.289> work<00:01:45.560> different<00:01:45.920> muscles<00:01:46.189> if

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
pull-up bar work different muscles if

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.800 
pull-up bar work different muscles if
you've<00:01:46.490> got<00:01:46.670> different<00:01:46.700> muscles<00:01:47.329> working<00:01:47.689> on

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
you've got different muscles working on

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.270 
you've got different muscles working on
different<00:01:48.229> sorts<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.619> grips<00:01:48.859> something's

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
different sorts of grips something's

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.910 
different sorts of grips something's
wrong<00:01:49.549> because<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.780> means<00:01:51.259> that<00:01:51.439> some

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
wrong because that means that some

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
in various scrapes you should have all

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.590 
in various scrapes you should have all
those<00:01:57.229> muscles<00:01:57.679> 100%<00:01:58.549> on<00:01:58.700> as<00:01:58.939> much<00:01:59.179> as<00:01:59.329> you<00:01:59.420> can

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
those muscles 100% on as much as you can

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.029 
those muscles 100% on as much as you can
and<00:01:59.719> that's<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.990> that's<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.469> hard<00:02:00.619> thing<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:00.829> do

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
and that's a that's a hard thing to do

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.099 
and that's a that's a hard thing to do
I'm<00:02:01.549> not<00:02:01.609> saying<00:02:01.999> I<00:02:02.149> can<00:02:02.329> definitely<00:02:02.869> do<00:02:02.990> it

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
I'm not saying I can definitely do it

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.620 
I'm not saying I can definitely do it
every<00:02:03.350> time<00:02:03.530> but<00:02:04.039> that's<00:02:04.280> your<00:02:04.520> goal<00:02:04.729> with

with all of these exercises your goal

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.699 
with all of these exercises your goal
should<00:02:07.460> be<00:02:07.490> every<00:02:08.060> muscle<00:02:08.270> 100%<00:02:09.140> on<00:02:09.259> as<00:02:09.500> much

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
should be every muscle 100% on as much

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.460 
should be every muscle 100% on as much
as<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:09.950> can<00:02:10.129> and<00:02:10.340> don't<00:02:11.300> just<00:02:11.659> jump<00:02:12.050> up<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
think that the muscles are going to turn

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.270 
think that the muscles are going to turn
out<00:02:15.150> as<00:02:15.390> they<00:02:15.629> should<00:02:15.709> but<00:02:16.709> you'll<00:02:16.920> get<00:02:17.040> into

there's a couple of ways we can do this

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.869 
there's a couple of ways we can do this
one<00:02:39.650> push<00:02:40.650> chain<00:02:40.889> includes<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:43.019> pectorals

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
muscles in your hands so you don't have

all the way back all the way down for

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.909 
all the way back all the way down for
handstands<00:03:24.329> also<00:03:24.750> work<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.169> right<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.889> a

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
handstands also work this right to a

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.430 
handstands also work this right to a
large<00:03:26.220> degree<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:26.729> well<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.599> fact<00:03:27.750> if<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.049> had<00:03:28.079> to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
large degree as well in fact if I had to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.379 
large degree as well in fact if I had to
guess<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.769> would<00:03:28.979> even<00:03:29.069> say<00:03:29.430> handstands<00:03:30.120> with

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
guess I would even say handstands with

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.280 
guess I would even say handstands with
