00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
pig and it can be difficult it can be

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.420 
pig and it can be difficult it can be
easy<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.170> case<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.739> easy<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.160> i<00:00:47.250> know

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
easy in this case it's easy and i know

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
easy in this case it's easy and i know
whether<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.640> had<00:00:47.820> any<00:00:48.390> major<00:00:48.899> difficulties

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
whether we had any major difficulties

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.209 
whether we had any major difficulties
and<00:00:50.899> in<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> first<00:00:52.109> instance<00:00:52.379> i<00:00:52.710> let<00:00:52.890> them<00:00:52.920> see

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and in the first instance i let them see

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.500 
and in the first instance i let them see
each<00:00:53.370> other<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.969> know<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.180> through<00:00:54.449> the

each other you know like through the
cages<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.660> they're<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:58.230> not

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
cages and and then if they're really not

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.560 
cages and and then if they're really not
getting<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.910> like<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.210> normal

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
getting on like that this normal

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.000 
getting on like that this normal
behavior<00:01:00.660> they're<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.350> Rumble<00:01:01.680> strutting

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
behavior they're just Rumble strutting

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.220 
behavior they're just Rumble strutting
and<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.510> mountain<00:01:03.510> each<00:01:03.600> other<00:01:03.809> trying<00:01:04.050> to

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
and a mountain each other trying to

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.720 
and a mountain each other trying to
establish<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.129> pecking<00:01:05.489> order<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:07.430> yeah<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
establish a pecking order and yeah and

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.480 
establish a pecking order and yeah and
if<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.860> they're<00:01:11.009> not<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.250> like

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
if you know they're not really like

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.800 
if you know they're not really like
getting<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.090> stuff<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> might<00:01:12.540> want<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
getting on and stuff you might want to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.120 
getting on and stuff you might want to
put<00:01:12.960> them<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> pen<00:01:14.009> like<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
put them in like a pen like this and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.260 
put them in like a pen like this and
probably<00:01:17.130> divider<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> middle<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.150> they

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
probably divider on the middle so they

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.649 
probably divider on the middle so they
can<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.570> each<00:01:18.689> other<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.820> then<00:01:21.329> when<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
can see each other and and then when you

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
can see each other and and then when you
think<00:01:21.869> things<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.380> ok<00:01:22.740> then<00:01:22.979> pop<00:01:23.189> them

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
think things are going ok then pop them

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
think things are going ok then pop them
in<00:01:23.490> together<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.350> um<00:01:26.030> if<00:01:27.030> you're<00:01:27.509> happy<00:01:27.990> with

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170

animal<00:01:30.030> home<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.869> tired<00:01:31.049> they'll<00:01:31.860> probably

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
animal home I was tired they'll probably

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.450 
animal home I was tired they'll probably
stay<00:01:32.400> together<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.119> at<00:01:34.049> night<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.340> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
stay together and at night but if you

stay together and at night but if you
think<00:01:35.520> they're<00:01:35.939> am<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:37.560> getting<00:01:37.680> along<00:01:38.009> put

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
think they're am not getting along put

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.310 
think they're am not getting along put
the<00:01:38.490> divider<00:01:38.759> back<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.299> night<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.750> there's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the divider back in at night so there's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.190 
the divider back in at night so there's
no<00:01:40.470> injuries<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.790> yeah<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:43.020> basically

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
no injuries and yeah so that's basically

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
no injuries and yeah so that's basically
it<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.770> seems<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.310> quite<00:01:44.520> well<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
