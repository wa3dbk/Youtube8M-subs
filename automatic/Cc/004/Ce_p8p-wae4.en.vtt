00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
just connect your iPad to your HDTV and

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.740 
just connect your iPad to your HDTV and
it'll<00:04:13.800> mirror<00:04:14.390> exactly<00:04:15.390> what<00:04:15.570> you're<00:04:15.720> doing

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
it'll mirror exactly what you're doing

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.970 
it'll mirror exactly what you're doing
on<00:04:16.290> your<00:04:16.560> iPad<00:04:16.890> and<00:04:17.190> any<00:04:17.820> orientation<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.989> in

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
on your iPad and any orientation and in

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.510 
on your iPad and any orientation and in
full<00:04:20.820> 1080p<00:04:21.500> we've<00:04:22.500> done<00:04:22.770> things<00:04:23.070> with<00:04:23.370> his

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
full 1080p we've done things with his

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.550 
full 1080p we've done things with his
ipad<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:24.420> we<00:04:24.570> never<00:04:25.050> could<00:04:25.320> have<00:04:25.380> done

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
ipad that we never could have done

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.160 
ipad that we never could have done
before<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.400> it's<00:04:26.910> because<00:04:27.210> there's<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.930> lot<00:04:27.990> of

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
before and it's because there's a lot of

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.000 
before and it's because there's a lot of
new<00:04:28.530> innovation<00:04:29.190> driving<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:31.440> starts<00:04:31.830> with

games and apps that use a lot
and<00:04:53.160> for<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.270> first<00:04:54.450> time<00:04:54.750> we've<00:04:55.200> built<00:04:55.440> the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
and for the first time we've built the

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.190 
and for the first time we've built the
gyro<00:04:56.010> in<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.310> design<00:04:56.670> pad<00:04:56.970> that<00:04:57.810> gives<00:04:58.050> you

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
gyro in the design pad that gives you

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.410 
gyro in the design pad that gives you
very<00:04:58.530> precise<00:04:58.980> control<00:04:59.550> in<00:04:59.790> multiple

very precise control in multiple

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.720 
very precise control in multiple
dimensions<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:01.230> it<00:05:01.500> allows<00:05:01.770> us<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.430> really

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
dimensions and it allows us to really

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.090 
dimensions and it allows us to really
measure<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.510> orientation<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.440> iPad<00:05:04.920> in

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
measure the orientation of the iPad in

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.880 
measure the orientation of the iPad in
space<00:05:05.720> these<00:05:06.720> new<00:05:06.960> components<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.740> features

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
comes to apps and even though we boosted

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.080 
comes to apps and even though we boosted
the<00:05:13.260> performance<00:05:13.830> we<00:05:14.100> haven't<00:05:14.520> compromised

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
the performance we haven't compromised

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
on battery life the new ipad still gets

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.150 
on battery life the new ipad still gets
a<00:05:18.060> full<00:05:18.330> 10<00:05:18.570> hours<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.530> that's<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.890> major

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
a full 10 hours and that's a major

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.580 
a full 10 hours and that's a major
achievement<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:21.000> designed<00:05:21.480> this<00:05:21.690> thing<00:05:21.990> with

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
achievement and designed this thing with

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.290 
achievement and designed this thing with
all<00:05:22.740> that<00:05:22.920> we've<00:05:23.010> added<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.340> iPad<00:05:23.790> to<00:05:24.030> a

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
all that we've added to iPad to a

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.440 
all that we've added to iPad to a
thinner<00:05:24.960> lighter<00:05:25.410> design<00:05:25.910> amazing<00:05:26.910> dual-core

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
thinner lighter design amazing dual-core

a5 chip front and rear cameras and the
smart<00:05:30.900> cover<00:05:31.110> this<00:05:31.560> really<00:05:31.860> is<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.370> giant<00:05:32.670> leap

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
smart cover this really is a giant leap

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.460 
smart cover this really is a giant leap
forward

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.550 

the<00:05:36.470> original<00:05:36.980> iPad<00:05:37.480> defined<00:05:38.480> a<00:05:38.690> category<00:05:39.290> and

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
the original iPad defined a category and

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.130 
the original iPad defined a category and
i<00:05:40.370> think<00:05:40.640> that<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:40.910> ipad<00:05:41.030> 2<00:05:41.600> will<00:05:41.870> really

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
i think that the ipad 2 will really

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.570 
i think that the ipad 2 will really
define<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:42.740> category<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.580> years<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:44.090> come

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580
