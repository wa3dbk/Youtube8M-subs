00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
site which looks like this we go up here

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.450 
site which looks like this we go up here
to<00:00:13.590> where<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.099> says<00:00:14.219> students<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> submit<00:00:17.630> and

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
next we're going to indicate which

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.570 
next we're going to indicate which
institution<00:00:22.439> were<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.400> that's

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
institution were with so that's

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.830 
institution were with so that's
obviously<00:00:23.789> Alliant<00:00:26.300> most<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> will<00:00:27.689> need

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
obviously Alliant most of you will need

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.839 
obviously Alliant most of you will need
to<00:00:27.869> use<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.590> step<00:00:28.859> first<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.730> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
to use this step first so you have to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.009 
to use this step first so you have to
create<00:00:30.060> an<00:00:30.150> account<00:00:30.269> before<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.869> could

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
create an account before you could

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.920 
create an account before you could
submit<00:00:31.500> any<00:00:31.710> dissertation<00:00:32.690> I've<00:00:33.690> already

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
submit any dissertation I've already

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.299 
submit any dissertation I've already
done<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.380> I'm<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> log<00:00:35.100> in

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
done that so I'm just going to log in

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
done that so I'm just going to log in
but<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.059> process<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.480> very<00:00:36.750> easy<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.350> like

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
but the process is very easy just like

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.520 
but the process is very easy just like
signing<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.430> yahoo<00:00:39.149> email<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.379> once

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
signing up for yahoo email and once

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.020 
signing up for yahoo email and once
you've<00:00:40.680> done<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.460> activated<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
you've done that and activated the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:51.490 
you've done that and activated the
account<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.540> come<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.350> login<00:00:49.940> and

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
account to come back here and login and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.569 
account to come back here and login and
ordinarily<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.680> won't<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> process

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
ordinarily you won't see this process

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
ordinarily you won't see this process
here<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.020> next<00:00:55.199> screen<00:00:55.410> you'll<00:00:55.620> see
