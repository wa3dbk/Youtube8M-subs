language<00:07:37.350> versus<00:07:38.350> a<00:07:38.380> person<00:07:38.980> can<00:07:39.160> tell<00:07:39.340> you<00:07:39.520> if

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
language versus a person can tell you if

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.390 
language versus a person can tell you if
there's<00:07:40.630> been<00:07:41.169> any<00:07:41.230> improvement<00:07:41.950> we're

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 
there's been any improvement we're

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.760 
there's been any improvement we're
looking<00:07:42.700> at<00:07:42.850> eight<00:07:43.030> months<00:07:43.419> for<00:07:43.630> her<00:07:44.530> to<00:07:44.650> get

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:44.770 
looking at eight months for her to get

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.240 
looking at eight months for her to get
back<00:07:44.830> to<00:07:45.160> pretty<00:07:45.400> normal<00:07:45.640> to<00:07:46.980> possibly<00:07:47.980> have

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.250 
back to pretty normal to possibly have

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.870 
back to pretty normal to possibly have
the<00:07:48.430> shoes<00:07:48.640> and<00:07:48.910> all<00:07:49.300> the<00:07:49.510> support<00:07:50.490> the<00:07:51.490> pads

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:51.880 
the shoes and all the support the pads

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.270 
the shoes and all the support the pads
and<00:07:52.240> all<00:07:52.390> the<00:07:52.690> support<00:07:53.050> that's<00:07:53.440> and<00:07:53.860> her<00:07:54.040> feet

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280 
and all the support that's and her feet

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.520 
and all the support that's and her feet
to<00:07:54.400> keep<00:07:54.550> her<00:07:54.760> foot<00:07:55.180> padded<00:07:55.900> and<00:07:56.020> comfortable

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:56.530 
to keep her foot padded and comfortable

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.720 
to keep her foot padded and comfortable
and<00:07:57.840> hopefully<00:07:59.100> it'll<00:08:00.100> be<00:08:00.130> less<00:08:00.430> than<00:08:00.640> eight

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:00.730 
and hopefully it'll be less than eight

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:13.820 
and hopefully it'll be less than eight
months<00:08:00.880> so<00:08:01.390> we'll<00:08:01.780> see<00:08:01.990> all<00:08:02.890> right

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:13.830
