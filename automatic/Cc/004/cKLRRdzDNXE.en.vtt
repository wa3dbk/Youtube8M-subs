smartphone<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.039> the<00:01:51.099> market<00:01:51.429> one<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:51.879> them

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
smartphone in the market one of them

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.109 
smartphone in the market one of them
maybe<00:01:52.629> it<00:01:53.019> can<00:01:53.410> be<00:01:53.500> affordable<00:01:53.890> we<00:01:54.789> don't<00:01:54.910> have

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
maybe it can be affordable we don't have

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.119 
maybe it can be affordable we don't have
to<00:01:55.300> say<00:01:55.450> assumption<00:01:55.989> of<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.530> activation<00:01:57.039> of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:57.129 
to say assumption of the activation of

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:00.059 
to say assumption of the activation of
ok<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:58.869> i<00:01:58.899> will<00:01:59.170> guess<00:01:59.319> i<00:01:59.500> would<00:01:59.619> guess<00:01:59.830> maybe

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
ok so i will guess i would guess maybe

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:01.710 
ok so i will guess i would guess maybe
it<00:02:00.340> can<00:02:00.519> be<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.670> one<00:02:00.970> hundred<00:02:01.209> fifty<00:02:01.300> dollars

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
it can be a one hundred fifty dollars
