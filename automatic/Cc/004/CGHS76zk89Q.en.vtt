hinge system that locks into the channel

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.689 
hinge system that locks into the channel
so<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.750> holds<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:59.010> strong

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
so it just holds so strong

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
so it just holds so strong
it<00:00:59.940> won't<00:01:00.210> move<00:01:00.420> once<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.230> locked<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.649> and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.609 
1980 when I was able to meet joke Jeff
Porcaro<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.119> his<00:02:09.299> rack<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.840> fell<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.470> love

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
Porcaro and see his rack I fell in love

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.520 
Porcaro and see his rack I fell in love
with<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.870> things<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:13.019> changed<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.410> lot

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
with it and things have changed a lot

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.180 
with it and things have changed a lot
since<00:02:13.590> then

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
since then

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.660 
since then
extrusions<00:02:14.819> are<00:02:15.120> better<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.860> aluminum<00:02:17.549> is

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
extrusions are better the aluminum is

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.070 
extrusions are better the aluminum is
more<00:02:17.849> prevalent<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.660> less<00:02:18.870> expensive

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
more prevalent so it's less expensive

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.170 
more prevalent so it's less expensive
for<00:02:19.410> Drummond's<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.769> afford<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.879> can<00:02:21.000> come

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
for Drummond's to afford so we can come

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.300 
for Drummond's to afford so we can come
and<00:02:21.450> put<00:02:21.599> together<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.930> rack<00:02:22.170> system<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:23.010> is

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
and put together a rack system that is

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.300 
and put together a rack system that is
35<00:02:24.090> 40<00:02:24.420> 40<00:02:24.989> percent<00:02:25.290> lighter<00:02:25.470> than<00:02:25.739> most<00:02:25.950> rack

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
35 40 40 percent lighter than most rack

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.369 
35 40 40 percent lighter than most rack
systems<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.910> will<00:02:27.060> fold<00:02:27.269> up<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.660> get<00:02:28.260> out

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
systems that will fold up and get out

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.800 
systems that will fold up and get out
your<00:02:28.410> own<00:02:28.650> way<00:02:28.940> again<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> cable<00:02:30.629> channel

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
your own way again with a cable channel

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.800 
your own way again with a cable channel
here<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.349> put<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.069> 14<00:02:32.610> 16<00:02:33.390> cables

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
here you can put up to 14 16 cables

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.210 
here you can put up to 14 16 cables
depending<00:02:34.170> on<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.349> thickness<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.890> bury<00:02:35.129> it

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
depending on the thickness and bury it

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.220 
depending on the thickness and bury it
get<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.519> out<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> way<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.629> also<00:02:36.989> have

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
get it out of the way and you also have

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.650 
get it out of the way and you also have
the<00:02:37.349> hinge<00:02:37.530> which<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> cast<00:02:38.519> aluminum<00:02:38.760> no

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
the hinge which is a cast aluminum no

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.140 
the hinge which is a cast aluminum no
cast<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.170> Inc<00:02:40.349> at<00:02:40.470> all<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:41.549> is<00:02:41.670> very<00:02:41.849> very

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
cast is Inc at all so this is very very

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.660 
cast is Inc at all so this is very very
strong<00:02:42.450> very<00:02:42.810> durable<00:02:43.310> lifetime<00:02:44.310> guarantee
