00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
motors pretty good dudes

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.910 
motors pretty good dudes
there<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> know<00:02:12.870> my<00:02:13.170> bed's<00:02:13.410> getting<00:02:13.710> wet

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
there and I know my bed's getting wet

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.220 
there and I know my bed's getting wet
but<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.430> motors<00:02:15.060> right<00:02:15.180> there<00:02:15.360> clip<00:02:15.750> off<00:02:15.960> if

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
but the motors right there clip off if

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.260 
but the motors right there clip off if
you<00:02:16.320> want<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> different<00:02:17.070> one<00:02:17.340> you

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
you want to get a different one you

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.350 
you want to get a different one you
could<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.750> could<00:02:18.810> find<00:02:19.050> one<00:02:19.760> but<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.970> yeah

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
could if you could find one but the yeah

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.940 
could if you could find one but the yeah
it's<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.840> sucked<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> through<00:02:22.470> here<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.830> it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
it's it sucked it through here and it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.040 
it's it sucked it through here and it
puts<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.310> through<00:02:23.340> these<00:02:23.820> three<00:02:24.270> stages<00:02:24.660> and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
puts it through these three stages and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.910 
puts it through these three stages and
it<00:02:25.140> pops<00:02:25.350> right<00:02:25.500> out<00:02:26.750> yeah<00:02:27.750> that's<00:02:28.050> basically

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it pops right out yeah that's basically

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.130 
it pops right out yeah that's basically
it's<00:02:29.490> all<00:02:29.700> plastic<00:02:29.940> when<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.510> take<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.900> motor

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
it's all plastic when you take the motor

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.590 
it's all plastic when you take the motor
out<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:32.370> cartridge<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.090> blue<00:02:33.300> stuff

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
out and the cartridge and a blue stuff

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.850 
out and the cartridge and a blue stuff
it's<00:02:33.780> basically<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.470> plastic<00:02:34.710> shell<00:02:35.250> so

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
it's basically just a plastic shell so

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.810 
it's basically just a plastic shell so
yep<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:40.380> says<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:40.860> quiet<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.430> pretty<00:02:41.610> quiet

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
yep it says it's quiet it's pretty quiet

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.130 
yep it says it's quiet it's pretty quiet
from<00:02:42.300> what<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.840> tested<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:44.600> easy<00:02:45.600> operation

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
from what I tested it easy operation

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.740 
from what I tested it easy operation
pretty<00:02:46.620> easy<00:02:46.770> I've<00:02:47.640> read<00:02:47.910> this<00:02:48.090> probably<00:02:48.630> a

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
pretty easy I've read this probably a

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410 
pretty easy I've read this probably a
nine<00:02:49.340> reason<00:02:50.340> there<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.520> another<00:02:50.850> points

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
nine reason there is another points

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.240 
nine reason there is another points
because<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:51.870> kind<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.140> big<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.920> might<00:02:53.100> be

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
because it's kind of big and it might be

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.650 
because it's kind of big and it might be
a<00:02:53.280> little<00:02:53.400> bit<00:02:53.550> ugly<00:02:53.910> if<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.300> smaller

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
a little bit ugly if you have a smaller

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:04.700 
a little bit ugly if you have a smaller
aquarium<00:02:56.810> also<00:02:57.810> because<00:03:00.170> it's<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:02.960> look<00:03:03.960> also

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
aquarium also because it's a look also

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.640 
aquarium also because it's a look also
because<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.160> doesn't<00:03:05.520> have<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:07.290> doesn't

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
because it doesn't have the it doesn't

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.240 
because it doesn't have the it doesn't
have<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.980> knob<00:03:08.220> where<00:03:08.460> you<00:03:08.610> can<00:03:08.790> adjust<00:03:09.980> how

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.800 

force<00:03:14.250> how<00:03:14.610> much<00:03:14.760> force<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.120> puts<00:03:15.450> into<00:03:15.630> it

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
force how much force that puts into it

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.210 
force how much force that puts into it
when<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.990> spews<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.350> water<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.770> wish<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.040> had

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
when it spews the water and I wish I had

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.040 
when it spews the water and I wish I had
that<00:03:17.400> because<00:03:18.330> if<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> bigger<00:03:18.810> one

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
that because if you have a bigger one

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.050 
that because if you have a bigger one
you<00:03:19.170> obviously<00:03:19.620> want<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.950> be<00:03:20.070> bigger<00:03:20.310> so

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
you obviously want it to be bigger so

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.540 
you obviously want it to be bigger so
the<00:03:21.180> clean<00:03:21.360> water<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:22.020> everywhere<00:03:22.520> but<00:03:23.520> I

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
the clean water and get everywhere but I

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.100 
the clean water and get everywhere but I
have<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.820> smaller<00:03:24.090> aquarium<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.900> doesn't

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
have a smaller aquarium so it doesn't

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.360 
have a smaller aquarium so it doesn't
matter<00:03:27.440> yeah<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.470> was<00:03:28.680> about<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.950> say<00:03:29.010> something

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
matter yeah I was about to say something

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.160 
matter yeah I was about to say something
else<00:03:30.950> yeah<00:03:31.950> if<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.880> have<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.650> specific

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
water the dang I can't talk today water

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.280 
water the dang I can't talk today water
filter<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.730> says<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.660> will<00:03:42.870> not<00:03:43.020> need

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
filter it says that you will not need

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.740 
filter it says that you will not need
any<00:03:43.530> oxygen<00:03:44.040> tanks<00:03:44.640> or<00:03:44.850> not<00:03:44.970> oxygen<00:03:45.450> tanks

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
any oxygen tanks or not oxygen tanks

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.020 
any oxygen tanks or not oxygen tanks
oxygen<00:03:46.410> pumps<00:03:46.830> if<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.280> have<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.640> because<00:03:47.910> it

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
oxygen pumps if you have this because it

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.660 
oxygen pumps if you have this because it
puts<00:03:48.209> oxygen<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.930> water<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:50.040> does<00:03:50.400> put

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
puts oxygen to the water it does put

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.930 
puts oxygen to the water it does put
oxygen<00:03:50.850> into<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.510> water<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:51.930> makes<00:03:52.050> bubbles

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
oxygen into the water it makes bubbles

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.100 
oxygen into the water it makes bubbles
little<00:03:53.940> ones<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.480> they're<00:03:54.780> not<00:03:54.900> too

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
little ones so they're not too

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.680 
little ones so they're not too
noticeable<00:03:55.730> but<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.760> still<00:03:57.120> would<00:03:57.390> advise<00:03:57.660> you
