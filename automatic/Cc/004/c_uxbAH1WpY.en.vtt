down the phone and then here sim

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.849 
down the phone and then here sim
applications<00:00:18.600> should<00:00:18.840> show<00:00:19.080> up<00:00:19.260> now<00:00:19.710> it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
applications should show up now it

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.320 
applications should show up now it
doesn't<00:00:20.010> always<00:00:20.160> show<00:00:20.460> up<00:00:20.550> immediately<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:21.119> we

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
doesn't always show up immediately as we

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.960 
doesn't always show up immediately as we
can<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:22.250> it's<00:00:23.250> not<00:00:23.430> there

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
can see it's not there

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.359 
can see it's not there
but<00:00:24.510> if<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.869> give<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.140> about<00:00:25.230> 15<00:00:25.830> seconds<00:00:26.310> or

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
but if you give it about 15 seconds or

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.650 
but if you give it about 15 seconds or
so<00:00:27.470> we<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.650> go<00:00:28.890> back<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.789> you'll<00:00:30.269> see<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
so we can go back in and you'll see the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.690 
so we can go back in and you'll see the
same<00:00:30.900> applications<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.890> now<00:00:32.309> sometimes

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
same applications is there now sometimes

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.069 
same applications is there now sometimes
it's<00:00:32.880> not<00:00:33.000> always<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.329> easy<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.719> will<00:00:33.899> need

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
it's not always that easy you will need

it's not always that easy you will need
to<00:00:34.170> reboot<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> phone<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:36.329> then<00:00:37.110> go

to reboot the phone and and then go

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.869 
to reboot the phone and and then go
ahead<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.469> look<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.520> still<00:00:38.579> not

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
ahead and look and if it's still not

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
ahead and look and if it's still not
there<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.329> go<00:00:39.480> out<00:00:39.750> wait<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> few<00:00:40.770> seconds<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
there you go out wait a few seconds and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.380 
there you go out wait a few seconds and
go<00:00:41.520> back<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.710> if<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.920> can't<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.640> show

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
go back in if you can't get it to show

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.729 
go back in if you can't get it to show
up<00:00:45.420> after<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.930> few<00:00:46.200> tries

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
up after a few tries

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
up after a few tries
you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.430> try<00:00:47.610> airplane<00:00:48.000> mode<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:48.360> well

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you can try airplane mode as well

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.450 
you can try airplane mode as well
sometimes<00:00:49.110> that'll<00:00:49.440> kind<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.860> help<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.219> kick

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
sometimes that'll kind of help it kick

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.310 
sometimes that'll kind of help it kick
into<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.850> searching<00:00:51.629> mode<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.050> help<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
into a searching mode and help it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
into a searching mode and help it
recognized<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.949> there's<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> sim<00:00:53.430> inside<00:00:53.760> of

you want to look at the SIM card and

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.980 
you want to look at the SIM card and
make<00:01:07.530> sure<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.490> contact<00:01:09.150> points<00:01:09.479> on<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> SIM

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
make sure the contact points on the SIM

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.390 
make sure the contact points on the SIM
card<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> our<00:01:10.500> sim<00:01:10.740> line<00:01:10.979> up<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.250> each

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
card in the our sim line up with each

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.910 
card in the our sim line up with each
other<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.200> six

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
other as you can see there's six

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.950 
other as you can see there's six
embossed<00:01:14.280> areas<00:01:14.670> right<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.570> our<00:01:15.689> sim

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
embossed areas right here on the our sim

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.090 
embossed areas right here on the our sim
itself<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.500> there<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.280> six<00:01:17.820> areas<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.860> SIM

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
itself and there is six areas on the SIM

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.039 
itself and there is six areas on the SIM
card<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.119> those<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.420> line<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:21.930> it's

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
card so if those don't line up then it's

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.179 
card so if those don't line up then it's
not<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> make<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> connection<00:01:22.860> your

not going to make a connection your
phone<00:01:23.400> won't<00:01:23.580> actually<00:01:24.090> register<00:01:24.900> there's<00:01:25.259> a

can all be resolved with a proper SIM

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.550 
can all be resolved with a proper SIM
card<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.840> make<00:01:37.020> sure<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
card and make sure that you get the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.679 
card and make sure that you get the
right<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.210> SIM<00:01:39.479> card

still at least register on the phone and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
still at least register on the phone and
some<00:01:55.530> applications<00:01:56.100> will<00:01:56.280> show<00:01:56.460> up<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.119> what

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
some applications will show up so what

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
some applications will show up so what
you<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.869> take<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> look<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.439> your

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you want to do is take a look at your

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.090 
you want to do is take a look at your
arson<00:02:00.170> take<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> look<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.619> if<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.860> bent

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
arson take a look and see if it's bent

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.609 
arson take a look and see if it's bent
if<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.969> bent<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.689> cause<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> break

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
if it's bent it can cause it to break

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.670 
if it's bent it can cause it to break
connections<00:02:05.250> also<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.869> cause<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
connections also it can cause it so it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
connections also it can cause it so it
doesn't<00:02:08.250> sit<00:02:08.399> flat<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.090> SIM<00:02:09.300> card<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.750> it

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
doesn't sit flat on the SIM card and it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.210 
doesn't sit flat on the SIM card and it
doesn't<00:02:10.229> make<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> connection<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.979> so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
doesn't make the connection with that so

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.949 
doesn't make the connection with that so
take<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> look<00:02:12.060> at<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> make<00:02:12.480> sure<00:02:12.629> it's<00:02:12.780> flat

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
take a look at it make sure it's flat

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.490 
take a look at it make sure it's flat
make<00:02:13.230> sure

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
make sure

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.900 
make sure
doesn't<00:02:13.800> look<00:02:13.890> damaged<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:16.020> next<00:02:16.320> thing<00:02:16.560> that

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
doesn't look damaged the next thing that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.090 
doesn't look damaged the next thing that
you<00:02:17.910> want<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.660> everything<00:02:19.620> checks<00:02:19.890> out

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
you want to do if everything checks out

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.120 
you want to do if everything checks out
you've<00:02:21.050> everything<00:02:22.050> lines<00:02:22.410> up<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.890> checks

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
you've everything lines up and checks

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.890 
you've everything lines up and checks
out<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.610> pop<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:23.910> back<00:02:24.180> into<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:24.660> phone

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
out and you pop it back into your phone

say<00:03:09.930> no<00:03:10.530> sim<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.040> then<00:03:11.130> switch<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.550> no<00:03:11.670> service

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
say no sim and then switch to no service

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.760 
say no sim and then switch to no service
ones<00:03:12.270> about<00:03:12.570> 15<00:03:12.930> seconds<00:03:13.260> after<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.560> put<00:03:13.739> a

ones about 15 seconds after you put a

ones about 15 seconds after you put a
sim<00:03:13.980> card<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:15.150> CDMA<00:03:15.630> obviously<00:03:16.200> it

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
sim card in if it's CDMA obviously it

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.530 
sim card in if it's CDMA obviously it
always<00:03:16.560> stays<00:03:17.010> at<00:03:17.250> no<00:03:17.519> service<00:03:17.910> like<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
always stays at no service like that and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.420 
always stays at no service like that and
this<00:03:18.630> always<00:03:18.930> stays<00:03:19.019> highlighted<00:03:19.680> but<00:03:20.190> if<00:03:20.310> you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
this always stays highlighted but if you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.670 
this always stays highlighted but if you
look<00:03:20.610> inside<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.030> here<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:21.900> not<00:03:22.140> registering

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
look inside of here it's not registering

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.500 
look inside of here it's not registering
that<00:03:23.100> there's<00:03:23.280> anything<00:03:23.549> in<00:03:23.760> there<00:03:24.000> all<00:03:24.330> it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that there's anything in there all it

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.300 
that there's anything in there all it
says<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.870> my<00:03:25.019> number<00:03:25.350> TTY<00:03:25.799> it<00:03:25.860> doesn't<00:03:26.250> even

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
says is my number TTY it doesn't even

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.250 
says is my number TTY it doesn't even
show<00:03:26.459> up<00:03:26.640> with<00:03:26.970> simp<00:03:27.299> an<00:03:27.570> or<00:03:27.720> anything<00:03:27.959> like

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
show up with simp an or anything like

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.960 
show up with simp an or anything like
that<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:29.040> phone<00:03:29.280> doesn't<00:03:29.549> even<00:03:29.670> recognize

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
that the phone doesn't even recognize

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.330 
that the phone doesn't even recognize
that<00:03:30.450> anything's<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.080> phone<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.920> reason

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
that anything's in the phone the reason

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.890 
that anything's in the phone the reason
being<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.450> because<00:03:34.380> when<00:03:34.560> an<00:03:34.680> our<00:03:34.799> sim<00:03:35.070> fails

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
being is because when an our sim fails

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.449 
being is because when an our sim fails
it<00:03:36.900> actually<00:03:37.380> fails<00:03:37.620> it's<00:03:38.040> not<00:03:38.250> like

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
it actually fails it's not like

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.420 
it actually fails it's not like
sometimes<00:03:39.450> it'll<00:03:39.930> kind<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.590> work<00:03:40.860> or<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.280> only

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
sometimes it'll kind of work or it only

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.330 
sometimes it'll kind of work or it only
works<00:03:41.700> every<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.150> often<00:03:42.360> if<00:03:43.130> anything<00:03:44.130> in<00:03:44.250> this

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
works every so often if anything in this

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.509 
works every so often if anything in this
microchip<00:03:45.140> ends<00:03:46.140> up<00:03:46.260> if<00:03:46.709> any<00:03:46.920> connections<00:03:47.400> are

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
microchip ends up if any connections are

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.130 
microchip ends up if any connections are
broken<00:03:47.610> within<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.180> microchip<00:03:48.750> for<00:03:48.989> whatever

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
broken within the microchip for whatever

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.280 
broken within the microchip for whatever
reason<00:03:49.820> then<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.390> won't<00:03:51.600> even<00:03:51.810> register

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
reason then it just won't even register

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.539 
reason then it just won't even register
that<00:03:52.320> there's<00:03:52.620> anything<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.220> phone<00:03:53.400> at

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
that there's anything in the phone at

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.670 
that there's anything in the phone at
all<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.600> if<00:03:54.810> you're<00:03:54.840> popping<00:03:55.200> your<00:03:55.440> SIM<00:03:55.650> card

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
all so if you're popping your SIM card

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.860 
all so if you're popping your SIM card
in<00:03:56.010> now<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.370> turning<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.820> on<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.150> off<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.540> no

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
in now and turning it on and off and no

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.130 
in now and turning it on and off and no
matter<00:03:58.049> what<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.530> do<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.940> doesn't<00:04:00.570> register

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
matter what you do it doesn't register

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.259 
matter what you do it doesn't register
that<00:04:01.590> anything's<00:04:02.010> in<00:04:02.190> there<00:04:02.400> one<00:04:03.000> thing<00:04:03.209> that

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
that anything's in there one thing that

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.990 
that anything's in there one thing that
you<00:04:03.420> might<00:04:03.720> try<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.549> actually<00:04:05.549> taking<00:04:05.910> out

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
you might try is actually taking out

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000 
you might try is actually taking out
your<00:04:06.299> SIM<00:04:06.510> card<00:04:06.540> popping<00:04:07.170> out<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.470> our<00:04:07.650> sim

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
your SIM card popping out the our sim

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.350 
your SIM card popping out the our sim
itself<00:04:09.170> putting<00:04:10.170> your<00:04:10.440> SIM<00:04:10.709> card<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.400> then

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
itself putting your SIM card in and then

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.420 
itself putting your SIM card in and then
seeing<00:04:12.630> if<00:04:12.810> your<00:04:12.989> SIM<00:04:13.230> card<00:04:13.260> registers<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
seeing if your SIM card registers in the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.280 
seeing if your SIM card registers in the
phone<00:04:14.640> again<00:04:15.299> it's<00:04:15.630> at<00:04:15.750> least<00:04:15.870> going<00:04:16.200> to

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
phone again it's at least going to

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.080 
phone again it's at least going to
register<00:04:16.769> like<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.250> see<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.549> pops<00:04:17.760> up<00:04:17.940> and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
register like this see it pops up and

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.219 
register like this see it pops up and
says<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.269> there's<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.600> new<00:04:18.750> voicemail

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
says that there's a new voicemail

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.810 
says that there's a new voicemail
obviously<00:04:19.739> there's<00:04:19.890> not<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.070> new<00:04:20.340> voicemail

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
obviously there's not a new voicemail

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.279 
obviously there's not a new voicemail
but<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.329> just<00:04:21.720> went<00:04:21.900> through<00:04:22.020> all<00:04:22.109> these

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
but it just went through all these

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.500 
but it just went through all these
changes<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:23.220> we<00:04:23.640> know<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:23.849> it's<00:04:24.150> making<00:04:24.300> a

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
changes so we know that it's making a

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.390 
changes so we know that it's making a
connection<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.470> phone<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.830> sim<00:04:26.039> cards

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
connection in the phone the sim cards

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.950 
connection in the phone the sim cards
good

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
good

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.420 
good
but<00:04:27.960> if<00:04:28.080> we<00:04:28.230> put<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.500> in<00:04:28.560> with<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.830> our<00:04:28.950> sim<00:04:29.190> it

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
but if we put it in with the our sim it

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.490 
but if we put it in with the our sim it
doesn't<00:04:29.760> even<00:04:29.850> recognize<00:04:30.060> at<00:04:30.570> all<00:04:30.690> so<00:04:31.200> there

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
doesn't even recognize at all so there

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.280 
doesn't even recognize at all so there
we<00:04:31.650> just<00:04:32.180> troubleshoot<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.450> we<00:04:33.840> know<00:04:34.020> that

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
we just troubleshoot it and we know that

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.340 
we just troubleshoot it and we know that
in<00:04:34.770> this<00:04:35.010> case<00:04:35.280> with<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:35.940> SIM<00:04:36.240> card<00:04:36.540> our

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
in this case with this SIM card our

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.800 
in this case with this SIM card our
tuner<00:04:37.740> this<00:04:37.800> arsim<00:04:38.520> that<00:04:39.090> is<00:04:39.210> defective<00:04:39.540> and

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
tuner this arsim that is defective and

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.150 
tuner this arsim that is defective and
it<00:04:39.900> doesn't<00:04:40.140> work<00:04:40.260> so<00:04:40.470> if<00:04:40.590> you're<00:04:40.740> having<00:04:40.950> the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
it doesn't work so if you're having the

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.190 
it doesn't work so if you're having the
same<00:04:41.370> issues<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.480> just<00:04:42.660> can't<00:04:42.870> get<00:04:42.990> it<00:04:43.110> to

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
same issues and you just can't get it to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.380 
same issues and you just can't get it to
register<00:04:43.350> at<00:04:43.740> all<00:04:43.860> then<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.940> need<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.210> get<00:04:45.360> a

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
register at all then you need to get a

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.420 
register at all then you need to get a
new<00:04:45.540> our<00:04:45.690> sim<00:04:45.960> and<00:04:46.470> one<00:04:46.650> advice<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.190> always

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
new our sim and one advice that I always

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.280
