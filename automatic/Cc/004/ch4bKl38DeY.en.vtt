 here is the package and and the cover in this way 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 respectively, the action instruction instruction 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.990
 out of the box there is oil 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.779

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.570
 millimeter guns 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:35.640
 battery charger 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:43.370
 nickel metal hydride lay can 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 deliver it here control equipment 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:52.399

 adjust so that it is vegas exactly 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.009
 there is no clear function ahead 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.840
 Hammond accordingly perfectly 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.759
 other equipment is more reliable and more 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.100
 qualitatively tank itself 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.409
 hand painting is completely manual 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.890
 hand painting every tank 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.890
 separately 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.890
 everything looks very blued realistic 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 metal tracks 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.720
 this switch tank switch it 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.690
 turning off the sound of a smoke machine is 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.959
 speaker volume control 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.900
 2 channel sound is used at all 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.620
 taiga on vskikh tanks used 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.600
 only metal gearbox with 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.880
 brass inserts larger 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.030
 size than pakhomov 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.850
 what allows you to use this liters 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.770
 longer time opens 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.450
 respectively the compartment cover 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.180
 battery in this very way 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.580
 easy 2000mAh battery 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.160

 store another similar battery 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.510
 increased capacity to be even longer 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.510
 charger included 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.010
 here it is time there is a machine gun there 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.670
 shot indicator 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:12.420
 six millimeter guns included 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:17.560
 still goes figure tankers painted 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.740
 let's turn on the tank means one more 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.010
 the moment here is used more 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.740
 advanced smoke machine which more 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.060
 reliable in comparison with commander well 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:34.140
 respectively radio control system 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.140
 also with active cooling with cooler 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.240
 all connectors are easy to lift 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.430
 connect you can upgrade tank 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.270
 replacing the data all the parts on 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.680
 metal with rubber bandages 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.680
 asterisks to put metal rims 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:59.410
 the region will now show how 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.690
 bind this equipment to the machine 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.510
 first we have to translate two give 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.250
 top switch position enable 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.330
 light bulbs blink 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:17.000
 and then we turn on the tank light bulb 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:19.970
 extinguished stopped blinking letting pigs 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.100
 down and respectively start the tank 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.490
 these cups check replaced by 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.490
 hardware 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.690
 parade or began blinking to the authorities tank 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.200
 warmed up 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.200
 ready to move 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.930
 focus on 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.480
 and on the left 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.630
 turn on carried 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.400
 now try this there is and 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.419
 fell asleep 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.180
 means to release this system 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.800
 radio control has a proportional 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.330
 management that is if you are a little bit 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.860
 click on the motion period she 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.270
 move very slowly accordingly 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.420
 or what you saw now hope you 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:15.140
 like this tank connect to 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:18.140
 Our channel wish you successful trips 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.140
 is happy
