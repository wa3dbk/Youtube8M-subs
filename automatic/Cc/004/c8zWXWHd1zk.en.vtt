00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
foot that big bump is called a bunion

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.810 
foot that big bump is called a bunion
now<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.890> causes<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.640> but

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
now you see what what causes that but

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.920 
now you see what what causes that but
that<00:00:56.910> button<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.300> caused<00:00:57.629> by<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:59.340> foot<00:00:59.760> if<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that button is caused by the foot if you

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.660 
that button is caused by the foot if you
pretend<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> foot<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.280> foot

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
pretend this is a foot that foot

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.929 
pretend this is a foot that foot
collapsing<00:01:03.920> inside<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:08.340> toes<00:01:08.610> being

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
collapsing inside and the toes being

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.030 
collapsing inside and the toes being
pushed<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> other<00:01:09.420> direction<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
pushed the other direction and how and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.620 
pushed the other direction and how and
over<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> long<00:01:11.640> period<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> time<00:01:13.040> that<00:01:14.040> bend

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
over a long period of time that bend

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.390 
over a long period of time that bend
starts<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> grow<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.259> way<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.070> joint

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
starts to grow that way that that joint

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.249 
starts to grow that way that that joint
starts<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.970> grow<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.420> way<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.140> end

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
starts to grow that way so then we end

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.960 
starts to grow that way so then we end
up<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.470> what's<00:01:19.710> called<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.040> bunion<00:01:20.250> plantar

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
up with what's called a bunion plantar

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.539 
up with what's called a bunion plantar
fasciitis<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.869> that<00:01:22.320> bottom<00:01:23.070> part<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
fasciitis is that bottom part of the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.450 
fasciitis is that bottom part of the
foot<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:24.540> call<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> plantar<00:01:25.470> side

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
foot the what they call the plantar side

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.600 
foot the what they call the plantar side
of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> foot<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.680> part<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> foot

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
of the foot and in that part of the foot

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.890 
of the foot and in that part of the foot
there<00:01:29.790> should<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.150> an<00:01:30.390> arch<00:01:30.780> okay<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:32.310> arch

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
there should be an arch okay that arch

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.590 
there should be an arch okay that arch
should<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.250> describe<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.479> of

you have ligaments you have anything
holding<00:01:58.110> things<00:01:58.170> place<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> point<00:01:58.979> is

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
holding things place but the point is

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.670 
holding things place but the point is
all<00:01:59.460> those<00:01:59.790> bones<00:02:00.149> line<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.689> together<00:02:00.899> alright

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
all those bones line up together alright

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.679 
all those bones line up together alright
now<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.100> stand<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.850> them<00:02:03.030> sometimes<00:02:03.299> they

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
now we stand on them sometimes they

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.219 
now we stand on them sometimes they
flatten<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:04.829> okay<00:02:05.670> when<00:02:06.360> they<00:02:06.479> flatten<00:02:07.079> out

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
flatten out okay when they flatten out

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.979 
flatten out okay when they flatten out
what<00:02:07.770> happens<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:09.060> plantar<00:02:09.629> fascia

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
what happens is the the plantar fascia

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.460 
what happens is the the plantar fascia
the<00:02:10.770> ligaments<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.840> tendons

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the ligaments that all the tendons

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.900 
the ligaments that all the tendons
everything<00:02:13.770> on<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> bottom<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.520> part<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.820> the

us some solutions well as usual I have
some<00:02:37.110> solutions<00:02:37.590> now<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> truth<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.490> the

some solutions now the truth of the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.070 
some solutions now the truth of the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
body makes a bony change unless we take

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.020 
body makes a bony change unless we take
a<00:02:47.940> chisel<00:02:49.010> there's<00:02:50.010> no<00:02:50.280> way<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.459> change<00:02:50.760> that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
prevents that from happening or instead

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.110 
prevents that from happening or instead
pull<00:03:04.770> from<00:03:05.370> happening

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
pull from happening

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.000
