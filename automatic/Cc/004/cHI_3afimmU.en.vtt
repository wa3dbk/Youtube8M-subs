00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
rods which would be available the fall

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.780 
rods which would be available the fall
2013<00:00:21.050> and<00:00:21.439> today<00:00:22.160> we're<00:00:22.340> just<00:00:22.400> going<00:00:22.580> to<00:00:22.610> walk

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
2013 and today we're just going to walk

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.040 
2013 and today we're just going to walk
through<00:00:22.970> some<00:00:23.150> of<00:00:23.330> the<00:00:23.419> features<00:00:23.540> which<00:00:23.840> make

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
through some of the features which make

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.960 
through some of the features which make
up<00:00:24.200> this<00:00:24.320> rod<00:00:24.590> starting<00:00:25.400> out<00:00:25.490> with<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:25.700> blank

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
up this rod starting out with the blank

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.409 
up this rod starting out with the blank
this<00:00:26.869> rod<00:00:27.080> uses<00:00:27.439> a<00:00:27.529> graphite<00:00:27.950> composite<00:00:28.579> blank

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
this rod uses a graphite composite blank

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.880 
this rod uses a graphite composite blank
when<00:00:29.750> you<00:00:29.840> hear<00:00:29.990> graph<00:00:30.170> I<00:00:30.289> could<00:00:30.439> posit<00:00:30.769> all

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
when you hear graph I could posit all

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.189 
when you hear graph I could posit all
that<00:00:31.070> means<00:00:31.310> is<00:00:31.580> that<00:00:31.609> the<00:00:31.910> rod<00:00:32.090> is<00:00:32.119> built<00:00:32.570> from

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
that means is that the rod is built from

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.920 
that means is that the rod is built from
both<00:00:33.550> graphite<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:34.820> fiberglass<00:00:35.390> materials

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
both graphite and fiberglass materials

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.630 
both graphite and fiberglass materials
so<00:00:36.379> you<00:00:36.470> have<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.680> sensitivity<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:37.489> light

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
so you have the sensitivity and light

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.970 
so you have the sensitivity and light
weight<00:00:37.989> that<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.050> graph<00:00:39.320> I<00:00:39.470> try<00:00:39.650> to<00:00:39.710> give<00:00:39.949> you

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
weight that a graph I try to give you

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.470 
weight that a graph I try to give you
but<00:00:40.250> then<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:40.460> have<00:00:40.699> the<00:00:41.239> glassware

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
but then you have the glassware

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.100 
but then you have the glassware
reinforcement<00:00:42.350> for<00:00:42.470> pooling<00:00:42.710> power<00:00:44.110> moving

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
reinforcement for pooling power moving

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.950 
reinforcement for pooling power moving
into<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.440> guides<00:00:45.699> we<00:00:46.699> use<00:00:46.879> fuji<00:00:47.330> stainless

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
into the guides we use fuji stainless

aluminum<00:00:50.750> oxide<00:00:51.080> is<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.290> smooth<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.070> hard

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
aluminum oxide is a smooth and hard

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.430 
aluminum oxide is a smooth and hard
material<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.420> it's<00:00:53.600> very<00:00:53.780> safe<00:00:54.080> for<00:00:54.140> both

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
material so it's very safe for both

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.100 
material so it's very safe for both

about the fore grip we use our trainer
angle<00:01:03.350> torque<00:01:03.589> for<00:01:03.860> grips<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.369> what<00:01:04.790> that

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
angle torque for grips and what that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.250 
angle torque for grips and what that
does<00:01:05.180> is<00:01:05.390> when<00:01:05.479> you're<00:01:05.630> fighting<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.049> fish

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260
