nectarines on them these two varieties

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.080 
nectarines on them these two varieties
here<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:40.350> really<00:00:42.050> fast-growing<00:00:43.610> we<00:00:44.610> need<00:00:44.879> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
here are really fast-growing we need to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.229 
here are really fast-growing we need to
keep<00:00:45.270> these<00:00:45.570> trees<00:00:46.050> pruned<00:00:46.739> small<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.789> small

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
keep these trees pruned small as small

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.470 
keep these trees pruned small as small
as<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.050> keep<00:00:49.289> them<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.520> backyard

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
as we can to keep them in this backyard

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.430 
as we can to keep them in this backyard
orchard<00:00:51.989> culture<00:00:52.760> arena<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.660> so

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
orchard culture arena that I have so

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
orchard culture arena that I have so
with<00:00:56.100> these<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.430> trees<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.789> that

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
with these two trees you can see that

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.630 
with these two trees you can see that
now<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.750> being<00:01:01.109> January<00:01:01.649> all<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.160> leaves<00:01:02.370> are

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
now it being January all the leaves are

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.420 
now it being January all the leaves are
off<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.739> actually<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
off and you can actually see the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.719 
off and you can actually see the
structuring<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> tree<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.610> what<00:01:08.610> I'm

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
structuring of the tree and what I'm

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.660 
structuring of the tree and what I'm
doing<00:01:09.150> here<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> these

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
doing here is you can see all of these

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.170 
doing here is you can see all of these
little<00:01:12.860> branches<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.130> here<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.670> these<00:01:14.850> little

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
little branches on here all these little

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.539 
little branches on here all these little
twigs<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.290> lots<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.950> leaf<00:01:17.250> all

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
twigs that just have lots of leaf all

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.060 
twigs that just have lots of leaf all
over<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.350> whole<00:01:19.530> purpose<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.979> that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
over it and the whole purpose of that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
over it and the whole purpose of that
the<00:01:20.400> tree<00:01:20.670> obviously<00:01:20.909> everybody<00:01:21.390> knows<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the tree obviously everybody knows is to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.350 
the tree obviously everybody knows is to
have<00:01:22.140> lots<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.650> leaves<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.580> they<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.970> feed

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
have lots of leaves so they can feed

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.260 
have lots of leaves so they can feed
those<00:01:24.659> roots<00:01:25.049> down<00:01:25.439> deep<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.070> with<00:01:27.060> backyard

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
those roots down deep and with backyard

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910 
those roots down deep and with backyard
orchard<00:01:27.750> culture<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.229> order<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.470> keep<00:01:28.740> your

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
orchard culture in order to keep your

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.210 
orchard culture in order to keep your
trees<00:01:29.250> from<00:01:30.030> getting<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.869> big<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.409> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
trees from getting really big is not to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.760 
trees from getting really big is not to
let<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> root<00:01:32.759> system<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:34.049> big<00:01:34.229> also

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
let the root system get really big also

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.830 
let the root system get really big also
and<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.909> by<00:01:36.060> keeping<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> trees

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and you do that by keeping the trees

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
and you do that by keeping the trees
small<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.340> see<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.060> particular<00:01:39.360> one

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
small so you can see this particular one

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.030 
small so you can see this particular one
here<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:41.490> already<00:01:41.759> pruned<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:43.710> one<00:01:44.009> I

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
here I have already pruned this one I

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.520 
here I have already pruned this one I
have<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> left<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.750> left<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
have not so I left I left this one so I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.429 
have not so I left I left this one so I
could<00:01:46.740> show<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.520> looks<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
could show you what it looks like and

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.780 
could show you what it looks like and
then<00:01:49.439> how<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
then how I do it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.929 
then how I do it
so<00:01:51.619> with<00:01:52.619> peaches<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.220> nectarines<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
so with peaches and nectarines in that

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.830 
so with peaches and nectarines in that
last<00:01:54.149> video<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.600> had<00:01:55.070> shows<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
last video I had shows that that the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.730 
last video I had shows that that the
peaches<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.890> could<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.460> peaches<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.740> every

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
peaches I could have peaches on every

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.130 
peaches I could have peaches on every
one<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> these<00:02:02.310> branches<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.509> next<00:02:03.930> year

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
one of these branches this next year

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.620 
one of these branches this next year
every<00:02:04.649> single<00:02:04.829> one<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> peaches

every single one so like if the peaches

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.869 
every single one so like if the peaches
came<00:02:07.079> out<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.680> while<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.310> peaches<00:02:08.520> will

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
came out on this while the peaches will

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.180 
came out on this while the peaches will
come<00:02:09.090> out<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:10.259> branch<00:02:11.270> at<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190

out<00:05:34.379> and<00:05:34.889> I'm<00:05:35.610> not<00:05:35.819> real<00:05:36.000> thrilled<00:05:36.180> about<00:05:36.479> that

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:36.839 
out and I'm not real thrilled about that

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:39.890 
out and I'm not real thrilled about that
coming<00:05:37.199> out<00:05:37.259> this<00:05:37.620> early<00:05:37.860> but<00:05:38.750> because<00:05:39.750> we

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
coming out this early but because we

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.930 
coming out this early but because we
could<00:05:40.110> get<00:05:40.289> another<00:05:40.500> cold<00:05:40.889> and<00:05:41.219> then<00:05:41.849> they

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
could get another cold and then they

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.879 
could get another cold and then they
could<00:05:42.150> die<00:05:42.330> off<00:05:42.569> so<00:05:43.139> I<00:05:43.169> hope<00:05:43.469> that's<00:05:43.680> not<00:05:43.770> the

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
could die off so I hope that's not the

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.119 
could die off so I hope that's not the
case<00:05:44.190> but<00:05:45.029> now<00:05:45.330> you<00:05:45.389> get<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.719> good<00:05:46.020> picture<00:05:46.469> as

00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:47.129 
case but now you get a good picture as

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.890

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
to how I take my trees from this down to

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.480 
to how I take my trees from this down to
that<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.729> I<00:05:53.729> can<00:05:54.029> manage<00:05:54.479> my<00:05:55.349> peaches<00:05:56.009> and
