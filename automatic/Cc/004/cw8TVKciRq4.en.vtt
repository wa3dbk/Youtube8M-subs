00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.750

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.600

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.899
 such an opportunity as I have not yet 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.719
 bought maybe buy mustang in general 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.140
 go do pudding we need salt 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.219
 egg sugar some cereal semolina cottage cheese 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.930
 lemon vanillin and syrup or berry jam 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.210
 first thing in a deep plate we 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.809
 put one tablespoon of sugar without 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.510
 slides 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.340
 and also break the egg there after which 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.530
 All this is thoroughly mixed to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.689
 sugar melted there add a pinch 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.119
 salt and a pinch of vanilla 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.820
 well and then cut the lemon and squeeze 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.159
 a couple drops in this mixture are about 3-4 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.409
 drops and naturally all this again 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.600
 we mix the resulting mixture we 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.119
 add about 100 grams of cottage cheese with 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.180
 using a mixer or whisk our mixture 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.950
 need to bring to a homogeneous state 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.049
 something like this we throw one there 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.180
 a tablespoon of semolina and all that 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.000
 knead our mixture again we spill 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.100
 In my case it is small 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 plates will bring it to the kitchen 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.720
 put our pudding in the microwave for 3 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.939
 minutes after which we give pudding two 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.460
 Minute to rest while not open 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.130
 microwave but then put another 2 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.740
 our puddings are almost ready to bear 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.530
 put them to the table on a platter and 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.630
 top it with jam or syrup here 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.000
 so here we pudding and it turns out 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.320
 now we will try it 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.209
 so here we are 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.060
 it turns out cottage cheese pudding 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.930
 I like the fact that he is curd because 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.810
 that it is already useful it is already cool 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.690
 he looks like a cake 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.910
 some kind but if you take special 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.030
 molds for example for cupcakes 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.670
 it will turn out very cool but I don’t 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.290
 I will talk a lot and just try and 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.569
 I will say that it is first definitely 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.890
 tasty secondly it is not very sweet and 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.720
 very much like cottage cheese casserole and 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.800
 so it is much more useful 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.050
 I would also like to say that 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.269
 cooking such cottage cheese pudding 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.390
 it won't take you more than ten minutes 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.700
 really very fast and very tasty i 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.060
 already did something like this i 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.600
 did what to do cupcake mugs cake in 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.130
 mug 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.650
 but now they made pudding 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:09.540
 cool very quickly what cool is what 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.600
 it's like we always did at home and 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.880
 we made it from products that are like 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.500
 would we see what it consists of that is not 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.470
 purchased some where there are all sorts 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.430
 concentrates well, this one is all chemistry 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.040
 exactly at home did ate happy with principle 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.950
 the body is not hurt the other way around 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.769
