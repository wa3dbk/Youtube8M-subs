 the most meat restaurant of the planets is 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.100
 steve of 3 represents 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.060
 tasty and easy and interesting program 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.610
 male kitchen on the first municipal 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.610
 we prepare someone else and for the soul 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.970
 Hello dear lovers of tasty 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.670
 to eat 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.480
 Today for you already beloved 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.879
 the transfer of the men's kitchen and and permanent 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.309
 Previous Alexander Orphan is not an accident 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.760
 on me this cap is not a coincidence today for 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.519
 we have prepared you meat which 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.479
 called lamb cook today 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.820
 shurpa 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.769
 for fur coats and characteristic several 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.619
 features first feature of course 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.420
 is this meat used lamb like me 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:59.799
 already said we are laying it in a cafe 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.000
 little ray is very important to use a bow in 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:06.729
 the same amount as meat 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.820
 this tradition which is connected in the first 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.340
 turn in order to remove the smell so 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.909
 remove the noise to remove all these 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:20.289
 components that make muddy muddy 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:23.619
 and ugly we don't cut my onion for sure 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:26.950
 also laying the whole is very important 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.990
 pour cold water 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.859
 fundamentally because as soon as 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.229
 flood 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.789
 warm clear broth you have shurpy 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.090
 will not work 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.689
 pour cold water and put on 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.689
 heavy fire 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:51.740
 probably another feature is 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:54.920
 the fact that a lot of vegetables are put in there 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.490
 And spices this necessarily pepper 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.280
 be sure to tomato spices which 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.240
 we use this parsley this 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.959
 paprika is I have already talked about it 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.120
 allspice and all sorts of spices and 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.110
 seasonings which are very common and 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.920
 in the east we add carrots in there 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.480
 the first place 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.610
 Elliot large cut like all vegetables she 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.500
 must add a certain beauty 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:34.489
 the dish should add a light taste 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.269
 sweetness so pepper just as large 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.690
 in chunks 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.000
 like for a real male kitchen we 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.760
 make billet tomatoes can 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.200
 throw the whole part can be cut 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.599
 you can throw a whole piece of tomato 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.549
 tomatoes can be cut so that they are immediately 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.950
 let their juice so they immediately bed 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.769
 its liquid and after that we 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.370
 will directly throw out those 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.040
 tomatoes 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.410
 skins that do not pass our potatoes 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:07.400
 we cut cubes in exactly the same way because 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.349
 we have large pieces of lamb and amid 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.590
 this lamb. 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.590
 we 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.069
 we will cut finely simply 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.260
 lost surely we add our 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:23.450
 pepper light cut it in half and 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.690
 when you gulp you will 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.290
 burn not only hot broth but also 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.629
 the very taste of Ukrainian pepper pepper 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.080
 we throw the manufacturer 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.080
 vegetables 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:54.430
 and now she is almost ready to shurpa 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.280
 we will prepare now for others 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.459
 a little green there 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:05.530
 the green we traditionally goes Ukrainian 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.370
 this dill throw just add 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.370
 there 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.590
 Parsley is necessary not to forget 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.260
 that the pike perch dish we had east 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.769
 of course oriental spices of course 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.669
 this oregano of course this is kenzo which 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:25.020
 we go without it in my opinion 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:29.590
 no oriental dish impossible 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.919
 throwing greens is best when 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.130
 removed the pot in the first minute only 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.860
 removed removed the cover threw in there the greens and 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.360
 in this moment 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.820
 cover with a lid to about herbs 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.900
 Steamed we take off the kitten because 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:52.320
 shourpa we ready to trap nicely boils 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.750

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:01.680

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.680
 boiling pot throw there business 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.340
 We cover with a lid and give it later 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:13.150
 literally one two minutes 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:17.970
 the most exciting moment we discover 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:21.630
 magic cover to hear 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:25.319

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:31.080
 scooping the bottom 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:36.330
 add a dummy and add on top 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.330
