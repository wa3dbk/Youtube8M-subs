00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.140 
a few different strategies that I like
but<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.829> fan<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.070> having<00:01:29.430> branch<00:01:29.820> chains

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
but I'm a fan of having branch chains

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.789 
but I'm a fan of having branch chains
and<00:01:30.390> carbohydrates<00:01:30.930> pre-workout<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:31.740> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and carbohydrates pre-workout because I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
and carbohydrates pre-workout because I
think<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.100> enough<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.939> stimulate<00:01:33.210> muscle

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
think that's enough to stimulate muscle

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.569 
think that's enough to stimulate muscle
protein<00:01:34.049> synthesis<00:01:34.500> which<00:01:34.650> leucine<00:01:35.310> will<00:01:35.460> do

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
protein synthesis which leucine will do

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.219 
protein synthesis which leucine will do
in<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.759> branch<00:01:35.939> chain<00:01:36.210> amino<00:01:36.240> acids<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.900> a

in the branch chain amino acids in a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.200 
in the branch chain amino acids in a

tiny tiny amount of carbohydrates based

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
tiny tiny amount of carbohydrates based
on<00:01:39.420> your<00:01:39.479> metabolism<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:40.829> into<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
workout point number two now is the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
newest thing is Perry work out which

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.340 
newest thing is Perry work out which
means<00:01:50.390> depending<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.720> talk<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.049> commune

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
means depending on you talk to commune

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.749 
means depending on you talk to commune
during<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> workout<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.189> at<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.640> beginning

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
during the workout or at the beginning

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.120 
during the workout or at the beginning
of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.090> workout<00:01:54.360> pre-workout<00:01:54.869> leading<00:01:55.560> into

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
of the workout pre-workout leading into

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
of the workout pre-workout leading into
the<00:01:56.219> workout<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.630> bigger

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the workout I think this is a bigger

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.429 
the workout I think this is a bigger
thing<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.680> BS<00:01:59.009> than<00:01:59.250> ever<00:01:59.600> first<00:02:00.600> off<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:00.960> let's

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
thing of BS than ever first off so let's

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.959 
thing of BS than ever first off so let's
just<00:02:01.590> go<00:02:01.979> back<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> general<00:02:02.670> theories

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
just go back to the general theories

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.789 
just go back to the general theories
let's<00:02:03.149> say<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.869> whole<00:02:04.439> protein

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
let's say that you have a whole protein

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.170 
let's say that you have a whole protein
source<00:02:05.040> or<00:02:05.189> even<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.430> shake<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.820> carbs
