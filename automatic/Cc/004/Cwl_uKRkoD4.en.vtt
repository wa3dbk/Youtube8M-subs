00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
two projects so the first one is an ek a

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.780 
two projects so the first one is an ek a
Swedish<00:00:11.429> slip-joint<00:00:12.710> I<00:00:13.710> had<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> lot<00:00:14.759> of

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
Swedish slip-joint I had a lot of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.640 
Swedish slip-joint I had a lot of
milling<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.299> there<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.719> didn't<00:00:16.260> quite<00:00:16.590> know

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
milling in there I didn't quite know

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.950 
milling in there I didn't quite know
what<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.160> getting<00:00:17.430> into<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:17.940> that's<00:00:18.600> okay

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
what I was getting into but that's okay

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.269 
what I was getting into but that's okay
I<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.650> made<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.800> look<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.130> lot<00:00:20.279> better<00:00:22.279> so

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
I think we made it look a lot better so

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.340 
I think we made it look a lot better so
it's<00:00:23.430> about<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> twenty<00:00:24.029> five<00:00:24.300> dollar<00:00:24.350> folder

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
it's about a twenty five dollar folder

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.439 
it's about a twenty five dollar folder
here<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.800> see<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> bags<00:00:26.310> all<00:00:26.609> open<00:00:27.180> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
here you can see the bags all open and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.230 
here you can see the bags all open and
stuff<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.470> there's<00:00:28.859> two<00:00:29.130> brass<00:00:29.550> liners<00:00:30.210> that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
stuff and there's two brass liners that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.380 
stuff and there's two brass liners that
run<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.019> channel<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:32.850> where<00:00:33.149> you

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
run in this channel and that's where you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.340 
run in this channel and that's where you
get<00:00:33.570> most<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.960> your<00:00:34.219> rigidity<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.350> slip

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
get most of your rigidity for the slip

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.299 
get most of your rigidity for the slip
joint<00:00:37.579> so<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.739> simple<00:00:42.079> simple<00:00:43.309> handle

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
joint so this was a simple simple handle

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.889 
joint so this was a simple simple handle
swap<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.820> got<00:00:45.120> rid<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.510> chunky<00:00:46.170> plastic

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
swap so got rid of these chunky plastic

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.670 
swap so got rid of these chunky plastic
handles<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:50.000> put<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.629> nice<00:00:51.870> bead

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
handles and put on some nice bead

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.479 
handles and put on some nice bead
blasted<00:00:53.250> black<00:00:53.670> g10<00:00:54.890> also<00:00:55.890> made<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> whole

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
blasted black g10 also made it a whole

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.720 
blasted black g10 also made it a whole
lot<00:00:56.520> thinner<00:00:57.739> soap<00:00:58.739> there's<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.039> focus<00:00:59.280> I

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
lot thinner soap there's a focus I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:12.850 
lot thinner soap there's a focus I
tighten<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> fit<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.780> finish<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.079> lot

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.930 

so<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:13.520> can<00:01:13.640> see<00:01:13.820> I<00:01:13.850> tightened<00:01:14.360> up<00:01:14.480> the<00:01:15.140> back

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
so you can see I tightened up the back

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.340 
so you can see I tightened up the back
see<00:01:16.940> that<00:01:17.090> was<00:01:17.240> just<00:01:17.270> wide<00:01:17.660> open<00:01:17.690> all<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.230> way

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
see that was just wide open all the way

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.220 
see that was just wide open all the way
down<00:01:18.530> there<00:01:19.240> you<00:01:20.240> see<00:01:20.390> how<00:01:20.480> even<00:01:20.840> everything

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
down there you see how even everything

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:34.000 
down there you see how even everything
is<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:29.060> same<00:01:29.300> thing<00:01:29.510> on<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.750> front<00:01:29.900> here<00:01:33.010> I'm

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
is the same thing on the front here I'm

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:41.330 
is the same thing on the front here I'm
trying<00:01:34.190> to<00:01:34.340> show<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.670> gaps<00:01:35.000> here

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.780 

made<00:01:41.940> it<00:01:42.090> really<00:01:42.620> nice<00:01:43.620> and<00:01:43.650> pocketable<00:01:44.460> now

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
made it really nice and pocketable now

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.440 
made it really nice and pocketable now
but<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> still<00:01:46.020> feels<00:01:46.230> nice<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.740> hand

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.630 
take this knife apart to the owner in
Canada<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.510> was<00:01:57.720> I<00:01:58.020> used<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.619> knife<00:01:58.830> and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
Canada and this was I used the knife and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.510 
Canada and this was I used the knife and
I<00:01:59.820> also<00:02:00.060> knocked<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.930> there<00:02:01.350> was<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:02.160> blade

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
I also knocked down there was this blade

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.390 
I also knocked down there was this blade
Tang<00:02:02.820> come<00:02:03.119> away<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.630> right<00:02:03.900> here<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.400> don't

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
Tang come away up right here I don't

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.520 
Tang come away up right here I don't
know<00:02:05.670> why<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.510> knocked<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.990> down<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.200> made

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
know why but I knocked it down and made

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.919 
know why but I knocked it down and made
it<00:02:07.650> flush<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> made<00:02:09.240> more<00:02:09.390> sense<00:02:09.660> when

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it flush so I made more sense when

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.390 
it flush so I made more sense when
you're<00:02:10.020> holding<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:12.650> also<00:02:13.650> gave<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.220> nice

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
you're holding it also gave it a nice

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.260 
you're holding it also gave it a nice
sharpening<00:02:14.970> job<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:19.260> there<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:20.060> kind<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.120> an

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
sharpening job so there it is kind of an

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.020 
sharpening job so there it is kind of an
odd<00:02:21.450> looking<00:02:21.870> knife<00:02:22.340> but<00:02:23.340> I'm<00:02:23.430> sure<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:23.850> a

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
odd looking knife but I'm sure it's a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.930 
odd looking knife but I'm sure it's a
great<00:02:24.540> user<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.380> hopefully<00:02:26.340> now<00:02:26.520> it's<00:02:26.760> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
great user and hopefully now it's a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.280 
great user and hopefully now it's a
little<00:02:27.270> more<00:02:27.420> easy<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.650> carry<00:02:28.890> as<00:02:29.070> well<00:02:29.100> I<00:02:30.290> know

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
little more easy to carry as well I know

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.060 
little more easy to carry as well I know
it<00:02:31.470> definitely<00:02:31.920> looks<00:02:32.100> better

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.470 

g10<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.220> always<00:02:38.520> better<00:02:38.730> than<00:02:38.880> plastic

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
g10 is always better than plastic

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:52.450 
g10 is always better than plastic
I<00:02:39.570> think<00:02:42.350> nice<00:02:43.350> snap

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.760 

I<00:02:52.690> don't<00:02:53.690> think<00:02:53.750> I'll<00:02:54.020> be<00:02:54.050> doing<00:02:54.170> another<00:02:54.560> one

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
I don't think I'll be doing another one

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.520 
I don't think I'll be doing another one
though<00:02:58.360> there's<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.450> whole<00:02:59.570> lot<00:02:59.750> going<00:03:00.020> on<00:03:00.140> when

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
though there's a whole lot going on when

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.170 
though there's a whole lot going on when
you<00:03:00.650> get<00:03:00.770> slip<00:03:01.070> joints<00:03:01.460> you<00:03:01.550> kind<00:03:01.820> of<00:03:01.880> think

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
you get slip joints you kind of think

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.990 
you get slip joints you kind of think
that<00:03:02.480> they're<00:03:02.780> gonna<00:03:02.870> be<00:03:03.110> easy<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.860> do<00:03:04.190> because

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
that they're gonna be easy to do because

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.850

don't<00:06:11.320> finish<00:06:11.560> the<00:06:11.889> underside<00:06:12.460> of<00:06:12.490> it<00:06:12.760> because

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
don't finish the underside of it because

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.710 
don't finish the underside of it because
that's<00:06:14.190> the<00:06:15.190> friction<00:06:15.729> that's<00:06:16.330> on<00:06:16.570> your

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
that's the friction that's on your

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.600 
that's the friction that's on your
pocket<00:06:17.110> when<00:06:17.200> it<00:06:17.320> goes<00:06:17.470> in<00:06:17.620> and<00:06:17.740> out<00:06:17.830> so<00:06:18.310> this

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
pocket when it goes in and out so this

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.640 
pocket when it goes in and out so this
is<00:06:18.880> just<00:06:19.150> a<00:06:19.330> slightly<00:06:20.020> rougher<00:06:20.530> finish<00:06:22.650> and

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
is just a slightly rougher finish and

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.050 
is just a slightly rougher finish and
you<00:06:23.800> know<00:06:23.889> I<00:06:23.919> just<00:06:24.130> want<00:06:24.310> to<00:06:24.370> keep<00:06:24.520> this<00:06:24.700> nice
