00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:06.569
 push more if now we try to summarize a bit messi are you saying 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.120
 is that to have feelings my task is necessary a good nervous system to 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.710
 time that you have to start from an organism with a nervous system that is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.980
 able to pitu puig that has the ability to project in images the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.960
 emotions if china 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.019
 in 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.939
 i finally 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.839
 but not less important 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.399
 you have to be aware in some way of yourself po please please be penn and I 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.280
 sentenced that if it is a very interesting theory interpreted although it is a 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.940
 little like the egg and the chicken 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.340
 cathode incentives what has to do with consciousness has a lot 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 importance 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.960
 the lawn I suspect 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
 that our feelings of emotion 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.090
 these especially the simplest feelings, the result of emotions of the 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.730
 environment for example do not almost pose the principle of consciousness 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.500
 are 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.220
 10 inoue in some urgent way you can not have a feeling properly 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.030
 said without conscience that has but I do not believe that you can have conscience without 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.120
 a feeling because there is a point where everything starts 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.010
 between 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.080
 and then sartre things get into a more complicated spiral of science in 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.649
 the one that increases awareness and feeling more and more 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:23.860
 start a little 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.380
 but somehow it is necessary to start efe pinter if we felt 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 our body to start you have 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 you get ishiÃ­ if we did not notice their changes there could be no conscience 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.260
 consciousness is intimately linked with this initial feeling of oneself 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.520
 0 I started and to have a sense of self it is necessary to feel your own 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.510
 organism and what changes in it 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.820
 of Africa you need to lean on that morning is now I understand why at 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.470
 plants 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.250
 they have no feeling to day and that's 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.579
 Spain nevertheless and despite what people say the winners of this plan
