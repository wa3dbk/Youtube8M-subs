00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.199
 so economic tuners make sense we expect it to work 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.729
 these experts 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:19.019
 the party the yard be quite short because actually this year at 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.909
 Middle East to say that I seek this minimum otherwise we will go on two 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.679
 hours of explanations of all phenomena affect all doors 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.130
 agreed with nick 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.089
 which interests nobody 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.779
 the best thing to do if you want if this can be an excellent 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.500
 problem at first this is the meaning that it has provided to 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.340
 israel in this match 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.620
 so there is a seller and that people right now 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.270
 we are happy to see that the selestat red lantern 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.150
 she is very different 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.140
 and that will not grant us 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.100
 thanks to the documents to justify let's start with the outlines 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.230
 when we are going to scratch the strings 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.360
 Note 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.949
 that agree their 14 pm here 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.030
 his name is lowered his eyes I often try to format American people 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.030
 so peace the sisyphe important that 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.780
 according to you young people here 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.119
 that told me you're sich earlier too drunk in the right to the left program 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.310
 my foot fish note 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.250
 between 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.910
 while the sellers with his own posters announced to whom it is necessary 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.410
 for the penalty if you have a small look 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.920
 but hey that's it 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.360
 the crown has posted a record to replay and if we are on the note 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.820
 but on a program get it wrong 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.070
 for this new skid there is something quite important so violent that 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.720
 the passport from there 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.660
 brahimi 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.200
 the individual 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.090
 - the program 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.230
 visibly 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.700
 short for taking the wheel this 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.720
 gollnisch article 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.110
 but what happens around the cash 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 at belux bourg-en-bresse nantaise 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.090
 that's basically 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.090
 if the agreement of the fda has granted its place in the courtroom 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.440
 and korea there was a meeting that peace quickly return to their soil there is 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 found in the south ad rings but his passion 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.299
 so be careful how old you must be when you wait for them 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.059
 body 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:16.079
 but for the present time that sees the day other countries operate on the 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:16.670
 same axis 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.670
 his bio bets like that but I never supported 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.549
 the problem especially an economic agreement is that when you miss 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.159
 the record from there 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.499
 gregory house dance 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:31.729
 a target, however, the port of France is not necessarily if it is 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.019
 more serious than that it is not known in what direction to give to achieve 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.459
 the pause during 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.869
 in cordoba 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.069
 so what I advise you months 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.180
 while launching this talk make you want to babble to break 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.260
 this drop is the technique the loire the party 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
 so use the lake kivu garbage fee 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.289
 for brive 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.429
 not far from here 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.659
 and after that I work only to refine the case 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.659
 every note that simon 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.809
 yanis delay 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.789
 the problems of depression their elected 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:11.369
 so here's to know that there is for sale the material on a reward is 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:15.129
 went for a big match against the vivacity a shop 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.359
 here we increase 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.339
 and it's going to vibration Sunday and so on 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:23.919
 and as it's called in the same way as the different scheme that's what 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.749
 propose france austria 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.389
 several workshops 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.959
 and so she apparently indifferent note that I preferred you have a 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.719
 small sign of a small concern will be proposed that we make evolve the 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.719
 agreements will make it possible 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.389
 we can play everywhere explain to you now unfortunately silence 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.119
 woven chisel in which camus on the port asked the question I do not answer 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.309
 crisis 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.799
 so why follow her to see what's called alternative tunings
