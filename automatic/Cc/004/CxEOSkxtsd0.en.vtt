00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.210 
let's get started we're gonna start off
with<00:01:44.299> one<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.720> trucks<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.040> gonna

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
with one of the trucks so this is gonna

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:58.200 
with one of the trucks so this is gonna
be<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:48.750> video<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.829> GMC<00:01:50.250> trim<00:01:51.000> truck

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.540 

now<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:58.960> said<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.500> wasn't<00:01:59.800> gonna<00:02:00.010> do<00:02:00.220> this<00:02:00.340> one

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.960 
now I said I wasn't gonna do this one
first<00:02:00.820> but<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.180> guess<00:02:01.420> I<00:02:02.490> guess<00:02:03.490> since<00:02:03.790> this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
first but I guess I guess since this

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.180 
first but I guess I guess since this
truck<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.540> one<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.590> more<00:02:07.590> wanted<00:02:08.590> trucks<00:02:08.979> I

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
truck is one of the more wanted trucks I

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.490 
truck is one of the more wanted trucks I
guess<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.520> should<00:02:09.729> do<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.000> video<00:02:10.270> first<00:02:10.570> now

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
guess I should do the video first now

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500 
guess I should do the video first now

this truck can do I need something to

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.800 
this truck can do I need something to
get<00:03:32.769> in<00:03:32.980> there<00:03:36.420> there<00:03:37.420> we<00:03:37.540> go<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:40.510> there's<00:03:40.690> a

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
get in there there we go so there's a

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:48.240 
get in there there we go so there's a
pretty<00:03:41.140> cool<00:03:41.470> truck<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:47.769> I'll<00:03:47.829> show<00:03:48.070> you<00:03:48.130> guys

pretty cool truck so I'll show you guys

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.420 
pretty cool truck so I'll show you guys
what<00:03:48.610> exactly<00:03:49.329> it<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:50.019> do<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:53.130> looking<00:03:54.130> at<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
what exactly it can do so looking at the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.970 
what exactly it can do so looking at the
truck<00:03:54.900> here's<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.170> bucket<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.739> then<00:03:56.829> we're

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
truck here's the bucket and then we're

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.240 
truck here's the bucket and then we're
bucket<00:03:57.400> actually<00:03:57.760> spend<00:03:58.120> another<00:03:58.410> 360<00:03:59.410> the

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
bucket actually spend another 360 the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.020 
bucket actually spend another 360 the
arm<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:01.570> actually<00:04:02.320> if<00:04:02.590> nothing<00:04:03.549> gets<00:04:03.700> in<00:04:03.940> the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
arm it actually if nothing gets in the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.379 
arm it actually if nothing gets in the
way<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.780> arm<00:04:05.079> I<00:04:05.470> don't<00:04:06.400> know<00:04:06.669> there's<00:04:07.299> no

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
way of the arm I don't know there's no

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:07.800 
way of the arm I don't know there's no
way

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
way

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.590 
way
but<00:04:08.230> this<00:04:08.500> rotates<00:04:09.400> they'll<00:04:09.970> do<00:04:10.739> do<00:04:11.739> a<00:04:11.769> good

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
but this rotates they'll do do a good

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.360 
but this rotates they'll do do a good
percentage<00:04:13.600> back<00:04:14.049> and<00:04:14.260> forth<00:04:14.790> but<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:15.820> can<00:04:16.150> move

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
percentage back and forth but I can move

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.039 
percentage back and forth but I can move
this<00:04:18.370> moves<00:04:18.730> here<00:04:19.090> as<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.359> can<00:04:19.540> see<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.870> back

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
this moves here as you can see the back

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.280 
this moves here as you can see the back
it<00:04:20.230> does<00:04:20.380> lower<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.919> raise<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.930> little

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
it does lower and raise and the little

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.879 
it does lower and raise and the little
hatch<00:04:23.530> on<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.860> back<00:04:24.130> here<00:04:24.490> does<00:04:24.730> open<00:04:25.389> up<00:04:25.570> so

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.670 

it<00:04:29.889> has<00:04:30.160> its<00:04:30.510> outriggers<00:04:31.510> here<00:04:31.870> they<00:04:32.500> actually

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
it has its outriggers here they actually

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.000 
it has its outriggers here they actually
pop<00:04:33.010> out<00:04:33.190> themselves<00:04:34.590> pop<00:04:35.590> those<00:04:35.770> back<00:04:36.010> in

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
pop out themselves pop those back in

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.409 
pop out themselves pop those back in
what<00:04:39.010> else<00:04:39.100> was<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.430> gonna<00:04:39.550> show<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.970> detail

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
what else was I gonna show the detail

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.540 
what else was I gonna show the detail
put<00:04:43.690> into<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:44.080> truck<00:04:44.410> is<00:04:44.620> pretty<00:04:44.980> nice<00:04:45.280> you

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
put into this truck is pretty nice you

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.930 
put into this truck is pretty nice you
have<00:04:45.699> here<00:04:45.970> a<00:04:46.000> step<00:04:46.330> up<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.840> has<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.730> way<00:04:48.730> up

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
have here a step up and has a way up

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.000 
have here a step up and has a way up
right<00:04:49.449> here<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:51.270> let's<00:04:52.270> get<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.720> open<00:04:53.290> just

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
right here so let's get that open just

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.060 
right here so let's get that open just
like<00:04:54.160> how<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.370> said<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.880> back<00:04:55.090> does<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:56.070> pop-up

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
like how I said the back does a pop-up

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.020 
like how I said the back does a pop-up
opens<00:04:58.470> up<00:04:59.470> so<00:04:59.650> you<00:04:59.710> can<00:04:59.919> dump<00:05:00.190> whatever<00:05:00.520> load

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
opens up so you can dump whatever load

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.939 
opens up so you can dump whatever load
you<00:05:01.210> put<00:05:01.449> into<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:03.540> pretty<00:05:04.540> nicely<00:05:04.949> detail

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
you put into it pretty nicely detail

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.680 
you put into it pretty nicely detail
this<00:05:06.190> truck<00:05:06.550> would<00:05:06.699> actually<00:05:07.000> be<00:05:07.090> pretty<00:05:07.300> cool

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
this truck would actually be pretty cool

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.070 
this truck would actually be pretty cool
and<00:05:07.840> a<00:05:07.930> recolor<00:05:10.740> pretty<00:05:11.740> nicely<00:05:11.980> the<00:05:12.370> design

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
and a recolor pretty nicely the design

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:21.309 
and a recolor pretty nicely the design
there's<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.350> front

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.719 

so<00:05:22.249> let's<00:05:22.639> get<00:05:22.909> a<00:05:22.990> rotating<00:05:23.990> here<00:05:24.289> so<00:05:25.129> how<00:05:25.490> far

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
so let's get a rotating here so how far

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.700 
so let's get a rotating here so how far
does<00:05:25.909> the<00:05:26.089> arm<00:05:26.300> go<00:05:26.539> up<00:05:26.689> I<00:05:26.869> will<00:05:27.050> show<00:05:27.259> that<00:05:27.439> in<00:05:27.589> a

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
does the arm go up I will show that in a

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.779 
does the arm go up I will show that in a
second<00:05:28.699> here<00:05:29.080> let's<00:05:30.080> just<00:05:30.409> rotate<00:05:30.949> this

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.739 

pretty<00:05:34.789> nice<00:05:35.059> truck<00:05:35.449> so<00:05:35.899> the<00:05:36.289> arm<00:05:37.389> you<00:05:38.389> can<00:05:38.569> get

00:05:38.739 --> 00:05:38.749 
pretty nice truck so the arm you can get

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:41.139 
pretty nice truck so the arm you can get
it<00:05:38.899> out<00:05:39.080> front<00:05:39.529> here<00:05:39.949> so<00:05:39.979> that<00:05:40.399> they<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:40.909> know

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:41.149 
it out front here so that they you know

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:42.279 
it out front here so that they you know
when<00:05:41.360> you<00:05:41.449> have<00:05:41.569> to<00:05:41.689> get<00:05:41.839> something<00:05:42.020> out<00:05:42.110> of

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
when you have to get something out of

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.100 
when you have to get something out of
the<00:05:42.379> truck<00:05:42.710> instead<00:05:43.159> of<00:05:43.479> put<00:05:44.479> it<00:05:44.569> up<00:05:44.719> here<00:05:44.990> and

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
the truck instead of put it up here and

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.709 
the truck instead of put it up here and
climbing<00:05:45.499> down<00:05:45.680> you<00:05:45.860> can<00:05:45.979> just<00:05:46.009> put<00:05:46.279> that<00:05:46.309> down

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
climbing down you can just put that down

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:55.329 
climbing down you can just put that down
but<00:05:47.719> here<00:05:47.960> is<00:05:48.080> how<00:05:48.229> high<00:05:48.499> the<00:05:48.559> arm<00:05:48.979> can<00:05:49.399> go<00:05:54.339> it's

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:55.339 
but here is how high the arm can go it's

00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:07.629 
but here is how high the arm can go it's
pretty<00:05:55.580> tall<00:05:55.819> if<00:05:55.969> I<00:05:56.089> say<00:05:59.919> there<00:06:00.919> we<00:06:01.039> go<00:06:06.639> so

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
pretty tall if I say there we go so

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:15.480 
pretty tall if I say there we go so
there<00:06:08.419> it<00:06:08.569> is<00:06:09.879> wonderful<00:06:10.879> truck<00:06:12.639> it<00:06:13.639> does<00:06:14.240> a
