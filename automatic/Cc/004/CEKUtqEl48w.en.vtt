00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
it until I created this weapon that

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
it until I created this weapon that
you're<00:02:01.860> shooting<00:02:02.010> screws<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:02.820> screws

you're shooting screws and the screws

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.880 
you're shooting screws and the screws
shot<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.810> sort<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.020> swirled<00:02:04.350> their<00:02:04.560> way<00:02:04.710> in

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
shot in and sort of swirled their way in

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.360 
shot in and sort of swirled their way in
making<00:02:05.520> these<00:02:05.730> curls<00:02:06.120> of<00:02:06.240> metal<00:02:10.130> it's<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.220> good

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
making these curls of metal it's a good

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.610 
making these curls of metal it's a good
weapon<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:11.850> there<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:12.300> few<00:02:12.420> disadvantages

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620

the<00:02:13.620> main<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.310> weapon<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.640> super

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
the main one is that the weapon is super

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.260 
the main one is that the weapon is super
super<00:02:15.390> long<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.430> I've<00:02:17.430> been<00:02:17.640> designing<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.120> new

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
super long and I've been designing a new

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.720 
super long and I've been designing a new
one<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> much<00:02:19.230> thinner<00:02:19.740> barrel<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.580> will

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
one with a much thinner barrel that will

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.490 
one with a much thinner barrel that will
shoot<00:02:20.940> pellets<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:21.720> much<00:02:21.930> shorter<00:02:21.960> all

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
shoot pellets and it's much shorter all

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.560 
shoot pellets and it's much shorter all
I<00:02:22.560> need<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.070> do<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.430> design<00:02:23.760> an<00:02:23.910> action<00:02:24.240> for<00:02:24.480> it

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
I need to do is design an action for it

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.180 
I need to do is design an action for it
it'll<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.320> done<00:02:27.020> but<00:02:28.020> anyways<00:02:28.410> thanks<00:02:29.070> for
