00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
the way I did but you basically keep

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.680 
the way I did but you basically keep
running<00:02:38.250> around<00:02:39.200> until<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.880> until

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
running around until you can until

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.050 
running around until you can until

00:02:45.060 --> 00:03:01.960 
Abigail comes back up user to heal and
rinse<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:45.900> repeat

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.080 

I<00:03:02.060> kind<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.990> wish<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.430> your<00:03:04.430> tactics

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
I kind of wish that your tactics

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.820 
I kind of wish that your tactics
actually<00:03:05.480> did<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.750> little<00:03:05.960> bit<00:03:06.140> more<00:03:06.380> like<00:03:06.680> when

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
actually did a little bit more like when

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.250 
actually did a little bit more like when
I<00:03:06.860> was<00:03:06.950> spinning<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.270> jumping<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:08.810> stuff<00:03:08.990> it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
I was spinning and jumping and stuff it

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.110 
I was spinning and jumping and stuff it
didn't<00:03:09.560> seem<00:03:09.770> like<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.980> prevented<00:03:10.490> any<00:03:10.640> damage

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
didn't seem like it prevented any damage

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.020 
didn't seem like it prevented any damage
I<00:03:12.040> thought<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.100> would<00:03:13.220> have<00:03:13.340> been<00:03:13.400> nice<00:03:13.610> what

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
I thought it would have been nice what

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:23.890 
I thought it would have been nice what
up<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.640> maybe<00:03:22.850> didn't<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.300> just<00:03:23.330> didn't<00:03:23.690> really

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
up and maybe didn't I just didn't really

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.280 
up and maybe didn't I just didn't really
notice<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.350> but<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:25.550> my<00:03:25.760> turtle<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:30.230> I

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
notice that but it's my turtle so I

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.290 
notice that but it's my turtle so I
pretty<00:03:30.530> much<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:30.820> destroyed<00:03:31.820> this<00:03:32.000> entire

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
pretty much just destroyed this entire

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.290 
pretty much just destroyed this entire
town<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.350> did<00:03:34.220> say<00:03:34.430> that<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:34.640> would<00:03:34.700> get

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
town but I did say that I would get

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:46.660 
town but I did say that I would get
revenge<00:03:38.300> on<00:03:38.510> him<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:43.580> as<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.880> saw<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:45.670> got

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
hopefully seeing my battle you have an

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.410 
hopefully seeing my battle you have an
idea<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.520> how<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:38.700> do<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:39.060> sorry<00:04:39.300> I'm

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
idea of how to do it and sorry I'm

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.320 
idea of how to do it and sorry I'm
thinking<00:04:39.690> so<00:04:39.840> long<00:04:40.020> looting<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.880> it's<00:04:42.180> not

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
thinking so long looting and it's not

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.090 
thinking so long looting and it's not
obtaining<00:04:45.320> but<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.470> want<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.710> make<00:04:46.800> sure<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:46.980> get

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
obtaining but I want to make sure I get

00:04:47.100 --> 00:05:00.770 
obtaining but I want to make sure I get
everything

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.500 

alright<00:05:01.620> let's<00:05:01.980> move<00:05:02.070> and<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:03.210> think<00:05:03.270> that

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
alright let's move and I think that

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.540 
alright let's move and I think that
flashing<00:05:04.050> red<00:05:04.230> is<00:05:04.380> because<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.650> my<00:05:04.860> toxicity

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
flashing red is because of my toxicity

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.710 
flashing red is because of my toxicity
levels

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
the game as the combat system doesn't

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.960 
the game as the combat system doesn't
seem<00:07:00.660> as<00:07:00.810> refined<00:07:01.230> as<00:07:01.380> it<00:07:01.530> could<00:07:01.740> be<00:07:01.770> I<00:07:02.130> think

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
seem as refined as it could be I think

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.490 
seem as refined as it could be I think
they<00:07:03.030> could<00:07:03.210> have<00:07:03.240> done<00:07:03.420> a<00:07:03.450> lot<00:07:03.690> better<00:07:03.750> job<00:07:04.260> on

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
they could have done a lot better job on

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.950 
they could have done a lot better job on
it<00:07:06.500> giving<00:07:07.500> chances<00:07:07.740> to<00:07:08.280> do<00:07:08.430> actual<00:07:09.360> Perry's

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
it giving chances to do actual Perry's

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.810 
it giving chances to do actual Perry's
and<00:07:10.440> stuff<00:07:10.890> like<00:07:11.040> that<00:07:11.100> would<00:07:11.640> have<00:07:11.730> been

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
and stuff like that would have been

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.370 
and stuff like that would have been
really<00:07:11.880> nice<00:07:12.270> but<00:07:14.930> can't<00:07:15.930> always<00:07:16.080> get<00:07:16.350> what
