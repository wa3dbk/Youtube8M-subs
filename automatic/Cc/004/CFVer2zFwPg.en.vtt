00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:36.090
 Tools used to 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:38.850
 It was said that it was a station, but it is closed and it feels like a tourist destination. 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.190
 I do sell commemorative tickets but 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.579
 If you don't have it 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:50.329
 There is also a time to do something 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.820
 You may be doing Toka Anado date is this is a long time ago 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.600

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.600
 Happiness station 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.850
 I think this is completely new 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.659
 Occasional retaliation and here 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.820

 But it does not mean I threshold 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.810
 It seems that there is also something like that 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.810
 There is a very way 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:01.580
 This side is Yappane-Tokyo East Hokkaido is also the difference in snow 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.850
 If you haven't heard of this , if it were Tokyo at all, it would melt in one day and become pitcher 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.690
 Perhaps it says contains a road in there Well I do not solve Hokkaido 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.539

 It's kinda broken already 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.760
 At that time, I 'm wondering how long it has been used until now 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.689
 I do not feel like this 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.689
 It was in-house 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.239

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.880
 And maneuverable 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.940

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.069
 The view is here 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.310

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.830

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.060
