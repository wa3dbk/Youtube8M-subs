00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
in the first place at the interception I

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.859 
in the first place at the interception I
specialize<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.460> very<00:00:17.730> specific<00:00:18.150> type<00:00:18.840> of

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
specialize in a very specific type of

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.429 
specialize in a very specific type of
security<00:00:19.699> okay<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.760> now<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:21.960> have<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.140> map

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
security okay so now here we have a map

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.120 
security okay so now here we have a map
scope<00:00:22.769> where<00:00:23.150> apparently<00:00:24.590> sonichu<00:00:25.590> who's<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
scope where apparently sonichu who's the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.609 
scope where apparently sonichu who's the
red<00:00:26.369> dot<00:00:26.670> surprisingly<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.660> sonic<00:00:28.320> who<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
red dot surprisingly and sonic who is

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.550 
red dot surprisingly and sonic who is
the<00:00:28.859> blue<00:00:29.160> dot<00:00:29.429> are<00:00:29.929> heading<00:00:30.929> down<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.320> same

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the blue dot are heading down the same

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.209 
the blue dot are heading down the same
path<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> guess<00:00:34.170> this<00:00:34.500> means<00:00:34.739> they're<00:00:35.070> going

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
path so I guess this means they're going

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.549 
path so I guess this means they're going
to<00:00:35.280> bump<00:00:35.460> into<00:00:35.579> each<00:00:35.880> other<00:00:36.030> well<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.200> really

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
to bump into each other well that really

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.819 
to bump into each other well that really
only<00:00:37.860> happen<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.430> they're<00:00:38.579> retarded<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.829> ok

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
only happen if they're retarded but ok

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.530 
only happen if they're retarded but ok
well<00:00:41.040> we're<00:00:41.190> reading<00:00:41.430> sonic<00:00:41.820> shoe<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.239> that's

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
well we're reading sonic shoe so that's

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540 
well we're reading sonic shoe so that's
pretty<00:00:42.719> likely<00:00:42.960> yeah<00:00:43.559> plus<00:00:43.920> you'll<00:00:44.250> notice

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
pretty likely yeah plus you'll notice

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.729 
pretty likely yeah plus you'll notice
that<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.789> only<00:00:44.940> thing<00:00:45.030> that's<00:00:45.360> labeled<00:00:46.320> here

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
that the only thing that's labeled here

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.490 
that the only thing that's labeled here
is<00:00:46.860> black<00:00:47.129> sancha<00:00:47.610> who<00:00:47.730> somehow<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.570> grass

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
appears that the countdown was such a

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.539 
appears that the countdown was such a
complicated<00:01:14.450> decision<00:01:14.930> process<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:16.369> he

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
complicated decision process that he

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.680 
complicated decision process that he
decided<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.180> add<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.750> numbers<00:01:18.110> in<00:01:18.470> post<00:01:18.920> and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
decided to add the numbers in post and

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.730 
decided to add the numbers in post and
considering<00:01:20.690> this<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:20.960> christian<00:01:21.500> we're

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
considering this is christian we're

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.529 
considering this is christian we're
talking<00:01:22.039> about<00:01:22.130> here<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.909> can<00:01:23.119> guess<00:01:23.330> how

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
talking about here you can guess how

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.359 
talking about here you can guess how
well<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:23.930> turned<00:01:24.140> out<00:01:24.289> and<00:01:24.590> if<00:01:25.190> you'll

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
well that turned out and if you'll

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.270 
well that turned out and if you'll
notice<00:01:25.600> several<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.350> panel's<00:01:27.979> seemed

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
notice several of the panel's seemed

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.370 
notice several of the panel's seemed
like<00:01:28.549> they<00:01:28.700> were<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.090> kind<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.509> photocopying

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
like they were just kind of photocopying

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.050 
like they were just kind of photocopying

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
I mean if you look at them they're a lot

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.550 
I mean if you look at them they're a lot
lighter<00:01:32.509> than<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:34.009> other<00:01:34.159> panels<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.899> can

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
lighter than the other panels so I can

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.540 
lighter than the other panels so I can
we<00:01:36.679> see<00:01:36.890> here<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.659> blotches<00:01:38.950> ingenious<00:01:39.950> plan

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
live so then we get another map scope

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.569 
live so then we get another map scope
and<00:02:47.519> we<00:02:48.239> can<00:02:48.450> see<00:02:48.689> here<00:02:48.959> that<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.439> road<00:02:50.189> I

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
and we can see here that the road I

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.990 
and we can see here that the road I
guess<00:02:50.730> decided<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.540> change<00:02:52.129> here<00:02:53.129> this<00:02:53.400> wasn't

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
guess decided to change here this wasn't

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.119 
guess decided to change here this wasn't
on<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.239> big<00:02:54.420> map<00:02:54.629> either<00:02:54.900> was<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.260> I'm

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
on the big map either was it I'm

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.539 
on the big map either was it I'm
thinking<00:02:56.549> this<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.849> an<00:02:56.970> inferior<00:02:57.329> map<00:02:58.549> you're

thinking<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.690> an<00:03:01.140> inferior<00:03:01.890> map<00:03:02.190> scope

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
thinking this is an inferior map scope

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.449
