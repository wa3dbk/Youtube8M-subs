00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
whole the whole first floor was flooded

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.050 
whole the whole first floor was flooded
or<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.789> about<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> whole<00:00:21.300> first<00:00:21.539> floor<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
or just about the whole first floor and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.320 
or just about the whole first floor and
what<00:00:24.060> happened<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.509> it's<00:00:24.859> piping<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> sink

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
what happened was it's piping the sink

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.009 
what happened was it's piping the sink
exploded<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.859> and<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.310> things<00:00:29.839> we've<00:00:30.839> ruined

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
exploded and and the things we've ruined

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.420 
exploded and and the things we've ruined
a<00:00:31.199> lot<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.410> stuff<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.859> first<00:00:32.099> floor<00:00:32.310> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
a lot of stuff on the first floor and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.000 
a lot of stuff on the first floor and
stuff<00:00:32.700> but<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.780> think<00:00:33.810> it<00:00:34.290> leaked<00:00:34.620> through<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
stuff but I think it leaked through the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.099 
stuff but I think it leaked through the
icemaker<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.820> I'll<00:00:35.910> show<00:00:36.149> you

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.009 

so<00:00:41.710> this<00:00:42.249> is<00:00:42.429> the<00:00:42.640> icemaker<00:00:43.269> I'm<00:00:43.629> asleep<00:00:43.809> I

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
so this is the icemaker I'm asleep I

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.069 
so this is the icemaker I'm asleep I
said<00:00:44.320> yeah<00:00:45.219> that's<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:45.940> icemaker<00:00:46.449> there<00:00:46.809> and
