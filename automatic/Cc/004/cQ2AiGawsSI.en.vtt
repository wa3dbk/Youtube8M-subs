sins by buying our way out of it and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.320 
sins by buying our way out of it and
that's<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.250> one<00:03:15.460> argument<00:03:15.700> that's<00:03:15.970> made<00:03:16.030> as

you know for for us to really make a

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
difference in our wealthier world we're

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.420 
difference in our wealthier world we're
gonna<00:03:20.050> have<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.320> cut<00:03:20.470> back<00:03:20.650> fossil<00:03:21.070> fuels<00:03:21.280> by

gonna have to cut back fossil fuels by

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.980 
gonna have to cut back fossil fuels by
ninety-five<00:03:21.850> percent<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.270> what<00:03:22.480> what<00:03:22.870> would

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
ninety-five percent so what what would

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.990 
ninety-five percent so what what would
you<00:03:23.080> suggest<00:03:23.230> we<00:03:23.530> do<00:03:23.740> it<00:03:23.890> not<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.640> get<00:03:24.730> into<00:03:24.880> a

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
you suggest we do it not to get into a

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.150 
you suggest we do it not to get into a
long<00:03:25.240> discussion<00:03:25.540> but<00:03:26.440> will<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.740> players<00:03:26.830> get

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
long discussion but will the players get

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.410 
long discussion but will the players get
involved<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.580> way<00:03:27.610> as<00:03:27.820> well<00:03:27.850> without<00:03:28.240> a

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
involved that way as well without a

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.270 
involved that way as well without a
doubt<00:03:28.540> carbon<00:03:29.410> neutral<00:03:29.650> isn't<00:03:29.860> isn't<00:03:30.130> a

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
doubt carbon neutral isn't isn't a

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.970 
doubt carbon neutral isn't isn't a
perfect<00:03:30.430> solution<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.420> think<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.620> great<00:03:32.950> thing

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
perfect solution I think the great thing

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.860 
perfect solution I think the great thing
about<00:03:33.160> this<00:03:33.430> program<00:03:33.850> is<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.570> going<00:03:34.810> to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
about this program is it's going to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.180 
about this program is it's going to
introduce<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.410> lot<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.650> guys<00:03:35.800> around<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
introduce a lot of guys around the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.699 
introduce a lot of guys around the
league<00:03:36.510> into<00:03:37.510> doing<00:03:37.930> something<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.380> taking

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
league into doing something and taking

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.949 
league into doing something and taking
action<00:03:38.890> and<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:40.150> know<00:03:40.420> some<00:03:40.600> guys<00:03:40.750> are<00:03:40.840> going

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
action and you know some guys are going

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.120 
action and you know some guys are going
to<00:03:41.020> take<00:03:41.170> it<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.410> greater<00:03:41.620> extremes<00:03:41.890> and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
to take it to greater extremes and

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.710 
to take it to greater extremes and
others<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.610> like<00:03:42.850> myself<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:43.480> change

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
others and like myself and you change

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.510 
others and like myself and you change
around<00:03:43.840> some<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.290> your<00:03:44.440> household<00:03:44.980> appliances

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
around some of your household appliances

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.040 
around some of your household appliances
you<00:03:45.670> know<00:03:45.760> lights<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.510> vehicles<00:03:46.959> you

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
you know lights the vehicles you

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.050 
you know lights the vehicles you
purchased<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.680> way<00:03:47.770> you<00:03:47.830> shop<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.700> the

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
purchased the way you shop the the

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.210 
purchased the way you shop the the
products<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.590> choose<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:51.070> buy

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
products that you that you choose to buy

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.250 
products that you that you choose to buy
but<00:03:51.580> like<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:52.450> said<00:03:52.630> at<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.870> end<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.110> day

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
but like you said at the end of the day

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.540 
but like you said at the end of the day
you<00:03:53.320> know<00:03:53.500> ride<00:03:53.680> your<00:03:53.860> bike<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.010> work<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.459> know

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
you know ride your bike to work you know

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.430 
you know ride your bike to work you know
it's<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.730> great<00:03:54.850> way<00:03:55.170> using<00:03:56.170> mass

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
it's a great way using mass

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.470 
it's a great way using mass
transportation<00:03:56.920> you<00:03:57.370> know<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.610> really<00:03:58.240> is<00:03:58.450> a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
transportation you know it really is a

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.240 
transportation you know it really is a
snowball<00:03:58.900> effect<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.800> that's<00:04:00.040> why<00:04:00.220> I

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
snowball effect and and that's why I

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.530 
snowball effect and and that's why I
think<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.520> power<00:04:00.700> of<00:04:00.850> this<00:04:00.940> program<00:04:01.300> can<00:04:01.510> be

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
think the power of this program can be

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.720 
think the power of this program can be
is<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:02.020> going<00:04:02.260> carbon<00:04:02.560> neutral<00:04:02.830> is<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:03.070> really

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
is is going carbon neutral is a really

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.670 
is is going carbon neutral is a really
an<00:04:03.790> introduction<00:04:04.360> into<00:04:04.840> taking<00:04:05.050> action<00:04:05.560> and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
an introduction into taking action and

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.840 
an introduction into taking action and
doing<00:04:06.130> something<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:07.350> it's<00:04:08.350> amazing<00:04:08.620> how<00:04:09.010> if

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
doing something and it's amazing how if

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.640 
doing something and it's amazing how if
you<00:04:09.970> change<00:04:10.239> one<00:04:10.300> part<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.690> your<00:04:10.780> life<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.260> get

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
you change one part of your life and get

you change one part of your life and get
off<00:04:11.739> your<00:04:11.920> butt<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.130> do<00:04:12.340> something<00:04:12.370> about<00:04:12.730> it

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
off your butt and do something about it

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.960 
off your butt and do something about it
how<00:04:13.860> it'll<00:04:14.860> snowball<00:04:15.250> into<00:04:15.400> something<00:04:15.760> bigger

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
how it'll snowball into something bigger

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.740 
how it'll snowball into something bigger
and<00:04:16.180> like<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.810> said<00:04:17.020> reducing<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.100> and
