00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
reissue and the original then if you can
see<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.049> like<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.650> reissues<00:01:29.070> got<00:01:29.250> eyes<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
see it like the reissues got eyes the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.539 
see it like the reissues got eyes the
original<00:01:30.329> doesn't<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:30.810> some<00:01:30.990> reason<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.590> dare

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
original doesn't for some reason so dare

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.130 
original doesn't for some reason so dare
you<00:01:32.759> use<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.119> own<00:01:33.270> discernment<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> but

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
you use your own discernment on it but

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.960 
you use your own discernment on it but
this<00:01:34.470> distinguishes<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.460> from<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.729> reissue

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
