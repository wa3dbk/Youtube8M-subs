 relatively recently 2010 from the metro 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 partly based on fantastic 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 horror story hideki son hit him 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 and is its plot continuation on 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.600
 back to our heroine and I was born in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.309
 America in the city of boston it happened 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.530
 happy event November 20, 1972 7 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.250
 yo girl got into a car accident in 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.080
 which killed both mother and sister in may 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 The 14th was transplanted right orbit 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.790
 May on preserved organs which 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.780
 conducted his experiments Dr. Klamp that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.610
 the future will still play a role 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.280
 data further childhood and diverge 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.680
 The official guide says that she lived 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.600
 in different adoptive families in the game between those 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.200
 the girl says thankful father for 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.040
 their upbringing unlike nilin and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.320
 visible bb 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.689
 I felt guilty about what was left 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.820
 alive after accidents and therefore decided 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.250
 dedicate your life to salvation and help 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.590
 to others after studying at university 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.110
 forensic expert she moves to new york and in 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.720
 25 years becomes an intern 17 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.240
 police station 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.520
 not having worked there for half a year and became 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.740
 an active participant in the event that was 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.320
 called the blockade incident new york 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.130
 It began with a harmless trip to the opera 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.130
 in carnegie hall 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.129
 after she survived and I realized that 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.599
 possesses paranormal abilities 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.150
 but it was only flowers compared 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.340
 so that I still had to go through 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.870
 I will not retell in detail the plot 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.620
 games on a generally outline 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.420
 state of affairs according to the legend of the game book 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.829
 cellular mitochondria have evolved 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.470
 so much so that they could manage 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.140
 whole body and decided to subjugate 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.420
 all living things on earth as their base 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.019
 they chose the body of the singer appeared and pier 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.790
 which I started calling myself I was 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.160
 he is affected by it as her 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.349
 mitochondria have already mutated thanks 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.030
 transplanted eye sockets and all of May 3rd and 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.579
 Dr. Clamp's experiments 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.709
 This situation of course only I was 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.920
 able to save the city and the whole world from 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.920
 destruction 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.050
 after destroying him and her born 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.640
 supercreature and I have a couple more years 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.500
 worked in new york and then 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.780
 moved to los angeles to enter 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.000
 in a special department fbi mist that 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.780
 stands for search command and 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.300
 the destruction of mitochondria parasitic strut 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.400
 of 2 begins with the fact that I leave for 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.980
 the place where according to data not activated 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.050
 mitochondrial creatures and if earlier 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.600
 mitochondria made monsters only from 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.960
 animals then in this part they got and 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.960
 up people 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.370
 Hildi bed where I was sent for 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.920
 further research she met 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.380
 detective carl and nigana and a little later in 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.020
 desert refuge girl like two drops 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:54.570
 water similar to myself discovered yet 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.970
 several test tube clones as well 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.940
 that all creatures are from shelters and are created on 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.130
 Based on her dna sample and I am winning 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.550
 final boss and along with left 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.560
 selected to the surface depending 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.720
 on what ending the player earned 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.930
 information about their further 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.270
 the fate of the best we will know 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.160
 that he became considered a younger sister 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.440
 a and went to school and enjoys there 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.959
 very popular with such and such 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.120
 charming penitential smile for a year 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.610
 nobody sees and I already started 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.620
 It appears that she came up with it but 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.360
 the final movie in the museum of great joy 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.360
 and he still comes back 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.990
 but 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.370
 but 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.570
 on this story and I could 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.460
 great end on thirst cut down 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.800
 money on the fans overpowered common 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.900
 the meaning and the light is beyond the light of the star 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.100
 actions that are already happening in our 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.440
 days at once strongly I will play 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.270
 the whole game we will not oh oh elo but 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.430
 it turns out this is only the end of the game and 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.860
 this is all including the players themselves 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.140
 him I think that the heroine is just suffering from 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.790
 amnesia actually and I oddly 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.200
 sad to admit was killed on 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:14.270
 I tried to rock my own wedding 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.700
 save her but the only thing she could 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.870
 it's moving your soul into her body 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.270
 and then in the course of numerous 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.670
 time travel and return to 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.310
 This point and did shoot the last 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.380
 requested the most it was necessary 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.570
 to stop the monsters popped up 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.250
 in the destruction of the soul and in the relocation 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.960
 his ability to move in her body 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.210
 the girl used more than once 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.220
 throughout the game but without such 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.870
 dangerous consequences like a serial 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.550
 quantum leap I really can 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.060
 move from one person to 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.700
 other 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.260
 and at the same time we see it as all Hella 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.930
 the rest of the person she is 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.060
 settled in this part of the heroine for the first time 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.880
 There is a voice in the English version 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.770
 she is not voiced anyhow who is beautiful 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.590
 Yvonne Strahovski known to many 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.600
 for example by role guard in d3 and miranda 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.400
 in mass effect 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.350
 if we talk about the public itself and this 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.510
 It is worth noting that she dresses in moderation 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.460
 modest and practical and I'm not talking right now 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.190
 about the third part 2 as we found out in 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.120
 communicating and t-shirt and jeans here and 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.880
 regular outfit 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.890
 no provocative cutting note 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.530
 what the older I got 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.390
 and this revelation was her clothes in 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.580
 the second part she walk in the desert 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.640
 in a short dress it’s probably hot 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.560
 denim jacket 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.240
 thanks not to the mitochondria inside of you then 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.180
 time of action and feast the heroine is not 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.090
 aged outwardly and noted it back in 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.090
 27 when the hotel approached the mirror 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.970
 her reaction is atypical for a girl she is not 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.370
 glad this is rather the contrary saddened you 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.210
 how he wants to live a normal human 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.740
 life in general I love to reason to 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.230
 single object in the environment 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.510
 she may have a few comments 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.180
 which indicates her sharp mind and 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:05.010
 well- developed logical thinking not 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:06.840
 for nothing she worked fb i'm sorry 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.180
 the creators of the stars and so cost 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.190
 the heroine who survived how much 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.650
 in two previous parts and fell in love 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.630
 of course its players look the same on 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.850
 this and I will not replace it 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.280
 remain to console themselves only so that it 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.710
 unofficial secret of his event can 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.330
 do not regard as canonically asqué 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.670
 ever let out normal 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.670
 the continuation of which will be most alive
