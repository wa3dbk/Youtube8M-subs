hey guys in this video I want to talk
about<00:00:01.800> muscle<00:00:02.429> fiber<00:00:02.879> recruitment<00:00:03.290> muscle

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
about muscle fiber recruitment muscle

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.230 
about muscle fiber recruitment muscle
fiber<00:00:04.560> recruitment<00:00:05.040> before<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:05.910> get<00:00:06.089> that

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240

to recruit more muscle fibers one party

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.130 
to recruit more muscle fibers one party
will<00:00:35.040> say<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.940> partial<00:00:36.329> reps<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
will say if you do partial reps and

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.799 
will say if you do partial reps and
never<00:00:37.380> lockout<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.700> recruit<00:00:39.120> more<00:00:39.329> muscle

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
never lockout you recruit more muscle

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
never lockout you recruit more muscle
fibers<00:00:40.100> another<00:00:41.100> party<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.700> heard<00:00:41.910> this

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
fibers another party and I heard this

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.840 
fibers another party and I heard this
this<00:00:42.840> week<00:00:43.170> said<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.370> greater<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
this week said that the greater the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.720 
this week said that the greater the
range<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.539> motion<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.010> more<00:00:47.250> muscle

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
range of motion you have the more muscle

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.270 
range of motion you have the more muscle
fibers<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.629> recruiting<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.039> more

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
fibers you are recruiting the more

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.760 
fibers you are recruiting the more
muscle<00:00:50.730> fibers<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.480> recruiting<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.500> yeah

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
muscle fibers you are recruiting so yeah

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.130 
muscle fibers you are recruiting so yeah
you<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.370> conflicting<00:00:54.149> bro<00:00:54.510> opinions

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you know conflicting bro opinions

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.900 
you know conflicting bro opinions
floating<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.770> there<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.370> muscle

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

let me explain both of those relative
intensity<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:28.799> weight<00:01:29.070> you're<00:01:29.250> using

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
intensity is the weight you're using

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.469 
intensity is the weight you're using

know near max sets week in a week out

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.840 
know near max sets week in a week out
that's<00:01:42.689> that's<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.250> point<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.700> making

need<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.180> recruit<00:01:54.479> more<00:01:54.720> muscle<00:01:55.110> fibers<00:01:55.140> help

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
need to recruit more muscle fibers help

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.060 
need to recruit more muscle fibers help
help<00:01:56.490> me<00:01:56.729> more<00:01:57.090> muscle<00:01:57.509> fibers<00:01:57.540> needed<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.469> need

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
help me more muscle fibers needed I need

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.670 
help me more muscle fibers needed I need
to<00:01:59.759> push<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.360> weight<00:02:00.659> off<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.110> chest<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.649> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
to push this weight off my chest so I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.639 
to push this weight off my chest so I
don't<00:02:02.070> die<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.640> generally<00:02:03.600> above<00:02:03.780> 80<00:02:04.079> percent

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
don't die so generally above 80 percent

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.469 
don't die so generally above 80 percent
or<00:02:05.119> sets<00:02:06.119> at<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.950> know<00:02:08.039> 5<00:02:08.310> reps<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.879> less<00:02:09.119> with

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
about you got to have the greatest range

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.490 
about you got to have the greatest range

will help you recruit maximal muscle

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.040 
will help you recruit maximal muscle
fibers<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.650> it<00:04:33.220> will<00:04:33.520> ensure<00:04:34.050> maximum
