00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
way up but if you take a look at this

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
way up but if you take a look at this
something<00:01:07.110> real<00:01:07.380> closely

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
something real closely

something real closely
notice<00:01:08.729> how<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> spring<00:01:09.330> starts<00:01:09.810> tough<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
notice how the spring starts tough to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.719 
notice how the spring starts tough to
spring<00:01:11.810> okay<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:14.040> really

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
spring okay this is a really really

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.420 
spring okay this is a really really
unique<00:01:14.970> feature<00:01:15.450> about<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.990> machine

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
unique feature about this machine

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.499 
unique feature about this machine
another<00:01:17.430> thing<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.939> you'll<00:01:18.090> notice<00:01:18.390> right

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
another thing that you'll notice right

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.310 
another thing that you'll notice right
away<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.799> follow<00:01:20.490> my<00:01:20.729> lead<00:01:20.970> here

away is if you follow my lead here

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.670 
away is if you follow my lead here
notice<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:24.659> hinges<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.500> use

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
notice the the hinges we can we use

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
notice the the hinges we can we use
three<00:01:26.040> hinges<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> are<00:01:26.729> welded<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
three hinges that are welded on to the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.380 
three hinges that are welded on to the
machine<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.439> then<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.009> use<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> framing<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
machine and then we use a framing a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.749 
machine and then we use a framing a
complete<00:01:30.960> framing<00:01:31.409> around<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.979> around<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
complete framing around them around the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.630 
complete framing around them around the
machine<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.659> not<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.229> box<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:35.430> made

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
machine it's not just a box that's made

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.090 
machine it's not just a box that's made
out<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.790> tin<00:01:36.140> it's<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.259> complete<00:01:37.619> some<00:01:37.770> machine

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
out of tin it's a complete some machine

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.609 
out of tin it's a complete some machine
that<00:01:38.280> has<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.850> complete<00:01:39.840> frame<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.350> there<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that has a complete frame in there the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.850 
that has a complete frame in there the
frame<00:01:40.890> adds<00:01:41.130> rigidity<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.500> sturdiness<00:01:43.500> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
frame adds rigidity and sturdiness so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
frame adds rigidity and sturdiness so
this<00:01:44.040> is<00:01:44.189> something<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.549> will<00:01:44.880> last<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
this is something that will last you a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
this is something that will last you a
very<00:01:45.869> long<00:01:46.140> time<00:01:46.430> we've<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.790> machine

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
very long time we've got this machine

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090 
very long time we've got this machine
we've<00:01:48.450> got<00:01:48.659> an<00:01:48.810> actual<00:01:48.960> thermal<00:01:49.500> coupler<00:01:49.860> put

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
we've got an actual thermal coupler put

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.210 
we've got an actual thermal coupler put

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
off and the rust was showing so we

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.230 
off and the rust was showing so we
decided<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.160> start<00:03:59.430> making<00:03:59.550> all<00:03:59.820> of<00:03:59.850> our<00:04:00.000> stuff

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
decided to start making all of our stuff

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.000 
decided to start making all of our stuff
out<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.390> aluminum<00:04:00.900> we<00:04:01.350> noticed<00:04:01.680> us<00:04:01.800> we<00:04:01.920> were

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
out of aluminum we noticed us we were

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.800 
out of aluminum we noticed us we were
doing<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.310> out<00:04:02.460> of<00:04:02.610> aluminum<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.630> made

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
doing it out of aluminum that it made

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.950 
doing it out of aluminum that it made
things<00:04:04.080> lighter<00:04:04.790> which<00:04:05.790> was<00:04:06.300> really<00:04:06.660> nice<00:04:06.840> for

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
things lighter which was really nice for

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.900 
things lighter which was really nice for
my<00:04:07.170> family<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.710> be<00:04:07.800> able<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:08.010> push<00:04:08.220> around<00:04:08.370> and

my family to be able to push around and

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.690 
my family to be able to push around and
myself<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.870> was<00:04:09.960> very<00:04:10.230> much<00:04:10.410> lighter<00:04:10.710> and<00:04:11.010> it

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
myself it was very much lighter and it

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.880 
myself it was very much lighter and it
doesn't<00:04:12.000> rust<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:13.440> very<00:04:14.190> very<00:04:14.400> good<00:04:14.670> feature
