using it since it went on since it got
into<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.860> market<00:02:48.220> I<00:02:48.310> think<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.850> was<00:02:49.060> maybe

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
into the market I think it was maybe

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.240 
into the market I think it was maybe
four<00:02:50.320> or<00:02:50.350> five<00:02:50.470> years<00:02:50.920> ago

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
four or five years ago

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.760 
four or five years ago
and<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.330> did<00:02:52.570> cheated<00:02:52.870> with<00:02:53.050> other<00:02:53.230> mascaras

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770

and I did cheated with other mascaras
but<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:53.980> always<00:02:54.340> come<00:02:54.550> back<00:02:54.580> for<00:02:54.730> more<00:02:55.150> because

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
but I always come back for more because

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.410 
but I always come back for more because
I<00:02:56.380> think<00:02:56.710> it's<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.920> mini<00:02:57.070> see<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.210> is<00:02:58.300> no

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
they're I think they're one of the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.800 
they're I think they're one of the
companies<00:04:10.930> who<00:04:11.290> maybe<00:04:11.680> they're<00:04:11.920> not<00:04:12.130> um

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
companies who maybe they're not um

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.420 
companies who maybe they're not um
marketing<00:04:13.810> themselves<00:04:14.050> good<00:04:14.800> enough<00:04:15.040> because

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
marketing themselves good enough because

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.849 
marketing themselves good enough because
it<00:04:16.000> does<00:04:16.269> have<00:04:16.510> really<00:04:16.840> good<00:04:17.140> products<00:04:17.709> but

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
it does have really good products but

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.160 
it does have really good products but
from<00:04:18.040> some<00:04:18.280> reason<00:04:18.580> it<00:04:18.669> doesn't

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
from some reason it doesn't

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.610 
from some reason it doesn't
get<00:04:19.470> too<00:04:20.090> dark<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:23.640> biggest<00:04:23.910> problem<00:04:24.440> as<00:04:25.440> I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
get too dark so the biggest problem as I

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.010 
get too dark so the biggest problem as I
said<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.430> brush<00:04:26.640> why<00:04:27.060> because<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:27.930> a

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
said is the brush why because it's a

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.370 
said is the brush why because it's a
very<00:04:29.750> it's<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.810> very<00:04:30.840> thick<00:04:31.520> big<00:04:32.520> brush<00:04:33.380> which

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
very it's a very thick big brush which

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.800 
very it's a very thick big brush which
is<00:04:34.530> very<00:04:34.740> good<00:04:35.070> for<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.490> formula<00:04:36.150> because<00:04:36.600> I

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
is very good for that formula because I

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.510 
is very good for that formula because I
tried<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.380> put<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.650> with<00:04:37.770> different<00:04:38.310> kind<00:04:38.490> of

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
tried to put it with different kind of

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.150 
tried to put it with different kind of
brush<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.630> didn't<00:04:39.930> work<00:04:40.050> at<00:04:40.170> all<00:04:40.290> it's

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
brush and it didn't work at all it's

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.870 
brush and it didn't work at all it's
just<00:04:41.340> glued<00:04:42.680> bunches<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.860> lashes<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.700> it

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
just glued bunches of lashes and it

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.130 
just glued bunches of lashes and it
looks<00:04:45.030> horrible<00:04:45.750> because<00:04:46.940> it's<00:04:47.940> just<00:04:48.930> it

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
looks horrible because it's just it

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.830 
looks horrible because it's just it
designed<00:04:49.500> really<00:04:49.710> good<00:04:49.980> but<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.670> that's<00:04:51.630> the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
designed really good but and that's the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.930 
designed really good but and that's the
biggest<00:04:52.110> but<00:04:52.320> for<00:04:53.100> some<00:04:53.220> people<00:04:53.340> who<00:04:53.580> are<00:04:53.640> not

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
biggest but for some people who are not

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.480 
biggest but for some people who are not
used<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.390> work<00:04:54.510> with<00:04:54.540> big<00:04:54.960> brushes<00:04:55.200> and<00:04:55.680> not

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
used to work with big brushes and not

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.170 
used to work with big brushes and not
that<00:04:56.820> um<00:04:57.150> I<00:04:57.980> don't<00:04:58.980> know<00:04:59.070> if<00:04:59.220> talented<00:04:59.850> but<00:05:00.030> not

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
that um I don't know if talented but not

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.020 
that um I don't know if talented but not
that<00:05:00.390> then<00:05:01.230> you<00:05:01.740> know<00:05:01.800> tried<00:05:02.250> enough<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.760> scare

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
that then you know tried enough to scare

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.020 
that then you know tried enough to scare
us<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.390> don't<00:05:04.230> do<00:05:04.410> lots<00:05:05.130> of<00:05:05.310> makeup<00:05:05.670> all<00:05:06.000> the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
us and don't do lots of makeup all the

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.120 
us and don't do lots of makeup all the
time<00:05:06.360> then<00:05:07.320> it's<00:05:07.500> gonna<00:05:07.620> be<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.800> little<00:05:08.010> bit

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
time then it's gonna be a little bit

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.760 
time then it's gonna be a little bit
complicated<00:05:08.580> because<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.780> can<00:05:10.140> get<00:05:10.320> very

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
complicated because you can get very

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.250 
complicated because you can get very
messy<00:05:10.890> that's<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:12.030> big<00:05:12.210> brush<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:12.720> big<00:05:13.020> brushes

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
messy that's a big brush and big brushes

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.600 
messy that's a big brush and big brushes
means<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:14.040> hell<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.790> mess<00:05:15.140> so<00:05:16.140> what<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:16.710> do<00:05:16.890> is<00:05:17.310> I

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
means a hell of a mess so what I do is I

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.470 
means a hell of a mess so what I do is I
just<00:05:17.670> I<00:05:18.380> turn<00:05:19.380> my<00:05:19.650> head<00:05:20.010> like<00:05:20.280> this<00:05:20.700> so<00:05:21.240> my

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
just I turn my head like this so my

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.570 
just I turn my head like this so my
eyelashes<00:05:22.080> are<00:05:22.110> straight<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:23.220> then<00:05:23.400> when<00:05:23.520> I

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
eyelashes are straight and then when I

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.010 
eyelashes are straight and then when I
put<00:05:23.760> it<00:05:23.880> on<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.360> never<00:05:24.630> gets<00:05:24.840> on<00:05:25.290> my<00:05:25.560> eyelid

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
put it on it never gets on my eyelid

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.540 
put it on it never gets on my eyelid
another<00:05:28.020> way<00:05:28.230> is<00:05:28.440> just<00:05:28.560> put<00:05:28.830> your<00:05:28.950> finger<00:05:29.340> and

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
another way is just put your finger and

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.820 
another way is just put your finger and
then<00:05:30.030> your<00:05:30.240> finger<00:05:30.540> gets<00:05:30.780> dirty<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.170> not<00:05:31.350> your

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
then your finger gets dirty and not your

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.670 
then your finger gets dirty and not your
eyelid<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:32.550> there's<00:05:33.180> this<00:05:33.480> thing<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.380> think

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
eyelid and there's this thing I think

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:43.250 
eyelid and there's this thing I think
but<00:05:34.860> by<00:05:35.160> um<00:05:38.420> tweezerman<00:05:39.420> I<00:05:39.780> don't<00:05:42.020> but<00:05:43.020> it's

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
but by um tweezerman I don't but it's

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.110 
but by um tweezerman I don't but it's
this<00:05:43.470> kind<00:05:43.680> of<00:05:43.830> weird<00:05:43.890> plastic<00:05:44.670> where<00:05:44.850> you<00:05:44.940> put

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
this kind of weird plastic where you put

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.060 
this kind of weird plastic where you put
it<00:05:45.240> on<00:05:45.420> it<00:05:45.870> just<00:05:45.900> covers<00:05:46.260> your<00:05:46.530> eyelid<00:05:46.890> and

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
it on it just covers your eyelid and

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.490 
it on it just covers your eyelid and
then<00:05:47.220> that<00:05:48.180> thing<00:05:48.450> is<00:05:48.750> getting<00:05:48.990> dirty<00:05:49.170> and

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
then that thing is getting dirty and

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.140 
then that thing is getting dirty and
you're<00:05:49.620> not<00:05:49.890> your<00:05:50.070> eyelid<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.940> same

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
you're not your eyelid the same

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.200 
you're not your eyelid the same
principle<00:05:51.930> um<00:05:53.390> and<00:05:55.310> that's<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.550> I<00:05:56.790> think<00:05:56.910> it's

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
principle um and that's it I think it's

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.770 
principle um and that's it I think it's
a<00:05:57.270> good<00:05:57.390> mascara

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
a good mascara

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.320 
a good mascara
I<00:05:57.960> think<00:05:58.260> it's<00:05:58.440> award<00:05:58.920> the<00:05:59.160> money<00:05:59.430> hearing<00:06:00.210> as

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
I think it's award the money hearing as

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.680 
I think it's award the money hearing as
well<00:06:00.360> it<00:06:00.720> cost<00:06:01.430> 50<00:06:02.430> or<00:06:02.550> 60<00:06:02.880> shekel<00:06:03.240> which<00:06:03.420> is

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
well it cost 50 or 60 shekel which is

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.910 
well it cost 50 or 60 shekel which is
about<00:06:04.610> I'm<00:06:05.610> not<00:06:05.790> so<00:06:05.880> good<00:06:06.030> in<00:06:06.120> math<00:06:06.270> like<00:06:06.630> $13<00:06:07.620> I

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
about I'm not so good in math like $13 I

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.470 
about I'm not so good in math like $13 I
think<00:06:08.220> you<00:06:09.060> really<00:06:09.300> don't<00:06:09.810> you<00:06:11.030> and<00:06:12.030> that's<00:06:12.330> it

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
think you really don't you and that's it

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.400 
think you really don't you and that's it
so<00:06:12.750> I<00:06:12.780> hope<00:06:12.930> you<00:06:13.260> liked<00:06:13.500> my<00:06:13.530> review<00:06:13.890> and<00:06:15.410> you

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
was bad for her so if you have something

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.920 
was bad for her so if you have something
advised<00:06:43.350> maybe<00:06:43.770> you<00:06:43.920> shouldn't<00:06:44.370> try<00:06:44.880> that<00:06:45.180> so

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
advised maybe you shouldn't try that so
