00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.020
 welcome to a more cello tutorial 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.910
 alternative now we will talk about the 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.280
 second part of how to play blues in the 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.900
 cello another element that we have 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.610
 in the cello that we can also use 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.029
 to play blues is the possibility of 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.070
 do baseline in the cello what would 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.920
 the bass is possible to make a hachero 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.200
 then also let's see some 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.360
 ways to get to it first we're going to 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.030
 talk about how baseline is made to a 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.430
 bass line in the cello that appropriates 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.439
 we are going to use what is known 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.600
 as beige walking that is to say let's go 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.789
 play the bass in blacks then walk 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.679
 over black is a beige walking and there 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.420
 certain things that one has to take care of 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.999
 One is very interesting to try to 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.280
 get to each new compass by distance 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:46.659
 of half tone or a tone of 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.039
 preference at the beginning for 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.229
 to practice it, we are going to do it 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.780
 arriving by half-tone distances already 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.519
 that these are typical of style 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.079
 use chord notes from our 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.940
 walking beige are four times those that 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.699
 we have in each bar but we can 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.479
 insert small chromatic notes to 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.400
 that to give us the opportunity 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.290
 then to try to get there 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.330
 to each next compass by distances 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.640
 of half tone and these chromatic notes 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.500
 they are also part of what you have to 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.690
 see with the blues style let's see a 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.670
 example the structure of blues let's 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.920
 use the same one that we use for the case of 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.140
 the first part of the blues round or 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.030
 which they are two aces with the twelve - bar 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.400
 first four bars it makes me a 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.790
 reminder are from the first grade with 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.470
 seventh minor then we have two 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.810
 fourth degree compasses that is also 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.000
 greater but with seventh minor we return 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.040
 to the first degree bars after 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.410
 we play a fifth degree compass a 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.600
 compass fourth grade a holding pattern 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.770
 first grade and a fifth degree compass 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.540
 that is the structure the same as 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.700
 we use in the case of the tutorial 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.619
 number one the first part of how 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.570
 play blues on the cello 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.700
 let's see an example let's explain 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.680
 the first four bars of the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.330
 blues turn these first four 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.150
 bars are based as we said 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.170
 in the first grade with seventh minor is 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.000
 say they are dominant chords 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.310
 what am I going to do in the first measure 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.900
 I'm going to do 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.330
 some notes of the accordion and others that 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.770
 they are not and I will not get to 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.530
 next beat to beat number two 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:19.160
 number one would be a 34 and a fa 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.400
 sharp sun for the second measure 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.660
 I arrived by medium distance all for 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.790
 what good precisely to give you the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.280
 color that we want precisely in the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.110
 blues now how will I play the second 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.480
 compass and I'm going to link it with the third 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.940
 compass let's observe how we got to the 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.370
 third glasses using the glasses concept 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.409
 it would be if alone sustained 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.890
 reached the next measure by distance 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:48.580
 again half tone of the beat 3 to 4 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.610
 what I play is not going to 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.129
 held only again distance from 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.540
 great half tone and the sun is part of 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.209
 the notes of the corde is the fifth of the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.440
 strap as I play the fourth quarter beat 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.180
 of two touched these are only the fa no 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.040
 because I play this good because for the 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.349
 next compass is already the change we made 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.599
 the four chords of two follow others 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.340
 two measures of fa and then I arrived 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.069
 but so I end up with the milan I arrived 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.900
 by half-tone distance to the next 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.030
 degree that is the fourth grade as I touch 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.769
 the next grade played funk new moore and 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.329
 solomon because I want to get to the 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.400
 next beat that I'm still missing from 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.400
 fa seven by minute distance 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.930
 how do I play the next guayas compass 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.930
 the funk 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.220
 because because I want to get there again 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.800
 something we go back to the first grade but for 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.080
 half-tone distance gets the 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.550
 next compass with my sun 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.860
 here I already made a variant we said that 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.769
 You can also use second distances 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.890
 greater in this return to 27 I did my 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.580
 sun b flat next beat every time 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.769
 of 27 we go to the flat because I'm going to 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.230
 change to let go again I will get 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:08.000
 because the middle stay all in the sun 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.769
 so in me that is the sun chord 7 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.959
 I have a half-shift distance to 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.540
 return to fa 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:19.459
 re of moore because because again I 'm going to 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.780
 come back to 21 if flat 2 and here I have 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.810
 one small exception I made a small 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.700
 Repetitive pattern true 2 2 and 2 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.800
 but after that I 'm going to my charm 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.330
 at the end of the blues tour that is the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.520
 of remembered of sun 7 very well then 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.080
 after touching everything full already without 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.860
 stop without interrupting it so that 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.860
 we can listen 12 13 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.830
 ah 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.830
 ah 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.869
 very well then this also requires 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.219
 to practice you have to be practicing 

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:35.319
 you have to be looking for exploring 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:37.449
 sounds these are some of the things 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.459
 what can we do for a return of light 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.059
 I hope this video is useful for you 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:44.709
 and will wait soon in many more 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:46.509
 cello tutorials of other styles 

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.819
 I also invite you to visit the 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:51.309
 Facebook page that I have on the internet 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.259
 which is an alternative cello so you can 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:54.759
 search on facebook 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:58.080
 I can put there some other 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.080
 videos some other information
