00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:23.439
 and to the water to whom hello I am gala gonzález 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.320
 the new hurt locker of falabe I have 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.960
 26 years in Coruña but I have nine 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.820
 years in london living my family 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.430
 is dedicated to fashion 7 30 then 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.320
 it has always been a very present part 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.539
 in my life we played at home with the 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.210
 fabrics nothing made little dresses to 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.110
 my dolls everything that is absorbed 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.539
 unconsciously if everything has been left 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.920
 that knowledge there I always had the 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.989
 blog but I was with the university 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.780
 I was collaborating with them there were many 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.910
 things at the same time and as of 2010 I would 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.250
 take it more seriously and it was when he said that 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.350
 let's make bloggers just like 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.079
 such at the beginning I really had very 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.690
 few references 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.089
 there were some who helped us how 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.580
 take the pictures would not be jump and aleix 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.250
 for example what would be the court 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.049
 federer de eset the special one that we 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.060
 taught a bit how we should focus 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.220
 how we should take the pictures is 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.259
 fantastic that thanks to blogs and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.840
 social networks the monkey was able to 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.340
 democratize that is now accessible to 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.649
 almost everyone anywhere 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.420
 from the world we can all see what is 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.549
 puts someone the japan 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.850
 what another person in Peru puts that 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.850
 it's fantastic 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.510
 if we all have a secret dream all 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.130
 unite and show that today it does not matter 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.710
 where videos of all we can is super 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.130
 the most modern are the most with more 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.649
 waves 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.259
 the fashion for me is the letter of 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.600
 presentation to the world allows you to play 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.240
 to differentiate you because everyone in the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.159
 background we want to be different then to 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.730
 I think fashion is fantastic 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.500
 to express all of that 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.470
 what really inspires me to do 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.630
 the looks are from the movie I've 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.270
 seen the day before from the new 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.340
 musical group all everything influenced what 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.110
 is around me and has a great 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.150
 influence of the late 60's 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.700
 early 70s that if you leave 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.410
 favorite I play a lot for my state of 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.700
 Conference mood so much 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.720
 it is around me that I have 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.910
 lived in london that has enriched me 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.730
 much culturally insolvent 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.930
 eclectic domiciles because neither I 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 I know what it gives me in the morning 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.430
 bohemian is a relaxed line because I 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.100
 He likes to be comfortable with me no clothes 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.870
 like clothes that compels the mind is 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.370
 in a position that is not comfortable and that 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.470
 I think it's transmitted a lot through 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.300
 my blog dreamers present us these 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.970
 trends but really many 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.710
 people that we do not know in general how 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.630
 adapt them to our style then 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.030
 tried through the blog a bit and 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.090
 propose my personal idea not of how 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.920
 I would put it myself 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.660
 is from some woman like I hope that 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.220
 have the same needs that I have 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.480
 when I go to buy a store that 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.000
 really the clients to whom 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.400
 we need we want to be able to use it 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.030
 we all want to mix everything on the internet 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.950
 gives me that very real possibility but I see 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.930
 personal maybe on a catwalk every thing 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.180
 which is built in a super way 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.459
 meticulous and thought of street style is 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.840
 something much cooler what it requires 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.350
 no effort but that is the person 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.940
 how is the attitude 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.370
 for the next season I like 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.790
 much the idea of being able to mix patterns 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.940
 and prince very varied both tribal 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.250
 like the floral but for example not 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.900
 mix the two for that you have to 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.850
 remember that it can mix 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.250
 prince but not of the two families 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.480
 different 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.960
 I like it a lot, for example, you can 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.510
 mix a skirt had more 40 years with 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.110
 a cotton shirt I think it was 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.120
 for me the lilac blue ones would be key 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.670
 and clarito all the cakes that are 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.410
 green roses the green for example me 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.620
 it seems the ideal color this season 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.660
 also in the color lime limoncito 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.550
 yellow and now that you do not dare with the 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.890
 yellow that tastes with mustard is 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.950
 as well as a yellow more light I like 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.810
 much for example it was already a dress 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.200
 closed leather longer is the feet and 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.640
 add a blouse but big and 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.670
 rolled up because he breaks completely 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.969
 the scheme to have floral maybe 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:24.400
 I would put him in necklaces and necklaces maybe 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:25.930
 eye-catching but only unique color example 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.439
 Now that I have the sun I have put 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.569
 necklace for the necklace is black yes but no 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:33.400
 lends importance to the trend 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.710
 Olympic in the guard much with the 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.379
 hats now look super interesting already 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.330
 it 's time to run but there's 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:44.039
 steal from the boyfriend perhaps with his hair 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.039
 so more casual not so much 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.460
 an eternal tribal fits me better with the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.340
 hair maybe me that's where I would get a 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.870
 bunch of braids and I would play a little 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.940
 complete it that way but I would 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.890
 Many braided bracelets or wood or 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.140
 of meat or whatever x fit 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.560
 a little to the organic texture not of everything 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.560
 the cousin 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.260
 say how much that law works is 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.000
 really 24 hours a day but what 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.040
 you think in the morning is you look at the 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.900
 mobile emails 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.010
 what happened today that has happened in the world 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.010
 you are never disconnected
