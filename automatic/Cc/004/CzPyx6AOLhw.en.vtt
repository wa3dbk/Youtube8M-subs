that<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.240> from<00:01:18.420> another<00:01:18.509> website<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.799> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that was from another website but I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
that was from another website but I
thought<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.189> would<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.460> add<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.330> bit<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
thought I would just add a little bit to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.899 
thought I would just add a little bit to
it<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> show<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.780> actually<00:01:24.780> how<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.909> so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it and show you actually how to do it so

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.969 
it and show you actually how to do it so
you've<00:01:27.180> probably<00:01:27.750> gotten<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.470> craft

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you've probably gotten all your craft

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.950 
you've probably gotten all your craft
supplies<00:01:29.400> we're<00:01:30.180> gonna<00:01:30.329> take<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> cardboard

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
supplies we're gonna take the cardboard

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
supplies we're gonna take the cardboard
cover<00:01:31.290> off<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.790> camera<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:35.100> have

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
cover off of this camera and you have

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
cover off of this camera and you have
your<00:01:35.939> template<00:01:36.450> done<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.990> cut<00:01:37.229> out<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.590> ready

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
your template done and cut out and ready

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
your template done and cut out and ready
the<00:01:38.509> easiest<00:01:39.509> way<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:42.200> actually

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the easiest way to do this I actually

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.190 
the easiest way to do this I actually
use<00:01:43.770> double<00:01:44.340> stick<00:01:44.640> tape<00:01:44.750> instead<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.869> glue

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
use double stick tape instead of glue

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.560 
use double stick tape instead of glue
because<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.220> works<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.909> well<00:01:47.939> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
because it works just as well it's

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.010 
because it works just as well it's
permanent<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.799> sticks<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:51.479> don't<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
permanent it sticks you don't have to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.010 
permanent it sticks you don't have to
wait<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> dry<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.280> doesn't<00:01:53.670> use<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:54.119> or

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
wait for it to dry it doesn't use out or

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.740 
wait for it to dry it doesn't use out or
get<00:01:55.200> all<00:01:55.290> over<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.130> messy<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.659> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
get all over it's not messy and then I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.840 
get all over it's not messy and then I
use<00:01:57.899> regular<00:01:58.409> tape<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.130> hold<00:01:59.159> things<00:01:59.610> in

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
use regular tape just to hold things in

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.700 
use regular tape just to hold things in
place<00:01:59.909> until<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> double<00:02:01.530> stick

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
place until I get to the double stick

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.950 
place until I get to the double stick
tape<00:02:01.740> part<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.540> we're<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> do

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
tape part so what we're going to do

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.899 
tape part so what we're going to do
first<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.380> take<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> template<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.460> we're

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
first is take the template and we're

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.630 
first is take the template and we're
going<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> fold<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.049> creases<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.489> way

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
going to fold on the creases so this way

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.430 
going to fold on the creases so this way
everything<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.179> folded<00:02:09.750> where<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.080> needs<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
everything is folded where it needs to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
everything is folded where it needs to
be<00:02:10.530> folded<00:02:11.069> ahead<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.700> time<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.150> makes<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.569> lot

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
be folded ahead of time it makes a lot

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.130 
be folded ahead of time it makes a lot
easier<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.260> work<00:02:13.410> with

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
easier to work with

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.619 
easier to work with
so<00:02:15.140> we're<00:02:15.409> going<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.709> take<00:02:15.920> these<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:16.629> fold

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629
