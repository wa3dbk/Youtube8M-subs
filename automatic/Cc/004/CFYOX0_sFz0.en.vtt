00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
got some money melts in here this is

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.910 
got some money melts in here this is
manuals<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.719> I<00:01:38.460> believe

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.840 

just<00:01:43.920> some<00:01:44.070> wired<00:01:44.280> stuff<00:01:44.730> I<00:01:44.850> guess<00:01:49.850> not

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
just some wired stuff I guess not

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:58.460 
just some wired stuff I guess not
obviously<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.360> cable<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:57.110> let's<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.200> ahead<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
obviously a cable and let's go ahead and

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.120 
obviously a cable and let's go ahead and
see<00:01:58.650> this<00:01:58.800> case<00:01:59.010> one<00:01:59.190> second<00:02:00.860> all<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:01.980> so

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
see this case one second all right so

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.210 
see this case one second all right so
this<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.700> case<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.450> pretty<00:02:03.660> much

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
this is the case it's pretty much

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.320 
this is the case it's pretty much
standard<00:02:05.220> regular<00:02:05.460> nothing<00:02:05.970> special<00:02:06.180> about

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
standard regular nothing special about

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.130 
standard regular nothing special about
the<00:02:06.510> sides<00:02:06.720> or<00:02:06.900> anything<00:02:08.390> but<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.540> front<00:02:09.810> here

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the sides or anything but the front here

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.710 
the sides or anything but the front here
I<00:02:10.400> like<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.550> front<00:02:11.790> because<00:02:11.970> it's

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
I like the front because it's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.390 
I like the front because it's
pitch-black<00:02:13.080> right<00:02:13.500> now<00:02:13.650> but<00:02:13.920> once<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> turn

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
pitch-black right now but once you turn

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.610 
pitch-black right now but once you turn
on<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.550> computer<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.870> two<00:02:16.080> nice<00:02:16.320> big
