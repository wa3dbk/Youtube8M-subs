 friends autocosmos.com how are my 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.209
 name is rubén today I like it 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.599
 greet them today we are in the 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:19.519
 launch event of infiniti 70 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.980
 2016 in puerto rico and we are going to tell you 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:26.539
 10 things you should know about this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.539
 new luxury sedan of the Japanese firm 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.800
 The first thing you need to know is that you do not 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.379
 it is a completely model 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.590
 we already knew it in the market 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.809
 this came in the year of 2011 and as 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.149
 infiniti m just changed the 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.970
 nomenclature and now it's called cv-70 is 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.100
 the flagship sedan of the brand the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.010
 bigger luxurious sedan and what 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.839
 we have here is a small 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.050
 aesthetic update to put it at 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.100
 day with his brothers of range like 50 x 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.100
 70 etc. etcetera 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.839
 the main change can be observed in 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.580
 the front we find this new 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.030
 double bow brand grill 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.850
 new headlights and fog lights lights 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.290
 position all in LED technology 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.700
 According to the brand, it was also improved 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.259
 much the behavior of the dynamics 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.619
 thanks to the incorporation of 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.030
 hoppers and elements below 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.100
 vehicle that help you have a lot 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.100
 better aerodynamic flow in fact the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.009
 Penetration coefficient is 0.27 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.700
 very very good if we consider a sedan 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700
 of these proportions 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.009
 the back also has some 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.600
 changes the trunk lid is new and 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.610
 the design has changed a little before 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.880
 it was flatter and ended like a point 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.200
 now it is a little more fallen what 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.350
 It also gives an appearance a 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.909
 a little more like coupé to the vehicle 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.299
 the taillights are now from leds and 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.380
 also this design changed slightly 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.920
 obviously the fascia was also 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.920
 redesigned 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.810
 arrives with two 3.7 v6 engines 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.670
 liters with 330 horses and 270 foot-pounds 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.230
 of torque while at the top of 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.140
 range we found a v8 of 5.6 liters with 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.890
 420 horses and 417 foot-pounds of torque 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.360
 the transmission is automatic seven 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.050
 speeds with four modes 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.050
 normal driving eco sport and no out 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.010
 one of the most solid arguments of 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.620
 infiniti cv-70 is all the equipment 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.140
 of security offered in addition to the already 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.750
 forced to bs in six airbags the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.860
 stability and traction control 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.500
 we find other interesting elements 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.620
 as 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.420
 the frontal collision sensor that is 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.460
 able to intervene ie stop if 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.410
 blind spot sensor is necessary 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.080
 also with intervention capacity 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.940
 to say well a vehicle in the part 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.150
 where we can not see with the mirrors 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.860
 a visual and acoustic alert is activated 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.330
 in the vehicle if we still do not 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.520
 case 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.130
 the vehicle is capable of slowing down we have 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.690
 also rail abandon sensor with 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.360
 intervention capacity what do you want 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.300
 say that if we get distracted if we're 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.250
 for you go out of our lane 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.380
 involuntarily the vehicle goes 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.970
 monitoring the lines of the road 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.100
 and in any case he is also capable of 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.620
 return to the path finally 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.560
 We have a prevention system 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.290
 rear collision let's say let's go 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.800
 coming out of a parking drawer 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.230
 and the vehicle is monitoring if it comes 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.330
 a vehicle of some other unit 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.170
 sides and in any case it is necessary 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.170
 it can also slow down 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.970
 inside we find inserts of 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.319
 wood in Japanese ash wood genuine 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.220
 that also for the top version of the range 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.519
 that is, the v8 is treated with a layer 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.180
 of silver dust that gives it a 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:08.220
 shine much more intense than it 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.220
 we could find in the 6 version 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.150
 As a good luxury sedan we find 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.530
 all the necessary amenities for 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.739
 make travel as comfortable 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.980
 relaxed possible we have flyer with 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.970
 heating seats that can be 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.950
 heat and cool that is wonderful 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.710
 air conditioner with two seating areas and 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.710
 ruffles covered in leather sunroof 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.130
 The Bose system deserves special mention 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.670
 audio with 15 speakers that has this 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.230
 function I did not rest link 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.820
 means that it is issuing a 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.160
 often all the time to 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.150
 counteract the noises that filter 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.580
 of the outside 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.710
 this we 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.110
 to a much better quality of gear 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.039
 refined and comfortable that in a 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.039
 traditional vehicle 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.030
 obviously has a camera 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.750
 reversal that warns us of the 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.640
 trajectories that goes 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.950
 take the vehicle depending on how 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.950
 we go the direction however we have 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.470
 also this 360 degree view that 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.270
 thanks to a front camera two cameras 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.760
 located in each side mirror and the 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.920
 rear camera allows us to create a 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.960
 perspective of everything that is 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.910
 around the vehicle this is very useful 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.090
 for parking maneuvers at low 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.460
 speed to avoid scrapes on wheels 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.220
 or 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.310
 small blows both forward and 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.310
 behind 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.850
 the infiniti 70 2016 arrives in our country 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:53.210
 with a price for the v6 version of 759 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:59.780
 900 while for the top of the range the 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:02.300
 v8 is 900 49 900 the strategy of the 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.520
 brand is then locate your vehicle a 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.080
 little below the prices of the 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.570
 German sedans to 6 class and 5 series with 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.430
 which competes offering also in 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.000
 all motor cases a lot more 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.000
 powerful
