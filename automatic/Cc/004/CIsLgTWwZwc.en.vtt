bit different in terms of design so
actually<00:00:19.350> before<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.830> jump<00:00:20.130> inside<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.490> box

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
thing that isn't on the G watch that is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.539 
thing that isn't on the G watch that is
of<00:01:08.939> course<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.840> heart<00:01:10.140> rate<00:01:10.350> monitor<00:01:10.549> that

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
of course the heart rate monitor that

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.399 
of course the heart rate monitor that
lives<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> underside<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.049> will<00:01:13.260> give

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
lives on the underside that will give

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.740 
lives on the underside that will give
you<00:01:13.530> real-time<00:01:14.060> data<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.420> heart<00:01:15.600> rate

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
obviously there's also the exposure

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.179 
obviously there's also the exposure
there<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.540> charging<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.140> single<00:01:19.770> button<00:01:19.979> as

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
there for charging a single button as

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.700 
there for charging a single button as
well<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> microphone<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.170> you've<00:01:22.470> got

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that is of course the fact that we now

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.060 
that is of course the fact that we now
have<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.119> Android<00:01:30.630> wear<00:01:30.840> app<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> App

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
to make sure that this doesn't just work

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.670 
to make sure that this doesn't just work
with<00:01:40.979> Galaxy<00:01:41.369> phones<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.880> first<00:01:42.560> let's<00:01:43.560> go

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
with Galaxy phones but first let's go

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
with Galaxy phones but first let's go
ahead<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.070> check<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.579> other<00:01:44.850> components

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
ahead and check out the other components

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.149 
ahead and check out the other components
inside<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.750> box<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.829> microUSB

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
inside the box so it's a microUSB

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.969 
inside the box so it's a microUSB
charger<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.630> here<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.350> charging

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
charger and here is the charging

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.260 
charger and here is the charging
contraption<00:01:51.320> wow<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> tiny<00:01:53.040> little

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
contraption wow this is a tiny little

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.389 
contraption wow this is a tiny little
dock<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:55.110> upside<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> fact<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
dock the upside here is the fact that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.639 
dock the upside here is the fact that
you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.030> keep<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.360> attached<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.530> you're

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
you can keep it attached so if you're

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.760 
you can keep it attached so if you're
traveling<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.670> one<00:01:59.909> complete<00:02:00.240> package

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
traveling it can be one complete package

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.069 
traveling it can be one complete package
downside<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.360> got<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> make<00:02:03.570> sure<00:02:03.719> you've<00:02:03.869> got

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
downside you got to make sure you've got

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.350 
downside you got to make sure you've got
that<00:02:04.110> clip<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.640> not<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.850> like

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that clip in so it's not just like

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.969 
that clip in so it's not just like
dropping<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.020> your<00:02:07.170> nightstand<00:02:07.680> which<00:02:07.860> is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
dropping it on your nightstand which is

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.650 
dropping it on your nightstand which is
what<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.340> hoping<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.300> wish<00:02:09.479> they

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
what I was hoping for really wish they

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.839 
what I was hoping for really wish they
went<00:02:09.840> with<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> magnetic<00:02:10.679> clasp<00:02:11.250> or<00:02:11.550> something

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
went with a magnetic clasp or something

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.740 
went with a magnetic clasp or something
along<00:02:12.030> those<00:02:12.090> lines

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
along those lines

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.180 
along those lines
instead<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.710> now<00:02:13.800> I'm<00:02:13.920> going<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.070> go

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
instead of this so now I'm going to go

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.060 
instead of this so now I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.700> pair<00:02:15.330> these<00:02:15.930> two<00:02:16.170> devices<00:02:16.470> here

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
ahead and pair these two devices here

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.820 
ahead and pair these two devices here
using<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.940> Android<00:02:18.450> wear<00:02:18.690> application<00:02:19.470> click

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
using the Android wear application click

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.920 
using the Android wear application click
up<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.190> corner<00:02:20.550> here<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:20.910> pair<00:02:21.540> with<00:02:21.750> a

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
up in the corner here and pair with a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.780 
up in the corner here and pair with a
new<00:02:22.260> wearable<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.190> now<00:02:23.340> we've<00:02:23.520> hit<00:02:23.610> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
new wearable so now we've hit the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.700 
new wearable so now we've hit the
downloading<00:02:24.480> stage<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.230> probably

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
downloading stage and this is probably

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.070 
downloading stage and this is probably
the<00:02:25.980> longest<00:02:26.280> part<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.210> setup<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.930> both

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
the longest part of the setup so both

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.600 
the longest part of the setup so both
devices<00:02:28.380> have<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.770> number<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.100> different<00:02:29.250> watch

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
devices have a number of different watch

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.100 
devices have a number of different watch
faces<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.510> choose<00:02:30.690> from<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.080> have

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
faces that you can choose from we have

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.220 
faces that you can choose from we have
obviously<00:02:31.830> determined<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.330> gear<00:02:33.959> live

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
obviously determined that the gear live

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.980 
obviously determined that the gear live
will<00:02:34.620> function<00:02:34.950> with<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.730> non<00:02:36.030> galaxy<00:02:36.750> device

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
will function with a non galaxy device

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.410 
will function with a non galaxy device
so<00:02:37.530> lastly<00:02:37.860> let's<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:38.340> do<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.820> physical

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
so lastly let's just do a physical

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.770 
so lastly let's just do a physical
comparison<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.440> both<00:02:41.220> watches<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.970> little<00:02:42.690> bit

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
comparison of both watches a little bit

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.170 
comparison of both watches a little bit
different<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.290> terms<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.709> design<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.670> have<00:02:44.850> a

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
different in terms of design you have a

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.530 
different in terms of design you have a
completely<00:02:45.720> black<00:02:46.380> surface<00:02:46.950> here<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.330> G

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
completely black surface here on the G

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.690 
completely black surface here on the G
watch<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.709> gear<00:02:49.890> live<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.310> have<00:02:50.489> this

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
watch and on the gear live you have this

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.930 
watch and on the gear live you have this
metallic<00:02:51.060> ring<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.750> outside<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.850> be

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
metallic ring on the outside but to be

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.150 
metallic ring on the outside but to be
honest<00:02:54.209> with<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.480> there's<00:02:55.020> probably<00:02:55.500> fewer

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
honest with you there's probably fewer

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.710 
honest with you there's probably fewer
differences<00:02:56.430> than<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.150> are<00:02:57.270> similarities

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
differences than there are similarities

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.110 
differences than there are similarities
with<00:02:58.470> these<00:02:58.620> two<00:02:58.800> devices<00:02:59.070> after<00:02:59.520> all<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.820> OS

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
with these two devices after all the OS

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.820 
with these two devices after all the OS
is<00:03:00.150> identical<00:03:00.810> at<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.290> moment<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> few

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
is identical at the moment a few

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.220 
is identical at the moment a few
different<00:03:02.130> watch<00:03:02.280> faces<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.810> course<00:03:04.050> a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
different watch faces and of course a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.160 
different watch faces and of course a
slightly<00:03:04.709> larger<00:03:05.040> battery<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.720> G<00:03:06.989> watch

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
slightly larger battery on the G watch

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.350 
slightly larger battery on the G watch
and<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:08.280> slightly<00:03:08.550> different<00:03:08.730> display

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
and a slightly different display

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.150 
and a slightly different display

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
technology one of them is old ad the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.030 
technology one of them is old ad the
other<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.610> IPS<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.780> one<00:03:13.080> thing<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.320> will<00:03:13.500> say<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:14.010> I

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
other is IPS a one thing I will say is I

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.000 
other is IPS a one thing I will say is I
definitely<00:03:14.820> prefer<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:16.230> charging<00:03:16.890> cradle

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
definitely prefer the charging cradle

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.580 
definitely prefer the charging cradle
for<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.730> G<00:03:18.510> watch<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.959> that's<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.170> big<00:03:19.350> deal<00:03:19.530> to

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
for the G watch and that's a big deal to

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.840 
for the G watch and that's a big deal to
me<00:03:19.860> especially<00:03:20.070> if<00:03:20.430> it's<00:03:20.519> late<00:03:20.700> at<00:03:20.820> night

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850

you're<00:03:21.330> taking<00:03:21.630> your<00:03:21.750> watch<00:03:21.930> off<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.530> have

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
you're taking your watch off you have

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.620 
you're taking your watch off you have
this<00:03:22.769> beside<00:03:23.070> your<00:03:23.250> bed<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.700> don't<00:03:24.330> know<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.570> just

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
this beside your bed I don't know I just

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.570 
this beside your bed I don't know I just
like<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> seamless<00:03:25.380> sort<00:03:25.799> of<00:03:25.890> solution<00:03:26.340> so

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
like a seamless sort of solution so

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.250 
like a seamless sort of solution so
magnets<00:03:27.360> work<00:03:27.510> better<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:28.019> my<00:03:28.170> opinion

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
magnets work better in my opinion
