00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
these out there we go all right I think

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
these out there we go all right I think
she<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> main<00:00:55.199> general<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.219> deck<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
she is the main general for this deck is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
she is the main general for this deck is
away<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.820> boxes<00:01:00.570> big

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
away and then we have the boxes big

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.219 
away and then we have the boxes big
boxes<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.239> good<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.840> don't<00:01:04.019> have

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
boxes and that's good if you don't have

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.750 
boxes and that's good if you don't have
a<00:01:04.260> sleeve<00:01:04.619> detect<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.280> eventually<00:01:05.519> is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
a sleeve detect but eventually is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.950 
a sleeve detect but eventually is
probably<00:01:06.000> will<00:01:06.180> become<00:01:06.450> sleep<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.840> most

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
probably will become sleep for most

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.800 
probably will become sleep for most
people<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.670> those<00:01:08.670> might<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.060> met<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.450> being

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

and let's get to the deck see Emily

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
and let's get to the deck see Emily
looks<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> little<00:01:22.470> generals<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:22.860> not

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
looks like the little generals are not

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
looks like the little generals are not
foil<00:01:23.400> which<00:01:24.020> sort<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.140> bummer<00:01:25.369> but<00:01:26.369> just

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
foil which sort of a bummer but just

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.190
