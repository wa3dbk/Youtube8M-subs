put<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.799> test<00:01:58.890> they<00:01:59.219> first

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
put that to the test they first

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.620 
put that to the test they first
recommend<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.030> wipe<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.299> off<00:02:00.420> with

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
recommend that you wipe it off with

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749 
recommend that you wipe it off with
their<00:02:00.750> provided<00:02:01.229> cleaning<00:02:01.500> cloth<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:02.579> rid<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
their provided cleaning cloth get rid of

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.999 
their provided cleaning cloth get rid of
all<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.909> these<00:02:03.119> smudges<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> fingerprints<00:02:04.469> so

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
all of these smudges and fingerprints so

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
all of these smudges and fingerprints so
that<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> adhesive<00:02:05.369> sticks<00:02:05.969> really<00:02:06.119> well

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
that the adhesive sticks really well

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.419 
that the adhesive sticks really well
so<00:02:06.659> we're<00:02:06.750> gonna<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.110> first<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
so we're gonna do that first so like I

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.260 
so we're gonna do that first so like I
said<00:02:08.610> earlier<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.000> gonna<00:02:09.090> be<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
said earlier this is gonna be a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.669 
said earlier this is gonna be a
real-world<00:02:09.509> installation<00:02:10.229> test<00:02:10.500> we're<00:02:10.619> gonna

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
real-world installation test we're gonna

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.740 
real-world installation test we're gonna
way<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> start<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> timer

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
way to start the timer

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.980 
way to start the timer
long<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.170> actually<00:02:12.200> takes<00:02:12.680> us<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.900> know

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
long it actually takes us to you know

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.260 
long it actually takes us to you know
and<00:02:15.230> start<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.560> stick<00:02:15.740> rats<00:02:15.950> case<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.610> time<00:02:17.150> has

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and start a stick rats case so time has

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.060 
and start a stick rats case so time has
already<00:02:17.360> started<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.350> keep<00:02:18.650> mine<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.890> am

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
already started and keep mine I am

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.740 
already started and keep mine I am
fast-forwarding<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:19.940> video<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.540> have

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
fast-forwarding this video so you have

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.590 
fast-forwarding this video so you have
to<00:02:20.840> watch<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.200> entire<00:02:21.850> tippy<00:02:22.850> tubes<00:02:23.120> almost

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
to watch the entire tippy tubes almost

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.620 
to watch the entire tippy tubes almost
said<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.610> entire<00:02:25.850> time<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.330> install

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
said it to the entire time to install

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.260 
said it to the entire time to install
the<00:02:27.050> case<00:02:27.460> and<00:02:28.460> just<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:28.970> know<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.150> might

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
the case and just so you know you might

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.390 
the case and just so you know you might
want<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.450> visit<00:02:29.600> slick<00:02:30.020> reps<00:02:30.230> calm<00:02:30.620> they<00:02:31.190> have

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
want to visit slick reps calm they have

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.220 
want to visit slick reps calm they have
a<00:02:31.430> variety<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:32.180> cases<00:02:32.420> for<00:02:32.780> all<00:02:32.900> different

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
a variety of cases for all different

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.350 
a variety of cases for all different
type<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.410> devices<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.250> they're<00:02:34.940> pretty<00:02:35.180> cool

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
type of devices and they're pretty cool

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.330 
type of devices and they're pretty cool
actually<00:02:35.840> um<00:02:35.990> especially<00:02:36.350> like<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.100> said<00:02:37.250> this

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
actually um especially like I said this

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.550 
actually um especially like I said this
is<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.610> carbon<00:02:38.060> series<00:02:38.390> right<00:02:38.570> here<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.990> they

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
is the carbon series right here and they

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.310 
is the carbon series right here and they
have<00:02:39.740> about<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.340> want<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.730> say<00:02:40.960> let's<00:02:41.960> see<00:02:42.020> it's

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
have about I want to say let's see it's

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.520 
have about I want to say let's see it's
gonna<00:02:42.410> go<00:02:42.710> there<00:02:42.830> now<00:02:43.010> with<00:02:43.280> 1<00:02:43.520> 2<00:02:43.820> 3<00:02:44.090> 4<00:02:44.480> 5<00:02:44.720> 6<00:02:44.930> 7<00:02:45.410> 8

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
gonna go there now with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.980 
gonna go there now with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:02:45.709> 10<00:02:46.070> it's<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.459> look<00:02:46.940> about<00:02:47.060> 12<00:02:47.300> different

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
9 10 it's like a look about 12 different

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.949 
9 10 it's like a look about 12 different
type<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:48.980> cases<00:02:49.400> in<00:02:49.550> the<00:02:49.670> carbon<00:02:50.090> series<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:50.840> be

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
type of cases in the carbon series so be

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.780 
type of cases in the carbon series so be
sure<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.110> check<00:02:51.230> those<00:02:51.500> out<00:02:51.650> but<00:02:52.220> if<00:02:52.550> you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
sure to check those out but if you

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.520 
sure to check those out but if you
nitrogen<00:02:53.300> in<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.420> carbon<00:02:53.750> style<00:02:54.020> cases<00:02:54.380> they

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
nitrogen in the carbon style cases they

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.760 
nitrogen in the carbon style cases they
have<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:55.270> ton<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.440> different<00:02:57.440> types<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.650> cases

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
have a ton of different types of cases

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.790 
have a ton of different types of cases
and<00:02:58.070> raps<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.790> choose<00:02:59.000> from<00:02:59.380> okay<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:00.440> here<00:03:00.709> we

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
and raps to choose from okay so here we

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.530 
and raps to choose from okay so here we
are<00:03:00.860> we<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:01.040> put<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.430> last<00:03:01.610> piece<00:03:01.940> on<00:03:02.300> which

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
are we just put the last piece on which

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.520 
are we just put the last piece on which
is<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.810> actual<00:03:03.260> case<00:03:03.560> itself<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.310> main<00:03:05.150> piece

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
is the actual case itself the main piece

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.500 
is the actual case itself the main piece
and<00:03:06.820> there<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:07.940> have<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.090> took<00:03:08.390> us

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
and there you have it took us

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.800 
and there you have it took us
approximately<00:03:08.630> four<00:03:09.290> minutes<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:10.480> 53<00:03:11.480> 52

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
approximately four minutes and 53 52

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.160 
approximately four minutes and 53 52
seconds<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.920> install<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:14.090> case<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.630> here<00:03:15.050> it

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
seconds to install that case and here it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.509 
seconds to install that case and here it
is<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:15.620> how<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.860> looks<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.160> looks<00:03:16.340> really

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
is this is how it looks and looks really

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.210 
is this is how it looks and looks really
really<00:03:16.790> good<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.180> mind<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.930> did<00:03:18.530> this<00:03:19.100> is

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
really good and mind you I did this is

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.570 
really good and mind you I did this is
my<00:03:19.340> first<00:03:19.580> time<00:03:19.730> trying<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.120> do<00:03:20.300> this<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:21.709> I

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
my first time trying to do this so and I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.949 
my first time trying to do this so and I
got<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.150> got<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.450> on<00:03:23.540> there<00:03:23.630> pretty<00:03:23.870> good

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
got I got it on there pretty good

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.680 
got I got it on there pretty good
actually<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:25.100> looks<00:03:25.250> pretty<00:03:25.310> good<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.940> I'm

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
actually it looks pretty good and I'm

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.870 
actually it looks pretty good and I'm
being<00:03:26.930> perfectly<00:03:27.140> honest<00:03:27.650> when<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:27.830> say<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:28.850> I

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
being perfectly honest when I say that I

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.360 
being perfectly honest when I say that I
was<00:03:29.209> pretty<00:03:29.450> easy<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.930> install<00:03:30.170> now<00:03:30.950> let's<00:03:31.220> see

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
was pretty easy to install now let's see

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.479 
was pretty easy to install now let's see
how<00:03:31.820> you<00:03:32.570> know<00:03:32.690> how<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.620> pieces<00:03:33.950> actually<00:03:34.100> fit

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
how you know how the pieces actually fit

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.509 
how you know how the pieces actually fit
on<00:03:34.640> there<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:34.970> let's<00:03:35.150> try<00:03:35.360> out<00:03:35.480> my<00:03:36.110> touch<00:03:36.950> touch

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
on there so let's try out my touch touch

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
100% perfect but pretty much day they're

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.480 
100% perfect but pretty much day they're
pretty<00:04:21.410> good<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:21.620> mean<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:21.919> can<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.130> can't<00:04:22.340> see

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
pretty good I mean I can you can't see

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.279 
pretty good I mean I can you can't see
the<00:04:22.580> flaws<00:04:22.849> from<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.599> distance<00:04:23.930> but<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.140> look

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
the flaws from a distance but you look

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:25.530 
the flaws from a distance but you look
with<00:04:24.410> your<00:04:24.470> clothes<00:04:24.650> up<00:04:24.680> I<00:04:25.010> could<00:04:25.160> have<00:04:25.190> got<00:04:25.370> a

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
with your clothes up I could have got a

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.660 
with your clothes up I could have got a
a<00:04:25.570> little<00:04:25.840> bit<00:04:25.960> better<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.950> overall<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.460> have<00:04:27.550> to

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
a little bit better so overall I have to

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.550 
a little bit better so overall I have to
say<00:04:27.790> this<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.180> pretty<00:04:28.450> cool<00:04:28.720> case<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:29.200> is<00:04:29.530> a

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
say this is a pretty cool case it is a

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.200 
say this is a pretty cool case it is a
protective<00:04:30.040> case<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.910> doesn't<00:04:31.030> have<00:04:31.180> that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
protective case it doesn't have that

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.970 
protective case it doesn't have that
carbon<00:04:31.660> fibre<00:04:31.870> feel<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:32.530> it's<00:04:32.680> not<00:04:32.800> real

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
carbon fibre feel to it it's not real

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.190 
carbon fibre feel to it it's not real
carbon<00:04:33.370> fibre<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:34.150> does<00:04:34.330> have<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.630> feel<00:04:34.840> and

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
carbon fibre but does have the feel and

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.870 
carbon fibre but does have the feel and
I<00:04:35.650> guess<00:04:35.830> one<00:04:36.010> of<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.160> biggest<00:04:36.460> benefits<00:04:36.580> you

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
I guess one of the biggest benefits you

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.210 
I guess one of the biggest benefits you
get<00:04:37.030> with<00:04:37.150> this<00:04:37.210> case<00:04:37.420> is<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.870> style<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.560> lot<00:04:39.100> of

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
get with this case is the style a lot of

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.070 
get with this case is the style a lot of
cases<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.610> are<00:04:39.940> protective<00:04:40.660> don't<00:04:40.930> look

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
cases that are protective don't look

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.260 
cases that are protective don't look
that<00:04:41.230> good<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:42.160> one<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.670> can<00:04:42.880> pretty<00:04:43.180> much

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
that good this one you can pretty much

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.930 
that good this one you can pretty much
