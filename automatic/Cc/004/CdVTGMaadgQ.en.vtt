piles of specific amount of Monica Cobra

piles of specific amount of Monica Cobra
anti-venom<00:02:27.220> very<00:02:27.520> quickly

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.860 

one<00:02:59.069> thing<00:02:59.220> I've<00:02:59.370> learned<00:02:59.910> about<00:03:00.150> anaphylaxis

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
one thing I've learned about anaphylaxis

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.320 
one thing I've learned about anaphylaxis
and<00:03:01.380> snakebite<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.489> you're<00:03:02.670> allergic<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
and snakebite if you're allergic to the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.880 
and snakebite if you're allergic to the
venom<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.750> you're<00:03:03.900> going<00:03:04.170> into<00:03:04.319> anaphylaxis

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
venom and you're going into anaphylaxis

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.650 
venom and you're going into anaphylaxis
or<00:03:05.190> you're<00:03:05.310> having<00:03:05.430> an<00:03:05.640> allergic<00:03:05.760> reaction<00:03:06.060> as

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
or you're having an allergic reaction as

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.210 
or you're having an allergic reaction as
soon<00:03:07.110> as<00:03:07.260> they<00:03:07.410> start<00:03:07.709> giving<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.069> the

soon as they start giving you the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.770 
soon as they start giving you the
anti-venom<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.819> those<00:03:08.910> toxins<00:03:09.450> become

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
anti-venom and those toxins become

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.360 
anti-venom and those toxins become
neutralized<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.800> anaphylaxis

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
neutralized that that anaphylaxis

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.360 
neutralized that that anaphylaxis
dissipates<00:03:12.120> very<00:03:12.209> quickly<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.530> by<00:03:13.890> forming

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
dissipates very quickly so by forming

that complex bond between the antibody

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.290 
that complex bond between the antibody
and<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.819> toxin<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.690> changes<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.349> whole

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
and the toxin it changes the whole

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.360 
and the toxin it changes the whole
chemistry<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:22.530> histamine<00:03:23.130> thing

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.699 
system that causes that that reaction
I've<00:03:28.200> had<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.739> happen<00:03:29.420> in<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.630> past<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.170> had<00:03:31.680> a

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
monocle cobra bite not as severe as I

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.630 
monocle cobra bite not as severe as I
want<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.470> one<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.040> was<00:03:35.160> some<00:03:35.430> time<00:03:35.610> ago

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640

want that one but it was some time ago
and<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.000> was<00:03:36.120> right<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.110> edge<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.500> that

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
and I was right on the edge of that

dr. Macmillan to open the IV and I could
feel<00:03:43.200> in<00:03:43.470> fact<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.250> could<00:03:44.489> taste<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:45.000> try

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
feel in fact I could taste the try

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.680 
feel in fact I could taste the try
across<00:03:46.200> all<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.510> preservative<00:03:48.510> that

across all the the preservative that
they<00:03:48.870> put<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.230> anti-venom<00:03:49.799> and<00:03:50.130> as<00:03:50.580> soon

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
they put in that anti-venom and as soon

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.670 
they put in that anti-venom and as soon
as<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.940> felt<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.660> feeling<00:03:52.590> that

as I felt that that feeling that
anaphylaxis<00:03:53.220> just<00:03:53.670> dissipated<00:03:54.209> him<00:03:54.420> almost

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
anaphylaxis just dissipated him almost
