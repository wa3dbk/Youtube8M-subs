00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
get and it's actually about I'd say a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
get and it's actually about I'd say a
third<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> garden<00:00:48.329> probably<00:00:48.899> which<00:00:49.379> makes

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
third of the garden probably which makes

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.350 
third of the garden probably which makes
sense<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.250> expected<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:50.879> about<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
sense I was expected to get about a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.790 
sense I was expected to get about a
fifth<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> garden<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.649> much

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
fifth of the garden with as much

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.670 
fifth of the garden with as much
woodchips<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.579> had<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.780> was<00:00:54.960> guessing

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
woodchips as I had but that was guessing

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.160 
woodchips as I had but that was guessing
it<00:00:55.829> four<00:00:56.250> inches<00:00:56.640> thick<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.270> using<00:00:57.510> three

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it four inches thick and I'm using three

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.369 
it four inches thick and I'm using three
inches<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.000> I<00:01:00.000> got<00:01:00.329> further<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.079> then

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
inches here so I got further than I then

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.130 
inches here so I got further than I then
I<00:01:01.469> should<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.219> use<00:01:02.370> less<00:01:03.049> but<00:01:04.049> I'm

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
I should have because I use less but I'm

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.050 
I should have because I use less but I'm
gonna<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.680> ahead<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.979> mark<00:01:05.339> some<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.790> off

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.950 
is all being done with the bactine
method<00:01:46.710> using<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.040> wood<00:01:47.280> chips<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.729> such<00:01:48.000> but

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
method using the wood chips and such but

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050 
method using the wood chips and such but
the<00:01:49.079> reason<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.439> want<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> try<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.430> number

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
the reason we want to try this is number

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.639 
the reason we want to try this is number
one<00:01:51.299> we've<00:01:51.509> always<00:01:51.689> had<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> question<00:01:52.409> which

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
one we've always had the question which

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.190 
one we've always had the question which
one<00:01:52.890> was<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.310> better<00:01:53.810> which<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.020> was

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
one was really better which one was

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 
one was really better which one was
easier<00:01:55.649> better<00:01:56.280> production<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:57.090> those

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
easier better production all those

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260 
easier better production all those
questions<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.619> also<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.030> kind

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
questions but also because it just kind

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.639 
questions but also because it just kind
of<00:02:00.299> makes<00:02:00.479> sense<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:01.110> we're<00:02:01.259> talking<00:02:01.409> about

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
of makes sense when we're talking about

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.560 
of makes sense when we're talking about
back<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.100> eatin<00:02:02.430> we're<00:02:03.030> talking<00:02:03.360> about

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
back to eatin we're talking about

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.359 
back to eatin we're talking about
putting<00:02:03.899> nature<00:02:04.290> back<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> way<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
putting nature back the way that it that

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
putting nature back the way that it that
originally<00:02:05.969> was<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.180> way<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.540> God<00:02:06.719> put<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
originally was the way that God put it

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.680 
originally was the way that God put it
so<00:02:08.539> when<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.629> think<00:02:09.840> about<00:02:09.929> how

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
so when you think about how

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.430 
so when you think about how
plants<00:02:11.520> situated<00:02:12.520> in<00:02:12.640> nature<00:02:12.970> not<00:02:13.810> familiar

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
plants situated in nature not familiar

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.840 
plants situated in nature not familiar
with<00:02:14.590> them<00:02:14.740> being<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.130> rows<00:02:15.400> I'm<00:02:15.700> familiar

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
with them being in rows I'm familiar

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.350 
with them being in rows I'm familiar
with<00:02:16.090> them<00:02:16.270> being<00:02:16.510> in<00:02:16.690> clumps<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:19.120> kind<00:02:19.330> of

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
with them being in clumps so it kind of

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.910 
with them being in clumps so it kind of
makes<00:02:19.540> me<00:02:19.630> think<00:02:19.930> about<00:02:20.020> Square<00:02:20.740> Foot

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
makes me think about Square Foot

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.530 
makes me think about Square Foot
Gardening<00:02:20.980> how<00:02:21.520> we<00:02:21.580> plant<00:02:21.910> things<00:02:22.150> closer

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
Gardening how we plant things closer

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.820 
Gardening how we plant things closer
together

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
together

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.760 
together
they<00:02:24.730> almost<00:02:24.880> look<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:25.120> little<00:02:25.240> clumps<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.050> I

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
they almost look like little clumps so I

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.500 
they almost look like little clumps so I
kind<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.250> think<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.520> complements<00:02:28.150> back<00:02:28.330> to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
kind of think it complements back to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.410 
kind of think it complements back to
Eden<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.680> keeps<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.400> whole<00:02:30.550> process<00:02:30.880> in

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
Eden and and keeps the whole process in

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.020 
Eden and and keeps the whole process in
a<00:02:32.050> more<00:02:32.230> natural<00:02:32.710> way<00:02:32.740> but<00:02:33.610> we're<00:02:33.730> gonna<00:02:33.820> try

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
a more natural way but we're gonna try

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.000 
a more natural way but we're gonna try
both<00:02:34.300> because<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:35.320> don't<00:02:35.500> know<00:02:35.590> which<00:02:35.770> ways

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
both because we don't know which ways

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.600 
both because we don't know which ways
better<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:37.740> that's<00:02:38.740> what<00:02:38.950> we<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:39.220> we<00:02:39.580> have

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
better and that's what we have we have

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.280 
better and that's what we have we have
set<00:02:39.940> up<00:02:40.060> here<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.360> we<00:02:40.510> will<00:02:40.660> update<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.080> on

selection of organic seeds that I'm also
going<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:41.440> try<00:03:41.910> everything<00:03:42.910> else<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:43.870> just

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
going to try everything else that I just

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.949 
going to try everything else that I just
showed<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:45.040> probably<00:03:45.850> hybrid<00:03:46.630> because

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
showed you is probably hybrid because

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.830 
showed you is probably hybrid because
the<00:03:47.200> seed<00:03:47.380> packages<00:03:48.150> don't<00:03:49.150> mention<00:03:49.660> being

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
the seed packages don't mention being

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.730 
the seed packages don't mention being
organic<00:03:50.320> so<00:03:50.680> I'm<00:03:50.769> guessing<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.400> they're<00:03:52.150> not

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
but this is what we're gonna start off

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:17.750 
but this is what we're gonna start off
with

from four to eight plants in this little
square<00:05:03.940> foot<00:05:04.270> area<00:05:04.539> so<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.949> might<00:05:06.130> just<00:05:06.310> be<00:05:06.400> a

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
square foot area so it might just be a

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.950 
square foot area so it might just be a
lesson<00:05:06.729> learn<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.240> next<00:05:07.510> time<00:05:07.630> if<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:07.930> want

lesson learn that next time if we want

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.170 
lesson learn that next time if we want
to<00:05:08.289> do<00:05:08.380> this<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.830> we<00:05:08.889> do<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.430> planting<00:05:09.880> and

to do this that we do the planting and

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:29.310 
to do this that we do the planting and
then<00:05:10.479> put<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.870> woodchips<00:05:11.229> on<00:05:11.530> later<00:05:28.320> come

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
then put the woodchips on later come

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.110
