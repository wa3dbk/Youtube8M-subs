00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.770
 First of all, it is so unexpectedly nothing 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.650
 prepared therefore 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.719
 impromptu and I would put emphasis 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.179
 directly but we have already moved out 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.490
 the guys agreed about the cost that is 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.210
 more precisely rack and lock that's how 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.539
 two so far further, that is well understood 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.279
 the left side stand here is the only thing 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.619
 that only from here there is no secret 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.330
 there is never anything difficult but I would like 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.910
 note that the left side 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.870
 rack well let's say the lower tier in the lower 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.940
 sect different from china top h 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.250
 because here the left side 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.950
 correct that is, you can stand like this 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.450
 moving to the left and in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.230
 left-sided upstairs just 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.770
 respectively 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 all the way around 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.399
 intermediate position and call 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.710
 in this case, the right-sided rack 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.180
 have a top look up more by right 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.369
 2 no i base and frontal claims 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.140
 passing certain dates to me 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.630
 for example comfortable called your opinion and 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:22.460
 front desk why firstly 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.460
 except you skin first go away 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.290
 he already gave an example to more accurately pull out 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.140
 it's forever his left hand must too 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.050
 work from right side stand times 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.460
 become a currency hard you see here a 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.840
 now here and now let 's say here i am i 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.970
 I can get there and now I can 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 sector I have a hand record 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.990
 work it here and i will take it off 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.060
 will train that automatism that she 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.240
 works in simple general match you 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.700
 freeing this hand as a rule 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.710
 after one hit already return to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.810
 locking by the same hand is not an opportunity 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.400
 at high speed 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.810
 so much strength so here without it nowhere 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.300
 accordingly, of course, this one can 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.810
 by hand, that is, you can just go away 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.459
 why not and here if we are something 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.500
 want to make his hand necessarily 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.680
 should work stage 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.940
 2 moment 3 moment as for 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.450
 directly blog about which i 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.200
 mentioned 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.050
 I suggest just to bring my point 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.580
 block view and hard some and 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.880
 knocking down exactly this order 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.060
 why such a hand like a whip beats 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.100
 and believe me if we say an example 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.290
 kill the base of the palm is me them 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.490
 no weaker than the port further this one 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.430
 grip allows the hand to gobble up the glitch in 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.050
 the result of this here is valid if there is 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.330
 opportunity to catch you here in the evening 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:14.170
 it turns out who sticks stick affairs 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.650
 bad if you still have fixation 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.970
 here on the secondary 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.970
 respectively with all sorts of transitions and 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.290
 brush movements in my opinion they are 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:33.680
 the fastest up to the strength in them 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:40.580
 less but decent speed and power 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:45.110
 principle, only get well if there is 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.560
 what questions i understand i understand that 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.970
 There is a lot of information in general 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.870
 heard try digest can 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.570
 be someone like it yes just if 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.630
 I have someone to learn what could immediately 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.630
 I will show all this so much 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.630
 grateful
