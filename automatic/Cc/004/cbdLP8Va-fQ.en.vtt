00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.860 
have a real hard time setting your
teammate<00:03:21.030> up<00:03:21.180> for<00:03:21.360> an<00:03:21.420> easy<00:03:21.630> shot<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.790> also

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
teammate up for an easy shot and also

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.690 
teammate up for an easy shot and also
another<00:03:24.870> reason<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.260> think<00:03:25.320> point<00:03:25.709> guards<00:03:25.980> miss

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
another reason I think point guards miss

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.250 
another reason I think point guards miss
easy<00:03:27.000> shots<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.570> because<00:03:27.810> they've<00:03:27.959> got<00:03:28.140> that

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
easy shots is because they've got that

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.900 
easy shots is because they've got that
pass<00:03:28.500> first<00:03:28.769> mentality<00:03:29.130> they<00:03:29.640> think<00:03:29.820> I'm

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
pass first mentality they think I'm

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.039 
pass first mentality they think I'm
gonna<00:03:30.030> pass<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.239> I'm<00:03:30.510> gonna<00:03:30.600> pass<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.810> I'm

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
gonna pass it I'm gonna pass it I'm

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.720 
gonna pass it I'm gonna pass it I'm
gonna<00:03:31.170> pass<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.739> then<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.310> defensive

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
gonna pass it and then that defensive

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.520 
gonna pass it and then that defensive
player<00:03:32.910> never<00:03:33.150> commits<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.840> them<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.260> they

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
player never commits to them and they

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.170 
player never commits to them and they
think<00:03:34.590> oh<00:03:34.830> no<00:03:35.010> I'm<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.430> open<00:03:35.670> one<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.940> got<00:03:36.090> to

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
think oh no I'm the open one I got to

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.729 
think oh no I'm the open one I got to
shoot<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.660> then<00:03:36.959> they<00:03:37.080> hurry<00:03:37.350> up<00:03:37.530> some

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
shoot it and then they hurry up some

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.440 
shoot it and then they hurry up some
shot<00:03:37.980> at<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.190> last<00:03:38.430> second<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.299> usually

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
shot at the last second and it usually

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.090 
shot at the last second and it usually
doesn't<00:03:39.720> go<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.140> because<00:03:40.650> they<00:03:40.769> weren't<00:03:40.950> even

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
doesn't go in because they weren't even

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.430 
doesn't go in because they weren't even
thinking<00:03:41.340> about<00:03:41.730> shooting<00:03:42.049> it's<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.230> lot

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
thinking about shooting it's a lot

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.160 
thinking about shooting it's a lot
easier<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.310> turn<00:03:44.519> yourself<00:03:44.970> from<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.299> score<00:03:45.840> and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
easier to turn yourself from a score and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.080 
easier to turn yourself from a score and
then<00:03:46.560> realize<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.040> don't<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.430> pass<00:03:47.670> don't

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
then realize you don't have a pass don't

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.910 
then realize you don't have a pass don't
have<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.330> layup<00:03:48.570> -<00:03:49.110> all<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.380> sudden<00:03:49.650> being<00:03:49.799> a

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
have a layup - all of a sudden being a

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.210 
have a layup - all of a sudden being a
passer<00:03:50.459> than<00:03:50.940> vice<00:03:51.209> versa<00:03:51.620> it's<00:03:52.620> harder<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.100> go

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
passer than vice versa it's harder to go

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.380 
passer than vice versa it's harder to go
from<00:03:53.400> thinking<00:03:53.549> I'm<00:03:53.760> gonna<00:03:53.910> pass<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.269> I'm
