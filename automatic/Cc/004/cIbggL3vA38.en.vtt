which<00:00:30.619> generates<00:00:31.619> very<00:00:31.980> low<00:00:32.219> rolling

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
which generates very low rolling

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.600 
which generates very low rolling
resistance<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:34.050> order<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.590> able<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
resistance and in order to be able to to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.510 
resistance and in order to be able to to
test<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.630> device<00:00:37.129> as<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.250> can

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
test it we have this device as you can

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.790 
test it we have this device as you can
see<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.120> driven<00:00:39.660> electrical<00:00:40.440> dripping

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
see we have a driven electrical dripping

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.729 
see we have a driven electrical dripping
a<00:00:41.040> steel<00:00:41.399> drum<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:42.030> well<00:00:42.090> rather<00:00:42.629> huge<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.230> have

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
a steel drum as well rather huge to have

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.389 
a steel drum as well rather huge to have
a<00:00:43.770> rather<00:00:44.129> flat<00:00:44.550> ground<00:00:45.059> over<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
a rather flat ground over here and

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.190 
a rather flat ground over here and
actually<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.640> measure<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.390> power<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
actually we measure the power the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.650 
actually we measure the power the
electrical<00:00:49.739> power<00:00:49.920> needed<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:51.059> keep<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.449> tire

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
electrical power needed to keep the tire

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.220 
electrical power needed to keep the tire
rolling<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.559> certain<00:00:53.430> defined<00:00:53.879> speed<00:00:54.329> and

rolling and certain defined speed and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:16.520 
rolling and certain defined speed and
this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.559> according<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> resistance

you<00:01:21.719> can<00:01:21.750> find<00:01:22.219> and<00:01:23.219> forest<00:01:23.819> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> woods<00:01:26.000> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you can find and forest on the woods is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.999 
you can find and forest on the woods is
simulated<00:01:27.719> by<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.929> piece<00:01:28.469> of<00:01:28.649> metal<00:01:28.799> here

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
simulated by this piece of metal here

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.870 
simulated by this piece of metal here
and<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.969> falls<00:01:30.630> down<00:01:30.929> to<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> tire<00:01:31.679> and<00:01:32.250> we

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and this falls down to the tire and we

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.080 
and this falls down to the tire and we
rise<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.659> height<00:01:34.319> the<00:01:34.770> falling<00:01:35.130> height<00:01:35.340> step

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.229 
rise the height the falling height step
by<00:01:36.240> step<00:01:36.569> and<00:01:36.959> the<00:01:37.799> height<00:01:37.979> where<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.849> chip

really<00:01:39.659> gets<00:01:39.890> penetrate<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.000> snakebite

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
really gets penetrate is the snakebite

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.809 
really gets penetrate is the snakebite

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.039 
different tires and as you can see here
we<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.270> Plunkett's<00:02:03.270> 1.5

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
we have a kind of Plunkett's 1.5

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.449 
we have a kind of Plunkett's 1.5
millimeter<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:05.189> diameter<00:02:05.429> and<00:02:06.030> we<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:07.459> push

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
millimeter in diameter and we just push

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.170 
millimeter in diameter and we just push
the<00:02:08.910> plunger<00:02:09.590> through<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> tire<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.280> measure

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the plunger through the tire and measure

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.199 
the plunger through the tire and measure
the<00:02:12.389> force<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.870> needed<00:02:13.079> for<00:02:13.950> penetrating<00:02:14.880> the
