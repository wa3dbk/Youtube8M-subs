00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
to start off as a construction tool

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.960 
to start off as a construction tool
where<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.979> explore<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.640> deal<00:01:11.790> with

where you can explore and deal with
enemies<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:13.110> eventually<00:01:13.470> sort<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.070> turn

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
enemies and then eventually sort of turn

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.760 
enemies and then eventually sort of turn
its<00:01:14.640> way<00:01:14.820> into<00:01:15.000> an<00:01:15.210> MMO<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> mean<00:01:15.840> not<00:01:16.290> really

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
its way into an MMO I mean not really

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.499 
its way into an MMO I mean not really
because<00:01:16.920> EverQuest<00:01:17.700> next<00:01:17.759> landmark<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
because EverQuest next landmark and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.999 
because EverQuest next landmark and
EverQuest<00:01:18.869> next<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.200> always<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.560> separate

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
EverQuest next will always be separate

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
EverQuest next will always be separate
things<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.630> people<00:01:21.960> create<00:01:22.380> in

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
things but some of what people create in

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
things but some of what people create in
landmark<00:01:22.920> may<00:01:23.310> eventually<00:01:23.670> make<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.270> into<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
landmark may eventually make it into the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.929 
landmark may eventually make it into the
MMO<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.229> will<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.409> coming<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.909> probably<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
MMO that will be coming out probably a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.580 
MMO that will be coming out probably a
couple<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> years<00:01:27.390> down<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> road<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.259> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
couple of years down the road and I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.160 
couple of years down the road and I
think<00:01:28.829> that's<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.070> cool<00:01:29.220> idea<00:01:29.600> however<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.960> think

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
think that's a cool idea however I think

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.710 
think that's a cool idea however I think
we<00:01:31.560> should<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:32.040> dismiss<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.030> fact<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.450> as

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
we should not dismiss the fact that as

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.440 
we should not dismiss the fact that as
fantastic<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.920> could<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.450> there's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
fantastic as it could be there's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
fantastic as it could be there's
probably<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> whole<00:01:37.950> bunch

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
probably just going to be a whole bunch

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.760 
probably just going to be a whole bunch
of<00:01:38.369> phallic<00:01:38.820> symbols<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.320> we're

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
of phallic symbols and that's what we're

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.080 
of phallic symbols and that's what we're
going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.100> dealing<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> lot<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> people

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
going to be dealing with a lot of people

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850 
going to be dealing with a lot of people
creating<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.960> don't<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> bury<00:01:43.680> my

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
want to support the scene but you're

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.880 
want to support the scene but you're
just<00:05:11.430> looking<00:05:12.120> out<00:05:12.210> for<00:05:12.390> yourself<00:05:12.890> yeah
