00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.820
 Warwick was a man who was once respected for his ability to find a human subject for the most terrible scientific research. 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.320
 His ambition drank a dangerous potion to turn into an unstoppable human hunter when he exceeded his physical limits. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.060
 But the new power had a heavy price ... 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.480
 Warwick worked as a supplier of human subjects in Zaun before changing 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.620
 Famous for his sly methods and ruthless determination 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.740
 People used to treat him with fear and respect 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.160
 If his reputation has increased, the demands have also increased 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.620
 Customers were buying more rare and dangerous samples, and they wanted them to be brought more quickly. 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 Warwick needed a force to break the human body with limits to meet the demands 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.760
 Singed old friend for it, he developed a very strong formula on him 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.240
 3 of the materials needed to make the potion were very important; 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.160
 Shadow Islands Silver 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.260
 Balefire is a giant wolf female and the blood of a divine being 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.640
 Warwick found his first 2 points easily, but he seemed to be 3 times harder 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.480
 She went to Ionia to trap a creature believed to be the child of the stars. 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.140
 But Soraka realized Warwick's plan and repelled him with powerful spells. 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.380
 Unable to overcome this failure, Warwick returned to Singed with disability and fury 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.240
 He wanted the potion the chemist couldn't finish yet. 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.640
 Singed warns him that he doesn't know what will happen if he drinks the potion 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 Warwick didn't listen to his friend's warning 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.920
 The Elixir turned him into a wolf and a human being. 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.000
 Gives raw strength and sharper senses 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.840
 Very pleased, Warwick immediately began testing his new strength 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.240
 His instincts became sharper day by day, but his human side became so blind 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 He could feel his control 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.340
 Although he was able to capture his prey every time 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 often could not bring alive 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.500
 Now, his mind is trying to get Soraka's blood to stabilize his transformation before he is fully surrendered to animalistic instincts.
