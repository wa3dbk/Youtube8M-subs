00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
stealthily and there's this is this

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.099 
stealthily and there's this is this
stuff<00:00:57.809> way<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.440> fun<00:00:59.870> skipping<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> low

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
stuff way and it's fun skipping the low

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.900 
stuff way and it's fun skipping the low
times<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> 360<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
times because this is on the 360 and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.320 
times because this is on the 360 and
that<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.480> about<00:01:03.750> maybe<00:01:04.610> 30<00:01:05.610> seconds<00:01:06.150> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that was about maybe 30 seconds of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.130 
that was about maybe 30 seconds of
footage<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.560> pointless<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.080> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
footage that was pointless so now you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.830 
footage that was pointless so now you
just<00:01:10.560> need<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.130> roll<00:01:11.400> around<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:12.479> no

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
just need to roll around here no

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
just need to roll around here no
actually<00:01:13.439> after<00:01:13.740> all<00:01:13.860> even<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.520> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
actually after all even actually have to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.590 
actually after all even actually have to
be<00:01:15.000> sneaking<00:01:15.509> either<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:17.210> mean<00:01:18.210> if<00:01:18.450> you're

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
be sneaking either but I mean if you're

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.109 
be sneaking either but I mean if you're
sneaking<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.229> does<00:01:19.549> increase<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.909> speed

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
sneaking it does increase your speed

extra two questions you ask them like

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.600 
extra two questions you ask them like
giving<00:01:42.780> more<00:01:43.049> strength<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:44.040> somehow<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
giving more strength to like somehow a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.590 
giving more strength to like somehow a
breakout<00:01:47.390> but<00:01:48.390> yeah<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.600> interestingly

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
breakout but yeah so interestingly

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.980 
breakout but yeah so interestingly
enough<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:53.220> follower<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.540> you're

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
invisible it appears that the game also

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.469 
invisible it appears that the game also
thinks<00:01:59.490> your<00:01:59.610> followers<00:02:00.119> invisible<00:02:00.979> because
