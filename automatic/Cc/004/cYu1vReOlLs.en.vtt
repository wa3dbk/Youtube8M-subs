 I want to share with you the news company 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.000
 faberlik and also voice your request 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.250
 but perhaps I'll start asking me 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.400
 a very large number of consultants 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.130
 there are more than 1000 of them and also a lot to me 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.100
 the number of viewers and I am very pleased 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.410
 and all my questions are all my consultants 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.690
 and all the viewers of the channel that they have 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.449
 arises they tend to try them 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.920
 send me a PM on the social network and such 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.339
 way a large number accumulates 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.739
 questions that remain unanswered 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.260
 besides work i also have and 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.359

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.210

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.260
 a large number of questions accumulate 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.300
 unanswered and as I want to answer 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.420
 for all your questions I want to be 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.140
 as much as possible to you and therefore at me 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.150

 I have a little followers 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.440
 a group of only 300 people but in 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.660
 time before I most probably 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.490
 two or three years later she started doing it 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.350
 abandoned now I resumed again 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.660

 getting much faster and more likely 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.870
 many consultants are spinning in their heads 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.760
 most identical questions and my 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.580
 the answer to your question in specially 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.210
 created themes in groups in social networks 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.380
 they will help to give an answer to others 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.570
 consultant to other subscribers because 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.040
 what will they read these answers I now 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.980
 don't take youtube channel because you 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.590
 You can also ask your questions to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.890
 boxing video yes under each video with 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.720
 product reviews with either 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.800
 a training video in youtube and remains 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.800
 everything is still 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.870
 but many write questions to me exactly 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.690
 social networks in a personal write to me and 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.670
 so I would also like you to 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.840
 it was easier for me 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.210
 questions you passed to groups of social networks 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.580
 links to these groups I will leave below you 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.710

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.780

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.560
 look at your discretion as you 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.560
 will be easier and better 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.030
 And the news company for me she such 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.019
 Here the main and important thing is that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.920
 the company finally began to create 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.709
 video conferencing with tutorials 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.360
 materials on various topics are very 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.580
 many consultants ask me 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.880
 questions where you can learn 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.880

 earnings will seem much better 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.419
