what to Mars two cards are capable of so
as<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:59.010> saw<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.670> had<00:00:59.820> actually<00:01:00.120> an<00:01:00.210> engine

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
as you saw we had actually an engine

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.729 
as you saw we had actually an engine
running<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> background<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.530> so

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
running in the background here and so

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.170 
running in the background here and so
we've<00:01:01.920> gone<00:01:02.010> ahead<00:01:02.129> now<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> completed<00:01:03.090> our

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
we've gone ahead now to completed our

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
we've gone ahead now to completed our
first<00:01:03.210> initial<00:01:03.750> run<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.739> can<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.070> that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
first initial run and we can see that

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.390 
first initial run and we can see that
with<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.850> Mars<00:01:06.150> -<00:01:07.080> excuse<00:01:07.470> me<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.799> -<00:01:07.950> Mars<00:01:08.189> -

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
of garvik's cards we now have an average

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.609

frame rate of 75 frames a second I saw

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.980 
frame rate of 75 frames a second I saw
almost<00:01:13.920> 100%<00:01:14.580> scaling<00:01:15.270> from<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.780> had

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
almost 100% scaling from what we had

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.800 
almost 100% scaling from what we had
with<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.500> card<00:01:16.799> which<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.400> approximately

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
with one card which was approximately

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
with one card which was approximately
about<00:01:18.810> 40<00:01:19.229> frames<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> huge

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
about 40 frames so we see a huge

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
about 40 frames so we see a huge
increase<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.869> whole<00:01:22.140> performance<00:01:22.470> which

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
increase in the whole performance which

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.070 
increase in the whole performance which
is<00:01:23.670> really<00:01:24.150> really<00:01:24.390> nice<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.869> especially

pick<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.940> same<00:04:09.150> map<00:04:09.389> x<00:04:09.720> Square<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.859> do<00:04:10.980> one

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
pick the same map x Square and do one

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.580 
pick the same map x Square and do one
run<00:04:11.400> API<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.239> going<00:04:12.449> to<00:04:12.510> be<00:04:12.569> set<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.750> DirectX<00:04:13.199> 11

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
run API is going to be set to DirectX 11

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.370 
run API is going to be set to DirectX 11
we'll<00:04:14.280> go<00:04:14.400> ahead<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.639> do<00:04:14.940> edge<00:04:15.180> AAA<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.900> high

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
we'll go ahead and do edge AAA and high

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.050 
we'll go ahead and do edge AAA and high
resolution<00:04:16.889> textures<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.699> we'll<00:04:17.880> go<00:04:18.000> ahead

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
resolution textures so we'll go ahead

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.819 
resolution textures so we'll go ahead
and<00:04:18.239> add<00:04:18.329> that<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.630> our<00:04:18.659> queue<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.169> go<00:04:19.620> ahead

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
and add that to our queue and go ahead

00:04:19.829 --> 00:05:17.610 
and add that to our queue and go ahead
and<00:04:19.949> start<00:04:20.130> our<00:04:20.310> run

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.170 

okay<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:18.950> we've<00:05:19.130> gone<00:05:19.280> ahead<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.580> finished<00:05:20.000> up

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
okay so we've gone ahead and finished up

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.780 
okay so we've gone ahead and finished up
our<00:05:20.480> gun<00:05:20.960> here<00:05:21.200> of<00:05:21.350> crisis<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:22.160> we've<00:05:22.640> gone

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
our gun here of crisis and we've gone

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.030 
our gun here of crisis and we've gone
ahead<00:05:22.940> and<00:05:23.120> now<00:05:23.450> have<00:05:23.750> a<00:05:24.050> new<00:05:24.260> average<00:05:24.560> frame

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
ahead and now have a new average frame

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.580 
ahead and now have a new average frame
rate<00:05:25.250> of<00:05:25.430> forty<00:05:26.150> eight<00:05:26.330> point<00:05:26.720> three<00:05:26.930> frames

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
rate of forty eight point three frames

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.920 
rate of forty eight point three frames
so<00:05:28.010> considering<00:05:28.910> that<00:05:29.060> debt<00:05:29.240> crisis<00:05:29.600> too<00:05:29.780> is

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
so considering that debt crisis too is

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.710 
so considering that debt crisis too is
really<00:05:30.080> setting<00:05:30.470> kind<00:05:30.740> of<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.670> the<00:05:32.180> benchmark

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
really setting kind of the the benchmark

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.330 
really setting kind of the the benchmark
in<00:05:32.840> terms<00:05:33.020> of<00:05:33.140> graphics<00:05:33.500> fidelity<00:05:33.920> along<00:05:34.190> with
