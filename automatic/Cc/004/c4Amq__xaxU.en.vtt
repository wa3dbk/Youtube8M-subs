00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello everybody here the mayor if I 'm with 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.930
 three replicas of the galaxy s 4 solved 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.019
 make this video because there's a lot 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.809
 pick here and pass these replicas here 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.000
 with the original samsung galaxy s 4 and if you do not 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.430
 to know neither the replicas nor the original 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.250
 You could end up being a victim then. 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.830
 the best way is to know the same 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.570
 replicates that are on the market so that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 You do not come to be a victim. 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.390
 see this replica here is one of the most 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.859
 cheap What about her has tv 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.050
 if I take the cover here to show 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:41.670
 Right for you 2 model chip and 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.600
 9,500 of tv wifi 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.350
 He has a threesome and I'm going to call from here to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.350
 you see the operation 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.789
 this is with resistive screen as 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.769
 replicas that have resistive screens use 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.380
 this kind of screen here 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.600
 so the resistive screen is not 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.710
 touch you have to push 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.840
 a little strong phone recognizes 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:22.740
 if you touch your finger lightly on the screen 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.610
 does not recognize the second resistive 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.439
 replica 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:34.470
 The second replica is from here and I have 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.710
 logo of samsung teaching take cover 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.710
 his 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.980
 this one has two chip chip one 2 chip and 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:56.020
 here in the middle memory card take the 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:58.150
 battery here and it's written gt and 9505 I'm going 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.490
 call him here to see you at last 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.700
 unfortunately has a lot of picking 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:09.820
 It's here for over a thousand reais 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:12.250
 jonas people calling here let's see the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.060
 and memory of his father in the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.480
 ads they speak deco processor 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.530
 quadricolor I dual core I do not know which one 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.510
 al khor in memory talks 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.250
 they try to pass as original 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.380
 Unfortunately, who does not know ends? 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.930
 paying expensive a cell of his 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.060
 team 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.200
 so I downloaded a google problem 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.010
 play called a is an android hardware 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.800
 info 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:50.200
 and if this program here it allows 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:56.860
 view the memory processor before pixels 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:03:00.400
 who the camera will look for anac 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.620
 touch it here in cell and are now 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.040
 Almost computers are here already 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.340
 show some we will see here the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.570
 Processor here is that 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.610
 1000 1001 mega-hertz equals 1 ghz of 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.920
 velocity 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.880
 now I just do not know if this processor 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.250
 is dual core with the ads says I 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.430
 I'll search, tell me there on the internet at 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.410
 this processor's website to see if 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.920
 really is dual core without the memory is of 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:39.760
 232 mega-bytes does not even reach the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.900
 feet of the original s 4 galaxy that has 2 gb 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.350
 memory ovals fours we will not see the 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.319
 original samsung galaxy s camera is if i 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.010
 I 'm not mistaken it's 3 megapixels and said 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.489
 here is just one 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:00.700
 1.4 megapixels at beckham 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:07.010
 this here now front camera facing 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:10.220
 camera can not be seen here 0.2 megapixels 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.760
 I am not mistaken the camera s 4:02 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.030
 megapixels defendants in one day think you 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:21.199
 then this one compared to some 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.800
 It's good, it's good. 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:26.030
 nice plus compared the original s4 is 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.570
 a piece of crap 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:35.630
 so let's go to the last model of the 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.990
 galaxy s 4g replica galaxy and 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.949
 put the lid on 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.500
 this one is a more faithful replica in only 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.979
 enter here for the microchip let me 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.500
 to see 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.620
 I'm using here the live chip that 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:56.180
 I clipped here to input 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:01.580
 a writing micro sd wanted to have nine 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:08.240
 thousand nine thousand and five hundred and here we go 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:11.690
 put the replica battery here 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.870
 It's better she has face recognition. 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.860
 it also has the samsung s name here in 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:21.050
 front of the samsung name here behind is more 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.280
 worked is better crafted than 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.099
 these others 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.490
 only see the difference in what is the 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.229
 chip does not have a samsung name on the front and 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:38.570
 behind the eyes I do not know if nobody 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:42.470
 so here I think it still is 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:45.380
 warm adhesive paste this here is already a 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.360
 something better worked because at the time 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.310
 until that time, here also one of the 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.620
 The best I 've seen 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.250
 I also will be in it that 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.770
 hardware info programming info 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.539
 android radio influence let's look for it 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.300
 see settings 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.360
 let's see the processor memory of that 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:11.139
 appliance here 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:14.939
 We're going to go here. 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.939
 This is the time icon that touches it. 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:22.599
 So is this replica here due to 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:26.680
 Best is just the android 4.242 let's pro 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:31.060
 process of the processor process it 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:38.830
 has almost 2 ghz up to 1890 mega hair phase 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:41.650
 2 gig and would walk it and that in 1867 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:45.490
 refers to the RAM memory is not the same 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.069
 memory as hd no one saves photo of 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:52.449
 If you live here I do not understand much. 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:54.849
 well of configuration 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:58.389
 but this memory that she is 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:07:03.039
 related to device performance 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:07.779
 memory is good and the rear camera 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:11.680
 front front camera 2.1 megapixels and 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:14.889
 12.8 megapixel camera then replicates 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:19.599
 that I came here it's better that you have 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:21.460
 a replica that also only has one chip 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:25.259
 ahead of him is very much like this 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.259
 Here I am going to show you
