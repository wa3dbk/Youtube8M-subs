Kenya yamaha champions riding school and
I<00:00:12.240> think<00:00:12.750> one<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> cool<00:00:13.200> things<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.530> I

things<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.920> little<00:00:20.160> bit<00:00:20.279> better<00:00:20.460> at

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
things that I'm a little bit better at

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.220 
things that I'm a little bit better at
than<00:00:20.820> everybody<00:00:21.029> else<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> being<00:00:21.720> able<00:00:21.930> to

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
than everybody else is being able to

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.109 
than everybody else is being able to
read<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.619> corner<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.189> take<00:00:23.609> advantage<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
read the corner and take advantage of

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.179 
read the corner and take advantage of
what<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.390> corner<00:00:24.779> has<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.109> offer<00:00:25.289> Ben<00:00:25.890> Speas

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
what that corner has to offer Ben Speas

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.130 
what that corner has to offer Ben Speas
talked<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> lot<00:00:26.670> about<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.090> too<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.570> when<00:00:27.990> he's

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
talked a lot about that too is when he's

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.390 
talked a lot about that too is when he's
going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> these<00:00:28.740> new<00:00:28.890> tracks<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
going to some of these new tracks and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
going to some of these new tracks and
trying<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.640> figure<00:00:29.849> things<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.240> he<00:00:30.779> says<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
trying to figure things out he says I

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.290 
trying to figure things out he says I
want<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> maximize<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.070> radius<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.820> each

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
want to maximize the radius of each

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.229 
want to maximize the radius of each
corner<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.500> what<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> offers<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.180> do

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
corner for what it offers so what do

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.580 
corner for what it offers so what do
they<00:00:36.329> mean<00:00:36.360> we're<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> break<00:00:37.440> those

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
they mean we're going to break those

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.080 
they mean we're going to break those
corners<00:00:38.010> down<00:00:38.129> into<00:00:38.460> three<00:00:38.640> different<00:00:38.820> types

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
corners down into three different types

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.380 
corners down into three different types
of<00:00:39.239> corners<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.250> entry<00:00:41.250> corners<00:00:41.670> exit

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
of corners we have entry corners exit

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
of corners we have entry corners exit
corners<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.930> balance<00:00:43.649> corners<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.219> what

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
corners and balance corners and what

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
corners and balance corners and what
we're<00:00:44.879> looking<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:45.840> lasts<00:00:46.289> longest

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
we're looking for is what lasts longest

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.130 
we're looking for is what lasts longest
in<00:00:47.070> each<00:00:47.190> one<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> those<00:00:47.670> corners<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:49.020> an

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
in each one of those corners so on an

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.459 
in each one of those corners so on an
entry<00:00:49.469> corner<00:00:49.860> our<00:00:50.660> deceleration<00:00:51.660> zone<00:00:51.930> last

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
entry corner our deceleration zone last

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.100 
entry corner our deceleration zone last
longest<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:54.030> an<00:00:54.210> entry<00:00:54.449> corner<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.870> want<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
longest so on an entry corner we want to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.959 
longest so on an entry corner we want to
take<00:00:55.260> advantage<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> deceleration<00:00:56.610> zone

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
take advantage of the deceleration zone

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.729 
take advantage of the deceleration zone
because<00:00:57.270> that's<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.719> lasts<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> longest<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
because that's what lasts the longest so

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.650 
because that's what lasts the longest so
we<00:00:58.859> use<00:00:59.039> our<00:00:59.129> brakes<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.670> past<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> apex<00:01:00.420> in

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
we use our brakes to or past the apex in

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.720 
we use our brakes to or past the apex in
an<00:01:00.870> exit<00:01:01.199> corner<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.309> know<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.579> most

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
an exit corner and you know what most

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.429 
an exit corner and you know what most
corners<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.390> exit<00:01:03.660> corners<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> most

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
corners are exit corners you go to most

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.899 
corners are exit corners you go to most
tracks<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.189> we're<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.700> chuckwalla

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
tracks you know we're here at chuckwalla

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.200 
tracks you know we're here at chuckwalla
door<00:01:06.360> 16<00:01:06.720> corners<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.880> 12<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.060> them

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
door 16 corners and I think 12 of them

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.179 
door 16 corners and I think 12 of them
are<00:01:09.360> exit<00:01:09.689> corners<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.650> want<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
are exit corners we want to have the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.940 
are exit corners we want to have the
bike<00:01:11.369> slowed<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.450> pointed<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.799> take

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
bike slowed and pointed so we can take

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.490 
bike slowed and pointed so we can take
advantage<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.210> acceleration<00:01:15.930> zone<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.439> in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
advantage of the acceleration zone so in

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
advantage of the acceleration zone so in
an<00:01:16.590> exit<00:01:16.890> corner<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> bikes<00:01:17.970> floatin

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
an exit corner we have the bikes floatin

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.420 
an exit corner we have the bikes floatin
pointed<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.290> start<00:01:19.680> our<00:01:19.890> acceleration

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
pointed so we can start our acceleration

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.340 
pointed so we can start our acceleration
process<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.540> past<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> ape

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
process as we go past the ape

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.289 
process as we go past the ape
now<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> balance<00:01:23.549> corner<00:01:23.970> your

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
now on a balance corner your

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.130 
now on a balance corner your
deceleration<00:01:25.170> zone<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.759> your<00:01:27.140> acceleration

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
deceleration zone and your acceleration

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.990 
deceleration zone and your acceleration
zone<00:01:28.500> last<00:01:29.009> about<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> same<00:01:29.610> amount<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.939> time

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
zone last about the same amount of time

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.499 
zone last about the same amount of time
so<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.350> approach<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:32.100> balance<00:01:33.000> corner<00:01:33.360> as

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
so you can approach a balance corner as

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.330 
so you can approach a balance corner as
either<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:33.840> entry<00:01:34.259> or<00:01:34.350> exit<00:01:34.500> corner<00:01:35.040> really

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
either an entry or exit corner really

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.789 
either an entry or exit corner really
wouldn't<00:01:35.670> affect<00:01:35.880> your<00:01:36.030> lap<00:01:36.180> time<00:01:36.710> given<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
wouldn't affect your lap time given the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.680 
wouldn't affect your lap time given the
choice<00:01:37.830> will<00:01:38.340> approach<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.299> exit

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
choice will approach it as an exit

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.030 
choice will approach it as an exit
corner<00:01:40.049> because<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.470> safer<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:40.950> more

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
corner because it's safer and more

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.710 
corner because it's safer and more
repeatable<00:01:41.399> and<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.940> think<00:01:42.450> once<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
repeatable and I think once you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.680 
repeatable and I think once you
understand<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> track<00:01:43.470> dynamics<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.690> allows

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
understand the track dynamics it allows

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.870 
understand the track dynamics it allows
