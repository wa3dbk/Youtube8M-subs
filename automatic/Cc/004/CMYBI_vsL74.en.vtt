Harvey does do a lot of things such as

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.180 
Harvey does do a lot of things such as
byte<00:00:47.300> therapy<00:00:47.809> which<00:00:48.020> again<00:00:48.559> sets<00:00:48.890> us<00:00:49.040> aside

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
byte therapy which again sets us aside
