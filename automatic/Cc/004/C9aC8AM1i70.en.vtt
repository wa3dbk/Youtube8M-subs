the beginning of an alley and carry it
all<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.279> way<00:00:32.669> down<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.149> end<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> alley

all the way down to the end of the alley

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.229 
all the way down to the end of the alley
or<00:00:34.050> walk<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> alley<00:00:35.430> pick<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.120> the

bucket that's towards the end of the
alley<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:38.280> seems<00:00:38.550> much<00:00:38.730> easier<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.149> then

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
alley which seems much easier and then

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.970 
alley which seems much easier and then
drop<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.750> off<00:00:39.840> when<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.230> there<00:00:40.440> one

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
drop it off when you get there one

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
way down the other allowed them to just

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
way down the other allowed them to just
walk<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.700> then<00:00:45.120> pick<00:00:45.300> up<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> bucket<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> few

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
walk and then pick up a bucket for a few

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.930 
walk and then pick up a bucket for a few
seconds<00:00:46.469> put<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.770> down<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.550> was<00:00:47.730> supposed

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
seconds put it down so this was supposed

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
seconds put it down so this was supposed
to<00:00:48.030> measure<00:00:48.210> whether<00:00:48.629> people<00:00:48.899> will<00:00:49.170> do

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
to measure whether people will do

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.110 
to measure whether people will do
something<00:00:49.980> ahead<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.340> time<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:51.000> it's

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
something ahead of time when it's

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
something ahead of time when it's
actually<00:00:51.510> harder<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:52.530> they'll<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.829> do

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
actually harder or if they'll just do

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.560 
actually harder or if they'll just do
the<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.250> rational<00:00:53.670> thing<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.120> obviously

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the more rational thing so obviously

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.090 
the more rational thing so obviously
people<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.170> picked<00:00:55.379> up<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> bucket<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
people just picked up the bucket that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.650 
people just picked up the bucket that
was<00:00:56.250> closest<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> finish<00:00:57.180> line<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.600> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
was closest to the finish line so that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.939 
was closest to the finish line so that
they<00:00:57.809> didn't<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> carry<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:58.829> much

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
they didn't have to carry it for much

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
they didn't have to carry it for much
longer<00:00:59.129> right<00:00:59.460> that's<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> scientists

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
longer right that's what the scientists

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
longer right that's what the scientists
thought<00:01:00.930> until<00:01:01.379> every<00:01:01.829> single<00:01:02.190> participant

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
thought until every single participant

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.340 
thought until every single participant
picked<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> bucket<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.290> the

actually<00:01:13.500> gave<00:01:13.619> themselves<00:01:13.820> extra<00:01:14.820> work<00:01:15.030> for

to<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.820> desire<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.270> reduce<00:01:30.659> working<00:01:31.470> memory

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
to the desire to reduce working memory

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.130 
to the desire to reduce working memory
loads<00:01:32.220> working<00:01:32.939> memory<00:01:33.090> loads<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.630> basically

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
loads working memory loads is basically

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.260 
loads working memory loads is basically
the<00:01:34.320> available<00:01:34.979> resources<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.150> do

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the available resources we have to do

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
the available resources we have to do
short-term<00:01:36.630> immediate<00:01:37.020> tasks<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.799> closely

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
short-term immediate tasks it's closely

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
short-term immediate tasks it's closely
related<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.759> short-term<00:01:39.150> memory<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
related to short-term memory and it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.130 
related to short-term memory and it
seems<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> participants<00:01:41.310> are

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
seems like the participants are

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.569 
seems like the participants are
preferring<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.170> suffer<00:01:43.770> from<00:01:43.950> physical

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
preferring to suffer from physical

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.280 
preferring to suffer from physical
stress<00:01:44.850> as<00:01:45.060> opposed<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> mental<00:01:45.930> stress

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
stress as opposed to mental stress

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.960 
stress as opposed to mental stress
that's<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:46.979> they're<00:01:47.189> willing<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.640> make<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
that's right they're willing to make a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
that's right they're willing to make a
choice<00:01:48.180> that's<00:01:48.390> physically<00:01:48.869> harder<00:01:49.170> yeah

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
choice that's physically harder yeah

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.380 
choice that's physically harder yeah
because<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.490> mental<00:01:50.670> burden<00:01:51.119> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
because it's more of a mental burden to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.910 
because it's more of a mental burden to
have<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.659> live<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> decision<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> do

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
have to live with the decision do I do

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
have to live with the decision do I do
this<00:01:53.159> now<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.340> do<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:53.939> later<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.630> it's

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
this now or do I do that later and it's

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.510 
this now or do I do that later and it's
funny<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.920> all<00:01:56.070> sorts<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.399> those

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
funny because we have all sorts of those

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.679 
funny because we have all sorts of those
decisions<00:01:56.969> throughout<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> day<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.600> they

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
decisions throughout the day and they

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.240 
decisions throughout the day and they
seem<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.079> small<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.950> they're<00:01:59.100> actually

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
seem so small but they're actually

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.660 
seem so small but they're actually
taking<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.939> huge<00:02:00.299> amount<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:01.110> energy

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
taking up a huge amount of energy

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.170 
taking up a huge amount of energy
subconsciously<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.759> our<00:02:02.850> working<00:02:03.030> memory

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
subconsciously in our working memory

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
subconsciously in our working memory
that<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:03.810> probably<00:02:04.049> rather<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:04.890> them

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that we probably rather just get them

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
that we probably rather just get them
out<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.430> way<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:06.090> kind<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.450> sitting

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
out of the way it's kind of like sitting

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.540 
out of the way it's kind of like sitting
with<00:02:06.930> your<00:02:07.020> taxes<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:07.590> four<00:02:07.770> months<00:02:07.920> even

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
with your taxes for four months even

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580 
with your taxes for four months even
though<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.330> money<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.500> example

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
though the money would be for example

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
though the money would be for example
earning<00:02:11.310> interest<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.790> bank<00:02:11.910> account<00:02:12.030> if

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
earning interest in your bank account if

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.610 
earning interest in your bank account if
you<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.629> let<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.900> sit<00:02:13.050> there

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you just let it sit there

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.680 
you just let it sit there
so<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.580> has<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.909> sorts<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.239> practical

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so it has all sorts of practical

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.030 
so it has all sorts of practical
implications<00:02:16.260> for<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.500> way<00:02:16.560> we<00:02:16.680> live<00:02:16.980> our

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
implications for the way we live our

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160 
implications for the way we live our
lives<00:02:17.340> for<00:02:17.940> example<00:02:18.269> i<00:02:18.330> think<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.599> all<00:02:18.629> love

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
lives for example i think we all love

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.839 
lives for example i think we all love
that<00:02:19.349> feeling<00:02:19.739> of<00:02:19.799> like<00:02:19.860> getting<00:02:20.220> email<00:02:20.610> done

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
that feeling of like getting email done

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.820 
that feeling of like getting email done
and<00:02:21.209> you<00:02:21.569> know<00:02:21.690> starting<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.230> take<00:02:22.409> care<00:02:22.769> of

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
and you know starting to take care of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.770 
and you know starting to take care of
tasks<00:02:23.310> now<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.640> technology<00:02:24.150> puts<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.659> our

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
tasks now that technology puts it in our

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.240 
tasks now that technology puts it in our
face<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:24.989> allows<00:02:25.379> us<00:02:25.409> to<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.099> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
face and allows us to do it in the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.970 
face and allows us to do it in the
moment<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:27.239> that<00:02:28.200> might<00:02:28.440> not<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.950> our

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
moment but that might not be to our

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.890 
moment but that might not be to our
interest<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.849> now<00:02:30.030> if<00:02:30.180> we're<00:02:30.360> aware<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.659> this

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
interest and now if we're aware of this

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.270 
interest and now if we're aware of this
it<00:02:31.079> might<00:02:31.200> actually<00:02:31.349> make<00:02:31.650> us<00:02:31.860> truly

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
it might actually make us truly

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.069 
it might actually make us truly
efficient<00:02:32.940> as<00:02:33.030> opposed<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.480> thinking

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
efficient as opposed to just thinking

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.390 
efficient as opposed to just thinking
we're<00:02:34.230> efficient<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.860> now<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.310> this

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
we're efficient and now in this

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.649 
we're efficient and now in this
particular<00:02:35.579> case<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.209> could<00:02:36.329> argue<00:02:36.420> maybe

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
particular case you could argue maybe

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.119 
particular case you could argue maybe
people<00:02:37.019> just<00:02:37.079> wanted<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> get<00:02:37.590> some<00:02:37.769> Fitness

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
people just wanted to get some Fitness

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.100 
people just wanted to get some Fitness
done<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.579> work<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:38.940> their<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.420> guns<00:02:39.900> on

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
done and work on their you know guns on

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.220 
done and work on their you know guns on
it<00:02:40.650> um<00:02:40.890> but<00:02:41.819> and<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.299> imagine<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.900> could<00:02:43.110> be

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
it um but and I imagine that it could be

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.869 
it um but and I imagine that it could be
detrimental<00:02:43.379> in<00:02:43.829> other<00:02:44.010> cases<00:02:44.340> right<00:02:44.730> so

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
detrimental in other cases right so

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.490 
detrimental in other cases right so
we're<00:02:45.090> sort<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.660> some<00:02:45.840> examples<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.349> when

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
we're sort of some examples of when

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.410 
we're sort of some examples of when
people<00:02:46.799> procrastinate<00:02:47.129> and<00:02:47.849> then<00:02:48.060> they're

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
people procrastinate and then they're

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.729 
people procrastinate and then they're
like<00:02:48.540> oh<00:02:48.720> man<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.170> should<00:02:49.230> have<00:02:49.349> done<00:02:49.500> another

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
like oh man you should have done another

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.960 
like oh man you should have done another
way<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:49.980> mentioned<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.370> bank<00:02:50.579> account<00:02:50.879> for

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
way you mentioned the bank account for

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.819 
way you mentioned the bank account for
example<00:02:51.359> but<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:51.660> don't<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.290> let<00:02:52.769> things

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
example but you don't like to let things

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.550 
example but you don't like to let things
sit<00:02:53.280> financial<00:02:53.849> decisions<00:02:54.299> are<00:02:54.450> big<00:02:54.989> one<00:02:55.230> but

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
sit financial decisions are big one but

sit financial decisions are big one but
I<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.040> know<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.340> other<00:02:56.640> big<00:02:56.849> one<00:02:56.970> is

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
cognitive load is to simply write it

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.699 
cognitive load is to simply write it
down<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:30.660> know<00:03:30.780> we<00:03:30.900> have<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.290> do<00:03:31.440> something

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
down so we know we have to do something

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.349 
down so we know we have to do something
but<00:03:31.980> we<00:03:32.099> can't<00:03:32.340> do<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.549> right<00:03:32.730> then<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.299> there

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
but we can't do it right then and there

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.059 
but we can't do it right then and there

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
to do it later a simple note helps us

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.330 
to do it later a simple note helps us

turning it into something that you know

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.319 
turning it into something that you know
you'll<00:03:46.680> get<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:46.980> when<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.400> moment<00:03:47.760> comes<00:03:47.940> but

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
to do right now it also explains a lot

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
our desire to be efficient when really

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.420 
our desire to be efficient when really
it<00:04:01.230> might<00:04:01.379> just<00:04:01.500> be<00:04:01.650> playing<00:04:01.859> on<00:04:01.980> our<00:04:02.010> desire

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
it might just be playing on our desire

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.250 
it might just be playing on our desire
to<00:04:02.579> not<00:04:02.730> have<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.030> working<00:04:03.419> memory<00:04:03.599> load<00:04:03.930> that's

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
to not have a working memory load that's

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.619 
to not have a working memory load that's
too<00:04:04.440> much<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.859> that<00:04:05.549> could<00:04:05.760> explain<00:04:06.030> billions

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
too much and that could explain billions

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
my more mentally exhausting tasks maybe

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.970 
my more mentally exhausting tasks maybe
you<00:04:26.070> should<00:04:26.099> procrastinate<00:04:26.789> on

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
you should procrastinate on

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.500 
you should procrastinate on
stories<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.580> should<00:04:27.760> probably<00:04:27.970> do<00:04:28.390> the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
stories I should probably do the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.090 
stories I should probably do the
opposite<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:29.050> weave<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.470> cleaning<00:04:29.890> for

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
opposite and weave the cleaning for

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.530 
opposite and weave the cleaning for
later<00:04:30.280> but<00:04:30.820> then<00:04:31.000> you're<00:04:31.120> just<00:04:31.150> making

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
later but then you're just making

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.060 
later but then you're just making
trade-offs<00:04:31.750> so<00:04:32.080> I<00:04:32.320> think<00:04:32.650> what's<00:04:32.800> funny<00:04:32.980> about

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
trade-offs so I think what's funny about

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.770 
trade-offs so I think what's funny about
this<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:34.030> be<00:04:34.120> honest<00:04:34.390> it's<00:04:34.540> humbling

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
this is that to be honest it's humbling

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.810 
this is that to be honest it's humbling
it<00:04:35.050> reminds<00:04:35.410> us<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:35.530> we're<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:36.070> human

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
it reminds us that we're just human

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.280 
it reminds us that we're just human
we're<00:04:37.180> just<00:04:37.360> simple<00:04:37.600> like<00:04:37.810> we're<00:04:37.960> not<00:04:38.080> the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
we're just simple like we're not the

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.260 
we're just simple like we're not the
most<00:04:38.440> sophisticated<00:04:38.800> creatures<00:04:39.550> even<00:04:39.970> when

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
most sophisticated creatures even when

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.700 
most sophisticated creatures even when
we<00:04:40.360> have<00:04:40.480> our<00:04:40.510> productivity<00:04:40.990> hacks<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.620> our

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
we have our productivity hacks and our

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.650 
we have our productivity hacks and our
efficiency<00:04:42.220> shortcuts<00:04:43.120> they're<00:04:43.300> not<00:04:43.420> always

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
efficiency shortcuts they're not always

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.990 
efficiency shortcuts they're not always
doing<00:04:44.140> exactly<00:04:44.410> what<00:04:44.590> we<00:04:44.770> hoped<00:04:44.920> we<00:04:45.670> just<00:04:45.880> got

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
doing exactly what we hoped we just got

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.070 
doing exactly what we hoped we just got
to<00:04:46.120> kind<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.300> take<00:04:46.420> things<00:04:46.630> as<00:04:46.840> they<00:04:46.870> come

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
to kind of take things as they come

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.480 
to kind of take things as they come
that's<00:04:47.470> what<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:47.650> took<00:04:47.740> away<00:04:47.890> from<00:04:48.040> this<00:04:48.190> let<00:04:48.460> us

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
that's what I took away from this let us

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
that's what I took away from this let us
