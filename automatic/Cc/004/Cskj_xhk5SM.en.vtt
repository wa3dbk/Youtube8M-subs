in<00:01:32.869> my<00:01:33.140> opinion<00:01:33.619> this<00:01:33.799> is<00:01:33.920> one<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.219> most

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
in my opinion this is one of the most

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.940 
in my opinion this is one of the most
low-profile<00:01:35.390> riding<00:01:35.840> shoes<00:01:36.079> that<00:01:36.590> we<00:01:36.710> have<00:01:36.829> in

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
low-profile riding shoes that we have in

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.990 
low-profile riding shoes that we have in
that<00:01:37.039> collection<00:01:37.219> if<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.520> see<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.789> height<00:01:37.969> of

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
that collection if you see the height of

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.389 
that collection if you see the height of
it<00:01:38.210> it's<00:01:38.390> it's<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:39.380> between<00:01:39.500> a<00:01:39.740> high<00:01:39.950> top<00:01:40.189> and

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
it it's it's in between a high top and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.039 
it it's it's in between a high top and
something<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.210> would<00:01:41.329> be<00:01:41.420> considered<00:01:41.719> a<00:01:41.869> low

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
something that would be considered a low

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.510 
something that would be considered a low
top<00:01:42.289> it's<00:01:42.469> going<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.649> give<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:42.859> co<00:01:43.009> coverage

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
top it's going to give you a co coverage

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.029 
top it's going to give you a co coverage
but<00:01:43.939> it's<00:01:44.090> not<00:01:44.240> overly<00:01:44.719> high<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:45.350> depending<00:01:46.039> on

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
but it's not overly high so depending on

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.560 
but it's not overly high so depending on
your<00:01:46.219> personal<00:01:46.429> preference<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:47.299> could<00:01:47.450> be<00:01:47.479> a

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
your personal preference that could be a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.469 
your personal preference that could be a
