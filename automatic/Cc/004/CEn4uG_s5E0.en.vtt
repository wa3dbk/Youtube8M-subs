00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 is 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.320
 hello friends here we are again today 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.240
 I bring you a fun design for 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.240
 decorate your remaining hearing aids 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.260
 Colorful fashionable and that look more 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.950
 happy that's what we're going to need 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.360
 your hearing aids these bits come without 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.750
 our projects with which you can 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.710
 use cristeras to make bracelets and necklaces 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.500
 and some scissors the first thing we're going to 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.350
 do going to cut out our plastics 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.870
 to make them just a little cut to 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:58.790
 all of us who believe enough that 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:01:00.050
 be to cover our hearing aids and 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.930
 when we believe that we have the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.610
 enough let's proceed to the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.160
 following 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.680
 but we know in this same way up 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.360
 that we have complete the cable of this 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.110
 way we are going to order the color that 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.110
 more we like 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.390
 here we have our hearing aids already well 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.220
 colorful so that they are going to grow with 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.340
 they boast what all of us 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.670
 so look very striking here I decided 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.560
 doing it only in two colors I did not 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.200
 all this because I find it easier 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.640
 to pull it is to throw them here at 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.560
 long that I want them but if you 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.200
 they want to put all the colors this 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.479
 face is very good that's all for 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.550
