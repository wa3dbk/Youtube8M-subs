practicing<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
practicing I'm just going to do one and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.610 
practicing I'm just going to do one and
the<00:00:39.600> reason<00:00:39.780> why<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.290> many<00:00:40.320> things

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the reason why I do so many things

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.750 
the reason why I do so many things
because<00:00:40.770> when<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> trimming<00:00:41.550> them

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
because when you get to trimming them

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.049 
because when you get to trimming them
the<00:00:42.629> more<00:00:43.170> options<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> select<00:00:44.579> from

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the more options you have to select from

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.279 
the more options you have to select from
the<00:00:45.239> better<00:00:45.390> chances<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:45.960> you're<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.230> to

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the better chances are you're going to

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.040 
the better chances are you're going to
get<00:00:46.440> some<00:00:46.649> good<00:00:46.800> looking<00:00:47.070> entries<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:48.300> hope<00:00:48.930> to
