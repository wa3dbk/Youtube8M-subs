works<00:00:33.640> as<00:00:34.540> you<00:00:34.660> have<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.810> negative<00:00:35.020> sulfur<00:00:35.470> on

the<00:00:35.710> software<00:00:35.980> I<00:00:36.070> guess<00:00:36.220> it<00:00:36.370> when<00:00:37.090> you<00:00:37.180> charge

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
the software I guess it when you charge

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.910 
the software I guess it when you charge
it<00:00:37.480> up<00:00:37.630> a<00:00:37.780> positive<00:00:38.080> electron<00:00:38.380> ties<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:38.830> it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
it up a positive electron ties to it
