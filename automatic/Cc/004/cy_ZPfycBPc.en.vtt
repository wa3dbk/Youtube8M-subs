well<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:58.950> think<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.370> thing<00:03:59.550> that<00:03:59.580> happened<00:04:00.120> the

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
well I think the thing that happened the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.820 
well I think the thing that happened the
most<00:04:00.390> was<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:00.780> they<00:04:00.989> realized<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.380> anybody

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
most was that they realized that anybody

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.990 
most was that they realized that anybody
could<00:04:02.100> be<00:04:02.220> successful<00:04:02.820> on<00:04:03.090> any<00:04:03.330> level<00:04:05.000> that's

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
could be successful on any level that's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.040 
could be successful on any level that's
something<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.480> really<00:04:06.750> wanted<00:04:06.989> to

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
something that I really wanted to

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.920 
something that I really wanted to
impress<00:04:07.350> upon<00:04:07.410> them<00:04:07.860> that<00:04:08.630> no<00:04:09.630> matter<00:04:09.780> where

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
impress upon them that no matter where

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.090 
impress upon them that no matter where
you<00:04:10.019> came<00:04:10.230> from<00:04:10.290> no<00:04:10.739> matter<00:04:10.830> what<00:04:11.010> your

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
you came from no matter what your

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.250 
you came from no matter what your
background<00:04:11.280> was<00:04:11.850> no<00:04:12.120> matter<00:04:12.269> what<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.510> had<00:04:12.780> or

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
background was no matter what you had or

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.490 
background was no matter what you had or
didn't<00:04:13.620> have<00:04:13.830> you<00:04:14.730> could<00:04:14.910> make<00:04:15.060> art<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.660> I

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
didn't have you could make art and I

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.409 
didn't have you could make art and I
think<00:04:16.739> they<00:04:16.859> all<00:04:17.010> came<00:04:17.250> away<00:04:17.489> with<00:04:17.669> some<00:04:17.700> sense

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
think they all came away with some sense

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.700 
think they all came away with some sense
that<00:04:19.130> anybody<00:04:20.209> could<00:04:21.209> be<00:04:21.359> an<00:04:21.630> artist

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
that anybody could be an artist

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.230 
that anybody could be an artist
anybody<00:04:23.190> could<00:04:23.430> communicate<00:04:23.760> what<00:04:24.090> they

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
anybody could communicate what they

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:37.839 
anybody could communicate what they
needed<00:04:24.450> through<00:04:25.440> this<00:04:25.590> medium

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849
