00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
you're almost tuned there and then the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.760 
you're almost tuned there and then the
string<00:00:28.580> just<00:00:28.760> kind<00:00:28.940> of<00:00:29.030> pops<00:00:29.930> and<00:00:30.230> doesn't<00:00:30.710> go

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770

string just kind of pops and doesn't go
into<00:00:30.890> tune<00:00:31.130> using<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.119> pencil<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.899> lad<00:00:33.140> has

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
into tune using a pencil the lad has

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.740 
into tune using a pencil the lad has
graphite<00:00:34.010> in<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.030> if<00:00:35.120> you<00:00:35.240> rub<00:00:35.480> some<00:00:35.720> of

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
graphite in it so if you rub some of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.550 
graphite in it so if you rub some of
that<00:00:35.840> graphite<00:00:36.730> underneath<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.910> string

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
that graphite underneath the string

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.630 
that graphite underneath the string
right<00:00:39.560> here<00:00:39.739> on<00:00:39.829> this<00:00:39.920> white<00:00:40.190> piece<00:00:40.400> which<00:00:40.610> is

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
right here on this white piece which is

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.000 
right here on this white piece which is
called<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:41.060> nut<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.200> then<00:00:42.350> pop<00:00:42.560> your<00:00:42.590> string

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
called the nut and then pop your string

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.490 
called the nut and then pop your string
back<00:00:43.220> in<00:00:43.489> that'll<00:00:44.390> help<00:00:44.480> it<00:00:44.690> flow<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.290> little

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500

basics<00:01:00.829> with<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.160> I<00:01:01.190> don't<00:01:01.760> play<00:01:02.000> slide<00:01:02.300> very

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
basics with you I don't play slide very

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.049 
basics with you I don't play slide very
often<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.140> hopefully<00:01:04.129> we'll<00:01:04.670> kind<00:01:04.820> of<00:01:04.879> be<00:01:04.969> on

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
often so hopefully we'll kind of be on

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.219 
often so hopefully we'll kind of be on
the<00:01:05.089> same<00:01:05.329> page<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.780> I'll<00:01:05.870> give<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:06.110> the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
the same page and I'll give you the

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.110 
the same page and I'll give you the
basics<00:01:06.620> to<00:01:06.680> get<00:01:06.920> started<00:01:07.370> there's<00:01:07.970> two

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
basics to get started there's two

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.520 
basics to get started there's two
different<00:01:08.240> kinds<00:01:08.659> of<00:01:08.720> slides<00:01:09.020> that<00:01:09.260> are<00:01:09.380> you

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
different kinds of slides that are you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.649 
different kinds of slides that are you
generally<00:01:10.040> used<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.700> glass<00:01:10.940> slide<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.600> the

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
generally used the glass slide and the

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.490 
generally used the glass slide and the
brass<00:01:11.900> slide<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:13.360> prefer<00:01:14.360> this<00:01:14.510> one<00:01:14.570> because

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
brass slide I prefer this one because

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.180 
brass slide I prefer this one because
it's<00:01:15.620> a<00:01:15.710> heavy<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.900> it<00:01:17.900> kind<00:01:18.560> of<00:01:18.619> rests<00:01:18.860> itself

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
it's a heavy and it kind of rests itself

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.250 
it's a heavy and it kind of rests itself
on<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.490> strings<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.060> think<00:01:20.240> that<00:01:20.360> tone<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:21.049> me

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
on the strings I think that tone to me

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.380 
on the strings I think that tone to me
is<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.530> little<00:01:21.860> bit<00:01:22.010> thicker<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.640> which<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.210> like

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
is a little bit thicker to which I like

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.890 
is a little bit thicker to which I like
so<00:01:24.280> when<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:27.400> put<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.549> slide<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:29.240> your<00:01:29.479> hand

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
so when you put the slide on your hand

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.370 
so when you put the slide on your hand
the<00:01:30.710> ring<00:01:30.950> finger<00:01:31.479> is<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.540> good<00:01:32.869> place<00:01:33.080> for<00:01:33.260> it

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
the ring finger is a good place for it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.929 
the ring finger is a good place for it
to<00:01:33.439> be<00:01:33.619> because<00:01:33.920> these<00:01:34.040> two<00:01:34.250> fingers<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.729> kind

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
to be because these two fingers can kind

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.240 
to be because these two fingers can kind
of<00:01:35.000> drag<00:01:35.840> behind<00:01:36.260> it<00:01:36.380> and<00:01:36.530> mute<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.799> strings

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
of drag behind it and mute the strings

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.130 
of drag behind it and mute the strings
cuts<00:01:37.729> down<00:01:37.909> on<00:01:37.970> your<00:01:38.150> background<00:01:38.570> noise<00:01:38.810> which

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
cuts down on your background noise which

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.620 
cuts down on your background noise which
I<00:01:39.260> picked<00:01:39.470> up<00:01:39.560> from<00:01:39.710> Andy's<00:01:40.070> lesson<00:01:40.600> when<00:01:41.600> you

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
I picked up from Andy's lesson when you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.679 
I picked up from Andy's lesson when you
place<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:43.280> slide<00:01:43.549> on<00:01:43.850> your<00:01:44.060> strings<00:01:44.390> do<00:01:44.570> it

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
place the slide on your strings do it

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.359 
place the slide on your strings do it
very<00:01:44.930> lightly<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.560> don't<00:01:45.710> want<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:45.890> push<00:01:46.100> down

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
very lightly you don't want to push down

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.210 
very lightly you don't want to push down
or<00:01:46.700> just<00:01:46.759> gonna<00:01:46.970> sound<00:01:47.240> funky<00:01:47.650> so<00:01:49.509> place<00:01:51.220> the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
or just gonna sound funky so place the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.760 
or just gonna sound funky so place the
slide<00:01:52.580> very<00:01:52.909> lightly<00:01:53.240> on<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.600> string<00:01:53.900> strike

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
slide very lightly on the string strike

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.660 
slide very lightly on the string strike
the<00:01:54.920> string

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the string

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.020 
the string
and<00:01:57.670> then<00:01:59.070> can<00:02:00.070> move<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.370> slide<00:02:00.580> around<00:02:00.700> like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
and then can move the slide around like

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.380 
and then can move the slide around like
that<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:02.350> position<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.280> slide<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:04.210> very

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
that the position of the slide is very

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.600
