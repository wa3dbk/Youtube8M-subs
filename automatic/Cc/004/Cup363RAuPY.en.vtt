it's otherwise got white accents in the
talking<00:00:30.650> box<00:00:30.970> on<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.090> front<00:00:32.210> you<00:00:32.809> have<00:00:32.930> the

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
talking box on the front you have the

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.040 
talking box on the front you have the
fingerprint<00:00:33.530> detection<00:00:34.030> sensor<00:00:35.030> guess<00:00:35.870> imma

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
fingerprint detection sensor guess imma

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.759 
fingerprint detection sensor guess imma
need<00:00:36.140> your<00:00:36.379> fingerprint<00:00:36.830> that's<00:00:36.980> right<00:00:37.100> it<00:00:37.220> on

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
need your fingerprint that's right it on

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:46.419 
need your fingerprint that's right it on
so<00:00:39.769> strangely<00:00:42.010> tips<00:00:43.010> work<00:00:43.220> pretty<00:00:43.430> fast

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.220 

so<00:00:47.429> if<00:00:47.519> i<00:00:47.640> press<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.089> and<00:00:48.269> it's<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:49.140> not

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
so if i press it and it's not it's not

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.990 
so if i press it and it's not it's not
accepted<00:00:49.679> then<00:00:49.769> what<00:00:49.890> happens<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.399> for

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
accepted then what happens is for

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.180 
accepted then what happens is for
Jackson<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.929> won't<00:00:52.109> be<00:00:52.289> able<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.679> in<00:00:52.829> okay

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
Jackson you won't be able to get in okay

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.020 
Jackson you won't be able to get in okay
so<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.030> locked<00:00:54.180> down<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.820> seems

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so if it's locked down so it seems

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.459 
so if it's locked down so it seems
pretty<00:00:57.179> stupid<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.750> don't<00:00:57.960> let's<00:00:58.170> take<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> look

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
pretty stupid I don't let's take a look

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.560 
pretty stupid I don't let's take a look

above<00:06:08.300> 30

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
above 30

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.829 
above 30
obviously<00:06:11.650> just<00:06:11.830> FB<00:06:12.130> thing

00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:14.839 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:18.109 

I<00:06:15.889> don't<00:06:16.889> really<00:06:16.979> know<00:06:17.159> I<00:06:17.189> think<00:06:17.339> we'll<00:06:17.939> take<00:06:18.089> a

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:18.119 
I don't really know I think we'll take a

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:20.179 
I don't really know I think we'll take a
look<00:06:18.240> at<00:06:18.360> iOS<00:06:18.539> 7<00:06:19.080> and<00:06:19.169> more<00:06:19.379> depth<00:06:19.589> okay

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
look at iOS 7 and more depth okay

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.329 
look at iOS 7 and more depth okay
obviously<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:20.849> champagne<00:06:21.270> color<00:06:21.539> is<00:06:21.779> awesome

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:22.339 
obviously the champagne color is awesome

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.920 
obviously the champagne color is awesome
dual<00:06:23.339> LED<00:06:23.639> flash<00:06:23.789> I<00:06:24.300> guess<00:06:24.479> we<00:06:24.599> can<00:06:24.719> look<00:06:24.839> at

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
dual LED flash I guess we can look at

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.439 
dual LED flash I guess we can look at
that<00:06:24.990> see<00:06:25.949> if<00:06:26.009> we<00:06:26.039> can<00:06:26.219> see<00:06:26.430> it<00:06:26.460> light<00:06:26.729> up<00:06:26.759> turn

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 
that see if we can see it light up turn

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.730 
that see if we can see it light up turn
the<00:06:27.569> flash<00:06:27.779> off<00:06:28.159> warmer<00:06:29.159> in<00:06:29.249> the<00:06:29.339> photo

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
the flash off warmer in the photo

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.969 
the flash off warmer in the photo
of<00:06:31.130> course<00:06:31.340> this<00:06:31.490> on<00:06:31.840> it<00:06:32.840> is<00:06:33.289> better<00:06:33.530> that<00:06:33.650> way

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
of course this on it is better that way

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:35.790 
of course this on it is better that way
you<00:06:34.370> want

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
you want

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.710 
you want
we'll<00:06:36.340> try<00:06:36.490> that<00:06:36.669> again<00:06:36.759> you<00:06:37.210> can<00:06:37.360> even<00:06:37.449> tell

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
we'll try that again you can even tell

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.920 
we'll try that again you can even tell
right<00:06:37.930> there<00:06:37.960> yes

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.200 

so<00:06:42.440> you<00:06:42.500> see<00:06:42.770> the<00:06:42.889> two<00:06:43.039> LEDs<00:06:43.460> come<00:06:43.699> on<00:06:43.820> so<00:06:44.030> they

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
so you see the two LEDs come on so they

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.460 
so you see the two LEDs come on so they
can<00:06:44.389> mix<00:06:44.600> and<00:06:44.810> get<00:06:44.960> the<00:06:45.080> right<00:06:45.229> guard

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
can mix and get the right guard

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.350 
can mix and get the right guard
temperatures

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.390 

see<00:06:49.569> the<00:06:49.719> link

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.920 

needs<00:06:53.639> to<00:06:53.699> go<00:06:53.850> pretty<00:06:54.030> fast<00:06:54.210> even<00:06:54.630> than<00:06:54.780> it's

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
needs to go pretty fast even than it's

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.170 
needs to go pretty fast even than it's
doing<00:06:55.229> its<00:06:55.380> me<00:06:58.220> yeah<00:06:59.220> that's<00:06:59.699> that's<00:06:59.970> the

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
doing its me yeah that's that's the

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.730 
doing its me yeah that's that's the
thing<00:07:00.389> I<00:07:00.690> think<00:07:01.050> you'll<00:07:01.139> really<00:07:01.259> have<00:07:01.560> to

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 
thing I think you'll really have to

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.379 
thing I think you'll really have to
spend<00:07:01.949> a<00:07:01.979> lot<00:07:02.100> more<00:07:02.160> time<00:07:02.460> to<00:07:02.669> engage

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
spend a lot more time to engage

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.060 
spend a lot more time to engage
performance<00:07:04.110> you'll<00:07:04.289> obviously<00:07:04.380> the<00:07:04.800> ports

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
performance you'll obviously the ports

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.540 
performance you'll obviously the ports
of<00:07:05.160> iOS<00:07:05.580> that<00:07:05.759> are<00:07:05.880> smooth<00:07:06.150> are<00:07:06.360> still<00:07:06.630> smooth

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
of iOS that are smooth are still smooth

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.910 
of iOS that are smooth are still smooth
love<00:07:08.060> like<00:07:08.300> the<00:07:08.750> photos
