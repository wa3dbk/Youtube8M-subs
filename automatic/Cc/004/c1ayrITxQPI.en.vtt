but um if you have like a stinger or a

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.380 
but um if you have like a stinger or a
infinity<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:43.290> would<00:01:43.619> recommend<00:01:43.950> using<00:01:44.070> that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
infinity I would recommend using that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
infinity I would recommend using that
I'd<00:01:45.390> recommend<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> fire<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.979> um<00:01:47.130> since<00:01:47.340> I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
I'd recommend a fire one but um since I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.770 
I'd recommend a fire one but um since I
don't<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> I'm<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.270> gonna<00:01:48.390> I'll

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
don't have that I'm just gonna I'll

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.620 
don't have that I'm just gonna I'll
probably<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.560> stinger<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.040> um<00:01:50.759> anyways

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
probably go for a stinger but um anyways

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.450 
probably go for a stinger but um anyways
that's<00:01:51.869> why<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> chose<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.399> you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that's why I chose that and I think you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.539 
that's why I chose that and I think you

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
I was using that and then you go to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 
I was using that and then you go to
sound<00:02:04.740> some<00:02:04.860> voices<00:02:05.119> just<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> can

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
sound some voices just because you can

switch to a melee class or melee

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.870

know<00:04:14.239> mental<00:04:14.930> effect<00:04:15.200> it's<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.530> skill<00:04:15.769> kill<00:04:15.950> but

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
know mental effect it's a skill kill but

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.729 
know mental effect it's a skill kill but
you<00:04:16.220> can<00:04:16.400> it's<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.150> guaranteed<00:04:17.570> litem<00:04:18.080> on<00:04:18.200> fire

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
you can it's a guaranteed litem on fire

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.649 
you can it's a guaranteed litem on fire
you<00:04:18.950> would<00:04:19.070> actually<00:04:19.280> want<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.209> get<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.510> only

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
I don't know why they capped it at 200

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
can ignite them twice with this if you

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.940 
can ignite them twice with this if you

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
I could stamp wow that's actually I

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.480 
I could stamp wow that's actually I
don't<00:04:41.780> realize<00:04:42.290> that<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.190> really<00:04:43.370> good

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490
