00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.320
 very good hernandez esquivel station 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.740
 this and welcome to a new legend 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.050
 pokemon and today I bring you the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.550
 better perhaps mystery that is delivered 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.020
 will be to the channel, I always say that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.910
 but this time is that the truth that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.320
 it seems and is who is the father of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.510
 ketchup obviously this is a question 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.340
 that many of you will be 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.630
 gone through the head because there will be us 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.410
 called attention or for whatever 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.880
 but really this is something that is a 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 question that he has insisted during 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.870
 more than a decade and for this reason 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.000
 there are infinities of speculations 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.829
 about it both the father of 'the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.180
 as his grandfather knows they are 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.250
 pokémon trainers since 'the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.469
 belongs a lineage is a district one 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.300
 lineage of trainers pokémon the lord 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.129
 ketchum started its journey from the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.559
 village palette and came to green city in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.420
 only four days we also know that he 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.800
 he is very proud of his son so what 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.359
 he wants a lot 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
 all this previous we know thanks 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.949
 to chapter 2 of the series but after 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.810
 of the second chapter the dad of us never 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 it's more I mentioned 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.310
 the huge caress information originated 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.170
 several quite crazy theories even if 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.549
 there's the theory that they closed the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.310
 luc movie star action new 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.020
 may be the father of us but of these 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.140
 theories there are two that are the most 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.360
 famous giovanni is the father of ace in a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.009
 principle so it seemed he even knows that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.110
 the mother of as and giovani were brides 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.720
 in his adolescence according to pokemon light 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.880
 all this seemed to throw that giovani the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.289
 Max villain of the series was the father 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.880
 of the protagonist 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.380
 these same situations occurred in 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.670
 the famous star war movie 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.350
 luke I am your good father then by 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.479
 what not in pokemon but unfortunately 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.009
 after the appearance of new games and 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.390
 of the manga tomes can be 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.189
 confirm that giovani is not the father of 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.459
 fairy but he is father of silver the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.740
 rival redhead gold gold and silver and 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.799
 soul silver the teacher ou what is the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.060
 father of ace this is another expectations 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.770
 perhaps the craziest of all despite 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.149
 of being mathematically possible from 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.549
 according to the seats of each character 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.500
 it is very unlikely since a 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.599
 seeger and ever the have been linked as 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.549
 relatives of the in the series and their 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.500
 relatives that would then be gray 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.140
 something that in a certain way sounds 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.240
 it's nice besides in the story it 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.370
 Dad says the US is in a 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.410
 crossing as a pokémon trainer thing 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.880
 and still does not devote himself or 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.880
 simply sends you to complete the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.640
 Pokedex neither wear the teacher nor are they 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.350
 as parents that's a fact 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.120
 actually the father as never has 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.010
 had a role in the anime so I 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.630
 no male character that we see in 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.910
 the series could be considered the 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.740
 father of ace it is possible that the only 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.480
 times that the father could have left 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.410
 in the series is when he remembers moments 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.380
 of himself in the past 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.670
 There is a scene where he plays as a child 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.890
 is next to a man with his face 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.989
 blurred that caresses their practices will be 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.760
 that man the father of us and good guys 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.470
