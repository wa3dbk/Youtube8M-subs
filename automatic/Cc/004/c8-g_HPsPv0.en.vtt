specific times that is kind of weird but

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.789 
specific times that is kind of weird but
I<00:03:35.579> think<00:03:35.850> that's<00:03:36.269> what's<00:03:36.540> cool<00:03:36.720> about<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.019> okay

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
I think that's what's cool about it okay

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.850 
I think that's what's cool about it okay
with<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.280> plus<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.790> graphics<00:03:39.239> are<00:03:39.360> amazing

compared<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:41.010> what<00:03:41.280> yeah

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
compared to what yeah

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.290 
compared to what yeah
Pung<00:03:43.239> that's<00:03:44.140> debatable<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.310> point<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:45.700> this

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
Pung that's debatable the point is this

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.150 
Pung that's debatable the point is this
is<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> perfect<00:03:47.019> example<00:03:47.080> where<00:03:47.650> traditional

is a perfect example where traditional

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.979 
is a perfect example where traditional
challenging<00:03:48.580> gameplay<00:03:48.819> makes<00:03:49.330> that<00:03:49.720> great

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
challenging gameplay makes that great

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:50.550 
challenging gameplay makes that great
