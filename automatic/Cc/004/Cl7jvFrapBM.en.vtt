to<00:00:06.750> start<00:00:06.990> thinking<00:00:07.080> about<00:00:07.350> planting<00:00:07.890> bulbs

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
to start thinking about planting bulbs

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.549 
to start thinking about planting bulbs
and<00:00:08.580> here<00:00:09.540> at<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> garden<00:00:10.080> you've<00:00:10.200> probably

and here at the garden you've probably

yellow<00:00:13.920> sunny<00:00:14.280> daffodils<00:00:14.960> all<00:00:15.960> across<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
yellow sunny daffodils all across the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.029 
yellow sunny daffodils all across the
garden<00:00:16.949> also<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:18.090> vibrant<00:00:19.020> tones<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.560> tulips

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.310 
garden also the vibrant tones of tulips
as<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.460> bloom<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:21.510> there<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.779> another<00:00:21.810> way

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
as they bloom but there is another way

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
as they bloom but there is another way
to<00:00:22.380> use<00:00:23.010> bulbs<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.269> effective

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to use bulbs in a really effective

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.320 
to use bulbs in a really effective
manner<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.949> by<00:00:26.099> layering<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.939> bulbs

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
manner and that is by layering the bulbs

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.509 
manner and that is by layering the bulbs
rather<00:00:27.840> than<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.320> using<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.619> type<00:00:29.070> such<00:00:29.490> as

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
rather than just using one type such as

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.420 
rather than just using one type such as
having<00:00:30.029> all<00:00:30.179> daffodils<00:00:30.840> why<00:00:31.529> not<00:00:31.769> put<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.250> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
having all daffodils why not put in a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.580 
having all daffodils why not put in a
lot<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.820> different<00:00:32.969> types<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.870> extend<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
lot of different types to extend the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.740 
lot of different types to extend the
bloom<00:00:34.829> season<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:36.000> add<00:00:36.180> some<00:00:36.450> interest

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
bloom season and to add some interest

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.660 
bloom season and to add some interest

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.490 

now<00:02:48.700> even<00:02:49.090> though<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.420> bulb<00:02:49.600> looks<00:02:49.870> like<00:02:50.200> it's

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
now even though the bulb looks like it's

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.350 
now even though the bulb looks like it's
not<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.950> growing<00:02:51.460> or<00:02:51.610> living<00:02:51.790> thing<00:02:52.090> at<00:02:52.210> this

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
not a growing or living thing at this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.200 
not a growing or living thing at this
point<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:52.900> critical<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.380> water<00:02:53.710> them<00:02:53.950> in

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
point it's critical to water them in

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.700 
point it's critical to water them in
what<00:02:55.210> you<00:02:55.390> want<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.720> happen<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.440> want<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
what you want to happen is you want the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.800 
what you want to happen is you want the
root<00:02:57.010> system<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.490> start<00:02:57.760> growing<00:02:58.210> this<00:02:58.420> fall

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
root system to start growing this fall

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.020 
root system to start growing this fall
so<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.710> it<00:02:59.890> has<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.070> good<00:03:00.280> root<00:03:00.430> system<00:03:00.460> going

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
so that it has a good root system going

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.580 
so that it has a good root system going
into<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.360> spring<00:03:01.600> when<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.930> starts<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.320> grow

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
into the spring when it starts to grow

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.920 
into the spring when it starts to grow
so<00:03:03.370> after<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.790> get<00:03:03.910> everything<00:03:04.150> planted<00:03:04.780> you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
so after you get everything planted you

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.030 
so after you get everything planted you
want<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.200> go<00:03:05.320> in<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.590> give<00:03:05.710> them<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.890> good

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
want to go in and give them a good

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.220 
want to go in and give them a good
soaking<00:03:07.230> give<00:03:08.230> them<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> good<00:03:08.530> watering<00:03:10.080> in<00:03:11.080> a
