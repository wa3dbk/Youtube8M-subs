00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
is gonna be no exception to that because

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.870 
is gonna be no exception to that because
all<00:03:22.800> three<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.550> them<00:03:23.640> are<00:03:23.730> going<00:03:23.820> to

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
all three of them are going to

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.060 
all three of them are going to
contribute<00:03:24.210> immediately<00:03:24.960> with<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.620> losses

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
contribute immediately with the losses

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.170 
contribute immediately with the losses
that<00:03:26.190> we're<00:03:26.340> gonna<00:03:26.430> have<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.820> year<00:03:26.880> with

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
that we're gonna have this year with

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.480 
that we're gonna have this year with
four<00:03:27.450> seniors<00:03:28.230> graduating<00:03:28.740> it's<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.400> be

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
four seniors graduating it's going to be

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.280 
four seniors graduating it's going to be
difficult<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.030> replace<00:03:30.300> that<00:03:30.480> experience<00:03:31.110> but

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
difficult to replace that experience but

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.750 
difficult to replace that experience but
I<00:03:31.350> think<00:03:31.650> these<00:03:31.770> three<00:03:31.980> are<00:03:32.130> capable<00:03:32.520> of<00:03:32.610> doing

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
I think these three are capable of doing

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.940 
I think these three are capable of doing
it
