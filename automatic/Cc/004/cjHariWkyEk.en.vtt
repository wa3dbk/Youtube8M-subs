00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.279
 welcome dear 1000 base fans 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.199
 here from the european bike week in faak 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.080
 in the worst weather 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.130
 andreas the boss of van der beck can 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.990
 remember that it ever so 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.949
 was bad 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.840
 So now I believe I am 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.770
 Tenth time here and we have 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.899
 in between, sometimes rain 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.180
 but had such a continuous rain without 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.250
 no end in sight because there was never 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.170
 we still do what I want have a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 nice big tent with hot air 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.340
 tags where you can warm 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.219
 we just managed to get a sand pit here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 Enjoy a whole new model of yours 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.550
 can you explain it briefly what 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680
 it is all about 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.940
 something off the rack 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.649
 here is nothing from the bar up 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.489
 perhaps on the on the motor of it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.979
 from namibia from a current mirror 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.689
 otherwise everything is handmade with us and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.150
 no matter if you use the wheels the fork 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.950
 swing the frame is everything will be all 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.070
 Made with us that means you 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.320
 also consider such subtle ones 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.270
 at that time, systems never did 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.479
 what is the special about this 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 System as the trapezoid cable and 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.380
 special about this trapezoid cable is 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.790
 that they then worked by air pressure 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.630
 can be lowered and started up 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.250
 can be 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.630
 and if you are in this middle area 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.409
 fair it has a very good one 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.929
 suspension 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.329
 very good comfort the effect is 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.530
 just that you design here 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.240
 can do a lot more because yes 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 actually a rigid connection 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.189
 at least optically hate and thereby 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.899
 of course much more design inside 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.819
 fork can reinbringen than if you with 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.600
 Cable a2 straight pipes each other 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.789
 must connect 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.679
 So here we can get the swing from 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.659
 frames and of the whole are with 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.459
 absorb it while doing so on the spur 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.990
 to make a gift now I know so 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:02.640
 some groups oberberger and cruiser 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 and back and forth that's kind of something 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.979
 very own as is indeed something with 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.780
 worse, or so it is believed that racer 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.879
 one actually a further development 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.530
 our sporting line we we 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.780
 the drecks synonymous parts in the program 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.129
 but we are very low and very 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.260
 flat and do not have that much 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.459
 ground clearance and we are already 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.650
 started with relatively early too 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.629
 larger diameters to work around 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.200
 becomes optically as flat as possible 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.269
 hold 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.709
 despite all this, however, to ensure that 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.329
 you only drive reasonable inclinations 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.640
 can and something away from the whole 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.140
 advise grab something narrow again 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.970
 the whole story really color 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.560
 to get that one with one too 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.049
 sporting approach to things can move 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.840
 and what are the most popular ones now 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.540
 groups I think so sports afterwards 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.120
 four swords taboga cousin front tire 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.250
 what are they so the tags on the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120
 Most leads through the most 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.239
 carry out 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.099
 do we ever whichever which 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.389
 range of the deep but basically 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.319
 I believe in everything we do 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.260
 most sports 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.370
 but these are the least slightest 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.989
 effort was 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.209
 the athletes are not so massive 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.919
 rebuilt where the software 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.500
 Models is already properly received 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:12.540
 and also with the baker models goes 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.970
 it also really into the full and who 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.880
 can buy something like that now 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.989
 depending on each one of the over the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.780
 have required small change 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.250
 logically so here it has to be 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.390
 bring a little more, I think 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.980
 here we are at 70,000 euros approximately 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.110
 but of course you also get one 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.000
 completely independent motorcycle at the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.310
 copy nowhere to have to have 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.530
 well is still five-digit is okay 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.940
 then I would say maybe you say 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.840
 me a few others rebuilt the 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.840
 standing around here like this
