00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
reading your surgery so I'm going to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.789 
reading your surgery so I'm going to
take<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> spools<00:01:07.950> off<00:01:09.380> surgeries<00:01:10.380> use<00:01:10.560> these

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
take the spools off surgeries use these

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.010 
take the spools off surgeries use these
kind<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.100> schools<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.479> thread<00:01:12.810> has

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
kind of schools because the thread has

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.429 
kind of schools because the thread has
to<00:01:13.229> pull<00:01:13.439> really<00:01:13.619> fast<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:15.750> uses<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.110> lot<00:01:16.380> of

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to pull really fast and it uses a lot of

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.550 
to pull really fast and it uses a lot of
thread<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.180> use<00:01:18.479> regular<00:01:19.080> thread<00:01:19.350> on

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
thread and if you use regular thread on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.820 
thread and if you use regular thread on
it<00:01:19.710> like<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.720> there's<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.200> there's<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
it like this there's a little there's a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.480 
it like this there's a little there's a
little<00:01:22.979> notch<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.060> pool<00:01:24.979> where<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
little notch in this pool where the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.929 
little notch in this pool where the
thread<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.850> hooked<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.930> they<00:01:28.080> sell<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.939> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
thread is hooked when they sell it you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.780 
thread is hooked when they sell it you
see<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:31.560> can't<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:31.920> see<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.520> can

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
see you can't really see it but you can

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.690 
see you can't really see it but you can
see<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.240> cut<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> thread<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
see that it cut the thread so if you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.060 
see that it cut the thread so if you
pull<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.390> thread<00:01:36.659> off<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.049> spool<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.860> in

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
pull the thread off this spool this in

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.090 
pull the thread off this spool this in
this<00:01:38.490> direction<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.200> catch<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this direction it can catch on that and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.020 
this direction it can catch on that and
break<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:42.479> keep<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.869> from<00:01:43.110> happening

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
break it to keep that from happening

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.210 
break it to keep that from happening
sergers<00:01:45.030> come<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.479> these<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.990> things<00:01:46.220> so

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
sergers come with these little things so

sergers come with these little things so
if<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.460> want<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> use<00:01:47.820> regular<00:01:48.210> thread<00:01:48.540> you

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
if you want to use regular thread you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
if you want to use regular thread you
put<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.799> up<00:01:49.920> will<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:53.479> and

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
manual thread is the needle and the

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.330 
manual thread is the needle and the
needle<00:05:23.380> not<00:05:23.800> just<00:05:24.580> got<00:05:25.449> to<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:25.840> needle<00:05:26.340> the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
needle not just got to the needle the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.149 
needle not just got to the needle the
needle<00:05:27.509> the<00:05:28.509> knot<00:05:28.870> won't<00:05:29.139> pull<00:05:29.380> through<00:05:29.860> the

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
needle but it will pull through the

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.219 
needle but it will pull through the
