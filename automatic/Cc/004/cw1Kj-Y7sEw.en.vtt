00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.880
 it was several years that I can 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.690
 I started in 2006 the first field 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.720
 agroforestry and then wire in 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.130
 needle we have almost 18 hectares the on 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.020
 the 40 which are of a comfort and story 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.150
 is a moment is said like we will be able 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.750
 maybe do an orchard 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.430
 why not my motivation she was 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.850
 also pushed by the fact that I'm in 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.800
 direct sales we made poultry from 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.630
 black pork we have a small shop 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.130
 people come from friday afternoon 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.480
 and we said we 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.519
 maybe we could lend them 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.010
 fruit trees that people would pick up or 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.500
 for a mason will see and it's like that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.320
 that was born the idea of ​​doing it is binds 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.969
 about sixty fruit trees 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:56.640
 we put cherry pear trees 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.429
 peaches do not take too much because we 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 we love them and we are almost 5 km 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.519
 hedges on the farm since we 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.530
 arrived at the wharf mists do not have 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.850
 need to put them here necessarily for 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.080
 this is the first to combine peaches 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.330
 cherry apricot trees before having done 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.820
 these rows of fruit trees I made 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.780
 of open field agroforestry so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.390
 we 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.530
 we're actually coming back to the same idea that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.280
 traditionally agroforestry 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.860
 that is, art will bring 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.770
 biodiversity ie it is 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.640
 where to stay 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.359
 all the auxiliaries 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.670
 especially so who says hosting these 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.539
 to feed it to reproduce it is the ratio 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.700
 soil erosion 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.979
 having a little hillside 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.469
 steep as by us lines 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.110
 trees that actually stop in particular 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.750
 water runoff after the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.670
 fertility by the roots which each and 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.890
 dies and renews itself by the leaves 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.610
 who fall so I was going to say his 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.439
 allies actually the dollar more interest 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.170
 of the fruit these are these valuations a 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.159
 a little bit more important 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.060
 we're going to say since I'm going to shoot a 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.739
 income from his fruits not roger too 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.599
 manage agroforestry the referees 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.709
 and to densify a little bit because 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.120
 term it will be tadpole trees that 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.120
 are two months to the jets 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.080
 you are and help you are done 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.880
 advise by someone to implement 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.700
 these lines of fruit trees 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.220
 I have worked so since 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.890
 beginning with tree and landscape 32 for this 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.380
 which was from setting up after to 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.330
 fruit level I betrayed someone 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.860
 locally who does the transplants or from where 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.110
 no regrets, it depends on the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.730
 varieties and it's someone who 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.930
 has been working here for a long time on 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.880
 poles of ancient varieties 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.510
 that's where I met like that and 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.210
 so I'm going to buy her 60's and 70's 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.860
 spacing plants anyway compared 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.640
 other plots that manages 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.560
 agroforestry 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.450
 we decided to be a little bit more 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.560
 tight why because it's 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.810
 trees that will initially be a lot 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.980
 less big since we will go 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.080
 work to be able to pick 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.570
 so we could afford to have 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.600
 lower states and spacings 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.580
 why general on the farm gd 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.580
 spacing of 24 m whereas here we are 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.150
 sure all in between there is only 12 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.709
 So that's also leaving we'll say 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.760
 that there is a density a little bit more 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.019
 important 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.489
 per hectare we opted to mix the 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.040
 trees we did not see a row of 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.209
 apricot trees a little row 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.510
 like in the air on and looking to 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.950
 have diversity so that in case of 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.220
 disease on a tree to everyone on the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.079
 take 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.640
 that's bringing diversity is 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.549
 always good to put diversity 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.459
 now here I am I read apricots 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.769
 in the hand it's an art that then has 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.989
 seven Caesars let's pretend I'm wrong 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.519
 to be about four five years old so 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.590
 it starts a little bit in production 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.400
 it's still light but it's a miracle 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.840
 in here it does not come necessarily 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.549
 competition is in competition with 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.459
 moments that require a lot of work 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.159
 I think especially the winter size where 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.120
 that quietly manage at times 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.359
 where we took a little bit less 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.359
 job 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.169
 tell me I planted only 60 trees 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.259
 maybe I should have made one 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.759
 little more 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:27.340
 if I planted 10 trees each 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.979
 variety for example apricots i'm going 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.330
 to have six apricot weapons I'm not going 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.370
 make tons of non- folded apricots with 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.190
 so a moment if I want to put in 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.090
 place of direct selling with 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.220
 picking at the farm 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.840
 Is it not therefore just missed 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.699
 maybe I should redo a little bit 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.289
 of money on the island after what is 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.330
 important if I have any advice to give 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.770
 it is necessary to train for weapons 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.880
 in fact you have to learn how to carve 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.289
 must be bad and it takes time 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.970
 I realize myself a little on the sphere 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.620
 especially however to be able to see a 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.650
 little more time before its creation 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.650
 things despite his well- departed value
