that though it's not actually that

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.240 
that though it's not actually that
expensive<00:02:48.109> in<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.349> first<00:02:48.650> place<00:02:48.889> and<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.129> can

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
expensive in the first place and you can

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.069
