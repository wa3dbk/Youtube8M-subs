00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
the front of your apps and that's just

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.670

it's not efficient and yeah I know that

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.770 
it's not efficient and yeah I know that

and I'm afraid I do have many senior

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.850 
and I'm afraid I do have many senior
moments<00:04:55.210> where<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.330> sit<00:04:55.570> there<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:55.870> go<00:04:55.960> what

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
moments where I sit there and go what

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.810 
moments where I sit there and go what
was<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.040> thing<00:04:57.130> with<00:04:57.220> the<00:04:57.280> application<00:04:57.730> I

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
was the thing with the application I

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.910 
was the thing with the application I
wanted<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.180> use<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.570> can't<00:04:59.080> remember<00:04:59.290> it<00:04:59.500> well<00:04:59.890> I

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
wanted to use I can't remember it well I

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.550 
wanted to use I can't remember it well I
have<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.370> go<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:01.050> starting<00:05:02.050> zedge<00:05:02.320> the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
matter click on that then have to start

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.970 
matter click on that then have to start
scrolling<00:05:04.450> through<00:05:04.810> this<00:05:04.960> horrible<00:05:05.230> miss<00:05:05.710> and

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
scrolling through this horrible miss and

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.290 
scrolling through this horrible miss and
it's<00:05:06.670> not<00:05:06.940> conducive<00:05:07.240> to<00:05:08.490> easy<00:05:09.490> location<00:05:10.060> and

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
it's not conducive to easy location and

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.970 
it's not conducive to easy location and
software<00:05:10.660> now<00:05:10.990> of<00:05:11.140> course<00:05:11.290> there<00:05:11.560> are<00:05:11.710> some

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
software now of course there are some

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.160 
software now of course there are some
good<00:05:12.190> things<00:05:12.220> about<00:05:12.550> Windows<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.420> start<00:05:14.020> menu

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
good things about Windows a start menu

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.590 
good things about Windows a start menu
they've<00:05:14.500> expanded<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.250> ability<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.970> just

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
they've expanded the ability to just

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.270 
they've expanded the ability to just
type<00:05:16.870> in<00:05:17.080> something<00:05:17.350> so<00:05:17.770> if<00:05:17.920> I<00:05:18.040> know<00:05:18.100> my

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
type in something so if I know my

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.700 
type in something so if I know my
program<00:05:18.820> started<00:05:19.240> with<00:05:19.360> power<00:05:19.630> then<00:05:20.290> obvious

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
program started with power then obvious

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.130 
program started with power then obvious
to<00:05:20.920> type<00:05:21.430> in<00:05:21.640> power<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.150> all<00:05:22.300> my<00:05:22.480> power<00:05:22.810> stuff

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
to type in power and all my power stuff

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.140 
to type in power and all my power stuff
would<00:05:23.380> turn<00:05:23.410> up<00:05:23.770> and<00:05:24.010> if<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.430> perhaps<00:05:24.670> wasn't

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
would turn up and if it perhaps wasn't

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.090 
would turn up and if it perhaps wasn't
the<00:05:25.210> program<00:05:25.660> it<00:05:25.810> was<00:05:25.900> a<00:05:25.990> setting<00:05:26.230> then<00:05:26.890> it

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
the program it was a setting then it

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.260 
the program it was a setting then it
would<00:05:27.190> all<00:05:27.310> appear<00:05:27.640> there<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.090> you've<00:05:28.180> got

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
would all appear there and you've got

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.540 
would all appear there and you've got
files<00:05:28.630> with<00:05:29.020> power<00:05:29.380> in<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.800> that's<00:05:30.340> all<00:05:30.520> very

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
files with power in and that's all very

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.040 
files with power in and that's all very
well<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:30.940> that's<00:05:31.210> quite<00:05:31.420> nice<00:05:31.630> at<00:05:31.900> ease<00:05:32.020> a

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
well and that's quite nice at ease a

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.980 
well and that's quite nice at ease a
feature<00:05:32.320> I<00:05:32.470> actually<00:05:32.680> like<00:05:33.010> of<00:05:33.220> Windows<00:05:34.060> the

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
feature I actually like of Windows the

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.710 
feature I actually like of Windows the
windows<00:05:35.350> start<00:05:35.590> menu<00:05:35.710> but<00:05:36.400> the<00:05:37.120> amount<00:05:37.510> of

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
windows start menu but the amount of

this mess bugs me it might only be five
minutes<00:07:36.400> and<00:07:36.490> might<00:07:36.610> only<00:07:36.730> be<00:07:36.820> 10<00:07:37.150> minutes

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360
