 much to improve your postural control 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.879

 nowadays basketball is increasingly 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.830
 physical every time there is more contact 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.990
 between the players a good control 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.780
 postural will help you once you have 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.210
 gone from your defender in one against one 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.830
 or after a direct block when it comes out 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.780
 an aid that is usually of a man 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.600
 big that comes out very aggressive and to the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.640
 contact to finish well in your 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.309
 entry or in your shot and even make a 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.629
 2 plus 1 or create shots for the others 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.450
 players who are who they are 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.160
 open today I bring you an exercise that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.230
 you can do together with a partner or 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.460
 with your coach you just need a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.460
 soccer and a lot of desire 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.710
 exercise to work stability 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.330
 dynamics and postural control of the player 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.970
 in the contacts when penetrating towards the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.830
 basket the player with the ball stands in 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.990
 the line of 3 where in the first cone 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.729
 makes a change of hand by moving 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.310
 until the second to make a 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.960
 penetration to basket the defender in 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.700
 this case a partner or coach 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.680
 is in the low post on that same side 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.750
 with football as soon as the player is 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.970
 coming out of the second cone goes out to do 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.100
 a help to the high pole 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.020
 the penetrating player must decide by 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.670
 which side to end the entry according to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.950
 orientation of the body and feet of 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.470
 defender which will push with football 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.330
 simulating contact with the player at 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.950
 being an unstable material hinders the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.649
 stability and postural control of 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.330
 attacking player the completion must 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.250
 keep the center of gravity low 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.200
 before making the jump or we 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.270
 unbalance we have in contact and we 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.610
 we will jump well lowering the efficiency of 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.500
 the entrance a very complete exercise 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.509
 where you can make quantity of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.899
 variants we will do it for both 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.479
