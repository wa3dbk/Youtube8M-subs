fine I'm sure the 3rd gen should work in

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.590 
fine I'm sure the 3rd gen should work in
2nd<00:01:56.610> gen<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.090> ridiculous

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
they don't but uh also the nvidia

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.940 
they don't but uh also the nvidia
graphics<00:02:02.400> cards<00:02:02.670> based<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.119> Kepler<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.229> Fermi

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
graphics cards based on Kepler and Fermi

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.980 
graphics cards based on Kepler and Fermi
and<00:02:04.979> Maxwell<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.850> that's<00:02:06.119> pretty<00:02:06.810> sweet

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and Maxwell and that's pretty sweet

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.889 
and Maxwell and that's pretty sweet
because<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.250> guys<00:02:08.369> don't<00:02:08.489> know<00:02:08.670> Fermi<00:02:09.119> was

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
because if you guys don't know Fermi was

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.590 
because if you guys don't know Fermi was
like<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> GTX<00:02:10.619> 5-series<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.850> don't<00:02:12.000> know<00:02:12.390> if<00:02:12.510> it

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
like the GTX 5-series I don't know if it

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.690 
like the GTX 5-series I don't know if it
was<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.750> 4<00:02:12.959> series<00:02:13.260> as<00:02:13.350> well<00:02:13.530> but<00:02:14.340> that's<00:02:14.459> like

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
was the 4 series as well but that's like

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.870 
was the 4 series as well but that's like
2011<00:02:15.510> cars<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.959> pretty<00:02:16.319> old<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:17.700> you're

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
2011 cars is pretty old so if you're

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.309 
2011 cars is pretty old so if you're
still<00:02:18.000> running<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.300> car<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.690> old<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.140> you're

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
still running a car that old and you're

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.190 
still running a car that old and you're
set<00:02:19.970> for<00:02:20.970> your<00:02:21.420> text<00:02:21.690> well<00:02:21.840> that's<00:02:22.050> pretty

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
set for your text well that's pretty

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.390 
set for your text well that's pretty
sweet<00:02:22.290> they're<00:02:22.650> covering<00:02:22.920> all<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:24.209> also<00:02:25.400> AMD

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
sweet they're covering all that also AMD

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.010 
sweet they're covering all that also AMD
graphics<00:02:26.610> core<00:02:26.970> next<00:02:27.000> graphics<00:02:27.750> card<00:02:27.930> so

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
graphics core next graphics card so

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.530 
graphics core next graphics card so
that's<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.380> 7000<00:02:28.980> series<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.610> up<00:02:29.819> so

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
that's like the 7000 series and up so

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.570 
that's like the 7000 series and up so
that's<00:02:30.600> like<00:02:30.810> 2012<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:32.190> when<00:02:32.459> those

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
that's like 2012 and up is when those

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.780 
that's like 2012 and up is when those
came<00:02:32.730> out<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.239> that's<00:02:33.480> pretty<00:02:33.690> sweet<00:02:33.810> um<00:02:34.790> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
came out so that's pretty sweet um and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.090 
came out so that's pretty sweet um and
I'm<00:02:36.420> hoping<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:37.050> compare<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.590> mantle

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
I'm hoping it can compare to mantle

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.630 
I'm hoping it can compare to mantle
because<00:02:38.459> mental<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.920> works<00:02:41.130> pretty<00:02:41.310> well<00:02:41.459> but

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
because mental it works pretty well but

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.809 
because mental it works pretty well but
it<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.390> needs<00:02:42.600> some<00:02:42.780> more<00:02:42.900> fine<00:02:43.200> men<00:02:43.440> and

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
it just needs some more fine men and

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.030 
it just needs some more fine men and
it's<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:45.060> stupid<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.840> small<00:02:46.319> roads<00:02:46.680> and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
it's just stupid that small roads and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.670 
it's just stupid that small roads and
AMD<00:02:47.459> cards<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.209> I'm<00:02:48.780> still<00:02:49.049> running<00:02:49.200> battles

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
AMD cards but I'm still running battles

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680 
AMD cards but I'm still running battles
with<00:02:49.769> four<00:02:50.040> at<00:02:50.250> 70<00:02:50.700> FPS<00:02:51.030> or<00:02:51.150> tomorrow<00:02:51.420> with<00:02:51.540> my

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
with four at 70 FPS or tomorrow with my

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.770 
with four at 70 FPS or tomorrow with my
970<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.470> not<00:02:53.220> really<00:02:53.370> complaining<00:02:53.720> but<00:02:54.720> uh

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
970 so not really complaining but uh

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.199 
970 so not really complaining but uh
yeah<00:02:55.590> darkest<00:02:56.040> flow<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.459> what<00:02:56.880> Direct<00:02:57.090> X

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
yeah darkest flow is what Direct X

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.250 
yeah darkest flow is what Direct X
really<00:02:57.420> needs<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.900> just<00:02:58.080> similar

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
really needs is just similar

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.550 
really needs is just similar
optimization<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.190> it'll<00:02:59.880> be<00:02:59.940> pretty<00:03:00.060> sweet

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
optimization and it'll be pretty sweet

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.640 
optimization and it'll be pretty sweet
and<00:03:01.610> something<00:03:02.610> that's<00:03:03.540> come<00:03:04.049> up<00:03:04.079> in<00:03:04.290> my<00:03:04.320> life

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
and something that's come up in my life

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.960 
and something that's come up in my life
is<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.040> got<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> free<00:03:05.489> pc<00:03:05.850> right<00:03:06.030> recently<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.910> was

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
is I got a free pc right recently it was

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.170 
is I got a free pc right recently it was
given<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.269> me<00:03:09.420> by<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.959> friend<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:11.180> it's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
given to me by a friend and it's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.300 
given to me by a friend and it's
actually<00:03:12.299> pretty<00:03:12.840> decent<00:03:13.079> ins<00:03:13.410> got<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.620> core<00:03:14.160> i5

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
actually pretty decent ins got a core i5

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.830 
actually pretty decent ins got a core i5
750<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.600> from<00:03:16.079> 2009<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.880> pops<00:03:18.150> 8

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
750 so it's from 2009 and I pops 8

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.289 
750 so it's from 2009 and I pops 8
gigabytes<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.380> ram<00:03:19.590> into<00:03:19.859> it<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.970> upgraded

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
gigabytes of ram into it and I upgraded

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.430 
gigabytes of ram into it and I upgraded
the<00:03:21.450> cooler<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.109> cooler<00:03:22.799> master<00:03:23.220> hyper<00:03:23.250> t4

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
the cooler to a cooler master hyper t4

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.069 
the cooler to a cooler master hyper t4
it<00:03:25.440> was<00:03:25.560> on<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.709> stock<00:03:26.010> Intel<00:03:26.400> cool<00:03:26.609> or<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:27.079> coated

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
it was on a stock Intel cool or a coated

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.470 
it was on a stock Intel cool or a coated
in<00:03:28.170> dust<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.709> thing<00:03:29.489> hit<00:03:29.670> like<00:03:29.850> 86<00:03:30.239> degrees

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
in dust and thing hit like 86 degrees

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.920 
in dust and thing hit like 86 degrees
celsius<00:03:31.049> at<00:03:31.200> stock<00:03:31.470> Swedes<00:03:32.120> prime95<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.660> it's

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
celsius at stock Swedes prime95 so it's

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.740 
celsius at stock Swedes prime95 so it's
pretty<00:03:34.079> ridiculous<00:03:34.820> but<00:03:35.820> now<00:03:36.000> i<00:03:36.030> overclocked

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
pretty ridiculous but now i overclocked

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.910 
pretty ridiculous but now i overclocked
it<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.989> 3.5<00:03:37.500> gigahertz<00:03:37.859> and

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
it to 3.5 gigahertz and

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.820 
it to 3.5 gigahertz and
and<00:03:39.520> only<00:03:39.670> hits<00:03:39.940> like<00:03:40.120> 65<00:03:41.020> degrees<00:03:41.319> Celsius<00:03:41.709> in

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
and only hits like 65 degrees Celsius in

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.640 
and only hits like 65 degrees Celsius in
prime95<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.550> that's<00:03:42.700> pretty<00:03:43.060> nice<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.650> popped

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
prime95 so that's pretty nice I popped

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.900 
prime95 so that's pretty nice I popped
my<00:03:44.800> old<00:03:45.160> HT<00:03:45.760> 7050<00:03:46.360> in<00:03:46.450> there<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:47.819> cleaned<00:03:48.819> it

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
my old HT 7050 in there and cleaned it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.910 
my old HT 7050 in there and cleaned it
out<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.060> little<00:03:49.270> bit<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:50.590> I'm<00:03:50.770> debating

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
out a little bit and I'm debating

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.320 
out a little bit and I'm debating
whether<00:03:51.310> i<00:03:51.370> want<00:03:51.520> to<00:03:51.550> sell<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.790> or<00:03:52.000> keep<00:03:52.060> it

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
whether i want to sell it or keep it

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.570 
whether i want to sell it or keep it
it's<00:03:52.930> got<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.170> 550<00:03:53.830> watt<00:03:54.010> power<00:03:54.250> supply<00:03:54.310> and

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
it's got a 550 watt power supply and

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.260 
it's got a 550 watt power supply and
it's<00:03:55.020> it's<00:03:56.020> okay<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:57.069> 80<00:03:57.520> plus<00:03:57.790> or<00:03:58.000> five<00:03:58.239> and

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
it's it's okay it's 80 plus or five and

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.740 
it's it's okay it's 80 plus or five and
it's<00:03:58.600> antec<00:03:59.380> though<00:03:59.730> it's<00:04:00.730> an<00:04:00.850> antec<00:04:01.150> basic<00:04:01.600> I

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
it's antec though it's an antec basic I

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.510 
it's antec though it's an antec basic I
don't<00:04:01.900> know<00:04:01.959> if<00:04:02.020> I<00:04:02.080> trust<00:04:02.110> that<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.800> it's<00:04:03.370> just

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
don't know if I trust that and it's just

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.340 
don't know if I trust that and it's just
kind<00:04:03.670> of<00:04:03.700> old<00:04:03.910> so<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.810> don't<00:04:04.900> know<00:04:05.019> if<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.319> should

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
kind of old so I don't know if I should

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.370 
kind of old so I don't know if I should
just<00:04:05.739> sell<00:04:06.550> it<00:04:06.700> i<00:04:06.850> can<00:04:07.000> probably<00:04:07.269> get<00:04:07.480> thinking

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
just sell it i can probably get thinking

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.979 
just sell it i can probably get thinking
maybe<00:04:08.530> five<00:04:08.769> hundred<00:04:09.069> dollars<00:04:09.310> for<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.550> and

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
maybe five hundred dollars for it and

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.660 
maybe five hundred dollars for it and
i'm<00:04:10.989> thinking<00:04:11.050> of<00:04:11.500> building<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.950> new<00:04:12.310> system

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
i'm thinking of building a new system

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.819 
i'm thinking of building a new system
based<00:04:12.910> on<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.180> athlon<00:04:13.630> ii<00:04:13.900> 60<00:04:14.440> k<00:04:16.049> 80<00:04:17.049> 60<00:04:17.410> k<00:04:17.650> and

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
based on the athlon ii 60 k 80 60 k and

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.479 
based on the athlon ii 60 k 80 60 k and
then<00:04:17.889> r7<00:04:18.459> 260x<00:04:19.590> because<00:04:20.590> this<00:04:20.739> pc<00:04:21.160> i<00:04:21.190> don't

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
then r7 260x because this pc i don't

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.830 
then r7 260x because this pc i don't
know<00:04:21.579> if<00:04:21.669> it's<00:04:21.790> the<00:04:21.850> Wi-Fi<00:04:22.210> card<00:04:22.450> that's<00:04:22.630> in<00:04:22.720> it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
know if it's the Wi-Fi card that's in it

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.360 
know if it's the Wi-Fi card that's in it
but<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.139> takes<00:04:23.320> like<00:04:23.590> 10<00:04:23.800> minutes<00:04:24.040> to<00:04:24.250> load

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
but it takes like 10 minutes to load

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.190 
but it takes like 10 minutes to load
into<00:04:24.520> battlefield<00:04:25.000> 4<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.780> it's<00:04:26.080> on<00:04:26.169> a

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
into battlefield 4 and it's on a

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.290 
into battlefield 4 and it's on a
traditional<00:04:26.650> hard<00:04:26.830> drives<00:04:27.130> WD<00:04:27.610> green<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.150> I

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
traditional hard drives WD green and I

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.090 
traditional hard drives WD green and I
defragment<00:04:28.930> today<00:04:29.169> cuz<00:04:29.380> like<00:04:29.560> forty<00:04:29.889> percent

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
defragment today cuz like forty percent

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.730 
defragment today cuz like forty percent
fragmented<00:04:30.729> but<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.720> shouldn't<00:04:32.470> be<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.560> long

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
fragmented but it shouldn't be that long

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.460 
fragmented but it shouldn't be that long
wait<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.760> launch<00:04:34.030> battlefield<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:35.229> I'm

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
wait to launch battlefield so I'm

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.260 
wait to launch battlefield so I'm
probably<00:04:35.950> gonna<00:04:36.100> pray<00:04:36.310> at<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.430> Wi-Fi<00:04:37.030> card

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
probably gonna pray at the Wi-Fi card

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.690 
probably gonna pray at the Wi-Fi card
with<00:04:37.419> one<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.660> have<00:04:37.900> laying<00:04:38.470> around<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:39.040> we'll
