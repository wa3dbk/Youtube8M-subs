 residential complex for us holds 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.870
 main theme of the project 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.540
 Alexey veteran reason more than visa

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.050
 the call is working 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.300

 spacious hall and apartment corridor 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.729
 I beg 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:15.170
 here you can plan 25 options 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.479
 including the so-called euro apartments 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.490
 with combined kitchen and living room 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.590
 while the tenants have the opportunity 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.740
 vary the space in its own way 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.940
 discretion that here is very good good 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.320
 . 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.660
 this is the whole configuration 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:41.780
 partitions theoretically and practically 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:45.140
 can be changed as partitions 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.440
 made of tongue- and -groove blocks 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.800
 this is all easily dismantled when 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.810
 necessities are the brightest apartments 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.450
 butts which go directly to two 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.979
 sides of the color she has high floors to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.030
 achieve better light and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.610
 extension pro pro 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.680
 builders applied the original than 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.200
 above floor 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.080

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.620
 the greater the area of â€‹â€‹the glazing turned out 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.319

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.209
 panoramic windows naturally and lower 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.430

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.060
 deaf without possibility 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.650

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.980
 window blocks newcomers do not have to 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:40.680
 it means the window blocks are made of 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:44.580
 mare profiles here are 7 10 millimeter 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.630

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.140

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:14.680
 air conditioning in every single 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.299

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.400

 so with such readiness and 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.400
 it will be easy to start repair 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.829
