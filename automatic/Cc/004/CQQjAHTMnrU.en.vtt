and<00:00:03.270> today<00:00:03.600> I've<00:00:03.929> got<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.319> theory<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.859> see<00:00:05.130> I've

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
and today I've got a theory you see I've

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.550 
and today I've got a theory you see I've
got<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:05.940> theory<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.540> maybe<00:00:06.870> just<00:00:07.109> just

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
got this theory that maybe just just

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.320 
got this theory that maybe just just
maybe<00:00:07.890> if<00:00:08.099> I<00:00:08.250> combine<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.849> moon<00:00:09.090> gravity

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
maybe if I combine the moon gravity

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.169 
maybe if I combine the moon gravity
cheat<00:00:09.750> with<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:11.070> flying<00:00:11.460> bike<00:00:11.790> cheat<00:00:12.059> or

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
cheat with the the flying bike cheat or

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.549 
cheat with the the flying bike cheat or
whatever<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.019> showed<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.320> guys<00:00:13.469> a

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
while back that I might just might be

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.359 
while back that I might just might be
able<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.990> jump<00:00:16.350> all<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.560> way<00:00:16.650> from<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.980> top<00:00:17.190> of

able to jump all the way from the top of
Mount<00:00:17.490> chiliad<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:18.480> inner<00:00:18.840> city<00:00:18.930> lo<00:00:19.770> Santos<00:00:20.279> if

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
Mount chiliad to inner city lo Santos if

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.929 
Mount chiliad to inner city lo Santos if
not<00:00:20.699> farther<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.420> that's<00:00:21.990> why<00:00:22.199> oh<00:00:23.010> man<00:00:23.699> man

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
anyways that is what I wanted to try out

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.089 
anyways that is what I wanted to try out
today<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:27.990> as<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.439> see<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.800> I've

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
today so as you can see here I've

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.859 
today so as you can see here I've
already<00:00:29.279> got<00:00:29.519> my<00:00:29.670> my<00:00:30.119> moon<00:00:30.269> gravity<00:00:30.480> cheat

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
already got my my moon gravity cheat

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.770 
already got my my moon gravity cheat
enabled<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.880> yeah<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:33.090> only<00:00:33.390> using

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
enabled here and yeah with only using

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.180 
enabled here and yeah with only using
that<00:00:33.899> cheat<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.290> think<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.770> might<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:34.980> able

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
that cheat I think that I might be able

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 
that cheat I think that I might be able
to<00:00:35.280> jump<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.820> Los<00:00:36.030> Santos<00:00:36.210> if<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.840> works<00:00:37.079> out

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
to jump to Los Santos if this works out

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.860 
to jump to Los Santos if this works out
I<00:00:37.290> how<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> expect<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.120> that's<00:00:39.629> what

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
I how I expect it to so that's what

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.330 
I how I expect it to so that's what
we're<00:00:39.960> gonna<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.200> trying<00:00:40.500> out<00:00:40.620> today<00:00:40.829> let<00:00:41.250> me

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
we're gonna be trying out today let me

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.790 
we're gonna be trying out today let me
see<00:00:41.579> how<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.940> want<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.480> line<00:00:43.050> myself<00:00:43.290> up

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
see how do I want to line myself up

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.630 
see how do I want to line myself up
assuming<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.670> works<00:00:44.879> um<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.430> looks

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
assuming it works um that that looks

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.940 
assuming it works um that that looks
pretty<00:00:47.789> good<00:00:47.910> we're<00:00:48.840> gonna<00:00:48.989> we're<00:00:49.620> gonna<00:00:49.710> go

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
pretty good we're gonna we're gonna go

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.069 
pretty good we're gonna we're gonna go
with<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> hope<00:00:51.930> this

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
with that so here we go I hope this

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
with that so here we go I hope this
works<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.250> theory<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.640> correct<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
works if my theory is correct then I

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.310 
works if my theory is correct then I
will<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:55.110> flying<00:00:55.649> across<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.449> city<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.809> make

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
will go flying across the city and make

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.240 
will go flying across the city and make
it<00:00:58.469> all<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> way<00:00:58.829> there<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.370> here<00:01:00.329> goes

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
it all the way there so here goes

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.140 
it all the way there so here goes
nothing<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:03.260> okay<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:05.460> those<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> who

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
nothing go okay so to those of you who

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.910 
nothing go okay so to those of you who
have<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.869> seen<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
have not seen this all you do is you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.440 
have not seen this all you do is you
tilt<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.280> bike<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.330> this

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
tilt your bike back kind of like this

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
tilt your bike back kind of like this
and<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.020> far<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.290> can't<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.799> tell<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.159> is

and so far I can't really tell this is

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.230 
and so far I can't really tell this is
working<00:01:11.790> um<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.439> I<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.400> my<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.970> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
working um I I think it is a my is this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.620 
working um I I think it is a my is this
is<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.200> good<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.070> want<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.759> think<00:01:18.479> this

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
is this good do I want that I think this

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.149 
is this good do I want that I think this
is<00:01:18.780> happening<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.950> happening

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
is happening I think this is happening

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.719 
is happening I think this is happening
it<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.580> happening<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> right<00:01:21.270> way<00:01:22.189> in<00:01:23.189> fact<00:01:23.520> it

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it is happening the right way in fact it

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
it is happening the right way in fact it
almost<00:01:23.759> looks<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.659> ascending<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
almost looks like I'm ascending it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.200 
almost looks like I'm ascending it
almost<00:01:25.530> looks<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.040> I'm<00:01:26.159> going<00:01:26.400> upward<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
almost looks as if I'm going upward and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.249 
almost looks as if I'm going upward and
oh<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.500> god<00:01:28.799> holy<00:01:29.579> shit<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> actually

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
oh my god holy shit it is actually

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.710 
oh my god holy shit it is actually
happening<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:32.009> am<00:01:32.310> flying<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.180> bike<00:01:33.450> through

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
happening I am flying this bike through

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.130 
happening I am flying this bike through
the<00:01:33.869> air<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> plane<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.659> I<00:01:36.659> I'm

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the air as if it is a plane and I I'm

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
the air as if it is a plane and I I'm
not<00:01:37.350> even<00:01:37.560> falling<00:01:37.890> if<00:01:38.070> anything<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.549> could

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
not even falling if anything I could

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.969 
not even falling if anything I could
probably<00:01:39.000> make<00:01:39.479> myself<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.990> upward<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.680> just

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
probably make myself go upward if I just

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.359 
probably make myself go upward if I just
wow<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.750> actually<00:01:43.140> pretty<00:01:43.350> crazy<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.040> did

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
wow this is actually pretty crazy I did

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.630 
wow this is actually pretty crazy I did
not<00:01:44.610> expect<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> work<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.840> um<00:01:46.200> I

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
not expect it to work like this um I

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.889 
not expect it to work like this um I
honestly<00:01:47.640> thought<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.240> might<00:01:48.570> make<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.869> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
honestly thought I might make it to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.270 
honestly thought I might make it to
those<00:01:49.079> mountains<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.799> thought<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.189> would

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
those mountains I thought that it would

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
those mountains I thought that it would
work<00:01:50.399> better<00:01:50.729> than<00:01:51.060> than<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.320> did

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
work better than than what it like did

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
work better than than what it like did
previously<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.119> didn't<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.689> I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
previously but I didn't think that I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.330 
previously but I didn't think that I
would<00:01:54.899> actually<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.320> able<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.560> make<00:01:56.040> Jalloh

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
would actually be able to make Jalloh

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.550 
would actually be able to make Jalloh
Sandoz<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:57.960> let's<00:01:58.170> see<00:01:58.320> if<00:01:58.469> I

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
Sandoz so I don't know let's see if I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.109 
Sandoz so I don't know let's see if I
can<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:58.860> clear<00:01:59.369> those<00:01:59.579> mountains<00:01:59.969> up

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
can actually clear those mountains up

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.209 
can actually clear those mountains up
there<00:02:00.329> I'm<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.840> whoosh<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.649> looks<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.130> I

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
there I'm going whoosh it looks like I

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.880 
there I'm going whoosh it looks like I
started<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> fall<00:02:02.729> there<00:02:03.500> I'm<00:02:04.500> pretty<00:02:04.799> much

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
started to fall there I'm pretty much

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
started to fall there I'm pretty much
moving<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.399> slow<00:02:05.729> motion<00:02:06.000> right<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
moving in slow motion right now this

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.559 
moving in slow motion right now this
this<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.469> slow<00:02:08.099> process<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.149> if<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> go<00:02:09.450> like

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
this is a slow process but if I go like

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.940 
this is a slow process but if I go like
this<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.050> see<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.319> actually<00:02:10.470> not<00:02:10.800> moving

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
this you can see I'm actually not moving

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.690 
this you can see I'm actually not moving
that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.930 
that
oh<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:11.910> mean<00:02:12.950> giving<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.129> cinematic<00:02:14.550> angle

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
oh I mean giving this cinematic angle

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.250 
oh I mean giving this cinematic angle
you<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.120> see<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.420> I'm<00:02:15.510> kind<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.780> trucking<00:02:16.140> it

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
you can see that I'm kind of trucking it

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.020 
you can see that I'm kind of trucking it
it's<00:02:16.470> kind<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.040> big<00:02:17.190> trucking<00:02:17.489> but<00:02:17.760> not<00:02:17.879> too

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
it's kind of big trucking but not too

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.759 
it's kind of big trucking but not too
big<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.300> trucking<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.230> truck<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.650> his

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
big of trucking the the truck and his

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.660 
big of trucking the the truck and his
meteor<00:02:20.099> mediocre<00:02:20.970> Li<00:02:21.150> large<00:02:21.989> but<00:02:22.620> um<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.220> am

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
meteor mediocre Li large but um I am

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.580 
meteor mediocre Li large but um I am
making<00:02:23.970> progress<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:24.660> think<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:25.080> will<00:02:25.140> clear

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
making progress and I think I will clear

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.320 
making progress and I think I will clear
that<00:02:25.739> mountain<00:02:26.160> okay<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.879> had<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.060> go<00:02:27.150> back

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
that mountain okay so I had to go back

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.610 
that mountain okay so I had to go back
and<00:02:27.510> speed<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:27.840> part<00:02:28.019> up<00:02:28.110> here<00:02:28.290> as<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.590> can

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
and speed this part up here as you can

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.530 
and speed this part up here as you can
see<00:02:28.739> because<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.760> original<00:02:29.849> video<00:02:30.330> this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
see because in the original video this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.180 
see because in the original video this
was<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:30.870> four<00:02:31.170> minutes<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.620> flying<00:02:31.920> and

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
was like four minutes of flying and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.070 
was like four minutes of flying and
really<00:02:32.459> boring<00:02:32.730> commentary<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> actually

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
really boring commentary so I actually

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.839 
really boring commentary so I actually
sped<00:02:34.470> up<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.680> clip<00:02:34.860> as<00:02:34.980> fast<00:02:35.280> as<00:02:35.459> Sony<00:02:35.640> Vegas

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
sped up the clip as fast as Sony Vegas

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.820 
sped up the clip as fast as Sony Vegas
will<00:02:36.180> go<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> fastest<00:02:37.349> that<00:02:37.530> it'll

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
will go this is a fastest that it'll

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.440 
will go this is a fastest that it'll
even<00:02:38.069> allow<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.549> as<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.819> see<00:02:38.880> here<00:02:39.209> it

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
even allow and as you can see here it

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.729 
even allow and as you can see here it
still<00:02:39.780> looks<00:02:39.989> like<00:02:40.049> I'm<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.440> kind<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.680> slow

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
still looks like I'm going kind of slow

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.280 
still looks like I'm going kind of slow
so<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.610> just<00:02:42.090> gives<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.480> an<00:02:42.569> idea<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.840> just

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
so that just gives you an idea of just

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.770 
so that just gives you an idea of just
how<00:02:43.620> slow<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.910> was<00:02:45.209> terrible<00:02:45.569> and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
how slow I was going it was terrible and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.000 
how slow I was going it was terrible and
I<00:02:45.870> told<00:02:46.019> myself<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.380> wasn't<00:02:46.530> in<00:02:46.680> fast<00:02:46.830> forward

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
I told myself I wasn't in fast forward

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.890 
I told myself I wasn't in fast forward
to<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.459> but<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:47.610> caved<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.060> cracked<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.510> gave<00:02:48.690> in

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
to it but I caved I cracked I gave in

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.270 
to it but I caved I cracked I gave in
but<00:02:49.170> man<00:02:49.349> there<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.650> looks<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:49.860> I'm<00:02:50.069> like

I was just testing out different things
with<00:03:00.030> tilts<00:03:00.299> on<00:03:00.360> my<00:03:00.480> bike<00:03:00.660> here<00:03:00.870> but<00:03:01.380> okay<00:03:01.530> the
