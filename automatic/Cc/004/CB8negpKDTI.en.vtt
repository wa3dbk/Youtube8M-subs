00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
was my first time building a pc so i'm

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.140 
was my first time building a pc so i'm
very<00:01:29.880> proud<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.720> myself<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.619> i<00:01:31.740> got<00:01:32.150> all

very proud of myself you know i got all

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.319 
very proud of myself you know i got all
the<00:01:33.360> pieces<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.869> i<00:01:34.020> didn't<00:01:34.259> break<00:01:34.530> anything<00:01:35.329> i

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the pieces in i didn't break anything i

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.260 
the pieces in i didn't break anything i
did<00:01:37.140> all<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.500> wiring<00:01:37.950> myself<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.119> know<00:01:39.150> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
did all of the wiring myself you know I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.950 
did all of the wiring myself you know I
figured<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:40.049> by<00:01:40.079> myself<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> um<00:01:42.240> in

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
figured it out all by myself so um in

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.530 
figured it out all by myself so um in
retrospect<00:01:43.680> when<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.790> about<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.360> could

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
retrospect when I think about it I could

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.200 
retrospect when I think about it I could
probably<00:01:45.810> build<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.439> pc<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.399> anybody<00:01:47.970> now

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
probably build a pc for like anybody now

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.060 
probably build a pc for like anybody now
let's<00:01:48.450> say<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.899> sister<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.500> somebody<00:01:49.860> more

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
let's say if my sister is somebody more

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.050 
let's say if my sister is somebody more
than<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.250> pc<00:01:50.610> i<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:50.970> build<00:01:51.180> them<00:01:51.450> one

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
than the pc i can build them one

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.300 
than the pc i can build them one
and<00:01:52.180> be<00:01:52.689> completely<00:01:53.140> fine<00:01:53.470> it's<00:01:53.799> really<00:01:54.100> not

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
and be completely fine it's really not

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.940 
and be completely fine it's really not
that<00:01:54.369> hard<00:01:54.939> honestly<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:56.439> me<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.770> most

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
that hard honestly to me the most

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.010 
that hard honestly to me the most
nerve-racking<00:01:57.640> thing<00:01:57.670> about<00:01:58.060> building<00:01:58.479> my<00:01:58.600> pc

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
nerve-racking thing about building my pc

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.899 
nerve-racking thing about building my pc
was<00:01:59.200> getting<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.740> wiring<00:02:00.250> right<00:02:00.460> because<00:02:00.820> you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
was getting the wiring right because you

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.399 
was getting the wiring right because you
want<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.119> make<00:02:01.270> sure<00:02:01.329> everything<00:02:01.960> goes<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.320> the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
want to make sure everything goes in the

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.190 
want to make sure everything goes in the
proper<00:02:02.770> slots<00:02:03.130> but<00:02:03.759> luckily<00:02:04.200> everything

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
proper slots but luckily everything

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.560 
proper slots but luckily everything
pretty<00:02:05.649> much<00:02:05.770> goes<00:02:06.159> where<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:06.490> fits<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.119> it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
pretty much goes where it fits so it

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.059 
pretty much goes where it fits so it
