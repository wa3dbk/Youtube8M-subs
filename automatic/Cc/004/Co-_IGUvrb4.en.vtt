00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.150
 to me 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.710
 how are you welcome to a new video 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.690
 and good guys this time we are 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.280
 on a split server and why not 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.209
 know that sprint is very fast I tell you 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.250
 that explains is a game that 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.720
 developed before minecraft pc in the 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.490
 which we have to run to not fall 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.840
 and well you will see how it is to remember that 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.240
 the description I leave what is flu 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.500
 and then the server is a little new guys 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.720
 over here you can see that they are loading me 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.130
 the chips and everything then do not remember going to 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.359
 the description and here before 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.220
 start you can also see that this 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.590
 drug and see soon another icloud by the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.900
 that they know him well because in reality 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.250
 know if it 's the problem if if 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.410
 be him and we are recording at the same 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.940
 time then it 's a greeting to him and good 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.920
 let's start with these guys that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.010
 weighs in 20 seconds and well then in 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:52.130
 actually the server is this circus I do not know 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.780
 how it reduces is but also a 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.610
 very huge coincidence because now 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.760
 same I wanted to record then to see in 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.070
 321 and now you will see that we have to break 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.570
 the floor in this case are carpets for 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.509
 that others fall to me then 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.659
 a little late and everything then there's 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.490
 as I am scared seriously I want to win 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.840
 but I'm not so good either, it's not 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.530
 like in little fish that you are running and 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.210
 all 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.400
 well, those who do not know there is also a 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.830
 modality that is called dieter braun 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.020
 I started and then basically you're running 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.390
 and the ground falls behind you then 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.100
 you have to be careful and see the ground 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.470
 well because clearly if you do not take care of yourself 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.810
 you kill yourself then something here we are going to kill 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.680
 this person who is cheating and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.540
 we do this ok 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.979
 fuck and well then when you die you 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.009
 pull out the server if you do not estimate the psyche 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.479
 we answered here and other fuck ok and you 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.060
 disconnect because you lose then by 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.560
 here remember guys that I'm going to 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.060
 do a few games I'm not very 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.310
 well it will be android clown 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.310
 Rodriguez metro as it is and 12 then 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.570
 Well, we are going with another minor item and therefore 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.009
 back here, you guys can see that 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.869
 we are here again and that is what a 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.670
 Local boyfriend so I really like it 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.159
 the port are changing as you go 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.050
 changing the game mode and me and something else 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.210
 I do not know why it was happening is that they 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.679
 we change the armor which is very 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.479
 strange I stayed like that wadding focus 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.260
 between Peru they can not see that it changes 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.459
 gold breastplate and I do not know then 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.680
 just that I think that here they have given 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.390
 80 thousand guys not really 100 too 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.670
 we walk in a suit did not show us jockey 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.140
 I do not know how long I'm going to make a 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.370
 small cut boys and I come back when 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.819
 this is about to begin so two 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.440
 minutes a little bit and I'll be right back 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.209
 to load the tricks please to see 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.400
 well ten seconds damn I already want 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.810
 win the first game I recorded 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.270
 right now it 's all wrong so let's see now 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.680
 What's going on and why is green me 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.900
 I love green but I liked it more than 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.390
 outside they did where they are not working 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.280
 with our bat please I think that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.470
 let's do this carefully by the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.590
 I do not want to remove soil because 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.590
 see how they change all of armor 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.590
 strange 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.720
 they are sweating me the two as always 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.519
 as if you were the parkour but good 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.550
 the server is fine I like it 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.160
 much this type of game but yes that 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.110
 I would like to optimize it more but good 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.940
 Well, it's really fine, I like it 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.530
 much what the game and everything so 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.910
 If I recommend it, remember that 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.489
 port if I'm not wrong 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.380
 the server is to the pussy what's going on 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.150
 here when it was removed that the server is 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.590
 mtv.com point bat and he 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.440
 port is 2010 as well as there are more 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.510
 game modes is also the coruÃ±a 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.350
 there is also a game mode that is 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.360
 pvp and cursed them seriously of 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.120
 soccer in which you have that little dish 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.700
 So here I show you more or 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.160

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.540
 client with which it is not working 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.610
 but well actually I hope you know 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.480

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.680
 reality then I liked it a lot and 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.390

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.099
 of servers right now does not let me 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.470

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.990
 we are going to do this I would like to 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.370
 ring with someone from the place but number 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.410

 I was guided a lot then people 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.139

 the hunger games' though 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.960
 clearly in the eyes of hunger is a 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.970
 little more exciting than this but then 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.490
