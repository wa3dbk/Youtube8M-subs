00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
last time we looked at what Kip we

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
last time we looked at what Kip we
needed<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> bring<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.730> us<00:00:17.820> into<00:00:18.090> the

needed to bring with us into the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.970 
needed to bring with us into the
backcountry<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:19.199> week<00:00:19.410> we'll<00:00:19.650> look<00:00:19.680> at

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
backcountry and this week we'll look at

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.980 
backcountry and this week we'll look at
how<00:00:20.460> we'll<00:00:20.609> use<00:00:20.789> some<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.060> kit<00:00:23.900> so<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
how we'll use some of that kit so the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.750 
how we'll use some of that kit so the
first<00:00:25.199> thing<00:00:25.350> we'll<00:00:25.470> look<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.550> our

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
first thing we'll look at is is our

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.230 
first thing we'll look at is is our
skins<00:00:27.090> these<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.019> crucial<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.650> our

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
skins these are crucial to our

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.799 
skins these are crucial to our
backcountry<00:00:31.730> skiing<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.270> making<00:00:33.570> progress

my<00:00:41.790> bag<00:00:41.969> some<00:00:42.420> people<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:43.050> an<00:00:43.140> interweaving

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
my bag some people have an interweaving

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.080 
my bag some people have an interweaving

mesh between the sides of the skin
personally<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.149> don't<00:00:48.239> use<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.710> find

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
personally I don't use that as I find

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.500 
personally I don't use that as I find
it's<00:00:50.160> more<00:00:50.430> trouble<00:00:50.760> than<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:50.910> worth

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
it's more trouble than it's worth

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
it's more trouble than it's worth
but<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> skin<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
but here we have a skin and see on the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.689 
but here we have a skin and see on the
backside<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:54.000> quite<00:00:54.899> sticky<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
backside it's quite sticky and this is

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.979 
backside it's quite sticky and this is
the<00:00:56.760> side<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.180> stick<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.629> base<00:00:57.809> of

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the side that will stick to the base of

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.950 
the side that will stick to the base of
the<00:00:58.079> ski<00:00:58.760> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> front<00:01:00.120> side<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the ski on the front side we have a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439 
the ski on the front side we have a
furry<00:01:01.289> texture<00:01:01.980> which<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.149> contact

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
furry texture which will be in contact

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.789 
furry texture which will be in contact
with<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> snow<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.350> provides<00:01:04.619> us

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
with the snow this is what provides us

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.980 
with the snow this is what provides us
with<00:01:04.860> grip<00:01:05.280> selling<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.390> one<00:01:06.810> direction

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
with grip selling them on one direction

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.840 
with grip selling them on one direction
it's<00:01:07.470> smooth<00:01:07.799> which<00:01:08.130> allows<00:01:08.369> us<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.640> glide

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it's smooth which allows us to glide

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
it's smooth which allows us to glide
forward<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> other<00:01:10.020> direction

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
forward and on the other direction

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.250 
forward and on the other direction
it's<00:01:11.250> rough<00:01:11.520> which<00:01:11.880> allows<00:01:12.180> us<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.600> grip<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
it's rough which allows us to grip as we

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.399 
it's rough which allows us to grip as we
go<00:01:13.409> uphill<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.640> finally<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> loop<00:01:16.259> at

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
go uphill and finally we have a loop at

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.230 
go uphill and finally we have a loop at
the<00:01:16.439> top<00:01:16.530> which<00:01:16.860> will<00:01:16.979> hook<00:01:17.130> over<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> tip<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the top which will hook over the tip of

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.980 
the top which will hook over the tip of
the<00:01:18.360> ski<00:01:19.610> some<00:01:20.610> skins<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> clip<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the ski some skins have a clip at the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.679 
the ski some skins have a clip at the
back<00:01:22.229> which<00:01:22.530> helps<00:01:22.860> secure<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> skin<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
back which helps secure the skin at the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.120 
back which helps secure the skin at the
rear<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> ski<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.560> doesn't<00:01:25.830> come<00:01:25.979> off

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
rear of the ski so it doesn't come off

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.940 
rear of the ski so it doesn't come off
so<00:01:26.310> easily<00:01:26.630> some<00:01:27.630> skin<00:01:28.259> models<00:01:28.590> don't<00:01:28.799> have

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
so easily some skin models don't have

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
so easily some skin models don't have
this<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:30.119> purely<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.540> personal<00:01:30.689> choice<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
this it's purely a personal choice as to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.039 
this it's purely a personal choice as to
which<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.740> prefer

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
which one you prefer

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.170 
which one you prefer
so<00:01:34.049> putting<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> skins<00:01:35.159> much<00:01:35.670> easier<00:01:36.090> when

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
so putting on the skins much easier when

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.550 
so putting on the skins much easier when
it's<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:36.509> windy<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:37.770> need<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> do

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
it's not windy what we need to do

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.550 
it's not windy what we need to do
just<00:01:40.220> take<00:01:40.399> our<00:01:40.810> take<00:01:41.810> our<00:01:41.960> skin<00:01:42.259> we<00:01:42.350> need<00:01:42.500> to

just take our take our skin we need to
make<00:01:42.710> sure<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.100> base<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.579> ski<00:01:43.790> is

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
make sure that the base of the ski is

between the skin and the ski where snow
can<00:02:52.000> get<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:53.430> which<00:02:54.430> over<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.030> course<00:02:55.270> of<00:02:55.420> a

can get in which over the course of a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.250 
can get in which over the course of a
day<00:02:55.750> or<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.960> skin<00:02:56.260> will<00:02:56.440> prise<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.130> skins<00:02:57.610> off

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
day or a skin will prise the skins off

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.280 
day or a skin will prise the skins off
great<00:02:59.520> finally<00:03:00.520> I'll<00:03:00.820> just<00:03:00.880> put<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.480> tail<00:03:02.140> of

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
great finally I'll just put the tail of

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.200 
great finally I'll just put the tail of
the<00:03:02.380> skin<00:03:02.620> on

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.380 

there<00:03:05.930> were<00:03:06.080> pretty<00:03:06.260> set<00:03:06.700> so<00:03:07.700> that's<00:03:07.880> one<00:03:08.090> skin

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
there were pretty set so that's one skin

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.300 
there were pretty set so that's one skin
on<00:03:08.510> what<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.810> won't<00:03:09.110> do<00:03:09.320> now<00:03:09.500> particularly<00:03:10.010> if<00:03:10.190> I

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
on what I won't do now particularly if I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.210 
on what I won't do now particularly if I
didn't<00:03:10.580> have<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.760> tail<00:03:11.470> securer<00:03:12.470> because<00:03:13.100> I

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
didn't have a tail securer because I

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.640 
didn't have a tail securer because I
won't<00:03:13.370> jab<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.330> ski<00:03:14.540> into<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.930> snow<00:03:15.170> because

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
won't jab the ski into the snow because

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.160 
won't jab the ski into the snow because
it<00:03:15.800> helps<00:03:16.460> prise<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.240> skin<00:03:17.510> off<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.690> back<00:03:17.990> of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
it helps prise the skin off the back of

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.590 
it helps prise the skin off the back of
the<00:03:18.320> ski<00:03:18.650> which<00:03:19.430> then<00:03:19.970> means<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.390> skin

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
the ski which then means that the skin

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.960 
the ski which then means that the skin
will<00:03:20.690> come<00:03:20.720> off<00:03:20.990> later<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.470> skinning<00:03:21.970> so

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
will come off later in the skinning so

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.570 
will come off later in the skinning so
I'll<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:23.210> put<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:24.070> straight<00:03:25.070> down<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.490> the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
I'll just put that straight down in the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:32.410 
I'll just put that straight down in the
snow<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.530> an<00:03:30.620> alternative<00:03:31.130> when<00:03:31.730> it's<00:03:31.910> very

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
snow so an alternative when it's very

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.620 
snow so an alternative when it's very
windy<00:03:32.660> is<00:03:32.990> putting<00:03:33.950> on<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.160> skins<00:03:34.460> section<00:03:35.450> by

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
windy is putting on the skins section by

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.130 
windy is putting on the skins section by
section

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
section

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.820 
section
so<00:03:37.010> rather<00:03:37.910> than<00:03:38.000> prise<00:03:38.960> apart<00:03:38.990> the<00:03:39.440> skin<00:03:39.710> the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
so rather than prise apart the skin the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:40.420 
so rather than prise apart the skin the
whole<00:03:39.950> way

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
whole way

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.260 
whole way
I'll<00:03:41.300> just<00:03:41.570> prise<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.840> apart<00:03:42.280> partway<00:03:43.280> make

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
I'll just prise it apart partway make

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.980 
I'll just prise it apart partway make
sure<00:03:44.450> it's<00:03:44.600> nice<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.810> clean<00:03:49.690> then<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.780> can

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
sure it's nice and clean then I can

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.550 
sure it's nice and clean then I can
stick<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:52.250> first<00:03:52.550> section<00:03:53.000> on<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:54.140> as<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.380> go

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
stick the first section on and as I go

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.400 
stick the first section on and as I go
down<00:03:57.160> I'll<00:03:58.160> put<00:03:58.520> a<00:03:58.990> little<00:03:59.990> bit<00:04:00.080> more<00:04:00.260> in<00:04:00.350> a

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
down I'll put a little bit more in a

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.200 
down I'll put a little bit more in a
little<00:04:00.530> bit<00:04:00.740> more<00:04:00.890> just<00:04:01.130> it<00:04:01.640> just<00:04:01.790> means<00:04:02.000> it's

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
little bit more just it just means it's

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.950 
little bit more just it just means it's
not<00:04:02.360> your<00:04:02.480> left<00:04:02.630> skin<00:04:03.550> flapping<00:04:04.550> around

not your left skin flapping around

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.569 
not your left skin flapping around
that's<00:04:05.960> been<00:04:06.140> do<00:04:06.290> it

I can take it off in partial sections

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.740 
I can take it off in partial sections
usually<00:04:38.110> with<00:04:38.199> my<00:04:38.320> back<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.710> wind<00:04:39.600> take<00:04:40.600> it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
usually with my back to the wind take it

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.409 
usually with my back to the wind take it
off<00:04:40.870> from<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.650> back<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:43.720> I<00:04:43.840> can<00:04:43.990> just<00:04:44.139> fold<00:04:44.440> it

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
off from the back and I can just fold it

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.640 
off from the back and I can just fold it
in<00:04:46.419> shorter<00:04:46.960> sections<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:49.540> then<00:04:50.380> we<00:04:50.500> have<00:04:50.620> a

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
in shorter sections and then we have a

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.020 
in shorter sections and then we have a
slightly<00:04:51.160> less<00:04:52.710> flappy<00:04:53.710> skin<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.610> deal<00:04:54.820> with

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
slightly less flappy skin to deal with

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.320 
slightly less flappy skin to deal with
so<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.139> can<00:04:56.260> now<00:04:56.500> fold<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.950> into<00:04:57.210> quarters<00:04:58.210> or

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
so I can now fold it into quarters or

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.300 
so I can now fold it into quarters or
eighths<00:04:58.530> depending<00:04:59.530> on<00:04:59.590> how<00:04:59.710> big<00:04:59.860> I<00:04:59.950> want<00:05:00.100> it

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
eighths depending on how big I want it

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.260 
eighths depending on how big I want it
and<00:05:01.410> once<00:05:02.410> again<00:05:02.560> if<00:05:02.889> it's<00:05:03.070> really<00:05:03.370> cold<00:05:03.580> maybe

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
and once again if it's really cold maybe

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.600 
and once again if it's really cold maybe
I'll<00:05:04.450> just<00:05:04.660> keep<00:05:05.320> my<00:05:05.560> skills<00:05:05.950> and<00:05:06.160> hide<00:05:06.430> my
