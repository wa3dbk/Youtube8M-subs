00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.139
 Look when I make a story. 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.790
 usually part of some ideas 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:21.029
 that arise from conversations with 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.740
 colleagues or texts and so on and so on 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.560
 I'm usually attracted to the themes that speak 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.170
 the conflicts and conflicts in large 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.679
 cities also in themes related to a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.930
 the universe of the black population in 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.579
 big cities or also how I am 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.579
 doing now on the history of Brazil 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.050
 I do not really care to tell a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.019
 story of a form is to stay in a 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.879
 so that the person sees that story 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.859
 which may be on a theme that she already 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.559
 knows a little but she has not seen 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.810
 presented in that way and space 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.560
 reflect also from other 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 points of view is already has already has 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.229
 some time since 2006 I started reading 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.149
 a little about the history of palmares 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.670
 first to understand a little more 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:27.149
 about what was this fact in the history of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.520
 Brazil and then with personal interests 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.690
 from that moment on, I imagined that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.030
 History of Palmares is a History 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.000
 very interesting and is a very 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.009
 story here in the form of stories in 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.009
 comic strips have been little explored 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.930
 and it is a story that is a very 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.600
 important to understand what was the 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.950
 colonial Brazil to understand and that 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.870
 was also this constant resistance 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.750
 marginalized populations in the case of 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.600
 of black populations in colonial times 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.000
 I think there are few jobs in 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.649
 few good works that speak of the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.250
 perspective of the black in colonial times 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.770
 in the time of slavery this is there 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.550
 little in the cinema there is also a point 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.709
 comic books 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.810
 many times when this happens it is 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.950
 only from some figures 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.840
 central 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.550
 so I'll drive silva in june is no more 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.220
 always focused on these characters I 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.970
 wanted to present the universe with the text 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.570
 also from characters who 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.030
 would we say so would be in the 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.340
 periphery of these events and how 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.970
 they that regions are history will 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.970
 a little out there
