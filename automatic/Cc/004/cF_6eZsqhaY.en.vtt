00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.960 

and<00:01:10.729> then<00:01:10.970> they<00:01:11.090> retain<00:01:11.360> will<00:01:11.570> follow<00:01:11.900> through

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
and then they retain will follow through

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.550 
and then they retain will follow through
around<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.060> corner<00:01:14.240> of<00:01:14.390> here<00:01:14.930> we'll<00:01:15.440> do<00:01:15.530> a

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
around the corner of here we'll do a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.210 
around the corner of here we'll do a
nice<00:01:15.740> round<00:01:16.040> radius<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.119> front<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.420> it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
nice round radius to the front of it

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.789 
nice round radius to the front of it
gradually<00:01:19.220> blending<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.320> landscape

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
gradually blending in to the landscape

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.270 
gradually blending in to the landscape
hillside<00:01:22.220> over<00:01:22.460> here<00:01:22.640> behind<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:24.280> electrical

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.070 
hillside over here behind the electrical
pedestal<00:01:25.729> here<00:01:27.610> so<00:01:28.610> that'll<00:01:29.180> be<00:01:29.270> it<00:01:29.450> there<00:01:29.780> and
