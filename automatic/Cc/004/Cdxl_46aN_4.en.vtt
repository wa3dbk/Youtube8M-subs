00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 in my last tutorial I have you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.660
 Explains how to feed the beast infiniti 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.210
 the mod pack which is the basis of the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.070
 minecraft youtuber project mag is in 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.200
 you can install your minecraft 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.089
 Also in this video you will learn how it works 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.369
 now also possible is a server 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.710
 with just that feature, biest infinity 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.310
 was a lot of fun and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.310
 good succeed 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.400
 hey and welcome to the tutorial center 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.290
 the one server with the feature beast 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.300
 there is infinity ward pack to suspend 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.160
 in this video two variants 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.200
 First, I'll explain you like you 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.710
 do it all on your own pc 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.720
 can 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.520
 unfortunately, only this problem is problematic 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.410
 Solution not complete with me 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.000
 that means I had to 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.920
 looking for an alternative and 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.320
 That's why I present you in the second 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.500
 step of the videos with an alternative 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.570
 you also the server perfectly 24/7 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.180
 can run online without that 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.800
 your pc has to run constantly if you 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.300
 jump directly to the second variant 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.460
 then you just want to click now 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.110
 here on the note in this case 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.300
 I have now minecraft for 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.800
 open until launcher if you still have it 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.330
 do not know where you got the launcher 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.520
 then you should just click 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.200
 in the already mentioned tutorial 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.540
 because then you get the basis 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.920
 Please use this tutorial here 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.780
 you feed the beast end you'll find on the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.400
 on the left side there is the above 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.500
 possibility to shut down a server 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.390
 data then your browser opens and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.920
 it will download a zip file 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.659
 this zip file when finished 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.580
 downloaded is you pull then 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.470
 Simply drag and drop in a new on 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.210
 your computer created folder in 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.040
 connection, you can unzip that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.630
 goes for example with 7-zip or 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.150
 winrar in this case I do it for 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.670
 unzip right here and lead now 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.170
 A double click on the xt eula point 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.580
 because first I have to do that 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.770
 general terms and conditions of 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.470
 agree minecraft in which I eula 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.240
 if not on subsequent additions 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.620
 forget to save the document 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.170
 and now in this case we can do the 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.150
 run server startup brt file 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.770
 and it opens the black console 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.810
 in this you will always find 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.760
 status updates the service and she must 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.860
 be open to others on yours 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.740
 server connecten can now do it 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.929
 whole whole time to take 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.510
 I then fit like server completely 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.010
 has downloaded for me now 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.420
 the problem that this download 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.720
 sometime because of the sheer size 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.890
 stops and the feedback is not 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.450
 completely downloads from this 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.910
 I can reason about this variant 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.470
 not the server-create with you can 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.879
 you work the whole though 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.620
 and at this point just click 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.739
 times this tutorial to create a 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.499
 minecraft 1.8 servers for the servers 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.109
 edition now works just like here 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.950
 she also does it if you have a minecraft 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:39.290
 1.8 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.790
 villa server is therefore creating now 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.349
 just click on the note 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.910
 if the downloadable at this 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.069
 job works for me that works 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.510
 unfortunately not for this reason 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.370
 I had to look for an alternative 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.560
 look around and at this point comes mp 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.080
 Horst 24 point in the game 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.090
 There you can easily leave one 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.430
 euro 80 a minecraft server host and 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.200
 Potty care that feed the beast 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.150

 to order servers and that's exactly what they need 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.010
 we make the use recommends 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.200
 had to want to host infiniti 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.120
 start crediting for it 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.769
 you on the drop-down menu and want 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.090
 recharge credit here you can 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.769
 either one of the adjacent ones 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.200
 select amounts or your own 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.780
 Amount specify payment options 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.120
 are in addition to paypal sofortbanking and 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.340
 paysafecard you have now an option 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.260
 selected click on charge now 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.910
 and in the end you will be on the side of the 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.889
 forwarded to the payment agent where the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.630
 payment and then you can do yours 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.940
 new credit directly in the drop-down menu 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.769
 Now we had to see the fifi 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.269
 server where we are on minecraft server 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.769
 Click and the desired server 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.750
 configuration failed 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.060
 here the price of the server depends on 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.799
 RAM off for an extensive 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.080
 motech has a lot to offer here 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.860
 I recommend about 2 gb 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.960
 random access memory 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.820
 if you are with a few friends 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.169
 should want to play together 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.880
 then more friends will be able to do it 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.830
 Of course it will be better if 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.389
 you want a bit more RAM 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.070
 but that is completely in your 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.570
 own discretion with the option 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.950
 prepayment you can now also 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.960
 Choose how long you have a server in 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.000
 want to pay in advance and so can 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.409
 you have your server from a euro 80 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.419
 hot and that's really not much 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.810
 feels for the practical features 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.830
 the installation with a click on ca 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.540
 you will get one again 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.000
 summary your order needs 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.260
 the terms and conditions 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.580
 accept and can follow up 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.470
 his server liable to pay 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.450
 order now where we have our server 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.669
 who we can count on from the drop-down menu 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.560
 my server click choose our 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.510
 corresponding server off and lie 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.280
 now install on mac 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.100
 Now we have the possibility between 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.660
 ticket witch take off the beaten or 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.730
 just to choose many and if the 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.500
 feed the beast then we click 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.510
 another drop-down menu where you can find us 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.919
 direct feed find the beast infiniti 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.930
 in the connection must by the checkbox 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.880
 set that you are aware that we are 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.470
 data by installing a macs 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.820
 but can be lost in the end 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.139
 you do not have anything on the server yet 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.250
 actually made nothing 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.870
 can get lost 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.280
 Now you can install your rottbeck 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.840
 and I had to wait a moment 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.130
 Now you get the message that viett 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.120
 successful for biest infiniti 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.370
 was installed 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.260
 then you can just get the ip of the 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.540
 servers here in this case from the 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.940
 Copy interface and then directly into 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.280
 minecraft insert dmc hosters motech 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.810
 Keep up to date on the server 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.880
 you now in this case the version 1 3 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.290
 4 both in the client and on the 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.570
 server and accordingly you can 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.430
 now with your ip just up 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.410
 your own way for beast infiniti 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.870
 server joint of course then too 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.340
 is permanently online and that was it 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.930
 practically from this tutorial 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.880
 in my opinion is in the target house 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.010
 especially because of the low price 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.830
 a good alternative to classic 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.390
 servers on your pc in the end 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.530
 at least many problems with me 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.030
 have organized 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.440
 the link is as I said in the video 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.910

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.190
