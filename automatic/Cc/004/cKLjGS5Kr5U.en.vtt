00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.670
 and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.890
 custard recipes great 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.919
 many and even about the French 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.399
 classic there are controversial moments 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.930
 someone adds flour someone starch 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.909
 generally says that besides the yolks of milk 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.860
 and sugar with vanilla nothing 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:44.440
 I'll take the option with flour and proportions 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.949
 something like this goes in the classic 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.580
 the recipe for a glass of milk 250 milliliters 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:55.000
 one chicken egg yolk 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.920
 about 35 grams of sugar but you can 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.720
 vary to taste I will do a little less 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.339
 sweet, I took 20 grams 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.340
 this is a tablespoon with a slide 25 grams 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.310
 flour is a tablespoon of good 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.759
 bitter and vanilla to taste 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.630
 for my start I'll take double 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:20.670
 a serving of cream 2 cups of milk and milk and 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.670
 I immediately set to rule 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:33.460
 2 egg yolks adding sugar and 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:43.200
 rub or whisk yolk with sugar 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:46.590
 until a homogeneous white mass is enough 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.940
 add not large portions of flour and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.080
 We mix yolks so that we have 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:02:02.830
 homogeneous mass 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:02:05.980
 further warmed milk is warm but not 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.670
 hot so as not to brew at once the flour and 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:14.670
 yolks add portions bit by bit 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.670
 mix 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.040
 by a little bit in order not to be 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.200
 lumps in our mass divorced gave 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.200
 liquid state then there were a bridge so 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.840
 we can now pour the mass into the milk 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.670
 remaining 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.110
 and already put cook on the stove 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.450
 vanilla or vanilla extract and if you 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.120
 use saccharin extract add 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.660
 after the cream has brewed a little 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.690
 cool down 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.540
 if you have a vanilla pod 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.870
 it must be boiled in milk when you 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.940
 you suspect him before adding to the total 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.250
 mass further 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.160
 cream set on the smallest fire 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.810
 it's better to take pots with double bottom here 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.989
 how do you see it has air 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.200
 interlayer so on measuredly and heating 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.150
 provides and less likely that 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.470
 when it burns secondly it is better to take 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.680
 a wooden spoon to say less 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.489
 injure the cream 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.880
 constantly need to stir and you can 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.569
 do it in the form of the eight what 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:39.549
 allows to mix more evenly 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.290
 cream from all positions if you want to be 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.120
 more sure that the cream is not 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.260
 curl did not overheat 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.480
 can use water bath either 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.760
 how am I really small fire what else 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.129
 there is a subtlety cooking cream 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.909
 if you cook cream on yolks then he 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:00.969
 there will be a richer taste and more 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.030
 tender is considered if you lay the egg 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:06.730
 together with protein this option too 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.189
 there is but protein has a property 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.680
 it can happen such that 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:15.849
 after cooling it will not be completely 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:20.079
 uniform cream although it can be avoided 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:22.419
 passing an extra cream through a sieve 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.090
 this can be done anyway if you 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.419
 want to achieve more tender 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.440
 consistency if suddenly you cream 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.120
 digested 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.570
 and see that he is about to 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.110
 it is necessary to immediately remove the burner 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.750
 and for quick service you can 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.599
 put the pot in the cold very 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.330
 cold water it will help quickly 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:51.030
 cool and possibly prevent the cream from 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:54.960
 collapsing as you see near the end 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.940
 cooking may 3 more stirring intensively 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:03.030
 to cream 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:06.940
 thicken evenly from the moment 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.430
 setting on fire took five minutes and 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.120
 the cream is almost thick left 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.479
 a little bit 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.159
 and he will be ready as you see he on 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:20.789
 eyes begin to thicken 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.789
 the mark remains on the surface for a short time 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:27.580
 all the cream is ready this consistency 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.719
 enough to remove from heat while cream 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.620
 I will cool down 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:36.490
 I will borrow with other affairs because I will cover 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:40.409
 his film in order not to 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:44.960
 formed a film on the surface of the cream 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:53.919
 for this I will attach the film right the most 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:59.630
 Miss to receive cream is cold 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:07.490
 remove plenochku add powder 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:09.490
 vanilla and mix in the cream as you can see 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:15.530
 no film due to 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:18.349
 standing film good consistency 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.830
 cream turned out gentle and enough 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:20.830
 thick
