00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 waiting for the day a woman without the pair of louboutin to the term 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.610
 depends it's a match like any other 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.610
 she they allow in Quebec he is not paranoid 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.169
 during two hours 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.839
 it's nicer we were predicting a team interview why the choice of 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 biodynamic agriculture 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.489
 it's even something that is strange because today we 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.790
 could instead ask the question why does not everyone do organic 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.700
 if we look a little bit about the transformers' expectations today its skis 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.160
 the ice they ask 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.020
 and you go in the middle to thirty years later he was later locked up 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.680
 in the dynamics 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.210
 yes avatar in practice and daddy has not yet biodynamic it was the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.160
 turkish we had you show of the environment 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.730
 it turns out that you became the tournament after organic farming 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.540
 and speak 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.220
 compact with other peasants we were more oriented towards 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 biodynamic agriculture not that corresponded later 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.220
 with the state of mind 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.830
 is developing renewable energies part of the capital 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.150
 at our level we actually know the question how it is 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.110
 possible for the world 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.070
 rather than consume differently 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.680
 because we have the reflexes a little like everyone else a cce look closely 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.680
 it is on the button there is electricity we take the car 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.400
 we were already dying to see how we can consume differently 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.870
 country after trying to 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.980
 to tame the elements around us to try to draw% 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.470
 possibly some 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.789
 some resources 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.629
 we put a wind turbine project on the hill next door 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.680
 for them 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.370
 you have something with this wind around us we have mounted a 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.850
 photovoltaic installation in europe and last 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.540
 besides the sunde dishes it would have been a pity to not use it 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.799
 and how much to treat them of earth 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.470
 produced by palacios 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.529
 for renault could produce ap 3 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.819
 to the consumption of the farm 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.590
 that is to say, the farm is still something a little 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.349
 consistent but it would produce you adhere to empty for the 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.620
 do but why in the process a dozen families of the tournament display 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.739
 iii e in the court musa said that charm day production and it's a 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.950
 real pleasure to know that while working the sun works with me 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.670
 linden lab it's about you decided it to no longer be ready to 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.930
 go up in smoke voices swallowing a talented asshole 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.369
 what is actually 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.529
 already so agreed 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.009
 Valerie we love him again 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.359
 having acquired the machine called a shredder 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.840
 and who transforms in europe where these arms in small platelets 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.200
 and these platelets after being experienced teaser is both as material 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.199
 for heating 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:05.309
 % and the ground cover in the garden a year but I see the rameal reference 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:06.489
 fragmented 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.809
 it is used when traveling in settings 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:13.709
 housing which will certainly like others in europe grew by 6% 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.609
 antoine * 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.929
 good luck for the development of another surfer Germany 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:22.649
 after playing a hand for dignity he said
