00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.769
 Hi everyone 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.200
 welcome to eurobike 2013 we are here with 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.420
 nicolÃ² mattos of star ii 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.270
 we saw a new beast from 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.880
 descent with carbon frame and then 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.359
 we want to ask him why star ii 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.640
 It launches with a new frame the need 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 of star ii was to create a 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.230
 totally new product a bike 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.410
 modern dynamics suitable for downhill 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 current and therefore with the keyword 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.649
 lightness already that you have developed a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.559
 produced starting from a white sheet 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.450
 how come you never got into 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.899
 consideration of the new standard of the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.820
 27 and a half we believe for now that 27 e 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.239
 medium is more suitable for use in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.039
 hard so we bet or if 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.980
 not totally new to a bike 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.710
 the 26 downhill from simple to curious 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.439
 what are the steps to follow for 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.519
 switch from white paper to cai bike 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.680
 behind the shoulders 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.299
 then first of all we leave for the in 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.390
 consideration of needs 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.130
 we then move on to the engineering project 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.530
 real and then everything comes 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:23.130
 amalgamated by the design and the first 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.680
 prototype to the final one what they are 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 here too the steps how much time passes 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.770
 then the steps are are obviously 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.189
 more than one you make yourself a first 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.950
 realization of the project at the level 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.530
 engineering note and creation 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.520
 of the first prototypes 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.830
 with the testing of these by the gods 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.220
 our riders and then return to 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.590
 again to prototypes with new ones 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.680
 changes made and again 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.280
 test this earth I have to do first but you 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.590
 I do it now at the geometry level 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.770
 on what you have been inspired for 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.140
 draw your bicycle 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.179
 then as I said before and lee 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.200
 cougan wanted to create a bike from 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.410
 modern downhill and consequently if yes 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.900
 a bike is created from the corners a lot 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.760
 open for faster and faster routes 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.450
 currently present in the world cup 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.010
 and where precisely lightness becomes 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.330
 the fundamental element for development 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.569
 of the project and also talked to me about 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.730
 bottom bracket height has 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.560
 the height of the movement is 34 centimeters 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.209
 while regarding the angle of 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.940
 steering 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.840
 we are on the 63 degrees then editable 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.650
 through the use of Angol Set Headset 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.290
 ok and how many sizes you will have of this 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.870
 this frame and the bike will be available 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.269
 in two sizes and size l with 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.530
 length of 61 cm and size m 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.750
 58 cm long as it will be called that 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.640
 we haven't said the bike yet 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.440
 call x and records like ours 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.780
 old model with the addition of 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.790
 letter k which is just to highlight 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.489
 the fact of using carbon 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.060
 spicy demand will be a bicycle that 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:21.510
 we will find the same with other names or will be 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.299
 a 100 percent product lee is Cougan 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.050
 a 100 percent lee cougan product 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.510
 developed on needs and requests 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.130
 ours so you won't find this 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.660
 produced by no other party except by 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.430
 we 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.620
 excellent ask from a million 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.290
 dollars where he wants to get lee cougan 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.240
 from here to five years the ambitions of lee 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.330
 cougan are those of course 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.100
 always present products at the top and in the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.660
 special case of the downhill of 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.150
 offer a product suitable for 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.100
 perfect world cup competitions 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.870
 say hello to live bikes if not yours 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.660
 interview will not go online 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.770
 hello live bike thanks hi everyone 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.770
 guys see you soon
