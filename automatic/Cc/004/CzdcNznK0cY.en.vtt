good<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> like<00:01:05.100> those<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:06.210> gear<00:01:06.479> ratios<00:01:07.020> on

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

a compact chain set and an 11 32 cog on
the<00:01:16.770> back<00:01:16.979> now<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.540> made<00:01:18.720> possible<00:01:18.960> by

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the back now this is made possible by

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.670 
the back now this is made possible by
the<00:01:19.380> derailleur<00:01:20.040> being<00:01:20.310> long<00:01:20.549> paid<00:01:20.880> here

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
the derailleur being long paid here

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
the derailleur being long paid here
although<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> really<00:01:23.670> good<00:01:23.820> range<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
although this is a really good range to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.190 
although this is a really good range to
have<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.840> climbing<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.320> hills<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:27.080> 3432<00:01:28.080> at

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
have for climbing up hills the 3432 at

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080 
have for climbing up hills the 3432 at
the<00:01:28.290> back<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:29.159> easy<00:01:29.340> gear<00:01:29.790> for

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the back that's really easy gear for

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.789 
the back that's really easy gear for
really<00:01:30.360> steep<00:01:30.540> gradients<00:01:31.079> which<00:01:31.259> some<00:01:31.500> people

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
really steep gradients which some people

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.149 
really steep gradients which some people
are<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:33.380> had<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> few<00:01:34.500> issues<00:01:34.770> with

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
are really like I had a few issues with

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.670 
are really like I had a few issues with
it<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.570> steps<00:01:36.900> between<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.470> gears

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
it because the steps between the gears

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.080 
it because the steps between the gears
are<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.100> big<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> change<00:01:38.820> gear

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
are really big when you change gear

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.030 
are really big when you change gear
sometimes<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.750> feels<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.590> chain<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
sometimes it feels like the chain is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
sometimes it feels like the chain is
dropping<00:01:41.460> off<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> cliff<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.899> be<00:01:42.990> very

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
dropping off a cliff and it can be very

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.789 
dropping off a cliff and it can be very
clunky<00:01:43.579> but<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.360> need<00:01:45.600> those<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.619> easy

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
clunky but if you need those really easy

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.399 
clunky but if you need those really easy
gears<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.450> could<00:01:48.659> be<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:49.020> good<00:01:49.200> option

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
gears then this could be a good option

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.359 
gears then this could be a good option

what you'd pay for a road bike one thing
though<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.790> fork<00:03:00.120> which<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.689> a<00:03:00.720> little

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
though is the fork which is a little

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.349 
though is the fork which is a little
uncompromising<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.819> that's<00:03:02.939> because<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
uncompromising and that's because the

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.869 
uncompromising and that's because the
fork<00:03:03.599> is<00:03:03.750> made<00:03:03.930> from<00:03:04.200> aluminium<00:03:04.879> something

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
fork is made from aluminium something

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.339 
fork is made from aluminium something
that<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.150> change<00:03:06.359> with<00:03:06.540> bikes<00:03:06.870> around<00:03:07.260> this

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
that can change with bikes around this

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.649 
that can change with bikes around this
price<00:03:07.560> point<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.760> start<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.090> get<00:03:09.209> carbon

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
price point is you start to get carbon

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.659 
price point is you start to get carbon
fiber<00:03:09.930> Forks<00:03:10.409> and<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.620> carbon<00:03:10.980> fiber<00:03:11.220> fork

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
fiber Forks and a carbon fiber fork

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.640 
fiber Forks and a carbon fiber fork
improves<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.419> ride<00:03:12.599> quality<00:03:12.840> quite<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.349> lot

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
improves the ride quality quite a lot

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.129 
improves the ride quality quite a lot
because<00:03:14.430> it's<00:03:15.150> able<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.450> dampen<00:03:16.019> out

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
because it's able to dampen out

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.780 
because it's able to dampen out
vibrations<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.069> come<00:03:17.129> through<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.579> front

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
vibrations that come through the front

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.119 
vibrations that come through the front
end<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.629> there's<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> little<00:03:19.079> bit<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.440> harshness

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
end so there's a little bit of harshness

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.619 
end so there's a little bit of harshness
coming<00:03:20.579> out<00:03:20.669> the<00:03:20.760> front<00:03:20.849> end<00:03:21.150> but<00:03:21.239> it's<00:03:21.389> not

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
coming out the front end but it's not

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.240 
coming out the front end but it's not
that<00:03:21.810> bad<00:03:21.989> actually<00:03:22.169> it<00:03:22.500> was<00:03:22.620> less<00:03:22.829> than<00:03:22.859> what

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
that bad actually it was less than what

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.789 
that bad actually it was less than what
I've<00:03:23.359> experienced<00:03:24.359> before<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.530> bottom

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
I've experienced before and the bottom

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.259 
I've experienced before and the bottom
bracket<00:03:25.889> is<00:03:26.190> really<00:03:26.489> stiff<00:03:26.699> as<00:03:26.819> well<00:03:27.000> so

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
bracket is really stiff as well so

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.149 
bracket is really stiff as well so
sprinting<00:03:28.199> on<00:03:28.319> this<00:03:28.440> bike<00:03:28.650> feels<00:03:28.889> pretty

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
sprinting on this bike feels pretty

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.619 
sprinting on this bike feels pretty
