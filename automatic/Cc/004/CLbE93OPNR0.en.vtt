00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.950 
okay let's go you see that defender two
guys<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> defender<00:01:03.449> trying<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> shop

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
guys see the defender trying to shop

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.260 
guys see the defender trying to shop
block<00:01:04.229> there<00:01:04.470> too<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> get

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
block there too so if we have if you get

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.149 
block there too so if we have if you get
a<00:01:06.299> big<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.020> they<00:01:07.110> start<00:01:07.380> trying<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> shop<00:01:07.920> walk

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
a big and they start trying to shop walk

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
a big and they start trying to shop walk
usually<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.270> end<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.750> this

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
usually they go end up like this

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.270 
usually they go end up like this
vertically<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> ball<00:01:11.189> in

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
vertically so if we can get the ball in

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.890 
vertically so if we can get the ball in
the<00:01:11.369> center<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.760> easy<00:01:12.000> for<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> center's<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the center it's easy for the center's to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.190 
the center it's easy for the center's to
be<00:01:13.020> able<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:15.330> guys<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.720> help<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.080> the

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.280 

that's<00:06:14.030> a<00:06:14.150> good<00:06:14.300> question<00:06:14.750> I<00:06:14.840> think<00:06:14.990> we<00:06:15.230> were

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
that's a good question I think we were

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.980 
that's a good question I think we were
just<00:06:15.350> we<00:06:16.040> were<00:06:16.220> a<00:06:16.610> lot<00:06:16.850> more<00:06:17.060> efficient<00:06:17.720> today

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
just we were a lot more efficient today

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.930 
just we were a lot more efficient today
than<00:06:18.320> we<00:06:18.470> were<00:06:18.650> yesterday<00:06:19.010> at<00:06:19.400> that<00:06:19.610> we<00:06:19.700> didn't

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
than we were yesterday at that we didn't

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.200 
than we were yesterday at that we didn't
control<00:06:20.780> the<00:06:20.960> ball<00:06:21.140> very<00:06:21.350> well<00:06:21.910> yesterday<00:06:22.910> and

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
control the ball very well yesterday and

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.720 
control the ball very well yesterday and
we<00:06:23.570> did<00:06:23.690> a<00:06:23.720> much<00:06:23.900> better<00:06:24.050> job<00:06:24.170> of<00:06:24.380> that<00:06:24.500> we<00:06:24.800> we

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
we did a much better job of that we we

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.440 
we did a much better job of that we we
can<00:06:25.760> still<00:06:27.160> be<00:06:28.160> better<00:06:28.370> but<00:06:28.640> I<00:06:28.700> think<00:06:29.000> for<00:06:29.390> the

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.450 
can still be better but I think for the

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.840 
can still be better but I think for the
most<00:06:29.600> part<00:06:29.720> we<00:06:30.050> we<00:06:30.350> valued<00:06:30.830> our<00:06:31.040> possessions<00:06:31.730> a

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
most part we we valued our possessions a

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.270 
most part we we valued our possessions a
lot<00:06:32.030> more<00:06:32.300> this<00:06:33.170> game<00:06:33.410> than<00:06:33.590> we<00:06:33.620> did<00:06:33.770> yesterday

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
lot more this game than we did yesterday

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.450 
lot more this game than we did yesterday
