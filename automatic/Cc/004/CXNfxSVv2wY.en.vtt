on the internet it's going to list for
price<00:01:29.590> of<00:01:29.740> under<00:01:30.040> $600<00:01:30.790> which<00:01:31.180> probably<00:01:31.479> means

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
price of under $600 which probably means

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.200 
price of under $600 which probably means
five<00:01:32.290> hundred<00:01:32.590> ninety<00:01:32.710> nine<00:01:32.860> dollars<00:01:33.210> but

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
confirm this but that's what we stated

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.130 
confirm this but that's what we stated
for<00:01:41.860> about<00:01:42.010> six<00:01:42.250> hundred<00:01:42.280> bucks

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
for about six hundred bucks

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.500 
for about six hundred bucks
there's<00:01:44.140> no<00:01:44.320> focal<00:01:44.950> length<00:01:45.190> on<00:01:45.400> it<00:01:45.640> the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
there's no focal length on it the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.840 
there's no focal length on it the
information<00:01:47.140> on<00:01:47.260> it<00:01:47.410> but<00:01:47.620> we<00:01:48.460> do<00:01:48.580> have<00:01:48.700> an

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
information on it but we do have an

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.740 
information on it but we do have an
aperture<00:01:49.650> setting<00:01:50.650> of<00:01:50.830> 2.4<00:01:51.580> which<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.510> assume

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
aperture setting of 2.4 which I assume

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.400 
aperture setting of 2.4 which I assume
that's<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.050> fixed<00:01:53.320> focal<00:01:55.110> length<00:01:56.110> at<00:01:56.320> the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
that's a fixed focal length at the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.060 
that's a fixed focal length at the
aperture<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:57.040> fixed<00:01:57.700> aperture<00:01:57.940> of<00:01:58.120> 2.4<00:01:59.070> yeah

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
aperture a fixed aperture of 2.4 yeah

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.460 
aperture a fixed aperture of 2.4 yeah
not<00:02:00.820> confirmed<00:02:01.270> but<00:02:01.540> that's<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:02.080> pressure<00:02:02.260> we

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
not confirmed but that's the pressure we

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.360 
not confirmed but that's the pressure we
have<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:04.360> available<00:02:04.600> it's<00:02:05.560> made<00:02:05.920> out<00:02:06.159> of<00:02:06.190> a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
have it's available it's made out of a

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.979 
have it's available it's made out of a
polymer<00:02:06.850> composite<00:02:08.729> which<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.879> can't<00:02:10.539> do<00:02:10.750> this

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
polymer composite which I can't do this

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.369 
polymer composite which I can't do this
kind<00:02:11.560> Chris<00:02:11.890> would<00:02:12.340> see<00:02:12.640> myself<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:16.379> it

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
kind Chris would see myself and it

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.500 
kind Chris would see myself and it

manufacturers have supplied and at the
top<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.670> can<00:02:27.730> see<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:28.030> standard<00:02:28.269> 18

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
top you can see the standard 18

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.589 
top you can see the standard 18
millimeter<00:02:29.140> lens<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.640> there<00:02:30.940> are<00:02:31.090> obviously

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
millimeter lens and there are obviously

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.600 
millimeter lens and there are obviously
lenses<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:32.230> are<00:02:32.290> wider<00:02:32.890> than<00:02:33.069> that<00:02:33.280> for

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
lenses that are wider than that for

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.920 
lenses that are wider than that for
example<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.030> finish<00:02:34.239> on<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.860> but<00:02:36.840> there<00:02:37.840> are

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
example the finish on it but there are

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.110 
example the finish on it but there are
not<00:02:38.020> near<00:02:38.440> as<00:02:38.620> wide<00:02:38.890> obviously<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:39.970> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
not near as wide obviously is the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.670 
not near as wide obviously is the

of the RH - one and one we live as you
can<00:02:44.620> see<00:02:45.930> now<00:02:47.519> let's<00:02:48.519> compare<00:02:48.790> this<00:02:49.000> lens<00:02:49.269> to<00:02:49.510> a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
can see now let's compare this lens to a

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.140 
can see now let's compare this lens to a
fish<00:02:49.780> on<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:49.989> fish<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.469> have<00:02:50.799> rounded<00:02:51.489> edges<00:02:51.640> and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
fish on a fish I have rounded edges and

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.270 
fish on a fish I have rounded edges and
they're<00:02:52.810> out<00:02:53.019> of<00:02:53.049> focus<00:02:53.290> while<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.920> center

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
they're out of focus while the center

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.509 
they're out of focus while the center
subject<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.909> in<00:02:55.599> focus<00:02:55.629> or<00:02:56.280> at<00:02:57.280> least<00:02:57.430> that's

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
subject is in focus or at least that's

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
want to be in focus or you could put it

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.140 
want to be in focus or you could put it
down<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.340> focus<00:03:21.639> depending<00:03:21.909> on<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.090> you

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
down the focus depending on that you

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.539 
down the focus depending on that you
know<00:03:22.359> how<00:03:22.540> far<00:03:22.780> away<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:23.049> is<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.370> but<00:03:24.370> with<00:03:24.489> a

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
know how far away it is and but with a

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.500 
know how far away it is and but with a
2.4<00:03:25.349> rapture<00:03:26.349> lens<00:03:26.879> it<00:03:27.879> should<00:03:28.150> come<00:03:28.359> in

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
2.4 rapture lens it should come in

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.179 
2.4 rapture lens it should come in
nicely<00:03:29.230> clear<00:03:29.560> as<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:29.769> can<00:03:29.919> see<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:30.099> this

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
nicely clear as you can see in this

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.899 
nicely clear as you can see in this

shot with it and it looked really nice
and<00:03:42.639> really<00:03:42.730> clear<00:03:43.090> all<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.659> way<00:03:43.750> across<00:03:43.989> from

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
and really clear all the way across from

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.000 
and really clear all the way across from
left<00:03:44.680> right<00:03:44.829> now<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.989> downside<00:03:47.169> to<00:03:47.530> this<00:03:47.650> as<00:03:47.859> I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
left right now the downside to this as I

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.599 
left right now the downside to this as I
see<00:03:48.250> it<00:03:49.949> obviously<00:03:50.949> when<00:03:51.129> you're<00:03:51.220> shooting<00:03:51.579> a

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
see it obviously when you're shooting a

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.539 
see it obviously when you're shooting a
stared<00:03:52.030> Definition<00:03:52.720> TV<00:03:52.840> or<00:03:53.829> a<00:03:53.889> widescreen<00:03:54.430> TV

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
or a video for youtube and like you're

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.309 
or a video for youtube and like you're
obviously<00:03:57.879> not<00:03:58.180> gonna<00:03:58.269> be<00:03:58.359> able<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.599> fill<00:03:58.780> the

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
obviously not gonna be able to fill the

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.849 
obviously not gonna be able to fill the
screen<00:04:00.040> from<00:04:00.549> top<00:04:00.729> to<00:04:00.760> bottom<00:04:01.590> you're<00:04:02.590> going

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
screen from top to bottom you're going

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.339 
screen from top to bottom you're going
to<00:04:02.949> be<00:04:03.010> giving<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.939> wide<00:04:04.479> angle<00:04:04.689> yes<00:04:05.109> it's<00:04:05.290> a

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
to be giving a wide angle yes it's a

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.599 
to be giving a wide angle yes it's a
wide<00:04:05.500> angle<00:04:05.709> but<00:04:05.919> it<00:04:06.040> won't<00:04:06.189> be<00:04:06.280> able<00:04:06.370> to<00:04:06.430> fill

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
wide angle but it won't be able to fill

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.699 
wide angle but it won't be able to fill
from<00:04:06.760> top<00:04:06.909> to<00:04:06.939> bottom<00:04:07.379> similar<00:04:08.379> to<00:04:08.530> the

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
from top to bottom similar to the

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.339 
from top to bottom similar to the
sixteen<00:04:09.250> by<00:04:09.699> nine<00:04:09.729> that<00:04:10.509> we<00:04:10.659> have<00:04:10.810> now<00:04:10.989> so<00:04:11.019> this

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
sixteen by nine that we have now so this

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.580 
sixteen by nine that we have now so this
is<00:04:11.409> even<00:04:11.739> wider<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:13.150> that's<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.959> downside

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
is even wider so that's a downside

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.879 
is even wider so that's a downside
however<00:04:15.479> for<00:04:16.479> photography<00:04:16.989> purposes<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.680> think

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
however for photography purposes I think

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.860 
however for photography purposes I think
this<00:04:18.039> is<00:04:18.190> going<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.459> be<00:04:18.519> really<00:04:18.940> really<00:04:19.449> neat<00:04:19.630> a

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
this is going to be really really neat a

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.589 
this is going to be really really neat a
very<00:04:20.229> good<00:04:20.349> video<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.859> do<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.599> shooting

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
very good video to do this to shooting

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.629 
very good video to do this to shooting
with<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:22.840> sometimes<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.830> think<00:04:24.039> for<00:04:24.490> most

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
with this sometimes but I think for most

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.820 
with this sometimes but I think for most
part<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.030> mean<00:04:26.580> normally<00:04:27.580> when<00:04:27.759> I<00:04:27.789> shoot<00:04:28.830> video

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
part I mean normally when I shoot video

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.450 
part I mean normally when I shoot video
or<00:04:31.020> something<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.289> most<00:04:32.830> people<00:04:32.949> want<00:04:33.340> the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
or something that most people want the

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.939 
or something that most people want the
entire<00:04:34.180> front<00:04:34.570> whether<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.840> says<00:04:35.050> sixteen<00:04:35.830> by

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
entire front whether it says sixteen by

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.920 
entire front whether it says sixteen by
nine<00:04:35.979> you<00:04:36.639> know<00:04:36.699> a<00:04:36.759> widescreen<00:04:37.120> TV<00:04:37.180> or

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
nine you know a widescreen TV or

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.409 
nine you know a widescreen TV or
standard<00:04:38.259> definition<00:04:38.320> TV<00:04:38.820> with<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.970> 3/4

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
standard definition TV with the 3/4

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.810 
standard definition TV with the 3/4
ratio<00:04:40.860> for<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:41.919> most<00:04:42.159> part<00:04:42.340> people<00:04:42.400> want<00:04:42.699> the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
ratio for the most part people want the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.710 
ratio for the most part people want the
entire<00:04:43.120> tub<00:04:43.780> filled<00:04:44.229> up<00:04:44.349> with<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.590> image

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
entire tub filled up with the image

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.930 
entire tub filled up with the image
content<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:47.160> this<00:04:47.250> obviously<00:04:47.670> this<00:04:47.760> is<00:04:47.910> not

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
content and this obviously this is not

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.030 
content and this obviously this is not
going<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.360> do<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:49.080> think<00:04:49.110> /<00:04:49.590> no<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:49.920> is

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
going to do that so I think / no this is

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.080 
going to do that so I think / no this is
just<00:04:50.160> me<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:52.280> think<00:04:53.280> person<00:04:53.610> this<00:04:53.700> is<00:04:53.820> going<00:04:53.970> to

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
just me I think person this is going to

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.660 
just me I think person this is going to
be<00:04:54.210> used<00:04:54.600> by<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:54.810> lot<00:04:55.530> more<00:04:55.710> for<00:04:55.890> photography

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
be used by a lot more for photography

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.790 
be used by a lot more for photography
than<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:56.970> will<00:04:57.060> be<00:04:57.120> for<00:04:57.240> video<00:04:57.660> I'm<00:04:58.410> not<00:04:58.590> saying

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
than it will be for video I'm not saying

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.960 
than it will be for video I'm not saying
there<00:04:58.920> aren't<00:04:58.950> some<00:04:59.280> eating<00:04:59.490> applications

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.390 
there aren't some eating applications
for<00:05:00.120> video<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:01.410> I<00:05:01.470> think<00:05:01.710> with<00:05:01.920> some<00:05:02.040> people

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
for video and I think with some people

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.370 
for video and I think with some people
creative<00:05:02.970> people<00:05:03.120> there<00:05:03.750> are<00:05:03.960> out<00:05:03.990> there

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
creative people there are out there

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.440 
creative people there are out there
confront<00:05:05.190> some<00:05:05.310> really<00:05:05.610> neat<00:05:05.820> uses<00:05:06.210> for<00:05:06.330> this

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
confront some really neat uses for this

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.900 
confront some really neat uses for this
in<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.080> video<00:05:07.350> but<00:05:07.830> I<00:05:07.890> think<00:05:08.220> personally<00:05:08.700> I

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
in the video but I think personally I

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.390 
in the video but I think personally I
think<00:05:09.150> I<00:05:09.330> can<00:05:09.630> see<00:05:09.810> more<00:05:10.020> people<00:05:10.320> using<00:05:11.190> this

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
think I can see more people using this

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.190 
think I can see more people using this
for<00:05:11.610> photography<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.450> in<00:05:12.540> doing<00:05:12.720> some<00:05:12.840> really

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
for photography and in doing some really

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.140 
for photography and in doing some really
neat<00:05:13.470> stuff<00:05:13.710> with<00:05:13.920> it<00:05:14.010> to<00:05:14.190> photographically<00:05:14.910> I

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
neat stuff with it to photographically I

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.530 
neat stuff with it to photographically I
mean<00:05:15.690> this<00:05:16.410> produces<00:05:17.280> with<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.360> right

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
mean this produces with the right

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.750 
mean this produces with the right
creative<00:05:18.810> people<00:05:19.080> there's<00:05:19.290> uses<00:05:19.590> for<00:05:19.740> both<00:05:19.770> no

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
creative people there's uses for both no

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.840 
creative people there's uses for both no
doubt<00:05:20.970> but<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.810> think<00:05:22.010> from<00:05:23.010> my<00:05:23.370> experience

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
doubt but I think from my experience

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.460 
doubt but I think from my experience
this<00:05:23.940> would<00:05:24.120> be<00:05:24.210> used<00:05:24.450> more<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:24.780> think<00:05:25.260> for

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
this would be used more I think for

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.130 
this would be used more I think for
photography<00:05:25.890> and<00:05:26.040> video<00:05:26.990> because<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.080> think

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
photography and video because I think

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.190 
photography and video because I think
once<00:05:28.530> you<00:05:28.650> get<00:05:28.830> over<00:05:28.920> the<00:05:29.040> additional<00:05:29.670> use

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
once you get over the additional use

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.470 
once you get over the additional use
that's<00:05:31.200> deep<00:05:31.410> for<00:05:31.440> video<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:31.860> know<00:05:31.950> I<00:05:31.980> think

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
that's deep for video you know I think

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.310 
that's deep for video you know I think
it's<00:05:33.480> more<00:05:33.720> really<00:05:35.060> chill<00:05:36.060> or<00:05:36.330> have<00:05:36.930> an<00:05:37.020> actual

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
it's more really chill or have an actual

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.170 
it's more really chill or have an actual
application<00:05:37.590> to<00:05:38.130> use<00:05:38.280> for<00:05:38.520> photography

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
application to use for photography

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.320 
application to use for photography
there's<00:05:40.020> my<00:05:40.110> personal<00:05:40.290> opinion<00:05:40.740> but<00:05:41.330> either

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
there's my personal opinion but either

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.770 
there's my personal opinion but either
