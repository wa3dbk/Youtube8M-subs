I can do that think taiko here okay
first<00:05:39.069> let's<00:05:40.919> clear<00:05:41.919> some<00:05:42.280> space

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:16.269 

so<00:06:10.789> the<00:06:10.879> most<00:06:11.089> going<00:06:11.239> to<00:06:11.329> take<00:06:11.479> six<00:06:11.809> hours<00:06:15.279> so

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.279 
so the most going to take six hours so

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:22.329 
so the most going to take six hours so
we'll<00:06:16.819> feed<00:06:17.119> her<00:06:17.569> or<00:06:17.929> sell<00:06:18.889> to<00:06:18.919> her<00:06:19.489> and<00:06:21.339> he's

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:22.339 
we'll feed her or sell to her and he's

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.109 
we'll feed her or sell to her and he's
got<00:06:22.610> a<00:06:22.639> pretty<00:06:22.969> easy<00:06:23.269> request<00:06:23.689> too<00:06:24.079> so<00:06:24.349> so<00:06:24.559> far

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:25.119 
got a pretty easy request too so so far

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.899 
got a pretty easy request too so so far
the<00:06:26.119> requests<00:06:26.569> are<00:06:26.749> pretty<00:06:27.619> reasonable<00:06:28.189> it's

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
the requests are pretty reasonable it's

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:33.339 
the requests are pretty reasonable it's
kind<00:06:29.299> of<00:06:29.389> hard<00:06:29.659> to<00:06:31.509> give<00:06:32.509> them<00:06:32.779> the<00:06:32.929> food<00:06:33.139> it's

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:33.349 
kind of hard to give them the food it's

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:38.859 
kind of hard to give them the food it's
tricky<00:06:34.069> to<00:06:34.309> slide<00:06:34.969> it<00:06:35.149> over<00:06:37.449> so<00:06:38.449> I<00:06:38.509> guess<00:06:38.689> now

00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:38.869 
tricky to slide it over so I guess now

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:41.349 
tricky to slide it over so I guess now
we<00:06:38.929> just<00:06:39.169> wait
