00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.060 
and again it's like the deck still has
at<00:02:01.330> its<00:02:01.390> core<00:02:01.930> what<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.230> did<00:02:02.380> last<00:02:02.560> for<00:02:02.830> me<00:02:02.950> it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
at its core what it did last for me it

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.670 
at its core what it did last for me it
can't<00:02:03.310> all<00:02:03.490> TK<00:02:03.790> as<00:02:04.300> much<00:02:04.960> as<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.230> could<00:02:05.380> last

them<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:25.930> it's<00:02:26.200> not<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.380> you're<00:02:27.040> going<00:02:27.190> to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
them so it's not like you're going to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.800 
them so it's not like you're going to
have<00:02:27.340> people<00:02:27.370> side<00:02:27.910> decking<00:02:28.270> in<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.540> ton<00:02:28.780> of

missed<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.460> timing<00:02:31.890> another<00:02:32.890> reason<00:02:33.220> why<00:02:33.340> I

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
missed the timing another reason why I

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.070 
missed the timing another reason why I
think<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.910> deck<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.360> pretty<00:02:34.690> good<00:02:34.840> right<00:02:35.050> now

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
think this deck is pretty good right now

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.120 
think this deck is pretty good right now
is<00:02:35.440> because<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:37.420> very<00:02:37.690> hard<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.080> otk<00:02:38.770> cash

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
is because it's very hard to otk cash

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.500 
is because it's very hard to otk cash
dragons<00:02:39.550> especially<00:02:39.760> when<00:02:40.240> they're<00:02:40.390> playing

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
dragons especially when they're playing

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.600 
dragons especially when they're playing
max<00:02:40.870> see<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.170> not<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.800> mean<00:02:42.010> because<00:02:42.130> then<00:02:42.520> they

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
max see you not I mean because then they

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.790 
max see you not I mean because then they
can<00:02:42.640> draw<00:02:42.970> on<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.270> their<00:02:43.810> copies<00:02:44.350> of<00:02:44.380> tragg

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
can draw on to their copies of tragg

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.460 
can draw on to their copies of tragg
they<00:02:44.830> can<00:02:45.250> draw<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.640> their<00:02:45.790> Gore's<00:02:46.090> so

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
they can draw on to their Gore's so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.690 
they can draw on to their Gore's so
definitely<00:02:47.470> like<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.740> defensive<00:02:48.400> line<00:02:48.430> up

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
definitely like the defensive line up

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.370 
definitely like the defensive line up
another<00:02:48.940> neat<00:02:49.209> trick<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.750> people<00:02:50.080> might<00:02:50.200> not

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
another neat trick that people might not

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.870 
another neat trick that people might not
realize<00:02:50.740> about<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.070> stick<00:02:51.280> night<00:02:51.580> assailant

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
realize about the stick night assailant

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.610 
realize about the stick night assailant
is<00:02:52.180> actually<00:02:52.510> really<00:02:52.840> good<00:02:53.020> in<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.380> deck

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
is actually really good in this deck

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.650 
is actually really good in this deck
because<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.340> can<00:02:54.490> pitch<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:54.970> summon<00:02:55.480> like

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
because you can pitch it to summon like

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.630 
because you can pitch it to summon like
pulsar<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.440> then<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:56.980> can<00:02:57.100> get<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.250> right<00:02:57.489> go

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
pulsar and then you can get a right go

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.520 
pulsar and then you can get a right go
back<00:02:57.850> from<00:02:58.090> your<00:02:58.209> hand<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.720> actually<00:02:58.989> like

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
back from your hand so it actually like

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.740 
back from your hand so it actually like
you<00:03:00.160> know<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.459> can<00:03:00.580> end<00:03:00.730> up<00:03:00.910> being<00:03:01.150> like<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.480> plus

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
you know it can end up being like a plus

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.229 
you know it can end up being like a plus
one<00:03:02.110> ish<00:03:02.440> type<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:03.070> thing<00:03:03.250> or<00:03:03.520> you<00:03:03.970> know<00:03:04.090> what<00:03:04.180> I

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
one ish type of thing or you know what I

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.110 
one ish type of thing or you know what I
mean<00:03:04.360> so<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.530> think<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.250> deck<00:03:06.520> is<00:03:06.730> still

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
mean so I think that this deck is still

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.470 
mean so I think that this deck is still
pretty<00:03:07.330> viable<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:08.290> think<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.670> matchup

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
pretty viable I think that the matchup

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.740 
pretty viable I think that the matchup
versus<00:03:11.080> wind<00:03:11.560> up<00:03:11.830> can<00:03:12.400> be<00:03:12.610> winnable<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:13.450> you're

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
versus wind up can be winnable if you're

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.260 
versus wind up can be winnable if you're
running<00:03:13.900> Maxie's<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:15.100> think<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.820> can<00:03:16.060> be<00:03:16.239> a

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
running Maxie's I think that it can be a

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.660 
running Maxie's I think that it can be a
little<00:03:16.570> troublesome<00:03:17.050> I<00:03:17.410> think<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.550> has<00:03:18.640> a

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
little troublesome I think that it has a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.030 
little troublesome I think that it has a
very<00:03:18.880> good<00:03:19.000> six<00:03:19.480> samurai<00:03:19.870> matchup<00:03:20.320> because<00:03:20.590> I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
very good six samurai matchup because I

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.740 
very good six samurai matchup because I
mean<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.580> don't<00:03:21.670> run<00:03:21.880> trap<00:03:22.120> set<00:03:22.330> all<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:22.600> only

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
mean you don't run trap set all you only
