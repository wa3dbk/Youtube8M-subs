00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.810
 manfredi a family watched over his being 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.730
 loved and in the middle of wakefulness the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.769

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.690
 had died from one in an operation to 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.340
 open heart and just one of the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.040
 reasons why it was realized 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.750
 because he always did not have the scar on 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.910
 the chest what powerfully calls the 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.290
 attention is that this was open drawer 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.290
