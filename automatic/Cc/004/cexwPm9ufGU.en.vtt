to allow in the human months to place
tension<00:01:13.700> on<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.910> skin<00:01:14.060> by<00:01:14.570> pushing<00:01:14.930> up

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
tension on the skin by pushing up

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.999 
tension on the skin by pushing up
instead<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:16.009> banjo<00:01:16.940> pulling<00:01:17.750> back<00:01:18.320> with<00:01:18.710> the

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
instead of a banjo pulling back with the

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.780 
instead of a banjo pulling back with the

hardware on the outside the neck is made
out<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.830> wormy<00:01:24.830> maple<00:01:25.640> also<00:01:26.509> known<00:01:26.720> as

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:38.550 
out of wormy maple also known as
ambrosia<00:01:29.950> put<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:30.979> carving<00:01:31.750> at<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.930> fifth<00:01:33.140> peg

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.890 

there's<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.650> nice<00:01:39.860> stripe<00:01:40.370> of<00:01:40.400> orally<00:01:41.300> maple<00:01:41.690> in

there's a nice stripe of orally maple in

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.649 
there's a nice stripe of orally maple in
the<00:01:42.200> peghead<00:01:42.409> along<00:01:43.190> with<00:01:43.370> rosewood<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.510> it's

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
the peghead along with rosewood so it's

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.700 
the peghead along with rosewood so it's
rosewood<00:01:44.960> wormy<00:01:45.590> maple<00:01:45.710> in<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.190> peghead<00:01:46.659> and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
rosewood wormy maple in the peghead and

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.560 
rosewood wormy maple in the peghead and
an<00:01:48.710> inlay<00:01:49.130> of<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.550> crescent<00:01:49.940> moon<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.270> star

an inlay of a crescent moon and star
fifth<00:01:51.580> fret<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.940> though<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.630> looks<00:01:56.869> like

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
fifth fret and though it looks like

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.440 
fifth fret and though it looks like
there<00:01:57.410> are<00:01:57.440> friction<00:01:57.950> pegs<00:01:58.220> in<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:59.150> banjo

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
there are friction pegs in this banjo

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.050 
there are friction pegs in this banjo
have<00:01:59.930> any<00:02:00.080> friction<00:02:00.470> pegs<00:02:00.890> these<00:02:01.880> are

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
have any friction pegs these are

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.340 
have any friction pegs these are
actually<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.600> peg<00:02:02.810> heads<00:02:03.220> mechanical

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
actually the peg heads mechanical

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.370 
actually the peg heads mechanical
friction<00:02:06.350> pettings<00:02:06.920> they<00:02:07.070> look<00:02:07.250> like<00:02:07.460> violin

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
friction pettings they look like violin

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.020 
friction pettings they look like violin
pegs<00:02:09.380> but<00:02:09.860> they<00:02:10.130> actually<00:02:10.369> have<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.820> mechanism

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
pegs but they actually have a mechanism

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.140 
pegs but they actually have a mechanism
on<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.540> inside<00:02:12.020> make<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.070> much<00:02:13.400> smoother<00:02:13.970> for

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
on the inside make it much smoother for

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.890 
on the inside make it much smoother for
tuning<00:02:14.600> these<00:02:15.380> things<00:02:15.680> are<00:02:15.830> awesome<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:17.239> little

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
tuning these things are awesome a little

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.210 
tuning these things are awesome a little
bit<00:02:18.019> more<00:02:18.140> difficult<00:02:18.320> than<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.800> thought<00:02:18.830> they'd

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
bit more difficult than I thought they'd

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.690 
bit more difficult than I thought they'd
be<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.640> install<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:21.160> once<00:02:22.160> they<00:02:22.370> were<00:02:22.430> there

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
be to install but once they were there

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.360 
be to install but once they were there
this<00:02:23.630> these<00:02:24.290> things<00:02:24.560> work<00:02:24.769> really<00:02:25.220> well

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
this these things work really well

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.960 
this these things work really well
they're<00:02:25.790> four<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.300> one<00:02:26.570> ratio<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:27.530> fine<00:02:28.459> tuning

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
they're four to one ratio so fine tuning

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.960 
they're four to one ratio so fine tuning
is<00:02:29.150> very<00:02:30.140> easy<00:02:30.410> with<00:02:30.769> these<00:02:30.950> same<00:02:31.730> with<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
is very easy with these same with the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.040 
is very easy with these same with the
fifth<00:02:32.239> peg<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.690> also<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.730> mechanical<00:02:34.730> pet<00:02:38.050> the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
fifth peg it's also a mechanical pet the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.440 
fifth peg it's also a mechanical pet the
bridge<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:40.180> bloodwood<00:02:41.180> with<00:02:42.910> walnut<00:02:43.910> yeah

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
bridge is bloodwood with walnut yeah

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.920 
bridge is bloodwood with walnut yeah
walnut<00:02:44.930> tail<00:02:45.860> pieces<00:02:46.340> bloodwood<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.120> i

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
walnut tail pieces bloodwood and i

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.560 
walnut tail pieces bloodwood and i
compensated<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.040> bridge<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.850> time<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.150> don't

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
compensated the bridge this time I don't

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.440 
compensated the bridge this time I don't
know<00:02:50.690> if<00:02:50.810> you<00:02:50.989> can<00:02:51.290> see<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.430> but<00:02:52.880> there's<00:02:53.390> a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
know if you can see that but there's a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.630 
know if you can see that but there's a
little<00:02:53.600> compensation<00:02:54.019> in<00:02:54.560> there<00:02:54.799> so<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
little compensation in there so the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.020 
little compensation in there so the
third<00:02:55.940> string<00:02:56.480> goes<00:02:56.780> further<00:02:57.110> back<00:02:57.410> than<00:02:57.440> the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
third string goes further back than the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.680 
third string goes further back than the
first<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.420> fifth<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.200> even<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.709> second<00:03:01.250> and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
first and fifth and even the second and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.199 
first and fifth and even the second and
fourth<00:03:02.690> go<00:03:03.530> back<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:03.799> little<00:03:04.100> bit<00:03:04.280> more<00:03:04.549> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
fourth go back a little bit more the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.229 
fourth go back a little bit more the
third<00:03:05.480> string<00:03:05.959> really<00:03:06.290> goes<00:03:06.920> back<00:03:07.160> farther<00:03:07.579> to

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
third string really goes back farther to

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.949 
third string really goes back farther to
help<00:03:08.420> compensate<00:03:09.820> which<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:11.030> always<00:03:11.299> problem

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
help compensate which is always problem

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.759 
help compensate which is always problem
