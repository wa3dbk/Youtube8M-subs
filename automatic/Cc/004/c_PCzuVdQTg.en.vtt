00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
out is just in the first couple seconds

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.410 
out is just in the first couple seconds
of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> trailer<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.609> missed<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> first<00:00:30.240> few

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
of the trailer I missed the first few

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.580 
of the trailer I missed the first few
times<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.810> guys<00:00:30.990> might<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.410> it's

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
times so you guys might have to it's

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.180 
times so you guys might have to it's
right<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.360> as<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.230> see<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.980> just

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
right here so as you can see we just

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.639 
right here so as you can see we just
zoomed<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.059> second<00:00:36.750> time<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.200> our<00:00:37.230> scope

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
zoomed in a second time with our scope

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.670 
zoomed in a second time with our scope
so<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.370> means<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.730> either<00:00:38.850> an<00:00:39.059> attachment

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
so that means it's either an attachment

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.799 
so that means it's either an attachment
specific<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> gun<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:42.059> least<00:00:42.300> able<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
specific to the gun or at least able to

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.110 
specific to the gun or at least able to
zoom<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.200> two<00:00:43.649> times<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.160> certain<00:00:44.610> guns<00:00:44.789> maybe

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
zoom in two times on certain guns maybe

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600 
zoom in two times on certain guns maybe
all<00:00:45.390> guns<00:00:45.690> could<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:46.680> attachment<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.460> don't

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
all guns could be an attachment we don't

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.299 
all guns could be an attachment we don't
know<00:00:47.730> yet<00:00:48.140> maybe<00:00:49.140> there's<00:00:49.379> even<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> third

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
know yet maybe there's even like a third

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:00.189 
know yet maybe there's even like a third
layer<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.030> zoom<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.600> find<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.559> some<00:00:52.590> point

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.720 

so<00:01:01.199> too<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.530> left<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> guy<00:01:02.460> about

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
so too are left here we see a guy about

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.329 
so too are left here we see a guy about
to<00:01:03.090> shoot<00:01:03.270> off<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.510> missile<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to shoot off a missile I think it's the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.250 
to shoot off a missile I think it's the
Archangel<00:01:05.970> missile<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:06.990> quite<00:01:07.170> sure

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
Archangel missile but I'm not quite sure

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.770 
Archangel missile but I'm not quite sure
and<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.000> would<00:01:09.119> mean<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.299> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and if it is that would mean that that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.030 
and if it is that would mean that that
would<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> first<00:01:10.290> kill<00:01:10.619> streak<00:01:10.920> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
would be the first kill streak you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.370 
would be the first kill streak you
really<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.080> shoot

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
really like get that you can like shoot

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530 
really like get that you can like shoot
like<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.650> I'm<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.580> sure<00:01:14.670> exactly<00:01:15.150> how<00:01:15.360> they

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
like that I'm not sure exactly how they

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.469 
like that I'm not sure exactly how they
do<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.380> randomly<00:01:17.250> make<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.820> gun

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
do that just like randomly make the gun

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.719 
do that just like randomly make the gun
pop<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.080> hands<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.799> I'm<00:01:20.340> still<00:01:20.640> not

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
pop up in your hands but I'm still not

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.249 
pop up in your hands but I'm still not
sure<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.030> that's<00:01:21.150> what<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.170> sign

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
sure if that's what that is or just sign

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.020 
sure if that's what that is or just sign
that<00:01:22.290> looks<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.130> we'll<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that looks like that but we'll see you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.100 
that looks like that but we'll see you
later

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.470 

so<00:01:30.740> right<00:01:31.010> here<00:01:31.160> on<00:01:31.280> our<00:01:31.490> back<00:01:31.880> we<00:01:32.150> see<00:01:32.330> this

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
so right here on our back we see this

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.380 
so right here on our back we see this
huge<00:01:32.540> backpack<00:01:33.500> thing<00:01:34.130> pretty<00:01:35.120> sure<00:01:35.270> that's

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
huge backpack thing pretty sure that's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.760 
huge backpack thing pretty sure that's
not<00:01:35.540> going<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.900> be<00:01:35.930> part<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.380> character

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
not going to be part of the character

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.590 
not going to be part of the character
models<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.640> seems<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.150> me<00:01:38.210> like<00:01:38.240> it's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
models that seems to me like it's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.510 
models that seems to me like it's
definitely<00:01:38.780> going<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.140> be<00:01:39.230> something<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:40.340> do

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
definitely going to be something to do

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.030 
definitely going to be something to do
with<00:01:40.670> create<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.120> class<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.870> my<00:01:42.560> opinion<00:01:42.830> I

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
with create a class in my opinion I

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.740 
with create a class in my opinion I
think<00:01:43.070> it's<00:01:43.340> going<00:01:43.430> to<00:01:43.520> be<00:01:43.610> like<00:01:43.880> for<00:01:44.150> example

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
think it's going to be like for example

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.830 
think it's going to be like for example
this<00:01:45.200> thing<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.650> think<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.160> could<00:01:46.280> be<00:01:46.690> if<00:01:47.690> you

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
this thing I think it could be if you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.150 
this thing I think it could be if you
have<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.140> thing<00:01:48.350> on<00:01:48.470> your<00:01:48.560> back<00:01:48.620> it<00:01:49.010> gives

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
have this thing on your back it gives

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.760 
have this thing on your back it gives
you<00:01:49.400> like<00:01:49.580> extra<00:01:50.060> ammo<00:01:50.479> because<00:01:51.410> that's<00:01:51.620> what

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
you like extra ammo because that's what

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.380 
you like extra ammo because that's what
it<00:01:51.800> seems<00:01:52.040> like<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.340> would<00:01:52.400> do<00:01:52.580> but<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.210> might

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
it seems like it would do but it might

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.380 
it seems like it would do but it might
slow<00:01:53.600> down<00:01:53.690> your<00:01:54.020> speed<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.670> think<00:01:56.150> the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
slow down your speed but I think the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.630 
slow down your speed but I think the
black<00:01:57.110> ops<00:01:57.350> will<00:01:57.590> have<00:01:57.830> trade-offs<00:01:58.130> like<00:01:58.460> that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
black ops will have trade-offs like that

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.950 
black ops will have trade-offs like that
since<00:01:58.910> I<00:01:59.000> said<00:01:59.180> they<00:01:59.330> were<00:01:59.360> doing<00:01:59.570> some<00:01:59.840> new

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
since I said they were doing some new

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:09.249 
since I said they were doing some new
stuff<00:02:00.170> with<00:02:00.380> creative<00:02:00.800> class<00:02:07.899> so<00:02:08.899> right<00:02:09.229> here

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
stuff with creative class so right here

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.070 
stuff with creative class so right here
we<00:02:09.560> see<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:10.040> sniper<00:02:10.489> I<00:02:10.820> believe<00:02:11.660> he's<00:02:11.810> holding

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
we see a sniper I believe he's holding

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.600 
we see a sniper I believe he's holding
the<00:02:12.110> dragon<00:02:12.560> off<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.920> i<00:02:12.950> want<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.280> point<00:02:13.430> that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
the dragon off so i want to point that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.670 
the dragon off so i want to point that
out<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> dragon<00:02:15.230> off<00:02:15.320> will<00:02:15.440> be<00:02:15.530> back

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
out so that the dragon off will be back

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.260 
out so that the dragon off will be back
in<00:02:15.950> black<00:02:16.220> ops<00:02:16.459> because<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.820> wasn't<00:02:17.150> in

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
in black ops because it wasn't in

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.449 
in black ops because it wasn't in
Mulford<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.840> multiplayer<00:02:18.320> also<00:02:19.040> we<00:02:19.160> see<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
Mulford to multiplayer also we see the

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.520 
Mulford to multiplayer also we see the
remote<00:02:19.670> control<00:02:20.000> car<00:02:20.209> behind<00:02:20.540> showing<00:02:21.440> you

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
remote control car behind showing you

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.949 
remote control car behind showing you
can<00:02:21.709> do<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:23.440> humiliation<00:02:24.440> kills<00:02:24.709> like<00:02:25.160> and

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
can do like humiliation kills like and

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.390 
can do like humiliation kills like and
now<00:02:26.959> we<00:02:27.020> see<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.770> can<00:02:27.950> add<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.250> can

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
now we see that you can add you can

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.949 
now we see that you can add you can
actually<00:02:28.580> detonate<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.270> because<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.840> last

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
actually detonate it because in the last

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.510 
actually detonate it because in the last
trailer<00:02:30.380> wasn't<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.800> obvious<00:02:30.950> if<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.370> could

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
trailer wasn't that obvious if you could

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.340 
trailer wasn't that obvious if you could
actually<00:02:31.970> detonate<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.690> car<00:02:32.870> if<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.080> had<00:02:33.230> to

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
actually detonate the car if you had to

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.229 
actually detonate the car if you had to
run<00:02:33.530> into<00:02:33.770> something<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.190> blow<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.489> up<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:35.120> in

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
run into something to blow it up but in

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.060 
run into something to blow it up but in
a<00:02:35.330> second<00:02:35.660> we'll<00:02:35.750> see<00:02:35.900> that<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.380> actually

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
a second we'll see that you can actually

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:57.610 
a second we'll see that you can actually
detonate<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.820> car<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.120> blow<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.390> up

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.990 

so<00:02:58.620> right<00:02:58.950> here<00:02:59.160> we<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.430> what<00:02:59.610> i<00:02:59.640> believe<00:02:59.970> to

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
so right here we have what i believe to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.410 
so right here we have what i believe to
be<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.210> biggest<00:03:00.600> reveal<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.050> trailer<00:03:02.420> they

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
be the biggest reveal the trailer they

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.570 
be the biggest reveal the trailer they
don't<00:03:03.570> directly<00:03:04.260> say<00:03:04.590> anything<00:03:04.980> but<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.490> me

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
don't directly say anything but to me

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.550 
don't directly say anything but to me
it's<00:03:05.700> obvious<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.600> hinting<00:03:06.990> at<00:03:07.110> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it's obvious that this is hinting at the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.670 
it's obvious that this is hinting at the
nazi<00:03:07.980> zombies<00:03:08.490> version<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.300> black<00:03:10.110> ops<00:03:10.320> or<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
nazi zombies version of black ops or the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.580 
nazi zombies version of black ops or the
black<00:03:10.860> ops<00:03:11.070> version<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.460> nazi<00:03:11.700> zombies<00:03:12.590> so

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
black ops version of nazi zombies so

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.100 
black ops version of nazi zombies so
here's<00:03:14.250> what<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.610> take<00:03:14.850> from<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.210> picture<00:03:15.420> if

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
here's what I take from this picture if

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.160 
here's what I take from this picture if
you<00:03:16.170> cover<00:03:16.980> up<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.250> bottom<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> mouth<00:03:18.170> you

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
you cover up the bottom of the mouth you

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.200 
you cover up the bottom of the mouth you
see<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.980> top<00:03:20.160> head<00:03:20.490> is<00:03:20.700> basically<00:03:21.120> an

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
see that the top head is basically an

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.150 
see that the top head is basically an
alien<00:03:21.570> face<00:03:21.810> like<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.230> eyes<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.770> nose<00:03:22.800> and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
alien face like the eyes the nose and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.480 
alien face like the eyes the nose and
everything<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:24.209> bottom<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.810> mouth<00:03:24.959> uh

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
everything the bottom of the mouth uh

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.460 
everything the bottom of the mouth uh
seems<00:03:26.490> to<00:03:26.640> be<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:26.940> more<00:03:27.390> vicious<00:03:28.110> than<00:03:28.140> we

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
seems to be like more vicious than we

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.160 
seems to be like more vicious than we
see<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.920> aliens<00:03:29.459> used<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.760> be<00:03:29.880> could<00:03:30.630> have<00:03:30.959> to

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
see like aliens used to be could have to

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.460 
see like aliens used to be could have to
hint<00:03:31.410> at<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.830> zombies<00:03:32.550> themselves<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
hint at like zombies themselves and the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.250 
hint at like zombies themselves and the
top<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:35.100> hat<00:03:35.280> he's<00:03:35.550> wearing<00:03:35.810> that's<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.959> beret

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
top the hat he's wearing that's a beret

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.400 
top the hat he's wearing that's a beret
from<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.860> Russian<00:03:38.340> Spetsnaz<00:03:38.610> army<00:03:39.410> so

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
from the Russian Spetsnaz army so

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.770 
from the Russian Spetsnaz army so
basically<00:03:40.770> what<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.010> think<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.400> is<00:03:41.820> in

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
basically what I think this is is in

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.380 
basically what I think this is is in
World<00:03:43.650> War<00:03:43.770> we<00:03:44.040> had<00:03:44.190> nazi<00:03:44.670> zombies<00:03:45.000> right<00:03:45.180> so

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
World War we had nazi zombies right so

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.470 
World War we had nazi zombies right so
we<00:03:45.510> had<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.750> zombies<00:03:46.200> crazy<00:03:47.090> undead<00:03:48.090> things

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
we had the zombies crazy undead things

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.020 
we had the zombies crazy undead things
that<00:03:48.840> are<00:03:49.260> zombies<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:49.920> then<00:03:50.280> we<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.670> Nazi

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
that are zombies and then we the Nazi

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
that are zombies and then we the Nazi
part<00:03:51.270> was<00:03:51.709> like<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.739> political<00:03:53.250> party<00:03:53.610> so<00:03:54.480> this

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
part was like a political party so this

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.150 
part was like a political party so this
has<00:03:55.200> come<00:03:55.440> at<00:03:55.590> this<00:03:55.739> game<00:03:55.950> is<00:03:56.190> played<00:03:56.459> during<00:03:56.730> a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
has come at this game is played during a

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.880 
has come at this game is played during a
soviet<00:03:59.160> russia<00:03:59.760> so<00:04:00.180> back<00:04:00.870> when<00:04:00.900> communism<00:04:01.560> was

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
soviet russia so back when communism was

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.789 
soviet russia so back when communism was
in<00:04:02.370> Russia<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.900> think<00:04:03.989> they'll<00:04:04.290> keep<00:04:04.500> like

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
in Russia so I think they'll keep like

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.250 
in Russia so I think they'll keep like
the<00:04:04.950> name<00:04:05.330> having<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.510> something<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.080> do<00:04:07.140> with

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
the name having a something to do with

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.199

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
politics that start still have this is

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.280 
politics that start still have this is
what<00:04:09.360> I'm<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.720> what<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:09.930> guessing<00:04:10.200> right

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290
