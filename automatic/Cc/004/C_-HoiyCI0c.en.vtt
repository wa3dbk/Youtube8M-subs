it's actually missing a channel actually
missing<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.119> channel<00:01:42.360> something<00:01:43.360> come<00:01:44.170> when<00:01:44.289> we

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
missing a channel something come when we

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.370 
missing a channel something come when we
found<00:01:44.679> in<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:46.210> then<00:01:46.330> turned<00:01:46.570> out<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:46.929> a<00:01:47.020> chip

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
found in and then turned out on a chip

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.210 
found in and then turned out on a chip
and<00:01:47.860> that's<00:01:48.039> on<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.280> chip<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.770> movement

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
and that's on the chip and the movement

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.249 
and that's on the chip and the movement
of<00:01:54.310> thus<00:01:54.490> prices<00:01:55.119> is<00:01:56.020> less<00:01:56.590> fluid<00:01:58.259> they

quite of the console of quite of the the
other<00:02:42.299> fake<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.709> let<00:02:47.920> down<00:02:48.130> by<00:02:48.340> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
other fake but it's let down by the

sound

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.140 

but<00:02:52.620> morale<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.310> bad<00:02:53.610> as<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.849> Star<00:02:56.849> Plus

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.330 
but morale is bad as this is Star Plus
and<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.540> plays<00:02:58.110> in<00:02:58.349> sounds<00:02:58.769> pretty<00:02:58.980> pretty

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340

okay<00:03:02.720> yeah<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.319> screen<00:03:04.560> updates<00:03:04.860> it's<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.340> bit

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
okay yeah the screen updates it's a bit

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.720 
okay yeah the screen updates it's a bit
stuttering<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:07.379> that<00:03:07.590> could<00:03:07.890> be<00:03:07.920> because<00:03:08.340> it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
stuttering but that could be because it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.910 
stuttering but that could be because it
is<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.060> NTSC<00:03:09.720> version<00:03:10.189> running<00:03:11.189> on<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> pal<00:03:11.579> TV

right so this system is actually quite

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.670 
right so this system is actually quite
quite<00:04:12.150> good<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.690> mean<00:04:12.960> a<00:04:12.990> lot<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.440> games

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
quite good I mean a lot of the games

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.110 
quite good I mean a lot of the games
they<00:04:13.980> play<00:04:14.010> well<00:04:15.920> well<00:04:16.920> this<00:04:17.040> is<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.340> sound<00:04:17.580> is

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
they play well well this is the sound is

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.760 
they play well well this is the sound is
is<00:04:18.480> okay<00:04:20.239> but<00:04:21.239> not<00:04:21.450> for<00:04:21.750> for<00:04:22.050> more<00:04:22.440> intense

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
is okay but not for for more intense

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.090 
is okay but not for for more intense
games<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.220> mean<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.580> game<00:04:23.880> gun<00:04:24.180> AK<00:04:25.070> gun<00:04:26.070> i

games I mean this game gun AK gun i
ganic<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:26.940> game<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.240> is<00:04:27.540> that<00:04:28.410> has<00:04:28.680> a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
ganic is a game that is that has a

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.110 
ganic is a game that is that has a
multi-channel

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
multi-channel

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.980 
multi-channel
out<00:04:31.760> they<00:04:32.760> do<00:04:32.820> something<00:04:33.180> with<00:04:33.420> the<00:04:33.480> waveforms

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
out they do something with the waveforms

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.020 
out they do something with the waveforms
it<00:04:34.080> really<00:04:34.290> intense<00:04:34.680> music<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.610> see<00:04:35.850> that

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
it really intense music and you see that

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.850 
it really intense music and you see that
this<00:04:36.270> device<00:04:36.510> fails<00:04:37.230> with<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.740> music<00:04:38.690> I<00:04:39.860> just

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
this device fails with that music I just

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.670 
this device fails with that music I just
wanted<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.250> show<00:04:41.550> him<00:04:42.170> before<00:04:43.170> I<00:04:43.200> run<00:04:43.500> out<00:04:43.620> of

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
wanted to show him before I run out of

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.390 
wanted to show him before I run out of
time<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.580> let's<00:04:44.910> disconnect<00:04:45.330> yeah<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:47.220> video

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
time and let's disconnect yeah the video

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.480 
time and let's disconnect yeah the video
cable<00:04:47.790> here<00:04:48.410> show<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:50.000> quality<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.390> the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
of the building screen of course this is

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:11.760 
of the building screen of course this is
very<00:04:56.580> shiny<00:04:58.850> okay<00:04:59.850> let's<00:05:00.060> just<00:05:00.390> select<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:00.900> game

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.260 

this<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:12.920> adventure<00:05:13.430> island<00:05:13.820> without<00:05:14.000> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
this is adventure island without the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.980 
this is adventure island without the
Starscream

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:24.450 

yeah<00:05:17.990> that's<00:05:18.140> very<00:05:18.200> hard<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.620> tell

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.100 

perhaps<00:05:25.460> if<00:05:25.640> I<00:05:25.760> turn<00:05:26.030> on<00:05:26.210> that<00:05:26.420> crow<00:05:26.690> right

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
perhaps if I turn on that crow right

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.720 
perhaps if I turn on that crow right
alright<00:05:30.110> so<00:05:30.530> what<00:05:30.770> is<00:05:30.800> there<00:05:31.160> to<00:05:31.340> tell<00:05:31.520> about

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
alright so what is there to tell about

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.940 
alright so what is there to tell about
this<00:05:32.590> about<00:05:33.590> this<00:05:33.890> machine<00:05:34.750> that<00:05:35.950> actually

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
this about this machine that actually

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.090 
this about this machine that actually
plays<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.460> lot<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.150> cards<00:05:38.810> quite<00:05:39.110> well<00:05:39.410> the

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
plays a lot of the cards quite well the

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.420 
plays a lot of the cards quite well the
controls<00:05:40.550> are<00:05:40.760> pretty<00:05:40.790> pretty<00:05:41.390> ok<00:05:41.810> as<00:05:42.110> well

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
controls are pretty pretty ok as well

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.830 
controls are pretty pretty ok as well
yeah<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.660> option<00:05:45.110> to<00:05:45.320> connect<00:05:46.040> other

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
yeah the option to connect other

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.980 
yeah the option to connect other
joysticks<00:05:47.840> to<00:05:48.050> this<00:05:49.090> on<00:05:50.090> this<00:05:50.330> ports<00:05:50.720> through

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
joysticks to this on this ports through

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.460 
joysticks to this on this ports through
this<00:05:51.110> adapter<00:05:52.100> which<00:05:52.670> is<00:05:52.700> sadly<00:05:53.150> missing<00:05:53.690> from

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
this adapter which is sadly missing from

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.370 
this adapter which is sadly missing from
my<00:05:54.650> package<00:05:55.460> is<00:05:56.270> very<00:05:56.330> nice<00:05:56.810> also<00:05:58.690> yeah<00:05:59.690> the

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
my package is very nice also yeah the

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.230 
my package is very nice also yeah the
screen<00:06:00.620> the<00:06:00.800> Derman<00:06:01.100> screen<00:06:01.400> its<00:06:01.760> although

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
screen the Derman screen its although

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.980 
screen the Derman screen its although
it's<00:06:02.419> bright<00:06:02.660> it's<00:06:02.990> sort<00:06:03.350> of<00:06:04.510> has<00:06:05.510> a<00:06:05.540> roll<00:06:05.810> at

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
it's bright it's sort of has a roll at

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.400 
it's bright it's sort of has a roll at
low<00:06:06.350> resolution<00:06:07.100> and<00:06:07.720> which<00:06:08.720> lets<00:06:08.990> it<00:06:09.230> down

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
low resolution and which lets it down

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.190 
low resolution and which lets it down
and<00:06:09.740> perhaps<00:06:10.490> it<00:06:11.210> has<00:06:11.390> to<00:06:11.570> do<00:06:11.690> with<00:06:11.810> the<00:06:11.900> fact

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
and perhaps it has to do with the fact

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.560 
and perhaps it has to do with the fact
that<00:06:12.290> they<00:06:12.560> use<00:06:13.280> a<00:06:13.930> mystery<00:06:14.930> TFT<00:06:15.560> display<00:06:16.570> I'm

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
that they use a mystery TFT display I'm

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.270 
that they use a mystery TFT display I'm
not<00:06:17.750> sure<00:06:17.990> but<00:06:19.210> yeah<00:06:20.320> no<00:06:21.320> not<00:06:21.770> really

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
not sure but yeah no not really

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.240 
not sure but yeah no not really
and<00:06:22.490> then<00:06:22.640> there's<00:06:22.850> I<00:06:23.120> think<00:06:24.080> that<00:06:24.500> the<00:06:24.710> device

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
and then there's I think that the device

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.590 
and then there's I think that the device
that<00:06:26.620> maximally<00:06:27.620> was<00:06:27.770> shown<00:06:27.979> the<00:06:28.130> other<00:06:28.250> day

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
that maximally was shown the other day

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.900 
that maximally was shown the other day
is<00:06:29.600> actually<00:06:29.990> a<00:06:30.020> lot<00:06:30.860> better<00:06:31.070> than<00:06:31.250> this<00:06:31.640> one

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
is actually a lot better than this one

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.650 
is actually a lot better than this one
but<00:06:32.570> you<00:06:32.840> know<00:06:33.169> I<00:06:33.530> won't<00:06:34.340> i<00:06:34.580> won't<00:06:34.760> throw<00:06:35.600> a

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
but you know I won't i won't throw a

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.150 
but you know I won't i won't throw a
garbage<00:06:36.110> bin<00:06:36.290> it's<00:06:36.530> nice<00:06:36.710> to<00:06:36.919> have<00:06:37.070> a<00:06:39.160> console

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
garbage bin it's nice to have a console

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.940 
garbage bin it's nice to have a console
action<00:06:40.700> here<00:06:41.090> got<00:06:41.900> them<00:06:42.020> clone<00:06:42.320> council
