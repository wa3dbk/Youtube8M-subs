00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.649
 Brother shows up for greater distance 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:06.860
 however, due to the longer term 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.270
 more precisely an old acquaintance the aek 971 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.640
 will be back in battlefield 4 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.890

 fire rate and will be the three 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.690
 shot where the fully automatic semi 

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:26.020
 automatic as well as the burst mode for 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.270

 successor of ak 74 and at the same time 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.810
 bigger brother of ak u12 carbine 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.759
 has a moderate cadence and 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.110
 uses the standard ammo 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.479
 the russian forces the audi a3 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.690
 which you already in part 3 to 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.979
 stand is a storm rifle in 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.569
 wulfert this allows this 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.759
 Austrian litter one 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:00.500
 Ergonomic handling with one 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.869
 average fire rate and the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.000
 standard fire where the semi and 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.500
 fully automatically goes along with the cz 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.959
 805 we would have a new climber in the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.250
 battlefield franchise this modern 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.459
 assault rifle with czech roots 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.340
 can do this with a m16 a3 or a 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.200
 ak 74 m 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.450
 I already had this rifle in 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.410
 my weapons review on alfa weapons 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.480
 presented with the farmers we would have 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.310
 again with the compact french 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.900
 from the lot 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.150
 this weapon also corresponds to the bult 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.440
 Papers and has one of the highest 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.360
 guessing in the game 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.340
 This is what makes them in close combat 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.959
 situations become a deadly adversary 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.980
 where you can be faster than that 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.340
 should draw shade with the m 16 a4 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.829
 the controversial m16 a3 is abolished 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.079
 yes right with you on the 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.349
 gamescom the times m16 should be it 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.569
 originally this is about a m16 a4 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.819
 means that dice the beloved as well 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.260
 hated weapon in part 4 from the race 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.180
 takes the m4 16 also closes 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.430
 same with when it comes to well-known 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.230
 Konsorten goes with this assault rifle 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.360
 is definitely not wrong 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.599
 if you want a complete entry-level package 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.870
 as far as the achievements of the weapon are concerned 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.670
 The Chinese Kubi z 95 1 is ours 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.900
 already known from battlefield 3 and 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.730
 put the assault rifle healthy 95 b1 there 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.139
 This is expressed above all in the longer 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.850
 run the weapon with one 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.280
 correspondingly greater precision 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.280
 accompanied 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.160
 these are singapore produced sar 21 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.440
 resembles in its design strongly the aok 3 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.560
 This is mainly due to the used 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.959
 burkhard bauer the sar is due 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.209
 your design especially in monastery 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.489
 situation suitable whereby however the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.290
 Due to the design longer surname 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.349
 time taken into account in any case 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.200
 this should also be kh being here 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.180
 harp harry is already out 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.340
 Battlefield 3 is known and shoots in 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.650
 her happy version also accordingly 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.389
 stronger caliber 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.160
 this means more damage 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.130
 your opponents compared to others 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.510
 storm rifles in battlefield 4 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.030
 However, this advantage is with a 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.370
 Magazine capacity of only 20 balls 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.120
 compensates and forces you to do so 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.320
 continuous fire talks to abstain 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.090
 I hope you are the next 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.400
 I'll be there and of course I'm happy 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.470
 over a thumb after 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.270
 if you liked it in this 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.270
 senses deals with your goal in the eye
