tool on mode I did it for each character
here<00:00:37.350> which<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.340> pretty<00:00:38.550> easy<00:00:39.710> once<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.829> know

the<00:02:09.680> wing

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.479 

okay<00:02:29.099> so<00:02:29.160> that's<00:02:29.430> wings<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.099> we'll<00:02:33.319> go<00:02:34.319> to

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
okay so that's wings so then we'll go to

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.259 
okay so that's wings so then we'll go to
on<00:02:35.489> mode<00:02:36.019> it's<00:02:37.019> like<00:02:37.260> they're<00:02:37.500> darker<00:02:38.269> shade

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
on mode it's like they're darker shade

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.259 
on mode it's like they're darker shade
maybe<00:02:39.810> we'll<00:02:40.170> go<00:02:40.489> like<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.519> bad<00:02:42.120> orange<00:02:44.269> and

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
maybe we'll go like a bad orange and

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.870 
maybe we'll go like a bad orange and
we'll<00:02:45.420> select<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.019> brush<00:02:46.230> random<00:02:47.220> brush<00:02:47.400> should

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
we'll select a brush random brush should

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.220 
we'll select a brush random brush should
be<00:02:48.000> fine<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:50.459> select<00:02:51.030> whatever<00:02:51.450> um<00:02:51.870> tell<00:02:52.200> me

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
be fine and select whatever um tell me

be fine and select whatever um tell me
why<00:02:52.470> are<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.010> I'm<00:02:53.129> like<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.340> stick<00:02:53.730> with

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
why are you so I'm like just stick with

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:00.500 
why are you so I'm like just stick with
that<00:02:54.060> texture<00:02:56.450> um<00:02:58.459> then<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.489> fixed<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.150> area

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
that texture um then you fixed that area

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.979 
that texture um then you fixed that area
that<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.750> filled<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.549> very<00:03:02.880> handy<00:03:03.209> so

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
that you filled so it's very handy so

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.860 
that you filled so it's very handy so
you<00:03:04.079> didn't<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.349> to<00:03:04.410> race<00:03:05.180> around<00:03:06.180> the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.530 

character<00:03:09.870> or<00:03:10.019> figure<00:03:10.349> well<00:03:10.530> shape<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.099> did

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
character or figure well shape you did

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.589 
character or figure well shape you did
so<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.599> only<00:03:12.660> fills<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.170> area<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.769> feel

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
so it only fills the area that you feel

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.199 
so it only fills the area that you feel
um<00:03:16.700> see<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.819> it's<00:03:18.510> some<00:03:18.900> pretty<00:03:19.170> easy<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:21.090> fill

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
um see it it's some pretty easy to fill

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.949 
um see it it's some pretty easy to fill
it<00:03:21.360> in<00:03:21.450> with<00:03:21.480> different<00:03:21.930> colors<00:03:22.319> textures

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
it in with different colors textures

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.660 
it in with different colors textures
even<00:03:24.959> other<00:03:25.170> tools<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:26.400> even<00:03:26.579> fair<00:03:27.620> he

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
even other tools so like even fair he

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.559 
even other tools so like even fair he
can<00:03:29.670> um<00:03:29.850> never<00:03:30.810> green<00:03:31.200> fairy<00:03:31.590> wings<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:33.420> only

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
can um never green fairy wings that only

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.330 
can um never green fairy wings that only
affects<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:35.540> area<00:03:36.540> filled<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.100> still

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
affects that area filled so it's still

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.930 
affects that area filled so it's still
got<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.579> fairy<00:03:38.880> texture<00:03:39.540> but<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.760> mean<00:03:41.760> that

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
got the fairy texture but I mean that

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.620 
got the fairy texture but I mean that
area<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:44.310> can<00:03:44.459> even<00:03:44.609> do<00:03:44.850> stripes<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.569> is

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
area you can even do stripes this is

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.340 
area you can even do stripes this is
like<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.109> best<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:47.370> can<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:48.299> stripes<00:03:48.900> and

everything pretty neat and then we'll um
use<00:05:42.490> onload<00:05:44.700> put<00:05:45.700> in<00:05:45.850> some<00:05:46.350> mmm<00:05:47.350> maybe<00:05:47.710> put<00:05:48.100> a

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
use onload put in some mmm maybe put a

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.350 
use onload put in some mmm maybe put a
cup<00:05:48.520> put<00:05:49.480> some<00:05:49.510> texture<00:05:50.200> over<00:05:50.560> it<00:05:51.060> maybe<00:05:52.060> give

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
cup put some texture over it maybe give

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.360 
cup put some texture over it maybe give
them<00:05:52.510> a<00:05:52.600> bit<00:05:52.750> of<00:05:52.780> shading<00:05:53.490> um<00:05:55.830> use<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:57.130> cool

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
them a bit of shading um use the cool

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:07.690 
them a bit of shading um use the cool
crosshatch<00:05:58.300> II<00:05:58.330> tool

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:22.090 

you<00:06:08.300> the<00:06:08.720> texture<00:06:16.210> and<00:06:20.380> maybe<00:06:21.380> textures<00:06:21.860> a<00:06:21.890> bit

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.100 
you the texture and maybe textures a bit

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.270 
you the texture and maybe textures a bit
too<00:06:22.280> much<00:06:22.490> so<00:06:22.790> will<00:06:23.210> on<00:06:24.010> make<00:06:25.010> it<00:06:25.160> more

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
too much so will on make it more

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:37.120 
too much so will on make it more
smoother<00:06:25.730> off

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.780 

so<00:06:38.130> anyway<00:06:38.370> then<00:06:39.330> we're<00:06:39.479> going<00:06:39.660> to<00:06:39.690> take<00:06:40.790> give

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
so anyway then we're going to take give

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:49.520 
so anyway then we're going to take give
him<00:06:41.880> some<00:06:42.060> stripes<00:06:44.660> just<00:06:45.660> like<00:06:45.840> a<00:06:45.990> tiger<00:06:48.530> and

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
him some stripes just like a tiger and

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.999 
him some stripes just like a tiger and
it's<00:06:49.830> um<00:06:50.900> I'm<00:06:51.900> not<00:06:52.050> affected<00:06:52.610> by<00:06:53.610> the<00:06:53.669> tool

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 
it's um I'm not affected by the tool

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:57.740
