00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.410
 you can use the samsung galaxy tab 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.450
 Take with you everywhere 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.059
 and what about me now with a tablet yet 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.519
 Miss this is my favorite music 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.230
 few photos and of course videos about me 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.550
 to entertain but maybe also around 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.720
 friends known couple great 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.970
 show holiday pictures 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.609
 So what do we have to do to copy 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.320
 the data from the computer to the tablet 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.720
 pcs is quite simple in the scope of delivery 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 Do you have the data cable already doing that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.070
 means that connect once to the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.630
 galaxy tab below and the usb plug 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.390
 on the other side they're stuck in 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.239
 the usb port of your notebook or yours 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 computers and then it works 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.739
 right on the computer further than that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.329
 The tablet will be answered shortly 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.789
 says I am an external memory 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.210
 connected and everything else 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.590
 We can see that on the notebook now 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.969
 I have mine on the left side 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.100
 library you can already see a few 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.239
 Pictures of me and on the right side 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.600
 I have the workplace again 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.239
 opened for the galaxy tab reports 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.760
 up device as a portable to the can I 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.189
 then click on it all opens up 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.470
 the internal memory and lo and behold it 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.049
 is quite simply built up they have 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 there folder for music for photos for 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.650
 films already prepared as well as 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.780
 a hard disk or like her 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.530
 computer we simply copy the things 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.090
 in there 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.409
 that means i like theirs now on the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.229
 left side the pictures take all and 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.110
 add the folder pictures on my 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.490
 galaxy tab added so the computer asks 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.220
 In a nutshell, let's just say that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.659
 is yes high resolution pictures so should I 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.060
 which simply copy or should it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.250
 each adapt a mobile device 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.560
 you have a powerful tablet 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.439
 So just copy yourself there 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.210
 No worries the Galaxy Tab can do it all 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.530
 many formats for photos and videos 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.720
 reproduce 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.810
 and yes that's already happened the pictures 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.850
 are already there then I'm missing now 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.159
 So I change my favorite music 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.640
 the pieces of music in the folder music 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.130
 Mark me the same again 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.409
 you and then paste it here at music 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.149
 in addition 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.410
 automatically the Romans are copied and 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.480
 I'll go one step further 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.760
 because 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.459
 with a large display of over 25 cm 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.659
 in HD resolution then I want to 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.159
 every case synonymous with a few videos 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.799
 have and the search engines 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.489
 three movies from ice age madagascar and 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.620
 Starwars 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.980
 namely, and then just add them 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.200
 add to the folder movies here 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.629
 The whole thing will be here again 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.379
 in demand mobile device is starting up 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.290
 do not worry 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.639
 just copy and it works 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.819
 Come on 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:43.650
 that of course bitter for all movies and 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.239
 yes you have almost 16 gigabytes 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.980
 internal memory available 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.409
 if the data is copied over that 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.250
 is of course via usb ruckzuck can 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.730
 we'll get the tablet right back 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.709
 take away 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.180
 we're done that's me 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.980
 just pull the usb-plug here 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.780
 out again and then we look up 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.849
 the tray if everything has arrived and 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.019
 above all things which brilliance so now 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.609
 Let's take a quick look at that 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.519
 tray if all data really 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:07.889
 have arrived and for photos there are 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.700
 the gallery for the videos, there is a 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.200
 video player 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.819
 Of course, they either find that 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.739
 directly on the homescreen or her 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.260
 look like I now briefly in the 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.409
 catalog there is the gallery once 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.989
 select and yes super there are mine 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.599
 Pictures are all there that can be 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.549
 call 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.010
 zoom in there too zoom out great 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.180
 Everything worked and I think 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.799
 here of course also the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.599
 note eight there are a few movies with 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.239
 that's also called war 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.250
 I look at it and lo and behold my films 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.389
 are also on the tablet and so have 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.239
 you now have easy access 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.769
 on the way to great music on her 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.720
 favorite pictures and of course on 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.790
 we have the most beautiful films together 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.290
 just my favorite songs my photos 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.209
 and my videos on the internal 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.750
 store were single 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.310
 folder 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.530
 it all fits them, we have a total of 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.599
 16 gb available 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.370
 the great thing is now but you can do that 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.229
 galaxy tab still expand 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.419
 At the beginning I have one for you 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:06.000
 card reader shown up here and there 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.629
 come these little micro sd cards 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.669
 in 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.579
 You can have a capacity with these 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.709
 use cards of up to 32 gb 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.019
 Let's open the card in your hand 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.940
 the stuck here above the map 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.729
 with the fingernail once to click 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.490
 snaps shut quickly 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.800
 so now the memory is expanding i 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.690
 can still more pictures 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.030
 even more photos and more videos 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.099
 deposit a little tip I have 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.930
 still for you if we use the device via usb 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.580
 connect to the computer 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.289
 then they will realize i can 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.919
 transfer data but it will not 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.440
 loaded 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.379
 that's normal for the tablets 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.810
 the usb port of my computer or 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:47.300
 my notebook does not have enough power 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.840
 on the tablet to load it sensibly 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.159
 to be able to 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.110
 for this reason, the power supply is 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.370
 of course, and they should 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.400
 Stop offering use to the device 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.400
 recharge
