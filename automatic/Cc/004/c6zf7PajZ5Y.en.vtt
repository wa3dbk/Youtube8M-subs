00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.500
 imagine an elephant with warlike airs 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.990
 to the rambo in a video game designed by 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.180
 the very creators of pokemon what 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.310
 true is that we do not either 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.680
 we believed when they did not say it but here 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.260
 it is and in addition it is going to become one 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.059
 of the summer games game freak it 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.339
 put aside for a moment of nintendo for 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.860
 design next to sega an action title 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.750
 that overflows quality and that has also 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.329
 funny like few lately 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.699
 old school gameplay with 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.979
 advance in horizontal scroll but also 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.110
 many features that make it 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:55.570
 in a release according to the latest 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.570
 times we tell you in this video 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.580
 one of the things that we liked the most 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.890
 of legs elephant tembo is that it is a 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.320
 video game to play without 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.240
 there is a brief tutorial but with very few 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.030
 things that learn to ram the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.740
 enemies to finish them jump and 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.540
 float in the air in a way that 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.910
 sure it sounds like something and then 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.860
 water with fire hazards 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.650
 that we are finding there are more things 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.050
 how to throw ourselves in the form of a ball 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.090
 even bounce on the ground or even 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.100
 plummet but these are the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.320
 basic actions and do not require 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.020
 many buttons this is the good thing because 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.300
 it's simple, easy to understand but 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.000
 that at the same time is powerful 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.710
 thanks to a great level design that 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.710
 It is the best of the set 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.289
 the video game is structured 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.630
 in phases following the tradition of two 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.880
 scroll horizontal ers and what is 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.460
 our task for sure that you have already 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.229
 could intuit the progress ending with 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.690
 everything that we find in our 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.430
 step we will have enemies to beat 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.769
 but also various challenges 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.569
 platforms that rely on the use of 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.940
 various elements that were variety to the 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.010
 This we liked a lot but 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.530
 even more the fact that it is a 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.989
 game very very rejugable and with a 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.120
 quite high difficulty if you see here 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.430
 we must get a certain amount of 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.890
 points to access the next part 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.739
 and we assure you that it is not easy 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.870
 Another aspect that we liked is that 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.329
 in each level there is a certain number of 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.310
 characters to rescue and look at the 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.290
 detail because they are going up to our 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.569
 To the ombÃº it is also important to go 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.640
 killing the enemies since this 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.650
 gives us points to access new 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.930
 levels and finally we can not 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.150
 forget about the peanuts when 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.030
 we collect enough we will get 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.980
 a life and do not take it as a joke because it 's 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.420
 a complicated game to overcome 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.610
 we have checkpoint 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.340
 throughout each phase but life is 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.349
 Exhausts almost without realizing besides 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.780
 that there are final heads as a culmination to 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.780
 each world which must be said that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.670
 we have found the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.709
 game is completed with a table of 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.319
 online rankings although the truth 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.660
 is that in this sense maybe we have 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.000
 missed the presence of challenges or 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.700
 some additional mode the game is 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.769
 short we can not pass it in a couple of 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.269
 evenings, but we still emphasize that 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.640
 it's about such an experience 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.620
 satisfactory and re playable that no 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.590
 we should take this as an aspect 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.019
 totally negative the video game is 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.989
 superbly designed and the finish is 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.510
 really sensational in particular what 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.670
 What we liked best in 3d games is the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.860
 humor that overflows with a story that 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.620
 As you can see, it can be summarized 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.590
 very easily world in distress colonel 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.660
 that calls an elephant and elephant that 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.200
 he puts on his war uniform to go to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.200
 rescue 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.920
 to the sympathy of the video game contributes 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.709
 decisively the section 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.709
 artistic we have a design 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.930
 2d that puts special effort in the 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.539
 cartoon appearance very animations 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.060
 worked and a truly finished 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.650
 lovely the colorful and variety of 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.110
 each level is something that we liked 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.600
 especially with phases that place us 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.970
 in very different locations and 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.789
 then we have the music that contributes 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.389
 to give this certain warlike comic tone to 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.389
 videogame 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.360
 as you see if you listen to everything works in 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:46.419
 conjunction to generate an authentic 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.460
 audiovisual show and if we do not have 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.529
 afraid to mention it of show 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.699
 because we have had a great time 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:53.699
 watching it and listening to it 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.750
 to me if they had told me a few years ago 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.819
 that the company that takes care of 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.130
 pokemon was going to go into a 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:10.530
 development like this tempo 's 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.110
 elephant robes the truth is that I 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.300
 I would have been surprised but I'm glad it's a 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.699
 great videogame a scroll air with airs 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.340
 of recreational with a direct action a 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.620
 undeniable charm a lot of humor and a 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.080
 duration that good is not the best and 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.539
 it suffers from lack of additional modes 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.229
 but still it is very highly recommended 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.810
 arrives for playstation 4 xbox one ipc a 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.360
 a price of 13 euros and in 3djuegos 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.159
 we have given a rating of 8.5 a 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.080
 score that in the journal is 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.900
 corresponds to the denomination of 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.210
 excellent so in the absence of knowing 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.460
 what will be the summer song already 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.599
 we know at least what your animal will be 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.599
 elephant
