00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.259
 Now it can not be rough on the last Friday but probably not 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:18.820
 towards one still in the job 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.400
 even the boss of job center team work Hamburg Thomas Bösenberg looked 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 on northern Germany's largest job fair over 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.619
 more than 90 exhibitors offered nearly 5000 visitors all about the subject 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.960
 Work and Klopp 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.990
 Bitkom from Kiel 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.880

 Training facility served by the port South available 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.140

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.140
 Temporary work agencies holder 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.510
 Alsonso satisfied 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.510
 just so far quite good 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.760
 very interesting his friend knows about this information 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 Many of the temporary employment agencies have many more education centers over the years 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160
 It is very interesting dynamic mask of the face 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.120
 but in the new year he has found himself in the competition and wants 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.120
 Percent complete also informed about further education 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.460
 Although informative Xanten RP the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.010
 the NADA would have confirmed this 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.950
 Hall 1 to find 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.220

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.270
 some even queued up for that 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.620
 and actually at the fair but it's in addition to continuing education and information 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.450

 that skilled workers are desperately sought but also at the job fair in the 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.290

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.200
 the issues from now on whether something can do for them or not in the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.870
 In most cases, or one hundred percent if you can guarantee work 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:18.099
 because even directly from the employers adapt so that with no diversity 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.119
 They are the employers also directly meet 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.859
