me a hundred so now i need to ask the
questions<00:00:35.730> what<00:00:36.059> two<00:00:36.420> numbers<00:00:37.610> but<00:00:38.610> two

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
questions what two numbers but two

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.410 
questions what two numbers but two
numbers<00:00:39.000> when<00:00:39.870> i<00:00:39.899> multiply<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.829> together

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
numbers when i multiply them together

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.250 
numbers when i multiply them together
equal<00:00:42.420> 100<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:43.829> i<00:00:43.860> add<00:00:44.190> them<00:00:44.760> together

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
equal 100 and when i add them together

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.770 
equal 100 and when i add them together
wind<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.469> giving<00:00:46.649> me<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.980> negative<00:00:47.219> 20<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.539> fact

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
wind up giving me a negative 20 the fact

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.200 
wind up giving me a negative 20 the fact
that<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.260> product<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.190> positive<00:00:50.460> tells<00:00:51.059> me

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that the product is positive tells me

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.729 
that the product is positive tells me
the<00:00:51.390> signs<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.899> two<00:00:52.110> numbers<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.590> be

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the signs of the two numbers have to be

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
the signs of the two numbers have to be
the<00:00:52.949> same<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.850> fact<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> sum<00:00:54.629> is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the same the fact that the sum is

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.360 
the same the fact that the sum is
negative<00:00:54.840> tells<00:00:55.530> me<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> two<00:00:56.190> numbers

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
negative tells me that the two numbers

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.270 
negative tells me that the two numbers
have<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.270> both<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.510> negative<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> start

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
have to both be negative so I start

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.880 
have to both be negative so I start
going<00:00:59.460> down<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.940> road<00:01:00.079> let's<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.620> could

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
going down the road let's see I could

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.730 
going down the road let's see I could
start<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.539> negative<00:01:03.539> 100<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> negative<00:01:05.309> 1

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
start with negative 100 and negative 1

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.560 
start with negative 100 and negative 1
I<00:01:06.799> have<00:01:07.430> those<00:01:07.610> two<00:01:07.850> doesn't<00:01:08.420> give<00:01:08.509> me

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
I have those two doesn't give me

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.219 
I have those two doesn't give me
negative<00:01:08.689> 20<00:01:09.259> how<00:01:09.979> about<00:01:10.399> negative<00:01:11.210> 50<00:01:11.930> and

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
negative 20 how about negative 50 and

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.950 
negative 20 how about negative 50 and
negative<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.790> doesn't<00:01:14.750> work<00:01:14.960> how<00:01:15.950> about

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
negative to that doesn't work how about

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.840 
negative to that doesn't work how about
negative<00:01:17.960> 25<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.990> negative<00:01:20.990> up<00:01:21.740> 25<00:01:22.399> is<00:01:22.759> too

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
negative 25 and negative up 25 is too

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.770 
negative 25 and negative up 25 is too
low<00:01:23.000> for<00:01:23.119> it<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.570> negative<00:01:24.229> 40<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:26.390> doesn't

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
low for it and negative 40 that doesn't

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.169 
low for it and negative 40 that doesn't
work<00:01:26.960> how<00:01:27.710> about<00:01:28.100> negative<00:01:28.850> 20<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:31.179> negative

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
work how about negative 20 and negative

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.300 
work how about negative 20 and negative
5<00:01:33.130> we're<00:01:34.130> not<00:01:34.310> there<00:01:34.549> yet<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.860> makes<00:01:37.130> a

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
5 we're not there yet that makes a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.270 
5 we're not there yet that makes a
negative<00:01:37.670> 25<00:01:38.119> that's<00:01:38.750> negative<00:01:39.229> 29<00:01:39.590> that's

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
negative 25 that's negative 29 that's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.870 
negative 25 that's negative 29 that's
negative<00:01:40.640> 52<00:01:41.000> that's<00:01:41.659> naked<00:01:41.840> 101<00:01:42.530> let's<00:01:43.340> see<00:01:43.610> I

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
negative 52 that's naked 101 let's see I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.529 
negative 52 that's naked 101 let's see I
can<00:01:44.869> go<00:01:45.140> um<00:01:47.440> negative<00:01:48.440> 10<00:01:49.069> and<00:01:49.340> negative<00:01:49.970> 10

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
can go um negative 10 and negative 10

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.160 
can go um negative 10 and negative 10
and<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:51.080> fits<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.649> bill<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:53.330> fits<00:01:53.929> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
and that fits the bill that fits the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.080 
and that fits the bill that fits the
bill<00:01:54.319> I<00:01:54.649> add<00:01:55.069> those<00:01:55.399> two<00:01:55.549> together<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.940> get

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
bill I add those two together you get

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.179 
bill I add those two together you get
negative<00:01:56.209> 20<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.229> if<00:01:57.319> i<00:01:57.380> multiply<00:01:57.860> them<00:01:57.979> i<00:01:58.069> get

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
negative 20 and if i multiply them i get

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.460 
negative 20 and if i multiply them i get
a+<00:01:58.429> 100<00:01:58.819> so<00:01:59.330> we<00:01:59.479> are<00:01:59.600> going<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.899> break<00:02:00.200> that

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
a+ 100 so we are going to break that

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.309 
a+ 100 so we are going to break that
negative<00:02:01.310> 20x<00:02:01.580> up<00:02:01.909> into<00:02:02.179> two<00:02:02.360> negative<00:02:02.750> 10<00:02:02.959> so

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
negative 20x up into two negative 10 so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.359 
negative 20x up into two negative 10 so
I<00:02:03.350> go<00:02:03.590> 25<00:02:04.220> x<00:02:05.149> squared<00:02:05.750> minus<00:02:06.709> 10x<00:02:07.420> minus<00:02:08.420> 10x

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
I go 25 x squared minus 10x minus 10x

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.009 
I go 25 x squared minus 10x minus 10x
plus<00:02:10.369> 4<00:02:10.820> equals<00:02:11.120> zero<00:02:12.049> I<00:02:12.290> now<00:02:12.799> group<00:02:13.160> them<00:02:13.660> 25<00:02:14.660> x

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
plus 4 equals zero I now group them 25 x

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.990 
plus 4 equals zero I now group them 25 x
squared<00:02:15.650> minus<00:02:16.400> 10x

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.950 

plus<00:02:20.110> negative<00:02:21.110> 10x<00:02:21.880> plus<00:02:22.880> 4<00:02:23.360> equals<00:02:24.100> zero<00:02:25.960> do

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
plus negative 10x plus 4 equals zero do

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.710 
plus negative 10x plus 4 equals zero do
the<00:02:27.110> factoring<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.670> biggest<00:02:28.850> factor<00:02:29.450> and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
the factoring so the biggest factor and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.780 
the factoring so the biggest factor and
the<00:02:29.870> first<00:02:30.140> two<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> first<00:02:31.280> group<00:02:31.580> is

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
the first two in the first group is

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.400 
the first two in the first group is
going<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.570> 5<00:02:32.810> X<00:02:33.190> which<00:02:34.190> leaves<00:02:34.520> me<00:02:34.670> with<00:02:35.410> 5x

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
going to be 5 X which leaves me with 5x

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.600 
going to be 5 X which leaves me with 5x
minus<00:02:36.940> 2<00:02:38.530> we<00:02:39.530> know<00:02:39.710> this<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.100> going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.460> to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
minus 2 we know this is going to have to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:48.699 
minus 2 we know this is going to have to
be<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.990> 5<00:02:41.990> X<00:02:42.350> minus<00:02:43.070> 2<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.350> going<00:02:48.650> to

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
be a 5 X minus 2 so this is going to

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.750 
be a 5 X minus 2 so this is going to
have<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.160> be<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> negative<00:02:49.580> 2<00:02:50.709> equals<00:02:51.709> 0<00:02:51.770> which

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
have to be a negative 2 equals 0 which

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.720 
have to be a negative 2 equals 0 which
winds<00:02:53.270> up<00:02:53.420> with<00:02:53.920> 5x<00:02:54.920> minus<00:02:55.220> 2<00:02:56.200> times<00:02:57.200> 5x<00:02:57.830> minus

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
winds up with 5x minus 2 times 5x minus

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.320 
winds up with 5x minus 2 times 5x minus
2<00:02:59.270> equals<00:02:59.570> 0<00:03:00.380> well<00:03:01.220> these<00:03:01.489> are<00:03:01.700> both<00:03:01.910> exactly

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
2 equals 0 well these are both exactly

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.210 
2 equals 0 well these are both exactly
the<00:03:02.570> same<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:03.440> have<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.620> solve<00:03:03.920> for<00:03:04.100> one

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
the same so I just have to solve for one

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.100 
the same so I just have to solve for one
so<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.390> 5x<00:03:05.930> minus<00:03:06.410> 2<00:03:06.980> equals<00:03:07.220> 0<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:08.110> simply

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
so I have 5x minus 2 equals 0 I simply

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.850 
so I have 5x minus 2 equals 0 I simply
add<00:03:09.290> 2<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:10.670> both<00:03:10.700> sides<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.390> equation<00:03:11.860> so

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
add 2 to both sides of the equation so

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.030 
add 2 to both sides of the equation so
now<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.070> have<00:03:13.130> 5x<00:03:13.790> equals<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.870> divide<00:03:15.830> both

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
now I have 5x equals to divide both

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.310 
now I have 5x equals to divide both
sides<00:03:16.100> by<00:03:16.489> 5<00:03:16.850> both<00:03:17.750> sides<00:03:18.020> of<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.260> equation

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
sides by 5 both sides of the equation

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.620 
sides by 5 both sides of the equation
that<00:03:18.709> is<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:19.100> wind<00:03:19.820> up<00:03:19.910> with<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.150> answer<00:03:20.450> being

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
that is I wind up with the answer being

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.039 
that is I wind up with the answer being
X<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.170> equal<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.800> two<00:03:22.190> fifths<00:03:23.060> that's<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
X is equal to two fifths that's the

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.560 
X is equal to two fifths that's the
answer<00:03:24.200> for<00:03:24.530> that
