00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.570
 I'm going to take it out I'm going to add the apazote 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.020
 where the plant has already taken all the 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.120
 Water 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.480
 I return to make a shot so that 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.040
 you see the change it gives to the plant 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.040
 be and be with you bye 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.970
 Well it's been about two and a half hours 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.490
 more or less and I'm back 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.820
 I have let the leaves grow 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.460
 I knew a lot about water 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.430
 I gave him enough water more or less 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.520
 about 500 milliliters around so that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.410
 all the earth take and lasts for two or 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.460
 three days 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.700
 because here on the balcony is doing 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.950
 a lot of sun and then imagine that 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.000
 water evaporates fast and good and 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.000
 you are looking there 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.069
 beck 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.129

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.829

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.420
 Steps 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.370
 but the koljós when I was doing 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:51.519
