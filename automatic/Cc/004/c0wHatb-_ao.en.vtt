00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
was a pretty neat situation I then I'd

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.670 
was a pretty neat situation I then I'd
never<00:03:31.180> been<00:03:31.300> in<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.480> before<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:31.990> it<00:03:32.080> was<00:03:32.140> it<00:03:32.560> was

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
never been in it before so it was it was

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.910 
never been in it before so it was it was
a<00:03:32.709> nice<00:03:32.860> to<00:03:33.070> do<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:34.750> also<00:03:35.260> nice<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.530> get<00:03:35.800> it

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
a nice to do that is also nice to get it

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.160 
a nice to do that is also nice to get it
out<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.220> way<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.430> know<00:03:36.640> there's<00:03:36.790> been

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
out of the way you know there's been

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.750 
out of the way you know there's been
questions<00:03:38.170> about<00:03:38.350> what<00:03:39.340> I'm<00:03:39.459> going<00:03:39.550> to<00:03:39.610> do

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.380 
last year with 10 races to go i think
they<00:03:45.130> started<00:03:45.520> or<00:03:45.610> maybe<00:03:45.760> sooner<00:03:46.090> than<00:03:46.209> that

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390

they started or maybe sooner than that
meal<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:47.160> now<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.220> have<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.550> out<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.820> way

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
meal and now to have that out of the way

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.840 
meal and now to have that out of the way
i<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.320> feel<00:03:50.440> like<00:03:50.470> i<00:03:50.680> can<00:03:50.830> focus<00:03:50.980> on<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.790> a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
i just feel like i can focus on the on a

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.000 
i just feel like i can focus on the on a
budweiser<00:03:52.330> forward<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.440> rest<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:53.739> year

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
budweiser forward and the rest this year

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.430 
budweiser forward and the rest this year
and<00:03:54.220> give<00:03:54.640> them<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.850> hundred<00:03:55.690> percent<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.320> try

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
and give them a hundred percent and try

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.860 
and give them a hundred percent and try
to<00:03:56.500> win<00:03:56.650> races<00:03:57.040> there<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:58.450> they<00:03:58.570> can<00:03:58.720> also

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
to win races there and and they can also

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.570 
to win races there and and they can also
work<00:03:59.110> on<00:03:59.290> their<00:03:59.770> future<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:00.280> know<00:04:00.370> they<00:04:00.489> don't

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
work on their future you know they don't

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.210 
work on their future you know they don't
know<00:04:00.700> they<00:04:01.030> know<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:02.680> seats<00:04:02.980> going<00:04:03.160> to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
know they know that that seats going to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.590 
know they know that that seats going to
be<00:04:03.310> open<00:04:03.550> so<00:04:03.730> they<00:04:03.850> can<00:04:03.880> work<00:04:04.090> on<00:04:04.270> what<00:04:04.450> they're

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
be open so they can work on what they're

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.030 
be open so they can work on what they're
going<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.780> do<00:04:04.959> with<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.200> too<00:04:05.410> so<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:05.680> think<00:04:05.739> I

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
going to do with that too so I think I

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.060 
going to do with that too so I think I
kind<00:04:06.459> of<00:04:06.520> needed<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.850> do<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.180> when<00:04:07.330> we<00:04:07.360> do

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
kind of needed to do it when we do

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.410 
kind of needed to do it when we do
obviously<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.520> can<00:04:09.700> make<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.850> pretty<00:04:10.090> strong

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
obviously you can make a pretty strong

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.740 
obviously you can make a pretty strong
case<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.989> no<00:04:11.170> matter<00:04:11.320> who<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:11.680> compare

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
case that no matter who you compare

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.120 
case that no matter who you compare

instability play in your decision well I

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.460 
instability play in your decision well I
mean<00:04:37.120> I've<00:04:37.270> learned<00:04:37.479> a<00:04:37.540> lot<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:38.139> know<00:04:38.260> over

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
mean I've learned a lot you know over

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.680 
mean I've learned a lot you know over
the<00:04:38.560> last<00:04:38.590> few<00:04:39.400> years<00:04:39.460> with<00:04:40.389> a<00:04:40.419> lot<00:04:40.660> of

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
the last few years with a lot of

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.659 
the last few years with a lot of
instability<00:04:41.110> there<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.740> I've<00:04:42.280> felt<00:04:42.610> like

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
instability there and I've felt like

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:43.969 
instability there and I've felt like
I've<00:04:42.880> learned<00:04:43.030> a<00:04:43.180> lot<00:04:43.300> so<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.540> think<00:04:43.600> it's<00:04:43.810> uh

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
I've learned a lot so I think it's uh

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.370 
I've learned a lot so I think it's uh
you<00:04:44.979> know<00:04:45.100> sometimes<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:46.150> may<00:04:46.270> not<00:04:46.389> be<00:04:46.449> you<00:04:47.260> may

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
you know sometimes it may not be you may

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.110 
you know sometimes it may not be you may
not<00:04:47.530> be<00:04:47.680> in<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.860> exact<00:04:48.160> situation<00:04:48.760> you<00:04:48.880> want

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
not be in the exact situation you want

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.570 
not be in the exact situation you want
but<00:04:49.449> you<00:04:49.990> know<00:04:50.080> if<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.440> if<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.800> focus<00:04:51.370> hard

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
but you know if you if you focus hard

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.030 
but you know if you if you focus hard
and<00:04:51.760> work<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.260> try<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.320> learn<00:04:53.500> from<00:04:53.770> it<00:04:53.919> then

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
and work and try to learn from it then

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.860 
and work and try to learn from it then
it's<00:04:54.190> it's<00:04:54.610> not<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.790> bad<00:04:55.030> thing<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.479> you<00:04:55.840> know

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
it's it's not a bad thing and you know

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.969 
it's it's not a bad thing and you know
