00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
don't know about these they obviously

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.590 
don't know about these they obviously
redesign<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.430> general<00:00:56.910> structure<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.510> the

redesign the general structure of the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660 
redesign the general structure of the
shoe<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.050> don't<00:00:58.559> particularly<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.309> look

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
shoe I don't particularly like the look

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
shoe I don't particularly like the look
of<00:00:59.760> them<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:00.660> perform<00:01:00.930> well<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.739> don't

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
of them but if they perform well I don't

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:02.779 
of them but if they perform well I don't
really<00:01:02.280> care

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
really care

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.820 
really care
now<00:01:03.059> let's<00:01:03.329> touch<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.780> some<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> technique

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
now let's touch on some of the technique

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.940 
now let's touch on some of the technique
used<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:06.090> particular<00:01:06.630> model<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.470> upper

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
used on this particular model the upper

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.550 
used on this particular model the upper
is<00:01:08.159> basically<00:01:08.729> hyper<00:01:09.090> fused<00:01:09.540> nothing<00:01:10.409> that's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
is basically hyper fused nothing that's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.109 
is basically hyper fused nothing that's
gonna<00:01:10.650> change<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.220> life<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.850> solid

that's nothing new

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.890 
that's nothing new

I'm sure most people have played in hype
reviews<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.619> point<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.490> upper<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.939> also

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270

one piece but even just lacing them up I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.999 
one piece but even just lacing them up I
noticed<00:01:21.930> there's<00:01:22.110> gonna<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.350> some<00:01:22.560> dead<00:01:22.830> space

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
noticed there's gonna be some dead space

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
noticed there's gonna be some dead space
which<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:24.299> some<00:01:24.990> things<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.380> do

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
which I do not like some things I do

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.100 
which I do not like some things I do
like<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.700> they're<00:01:26.909> lightweight<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
like are that they're lightweight and it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
like are that they're lightweight and it
seems<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.770> support<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.520> gonna<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.909> good

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
seems like support is gonna be good

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.050 
seems like support is gonna be good
there's<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.930> foam<00:01:31.259> collar<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.070> an<00:01:32.490> internal

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
there's this foam collar and an internal

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.450 
there's this foam collar and an internal
bootie<00:01:33.479> mix<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> dynamic<00:01:35.220> fly

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
bootie mix that with the dynamic fly

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.060 
bootie mix that with the dynamic fly
wire<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.060> some<00:01:36.210> lockdown<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.500> midsole

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
wire for some lockdown and this midsole

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.399 
wire for some lockdown and this midsole
which<00:01:38.340> wraps<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.299> heel<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.049> see<00:01:40.229> I

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
which wraps up the heel as you can see I

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
which wraps up the heel as you can see I
think<00:01:40.950> these<00:01:41.070> will<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.610> covered<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
think these will have you covered in the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.179 
think these will have you covered in the
support<00:01:42.600> department<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.229> although<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.770> don't

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
support department and although I don't

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.370 
support department and although I don't
like<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> way<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> heel<00:01:45.149> looks<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.810> think<00:01:46.290> it's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
like the way the heel looks I think it's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.600 
like the way the heel looks I think it's
going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> beast<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.280> court

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
going to be a beast on the court

going to be a beast on the court

cushioning wise there is zoom in the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.940 
cushioning wise there is zoom in the
heel<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.820> forefoot<00:01:51.240> which<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.840> nice<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.409> not

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
heel and forefoot which is nice it's not

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
heel and forefoot which is nice it's not
super<00:01:53.369> chunky<00:01:53.640> cushioning<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.750> there<00:01:54.960> should

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
super chunky cushioning so there should

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.289 
super chunky cushioning so there should
be<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.500> good<00:01:55.799> court<00:01:56.159> deal<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:56.759> which<00:01:57.270> is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
be a good court deal as well which is

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.060 
be a good court deal as well which is
definitely<00:01:57.659> important<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.560> then<00:01:58.829> there's

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
definitely important and then there's

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
definitely important and then there's
this<00:01:59.250> solid<00:01:59.790> rubber<00:02:00.060> outsole<00:02:00.689> with

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
this solid rubber outsole with

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.530 
this solid rubber outsole with
herringbone<00:02:01.619> traction<00:02:02.399> pretty<00:02:03.000> standard

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
herringbone traction pretty standard

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.420 
herringbone traction pretty standard
stuff<00:02:03.659> really<00:02:04.170> overall<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.979> think

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
stuff really overall I think

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.220 
stuff really overall I think
this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.000> good<00:02:06.330> shoe<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.870> court

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
this is going to be a good shoe on court

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.130 
this is going to be a good shoe on court
