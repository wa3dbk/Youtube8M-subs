00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180 

one<00:00:00.810> of<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:00.989> best<00:00:01.199> ways<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.530> figure<00:00:02.040> how

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
one of the best ways to figure how

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.889 
one of the best ways to figure how
something<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.639> constructed<00:00:03.330> let's<00:00:03.720> put

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
something is constructed let's put

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.680 
something is constructed let's put
together<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:05.310> take<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.580> apart<00:00:05.910> so<00:00:06.660> I

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
together is to take it apart so I

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.259 
together is to take it apart so I
thought<00:00:06.810> it'd<00:00:06.960> be<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.049> good<00:00:07.200> idea<00:00:07.259> to

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
thought it'd be a good idea to

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.879 
thought it'd be a good idea to
deconstruct<00:00:09.269> Mopsy<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.260> hopes<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.679> you

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
deconstruct Mopsy in hopes that you

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.080 
deconstruct Mopsy in hopes that you
might<00:00:10.920> get<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> better<00:00:11.400> idea<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.849> how

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
might get a better idea of how

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.620 
might get a better idea of how
everything<00:00:12.570> comes<00:00:12.960> together<00:00:13.230> for<00:00:14.630> starters

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
everything comes together for starters

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.210 
everything comes together for starters
the<00:00:15.929> Arduino<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> right<00:00:16.859> hand<00:00:17.039> side

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the Arduino here on the right hand side

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.070 
the Arduino here on the right hand side
I've<00:00:17.820> got<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> outside<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:18.990> have

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
I've got it on the outside so you have

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.710 
I've got it on the outside so you have
better<00:00:19.230> access<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.949> pins<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.600> also<00:00:21.600> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
better access to the pins and also the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.660 
better access to the pins and also the
programming<00:00:22.260> cable<00:00:22.439> which<00:00:23.010> will<00:00:23.039> unplug<00:00:23.640> and

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
programming cable which will unplug and

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.620 
programming cable which will unplug and
something<00:00:26.670> I've<00:00:26.760> done<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.240> reduce<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
something I've done here to reduce the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.099 
something I've done here to reduce the
number<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.900> wires<00:00:28.380> coming<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.670> robot

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
number of wires coming out of the robot

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.420 
number of wires coming out of the robot
what<00:00:31.109> I've<00:00:31.230> done<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.529> I've<00:00:31.769> combined<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
what I've done is I've combined the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.330 
what I've done is I've combined the
power<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> ground<00:00:33.500> in<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.710> block<00:00:34.770> here

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
power and the ground in this block here

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.490 
power and the ground in this block here
in<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> back<00:00:35.870> this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> where<00:00:37.140> I've<00:00:37.230> connected

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
in the back this is where I've connected

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.940 
in the back this is where I've connected
both<00:00:37.980> servos<00:00:38.489> plus<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> neopixel<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.950> again

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
both servos plus the neopixel and again

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.920 
both servos plus the neopixel and again
combine<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.700> power<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.390> ground<00:00:42.629> into<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
combine the power and the ground into a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.770 
combine the power and the ground into a
single<00:00:43.410> wire<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.969> then<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> them<00:00:45.510> come

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
single wire and then all of them come

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
single wire and then all of them come
down<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> Arduino<00:00:46.559> pins<00:00:47.100> eight<00:00:47.309> nine<00:00:47.489> ten

is an item that's typically featured in
scrapbooking<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.580> holds<00:01:14.880> pages<00:01:15.210> together<00:01:15.390> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
scrapbooking it holds pages together and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.130 
scrapbooking it holds pages together and
they<00:01:16.710> are<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:17.130> out<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> soft<00:01:17.729> aluminum<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.689> do

they are me out of soft aluminum so do

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.510 
they are me out of soft aluminum so do
you<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.439> careful<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.979> might<00:01:20.130> chip<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you be careful you might chip the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
you be careful you might chip the
corners<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.150> little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.110> too

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
corners a little bit if you get too

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.890 
corners a little bit if you get too
forceful<00:01:22.970> but<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.180> case<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
forceful but in this case it's just a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.719 
forceful but in this case it's just a
friction<00:01:25.290> fit<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.830> as<00:01:25.920> soon<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.250> start<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
friction fit so as soon as you start to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.980 
friction fit so as soon as you start to
unscrew<00:01:27.119> them<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.689> come<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:27.960> pretty

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
unscrew them they they come out pretty

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.240 
unscrew them they they come out pretty
easily<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:31.280> also<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.820> arm<00:01:33.030> which<00:01:33.570> reveals

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
easily and also the arm which reveals

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.910 
easily and also the arm which reveals
the<00:01:35.250> screw<00:01:35.610> underneath<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.600> mount

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
the screw underneath on that mount

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.080 
the screw underneath on that mount
connects<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.130> through<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> servo

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
connects in through to the servo

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.170 
connects in through to the servo
underneath<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.579> something<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.700> mention<00:01:42.000> here

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
underneath and something to mention here

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.910 
underneath and something to mention here
I've<00:01:42.270> actually<00:01:42.450> used<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.049> longest<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I've actually used the longest of the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.889 
I've actually used the longest of the
two<00:01:44.159> screws<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.670> are<00:01:45.149> included<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
two screws that are included with the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.590 
two screws that are included with the
servo<00:01:46.259> horns<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
servo horns this is just to do to the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.660 
servo horns this is just to do to the
thickness<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.409> actually<00:01:50.130> makes<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
thickness here it actually makes for a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.969 
thickness here it actually makes for a
much<00:01:50.820> better<00:01:51.090> more<00:01:51.630> solid<00:01:51.990> connection<00:01:52.439> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
much better more solid connection you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.620 
much better more solid connection you
can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> longer<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.090> two

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
can see here it's the longer of the two

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.060 
can see here it's the longer of the two
screws<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:57.259> we'll<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> same<00:01:58.649> thing<00:01:58.890> on
