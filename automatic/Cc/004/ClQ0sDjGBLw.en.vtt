00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.220
 good day boys and greetings to all 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.980
 this time I want to share 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.380
 this skinner that was made to order for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.600
 a fellow of the forum and his 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.840
 characteristics what are the tree 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.050
 total of the piece are 20 centimeters to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.289
 the leaf in its important part are 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:28.710
 approximately 8 points 7 centimeters 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.949
 the height is 3 centimeters and a half 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.980
 approximately is made of steel 440 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.500
 ce of 5 32 thick and how can we 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.150
 see because it has a hook on the spine to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.730
 open animals the scales are in wood 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.130
 of tanks will be cured with oil 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.350
 linseed 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.560
 the rivets they carry are pins of 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.140
 mosaic that I myself made these pins 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.650
 I have not shown them but I like them a lot 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.560
 put them to the hunting knives 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.840
 they are the morning of traces of animals 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.290
 today we are all going to see and have your 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.730
 hole for the belt not in this case 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.520
 It is a gift that I am going to 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.420
 make this partner who did me the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.360
 please buy it 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.960
 the case is in the first drumstick 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.740
 quality also made 100% by hand for its 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.430
 server 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 is inside held out 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.120
 also forgiveness is illustrated with fat 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.730
 for skin 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.230
 you turn 100% by hand and well as 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.790
 we can see has a job of 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.590
 chiselled that is petatillo 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.150
 and we're going to give a little bit of a review 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.150
 Closer to the piece 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.229
 there we are pins that I mention are 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 like bear tracks at least is what 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.960
 I pretend to do there is the wood of 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.960
 complicity that is the other pin 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.420
 and then there is the sheet 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.870
 we do not make the case sorry 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.890
 there is 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.940
 let's see the wood on the other side 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.060
 of the use of the studs this 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:52.940
 way is the same as you use to 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.160
 point in days past of lime with ham 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.440
 I do not know if you remember it is a beta 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.970
 also very nice and for the here 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.970
 put the east to this knife 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.470
 make an approach again for 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.470
 can see a little more than that 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.280
 my mom really 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.090
 Now let's see how 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.340
 it feels normal 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.470
 because 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.470
 here is about has 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.720
 some cuts on the back 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.310
 to improve a bit what has been the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.080
 thumb grip to this part and 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.720
 these knives because sometimes it 's very 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.530
 practical to take them this way when 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.560
 We're really going to combine some animal 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.690
 that we have acquired in some task of 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.209
 house a person I like to take them from 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.220
 this way with the index finger towards 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.810
 what has been the leaf the doctor in 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.970
 the back to move it from 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.050
 this way and remove the skin of what 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.050
 the meat of the animal has been 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.440
 yes he was boys 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.440
 and this new width 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.850
 here I leave the piece as always my 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.430
 intention is to share that they know a 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.080
 A little bit more of my work I hope 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.080
 have liked and thanks for looking
