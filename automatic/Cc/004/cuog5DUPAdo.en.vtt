Keith<00:03:05.700> at<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.849> bird<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.840> state<00:03:08.079> of

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
Keith at the bird is in a state of

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.210 
Keith at the bird is in a state of
decomposition<00:03:10.530> we'll<00:03:11.530> need<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.799> look<00:03:11.920> at<00:03:12.069> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
decomposition we'll need to look at the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.890 
decomposition we'll need to look at the
dark<00:03:12.700> intestines<00:03:13.359> because<00:03:13.569> there's

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
dark intestines because there's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.509 
dark intestines because there's
something<00:03:14.109> probably<00:03:14.620> being<00:03:14.980> causing

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
something probably being causing

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.720 
something probably being causing
bleeding<00:03:16.409> there<00:03:17.409> but<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:17.799> not<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.099> typical

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.520 

gangrenous<00:03:21.730> necrotic<00:03:22.359> in<00:03:22.599> Titus<00:03:23.049> that<00:03:23.170> we<00:03:23.349> see

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
gangrenous necrotic in Titus that we see

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.960 
gangrenous necrotic in Titus that we see
that<00:03:23.889> we<00:03:24.269> have<00:03:25.269> been<00:03:25.450> seeing<00:03:26.310> however<00:03:27.310> very

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
that we have been seeing however very

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:44.809 
that we have been seeing however very
dark<00:03:28.269> intestines<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:33.359> going<00:03:34.359> down<00:03:34.569> here

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.739 

it<00:03:45.390> appears<00:03:45.749> that<00:03:45.989> we've<00:03:46.170> got<00:03:46.379> to<00:03:46.560> pay<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:47.749> male

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:48.749 
it appears that we've got to pay a male

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.520 
it appears that we've got to pay a male
bird<00:03:49.049> with<00:03:49.319> very<00:03:49.560> very<00:03:49.739> small<00:03:49.859> testes<00:03:50.549> and

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
it's slightly swollen adrenal glands

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.800 
it's slightly swollen adrenal glands
testes<00:03:55.560> their<00:03:55.889> and<00:03:56.189> their<00:03:56.629> adrenal<00:03:57.629> glands

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.819 
testes their and their adrenal glands
immediately<00:03:58.349> in<00:03:58.439> front<00:03:58.469> of<00:03:58.799> them

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.479 

lots<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.579> urine<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:04.049> rates<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.829> ureter

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
lots of urine you rates in the ureter

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.250 
lots of urine you rates in the ureter
coming<00:04:05.939> down<00:04:06.090> from<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.510> kidneys<00:04:06.840> that's<00:04:07.079> at

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
coming down from the kidneys that's at

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.830 
coming down from the kidneys that's at
white<00:04:07.469> strand<00:04:07.859> there<00:04:11.180> again<00:04:12.180> intestinal

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
white strand there again intestinal

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.970 
white strand there again intestinal
contents<00:04:13.069> very<00:04:14.069> dark

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.570 

and<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:21.440> looks<00:04:21.620> like<00:04:21.800> this<00:04:21.980> bird<00:04:22.220> might<00:04:22.460> have

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and it looks like this bird might have

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.450 
and it looks like this bird might have
been<00:04:22.730> bleeding<00:04:23.090> inside<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:24.160> intestine<00:04:25.160> so

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
been bleeding inside the intestine so

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.980 
been bleeding inside the intestine so
we'll<00:04:25.640> take<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:26.660> smear<00:04:27.020> or<00:04:27.200> two<00:04:27.410> from<00:04:27.590> their

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
we'll take a smear or two from their

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.020 
we'll take a smear or two from their
local<00:04:29.990> region<00:04:30.200> with<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:31.250> mixture<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.730> white

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
local region with a mixture of white

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.300 
local region with a mixture of white
your<00:04:32.360> rates<00:04:32.540> or<00:04:32.720> creamy<00:04:32.990> white<00:04:33.230> rates<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.920> the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
your rates or creamy white rates and the

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.570 
your rates or creamy white rates and the
dark<00:04:34.520> intestinal<00:04:35.060> contents<00:04:35.270> in<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:36.580> that's

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
dark intestinal contents in it that's

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.770 
dark intestinal contents in it that's
inside<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.150> vent<00:04:38.980> okay

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
inside the vent okay

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.780 
inside the vent okay
so<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.810> think<00:04:42.050> we<00:04:42.290> need<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.590> get<00:04:43.400> a<00:04:43.460> couple<00:04:43.760> of

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
so I think we need to get a couple of

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:59.010 
so I think we need to get a couple of
samples<00:04:44.000> of<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:48.970> what's<00:04:49.970> going<00:04:50.240> on<00:04:50.390> there

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:19.750 

we<00:04:59.980> might<00:05:00.280> turn<00:05:00.520> off<00:05:00.610> that<00:05:00.790> tap<00:05:01.030> after<00:05:01.240> that

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.800 

I'll<00:05:20.760> have<00:05:20.910> a<00:05:20.970> look<00:05:21.060> at<00:05:21.180> that<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.480> little<00:05:21.660> bit

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
I'll have a look at that a little bit

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:37.080 
I'll have a look at that a little bit
lighter<00:05:25.040> open<00:05:26.040> this<00:05:26.130> birds<00:05:30.560> use<00:05:31.560> it

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.629 

so<00:05:37.660> that<00:05:37.810> gives<00:05:37.960> it<00:05:38.080> here<00:05:38.650> where<00:05:39.010> is<00:05:39.130> he<00:05:39.250> up<00:05:39.400> the

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
so that gives it here where is he up the

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.190 
so that gives it here where is he up the
previous<00:05:40.030> Birds<00:05:40.270> gizzard<00:05:40.690> was<00:05:40.840> distended

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
previous Birds gizzard was distended

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.580 
previous Birds gizzard was distended
with<00:05:41.410> fiber<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.340> black<00:05:43.120> mass<00:05:43.480> and<00:05:43.780> stuff<00:05:44.050> like

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.170 

like<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:47.620> that<00:05:48.280> came<00:05:48.520> out<00:05:48.700> of<00:05:48.730> it<00:05:48.910> the

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
like that that came out of it the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.240 
like that that came out of it the
previous<00:05:49.930> Birds<00:05:50.169> gives<00:05:50.530> it<00:05:50.620> if<00:05:50.740> you<00:05:50.860> remember

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
previous Birds gives it if you remember

00:05:51.250 --> 00:06:05.820 
previous Birds gives it if you remember
if<00:05:52.210> you<00:05:52.360> saw<00:05:52.600> it<00:06:00.480> this<00:06:01.480> bird's<00:06:01.750> gizzard

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.510 

running<00:06:06.830> up<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:07.160> stomach<00:06:07.730> I<00:06:09.370> presume<00:06:10.370> these

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
running up the stomach I presume these

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.200 
running up the stomach I presume these
two<00:06:10.760> birds<00:06:10.940> are<00:06:11.120> from<00:06:11.300> the<00:06:11.420> same<00:06:11.600> Avery<00:06:13.210> that's

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
two birds are from the same Avery that's

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.580 
two birds are from the same Avery that's
where<00:06:14.420> the<00:06:14.630> bleeding<00:06:15.020> appears<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.500> have

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
where the bleeding appears to have

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.580 
where the bleeding appears to have
occurred<00:06:15.710> in<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.430> gizzard<00:06:16.730> area<00:06:17.200> the<00:06:18.200> stomach

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
occurred in the gizzard area the stomach

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.630 
occurred in the gizzard area the stomach
area<00:06:18.740> here<00:06:20.380> we've<00:06:21.380> got<00:06:21.470> very<00:06:21.740> dark<00:06:21.950> stomach

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
area here we've got very dark stomach

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.490 
area here we've got very dark stomach
contents<00:06:23.350> so<00:06:24.350> I<00:06:24.620> suspect<00:06:24.950> this<00:06:25.460> is<00:06:25.520> where<00:06:25.850> the

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
contents so I suspect this is where the

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.450 
contents so I suspect this is where the
that's<00:06:27.500> been<00:06:27.740> hemorrhaging<00:06:27.980> from<00:06:28.280> the

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
that's been hemorrhaging from the

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
that's been hemorrhaging from the
stomach<00:06:28.880> area<00:06:29.090> I<00:06:29.570> think<00:06:30.940> we'll<00:06:31.940> make<00:06:32.060> a<00:06:32.120> smear

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
stomach area I think we'll make a smear

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.070 
stomach area I think we'll make a smear
that<00:06:32.510> as<00:06:32.990> well

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.600 

and<00:06:40.590> I'll<00:06:40.680> put<00:06:40.830> some<00:06:41.009> of<00:06:41.099> that<00:06:41.220> under<00:06:41.520> the

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
and I'll put some of that under the

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.140 
and I'll put some of that under the
microscope<00:06:43.190> see<00:06:44.190> what<00:06:44.340> we<00:06:44.460> find

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.140 

okay<00:06:49.280> we<00:06:50.280> still<00:06:50.490> don't<00:06:50.669> know<00:06:50.729> the<00:06:50.819> cause<00:06:50.940> of

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
okay we still don't know the cause of

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.460 
okay we still don't know the cause of
death<00:06:51.479> but<00:06:51.690> we're<00:06:51.870> getting<00:06:52.080> some<00:06:52.110> clues<00:06:54.470> all

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
death but we're getting some clues all

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.980 
death but we're getting some clues all
right<00:06:55.650> so<00:06:55.800> this<00:06:56.009> was<00:06:56.220> a<00:06:56.250> fresh<00:06:56.490> carcass<00:06:56.819> I'd<00:06:57.810> be
