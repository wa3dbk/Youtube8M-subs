and<00:01:36.500> then<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.700> difficulty<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.479> game

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
and then the difficulty of the game

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.060 
and then the difficulty of the game
actually<00:01:38.869> gets<00:01:39.229> harder<00:01:39.590> when<00:01:39.799> people<00:01:40.009> are

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070
