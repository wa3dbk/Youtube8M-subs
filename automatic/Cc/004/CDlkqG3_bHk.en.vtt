00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.520
 I welcome dear Sonya and among 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.560
 all other headphones exist and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.000
 top relatively speaking series under 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.309
 title 1a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.800
 So in this series there are also 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.730
 bluetooth on and versions of these headphones 1 a 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.740
 bd 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.570
 today we will look at it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.670
 headset went 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.840
 well what can I say at all they of course 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.990
 not small 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.710
 quite voluminous such dense powerful 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.840
 ear cushions and naturally they repeat 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.109
 classic non- bluetooth look 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.839
 nai version mdr 1st 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.549
 and understandably a matter of turning on one of 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.129
 cups there is an action area for all tags 

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:42.440
 another cup sensory using it 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.609
 can control playback 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.019
 adjust volume rewind 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.079
 tracks but also answer the call 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.449
 Naturally on this one 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.059
 cups where you can manage there 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.059
 a small light bulb is such 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.149
 micro usb slot for charging 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.109
 nothing else but the cup on the stage 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.949
 all modules 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.899
 there is an opening for the microphone and an input 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.060
 cable from the test can all be on cable 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.250
 connect and power button off 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.920
 and a small led which 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.810
 It shows what's going on so 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.429
 same here here you can find a little here 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.490
 hole in which, if necessary 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:23.009
 you can poke something spicy here 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.780
 fit or very thin clip or 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.369
 needle but also let you reset 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.370
 headphones if they behave like that 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.900
 strange is the left cup 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.030
 about the width of the width well, enough I 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.700
 not maximally on the market but nevertheless 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.500
 for most goals this will be with 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 stock so here are these headphones 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.310
 looks in front 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.700
 well and so here they will look with 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.500
 bubu well well respected results so 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.100
 these headphones can work 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.950
 already 30 hours that is more than a day 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.470
 full yes of course 30 hours is 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.540
 maximum value in reality she 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.190
 will be a little less dependent on how you 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.850
 listen to what you listen to in what 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.700
 conditions 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 but so far the indicator is very good 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.119
 about the sound 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.550
 understandable business and stated that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.850
 here and extended range and support 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.600
 all good codecs and all sorts of high cuts 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.920
 you have but nevertheless by real 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.440
 listening to the real picture we 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.020
 we get the following when connecting by 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.690
 bluetooth i heard pretty even 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.360
 sound picture without failures without 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.760
 some such obvious rises without 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.430
 problems that is all well and good 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.860
 there is a normal detail normal 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.989
 panorama normal scene depth then 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.940
 eat i feel like i'm listening quite to myself 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.950
 good headphones on cable 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.260
 really good feeling 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.630
 no problems everything is fine all 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.190
 it's good when I plug in the cable 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.230
 I'm starting to hear this one 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.720
 modern fashionable plug 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.300
 that is, the bottom of us rises up 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.610
 us getting so sharp lying 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.590
 a little too lifts and this 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.320
 the most even and my favorite picture 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.780
 begins to disperse in the direction of fashion 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.390
 I do not know who likes this business therefore 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.390
 plug in and hear what 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.000
 you like i'd rather listen personal 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.459
 them without these extras 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.580
 cords yes that's such an unexpected decision 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.290
 but nevertheless the rest is up to headphones 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.480
 terribly expensive there is something twenty three 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.600
 twenty four thousand rubles all the same 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.730
 quite a lot but they give themselves quite 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.590
 a decent result if you have 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.350
 money if you like sony company 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.780
 look and listen at least and 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.209
 go and just listen in 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.549
 live on your machine on your 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.000
 phone on your player and create 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.650
 some 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.500
 your impression because the thing 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.600
 really worth attention to her all 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.290
 for today everything i say goodbye to you but 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 briefly 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.600
 for soon there will be new reviews by now mac
