00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
side as you can see these grips are a

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.449 
side as you can see these grips are a
little<00:02:21.690> longer<00:02:21.930> than<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.170> stock<00:02:22.500> grips<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.370> we

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
little longer than the stock grips so we

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.710 
little longer than the stock grips so we
had<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.670> loosen<00:02:23.849> up<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.180> throttle<00:02:24.599> housing

and<00:02:25.200> slide<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.890> bar<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> little<00:02:26.340> bit<00:02:26.549> to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and slide it on the bar a little bit to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.390 
and slide it on the bar a little bit to
make<00:02:26.879> enough<00:02:27.150> room<00:02:27.360> for<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.629> new<00:02:27.750> grip<00:02:28.400> to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
make enough room for the new grip to

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.800 
make enough room for the new grip to
show<00:02:29.579> you<00:02:29.640> installing<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.269> grip<00:02:30.450> width<00:02:30.629> grip

we<00:02:43.590> didn't<00:02:43.829> need<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.950> use<00:02:44.220> any<00:02:44.459> grip<00:02:44.730> glue

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
we didn't need to use any grip glue

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970 
we didn't need to use any grip glue
because<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.780> grips<00:02:46.079> already<00:02:46.379> fit<00:02:46.590> plenty

we're showing the install on this side
with<00:02:51.000> glue<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.349> only<00:02:52.530> need<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.799> use<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:52.980> small

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
with glue so we only need to use a small

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.099 
with glue so we only need to use a small
amount<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.670> glue<00:02:53.849> on<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.090> bar<00:02:54.329> and<00:02:54.780> we'll<00:02:54.870> put

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
to it with the ground so the next step

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.360 
to it with the ground so the next step
is<00:06:08.900> just<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:09.140> connect<00:06:09.500> all<00:06:09.650> the<00:06:09.770> wires<00:06:10.010> and

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
is just to connect all the wires and

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.950 
is just to connect all the wires and
keep<00:06:10.760> in<00:06:10.910> mind<00:06:11.120> that<00:06:11.240> the<00:06:11.360> leads<00:06:11.600> coming<00:06:11.870> from

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
keep in mind that the leads coming from

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.930 
keep in mind that the leads coming from
the<00:06:12.140> left<00:06:12.530> and<00:06:12.770> the<00:06:12.830> right<00:06:13.280> grips<00:06:13.550> have<00:06:13.789> no

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
the left and the right grips have no

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.730 
the left and the right grips have no
polarity<00:06:14.300> so<00:06:14.870> we'll<00:06:14.990> connect<00:06:15.320> both<00:06:15.530> those

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
polarity so we'll connect both those

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.409 
polarity so we'll connect both those
wires<00:06:16.039> to<00:06:16.280> the<00:06:16.370> corresponding<00:06:16.910> connectors
