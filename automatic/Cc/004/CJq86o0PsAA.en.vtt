00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
enough this is the life ins like that

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.309 
enough this is the life ins like that
are<00:05:50.240> you<00:05:50.389> not<00:05:50.599> judging<00:05:51.169> your<00:05:51.680> body<00:05:52.009> is<00:05:52.310> still

so<00:05:54.319> you're<00:05:54.650> creating<00:05:55.099> a<00:05:55.129> balance<00:05:55.400> between<00:05:55.759> the

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
so you're creating a balance between the

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.079 
so you're creating a balance between the
left<00:05:56.870> hemisphere<00:05:57.250> of<00:05:58.250> the<00:05:58.370> brain<00:05:58.460> and<00:05:58.939> the

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 
left hemisphere of the brain and the

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:01.990 
left hemisphere of the brain and the
right<00:05:59.300> one<00:05:59.889> so<00:06:00.889> that<00:06:01.039> means<00:06:01.219> when<00:06:01.699> those

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
right one so that means when those

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.899 
right one so that means when those
thoughts<00:06:02.270> come<00:06:02.629> again<00:06:03.279> your<00:06:04.279> head<00:06:04.520> when

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909 
thoughts come again your head when

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:06.969 
thoughts come again your head when
somebody<00:06:05.360> will<00:06:05.569> tell<00:06:05.810> you<00:06:06.050> a<00:06:06.199> negative

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
that you perceive as negative you won't

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.279 
that you perceive as negative you won't
judge<00:06:13.849> it<00:06:14.089> so<00:06:14.449> that<00:06:14.599> means<00:06:14.719> you<00:06:14.930> won't<00:06:15.139> be
