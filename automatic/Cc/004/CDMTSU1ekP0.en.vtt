the<00:00:14.820> Nikon<00:00:15.089> d70<00:00:15.540> 2<00:00:15.719> has<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> same<00:00:16.379> dynamic

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the Nikon d70 2 has the same dynamic

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.420 
the Nikon d70 2 has the same dynamic
range<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> Nikon<00:00:18.119> d810<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:19.050> record<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.980> he

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.990 
go over to DX o mark that's absolutely
he's<00:00:28.289> absolutely<00:00:28.560> correct<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.250> Nikon<00:00:29.550> d810

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
he's absolutely correct the Nikon d810

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.470 
he's absolutely correct the Nikon d810
is<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.630> fourteen<00:00:31.080> point<00:00:31.349> eight<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.309> D<00:00:32.489> 7200<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
is at fourteen point eight the D 7200 is

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.350 
is at fourteen point eight the D 7200 is
at<00:00:33.570> fourteen<00:00:33.989> point<00:00:34.200> six<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.190> d750<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.210> at

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
at fourteen point six and the d750 is at

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.200 
at fourteen point six and the d750 is at
fourteen<00:00:36.750> point<00:00:36.960> five<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.829> it's<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:38.010> exact<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
fourteen point five so it's not exact to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
fourteen point five so it's not exact to
the<00:00:39.300> d810<00:00:39.570> but<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.050> right<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the d810 but it's right up there at the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.040 
the d810 but it's right up there at the
top<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> pile<00:00:42.420> for<00:00:43.140> dynamic<00:00:43.950> range<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
top of the pile for dynamic range and

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.619 
top of the pile for dynamic range and
right<00:00:46.050> below<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.530> d810<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.190> above<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.629> 750

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
right below the d810 but above the 750

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.180 
right below the d810 but above the 750
so<00:00:49.190> absolutely<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.940> aps-c<00:00:51.480> sensor

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
so absolutely we have the aps-c sensor

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
so absolutely we have the aps-c sensor
outperforming<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.520> wonderful<00:00:53.969> sensor<00:00:54.390> full

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
outperforming the wonderful sensor full

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.920 
outperforming the wonderful sensor full
frame<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> d750<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.120> hair<00:00:57.449> below

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.240 
frame in the d750 and just a hair below
the<00:00:58.500> d810<00:00:58.859> so<00:01:00.379> incredible<00:01:01.379> performance<00:01:02.039> here

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the d810 so incredible performance here

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.030 
the d810 so incredible performance here
on<00:01:02.370> dynamic<00:01:03.270> range<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.290> we're<00:01:04.890> at

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
on dynamic range and you know we're at

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
on dynamic range and you know we're at
the<00:01:05.070> point<00:01:05.400> where<00:01:05.580> high<00:01:05.909> ISO<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.780> mean<00:01:07.110> I'll

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the point where high ISO is I mean I'll

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.870 
the point where high ISO is I mean I'll
always<00:01:07.380> take<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> performance

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
always take more but the performance

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.380 
always take more but the performance
here<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.119> good<00:01:09.390> enough<00:01:09.689> very<00:01:10.380> good<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.939> we

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
here is good enough very good and we

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.990 
here is good enough very good and we
want<00:01:12.689> more<00:01:13.350> dynamic<00:01:13.950> range<00:01:14.189> more<00:01:14.520> dynamic

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
want more dynamic range more dynamic

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.789 
want more dynamic range more dynamic
range<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.479> beautiful<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> always<00:01:16.470> want<00:01:16.650> more

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
range is beautiful you always want more

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.399 
range is beautiful you always want more
