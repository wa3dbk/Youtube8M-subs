 pieces here and good the first piece is 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.910
 This is like a fishing roller I think 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.950
 and well we're going to the table to 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.870
 ride it remember that you have several 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.480
 tables is always I choose it because it is 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.810

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.940

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.860

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.720

 I think it's a saw we go and good 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.890

 and good to tell you that this consists of 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.520
 four pieces we are missing two more pieces 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.890
 let's go for them 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.479
 picker in it 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.270
 the part where you throw to pick up the 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.510
 the rod of the fishing reel as you are 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.010
 seeing there that would be the lever 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.010
 to pull the line 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.850

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.800

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.400
 will hold the weapon on the ground in the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.410
 ceiling or on the wall where we place it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.110

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.180

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.020
 this weapon cuts the head of the zombies 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.659
 or to the extent where we have placed it 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.969
 also tell you that this week you can 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.590
 place where you want either on the ground 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.539
 or on the wall 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.450
 you can place it anywhere as 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.940
 you are watching this kill zombies as you see 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.410

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.510
 be very careful as this can make us 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.890
 to do our own damage or can it do us 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.480
