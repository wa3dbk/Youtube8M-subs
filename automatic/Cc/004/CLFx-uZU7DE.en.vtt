reshaping the mask these masks are a
little<00:00:20.910> bit<00:00:21.180> wide<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> part<00:00:22.740> three<00:00:23.100> hockey

little bit wide for a part three hockey
mask<00:00:23.960> so<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> did<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.430> preheated<00:00:27.119> my

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
mask so what I did was I preheated my

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.580 
mask so what I did was I preheated my
oven<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.869> about<00:00:28.140> 300<00:00:29.039> degrees<00:00:30.019> then<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.199> placed

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
oven to about 300 degrees then I placed

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.970 
oven to about 300 degrees then I placed
the<00:00:32.070> mask<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> oven<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.989> about<00:00:34.170> three

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the mask in the oven for about three

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.729 
the mask in the oven for about three
minutes<00:00:35.660> then<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.780> took<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.290> wearing

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
minutes then I took it out wearing

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.630 
minutes then I took it out wearing
gloves<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.629> I<00:00:39.629> bent<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.160> hands

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
gloves and I bent it with my hands

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.729 
gloves and I bent it with my hands
squeeze<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.469> two<00:00:43.940> outside<00:00:44.940> edges<00:00:45.239> in

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
squeeze the the two outside edges in

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.639 
squeeze the the two outside edges in
towards<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> center<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.989> ran<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.469> under

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
towards the center and then ran it under

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.090 
towards the center and then ran it under
cold<00:00:50.010> water<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.090> see<00:00:54.440> now<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> mask

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
cold water as you can see now the mask

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.500 
cold water as you can see now the mask
has<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:57.260> definite<00:00:58.730> different<00:00:59.730> shape<00:01:00.030> than<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
has a definite different shape than it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.460 
has a definite different shape than it
originally<00:01:00.629> had<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:03.359> next<00:01:03.629> step<00:01:03.899> after<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
originally had the next step after that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.760 
originally had the next step after that
it<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:05.400> time<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.729> put<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> base<00:01:06.600> coat<00:01:06.960> now

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it was time to put on the base coat now

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.280 
it was time to put on the base coat now
knowing<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.510> scratch<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
knowing that there is a scratch on the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.859 
knowing that there is a scratch on the
nose<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.299> scratch<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
nose and the and a scratch on the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
nose and the and a scratch on the
forehead<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.530> figured<00:01:14.159> I'd<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.340> tape<00:01:14.909> those

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
forehead I figured I'd just tape those

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.330 
forehead I figured I'd just tape those
off<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.900> little<00:01:16.470> piece<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.799> masking<00:01:17.040> tape

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
off at the little piece of masking tape

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.640 
off at the little piece of masking tape
I<00:01:18.920> just<00:01:19.920> found<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.170> saves<00:01:22.380> time

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
I just found that it just saves time

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
I just found that it just saves time
then<00:01:22.950> trying<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> scrape<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.299> off<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
then trying to scrape it all off and you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.510 
then trying to scrape it all off and you
might<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> proper<00:01:25.830> shape<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
might not get the proper shape that you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
might not get the proper shape that you
want<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:28.460> put<00:01:29.460> about<00:01:29.579> four<00:01:30.090> coats<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
want I put about four coats of the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.050 
want I put about four coats of the
Krylon<00:01:33.079> on<00:01:34.079> um<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:36.229> used<00:01:37.229> krylon<00:01:37.770> fusion<00:01:38.430> one

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
Krylon on um I used krylon fusion one

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.290 
Krylon on um I used krylon fusion one
shade<00:01:39.360> lighter<00:01:39.780> than<00:01:39.930> almond

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.560 

after<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.480> basecoat<00:01:47.050> had<00:01:47.320> set<00:01:47.740> for<00:01:48.150> 24<00:01:49.150> hours

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
after the basecoat had set for 24 hours

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.990 
after the basecoat had set for 24 hours
I<00:01:50.700> roughed<00:01:51.700> up<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.000> base<00:01:52.420> coat<00:01:52.960> with<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.970> a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
I roughed up the base coat with with a

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.640 
I roughed up the base coat with with a
scouring<00:01:55.420> pad<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:58.350> set<00:01:59.350> forth

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
scouring pad and then I set forth

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.240 
scouring pad and then I set forth
applying<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:01.000> slightly<00:02:01.930> darker<00:02:02.290> more<00:02:02.770> almond

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
applying a slightly darker more almond

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.860 
applying a slightly darker more almond
tone<00:02:03.490> paint<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:05.050> I<00:02:05.080> would<00:02:05.410> wash<00:02:05.770> off<00:02:06.070> later

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
tone paint that I would wash off later

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.749 
tone paint that I would wash off later
now<00:02:07.870> this<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.320> a<00:02:08.350> technique<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.340> saw

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
now this is a technique that I saw

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.340 
now this is a technique that I saw
others<00:02:10.600> use<00:02:11.050> online<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:13.630> didn't<00:02:13.990> work<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
others use online it didn't work the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.310 
others use online it didn't work the
greatest<00:02:14.980> for<00:02:15.310> me<00:02:15.490> in<00:02:16.180> fact<00:02:16.480> later<00:02:16.810> on<00:02:17.050> a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
greatest for me in fact later on a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.590 
greatest for me in fact later on a
second<00:02:17.800> mask<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.400> found<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.940> easier<00:02:19.360> to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
second mask I found it easier to

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
second mask I found it easier to
actually<00:02:20.100> dilute<00:02:21.100> some<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.640> paint<00:02:22.620> paint

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
actually dilute some of the paint paint

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.680 
actually dilute some of the paint paint
it<00:02:23.860> on<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.430> then<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.410> wipe<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.680> off<00:02:26.920> with<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
it on and then just wipe it off with the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.820 
it on and then just wipe it off with the
with<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> dry<00:02:29.080> cloth

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
with a dry cloth

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.600 
with a dry cloth
I<00:02:30.540> found<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.750> way<00:02:32.500> more<00:02:32.739> effective<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.550> a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
I found that way more effective and a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.800 
I found that way more effective and a
lot<00:02:34.090> less<00:02:34.300> time-consuming<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:37.180> for<00:02:37.540> this

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
lot less time-consuming but for this

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.720 
lot less time-consuming but for this
particularly<00:02:38.340> particularly

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
particularly particularly

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.850 
particularly particularly
I<00:02:39.940> did<00:02:40.600> use<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:41.020> technique<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:43.650> roughed<00:02:44.650> up

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
I did use this technique I roughed up

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.680 
I did use this technique I roughed up
some<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.430> areas<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.120> wanted<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.570> be

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
some of the areas that I wanted to be

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.900 
some of the areas that I wanted to be
darker<00:02:47.320> with<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.540> with<00:02:49.540> some<00:02:49.810> sandpaper<00:02:50.140> just

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
darker with the with some sandpaper just

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.220 
darker with the with some sandpaper just
so<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.120> they<00:02:52.299> would<00:02:52.480> take<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.780> little<00:02:53.019> bit

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
so that they would take a little bit

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.590 
so that they would take a little bit
more<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.590> color<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.100> I<00:02:54.610> applied<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.090> second

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
more of the color and I applied a second

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.170 
more of the color and I applied a second
wash<00:02:55.780> just<00:02:56.049> mostly<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.769> those<00:02:56.920> areas<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.700> this

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
wash just mostly to those areas and this

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.120 
wash just mostly to those areas and this
time<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.480> did<00:02:58.870> use<00:02:59.080> my<00:02:59.260> own<00:02:59.410> technique<00:02:59.860> where<00:03:00.100> I

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
time I did use my own technique where I

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.789 
time I did use my own technique where I
just<00:03:00.430> painted<00:03:00.820> on<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.299> thin<00:03:01.989> layer<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.650> the

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
just painted on a thin layer of the

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.220 
just painted on a thin layer of the
paint<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:03.670> wiped<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.180> away<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.900> next

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
paint and just wiped it away the next

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.979 
paint and just wiped it away the next
part<00:03:08.470> was<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:09.100> hardest<00:03:09.130> part<00:03:09.640> but<00:03:10.630> also<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
part was the hardest part but also the

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.270 
part was the hardest part but also the
most<00:03:11.680> satisfying<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:13.260> had<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.290> lot<00:03:14.739> of<00:03:14.890> reference

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
and had it right beside the mask and I

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.800 
and had it right beside the mask and I
took<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:29.110> small<00:03:29.530> piece<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:30.120> 80<00:03:31.120> grit<00:03:31.480> sandpaper

took a small piece of 80 grit sandpaper
and<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:32.980> brought<00:03:33.340> up<00:03:33.400> lightly<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.660> areas

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
and I just brought up lightly the areas

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.979 
and I just brought up lightly the areas
that<00:03:35.110> I<00:03:35.350> knew<00:03:35.620> were<00:03:36.489> had<00:03:37.030> scratches<00:03:37.540> or

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
that I knew were had scratches or

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.930 
that I knew were had scratches or
scrapes<00:03:40.530> because<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.560> only<00:03:41.799> use<00:03:42.100> four<00:03:42.430> coats<00:03:42.700> I

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
scrapes because I only use four coats I

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
had to be very light on this because I

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.710 
had to be very light on this because I
didn't<00:03:45.519> want<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.700> go<00:03:45.850> all<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.239> way<00:03:46.269> through

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
only on certain areas that I wanted to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.190 
only on certain areas that I wanted to
show<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:50.019> actual<00:03:50.260> white<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.070> mask<00:03:51.280> under

I also used an exacto knife for certain
air<00:03:56.910> areas<00:03:57.690> like<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.620> wanted<00:03:59.150> to<00:04:00.150> make<00:04:00.300> sure

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
air areas like I wanted to make sure

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.330 
air areas like I wanted to make sure
that<00:04:00.630> there<00:04:00.810> was<00:04:00.840> straight<00:04:01.590> up<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.280> down

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
lines on the forehead crack I'll go into

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.540 
lines on the forehead crack I'll go into
the<00:04:05.819> crackle<00:04:06.330> in<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.630> next<00:04:06.900> step<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.349> took<00:04:08.340> a

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
the crackle in the next step I took a

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.250 
the crackle in the next step I took a
dark<00:04:09.150> paint<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:10.370> using<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.519> same<00:04:11.790> technique

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
dark paint and using that same technique

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.370 
dark paint and using that same technique
I<00:04:13.260> would<00:04:13.830> just<00:04:14.040> paint<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.209> into<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.930> areas

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
I would just paint it into the areas

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.930 
I would just paint it into the areas
that<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.620> want<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.859> darker<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.340> then<00:04:17.459> I'd<00:04:17.669> wipe

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
that I want a darker and then I'd wipe

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.409 
that I want a darker and then I'd wipe
it<00:04:18.150> away<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:19.220> for<00:04:20.220> certain<00:04:20.430> areas<00:04:20.970> I<00:04:21.180> just

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
it away and for certain areas I just

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.659 
it away and for certain areas I just
went<00:04:21.900> over<00:04:22.019> with<00:04:22.290> a<00:04:22.350> really<00:04:22.650> fine<00:04:22.919> brush<00:04:23.370> and

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
went over with a really fine brush and

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.080 
went over with a really fine brush and
made<00:04:23.790> sure<00:04:23.820> that<00:04:24.240> those<00:04:24.419> areas<00:04:24.900> stayed<00:04:25.620> dark

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
made sure that those areas stayed dark

problem<00:05:17.610> was<00:05:17.760> is<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.150> works<00:05:18.390> better<00:05:18.840> if<00:05:19.020> it's

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
problem was is it works better if it's

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.500 
problem was is it works better if it's
actually<00:05:19.770> adhering<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.820> acrylic<00:05:21.240> paint

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
actually adhering to the acrylic paint

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.870 
actually adhering to the acrylic paint
you're<00:05:21.720> using<00:05:21.960> which<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:23.039> didn't<00:05:23.789> do

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
you're using which I didn't do

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.310 
you're using which I didn't do
putting<00:05:26.880> it<00:05:27.000> on<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.270> clear<00:05:27.539> coat<00:05:27.780> it<00:05:28.020> just

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
putting it on the clear coat it just

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.029 
putting it on the clear coat it just
didn't<00:05:28.560> crack<00:05:28.919> all<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.190> way<00:05:29.340> I<00:05:29.460> wanted<00:05:29.910> it<00:05:29.970> to

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
didn't crack all the way I wanted it to

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.620 
didn't crack all the way I wanted it to
again<00:05:32.039> here<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.760> just<00:05:33.030> used<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.389> same

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
again here I just used that same

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.900 
again here I just used that same
technique<00:05:34.080> I<00:05:34.229> watered<00:05:34.680> down<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:35.280> really<00:05:35.729> dark

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
technique I watered down a really dark

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.510 
technique I watered down a really dark
color<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:36.900> just<00:05:37.139> washed<00:05:37.500> it<00:05:37.800> over<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.370> then

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
color and I just washed it over and then

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.029 
color and I just washed it over and then
wiped<00:05:38.789> it<00:05:39.000> away<00:05:39.090> with<00:05:39.479> a<00:05:39.510> cloth

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
wiped it away with a cloth

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.090 
wiped it away with a cloth
I<00:05:41.100> used<00:05:41.910> a<00:05:42.030> wet<00:05:42.210> cloth<00:05:42.479> this<00:05:42.720> time<00:05:42.960> as<00:05:43.169> I<00:05:43.680> didn't

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
I used a wet cloth this time as I didn't

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.600 
I used a wet cloth this time as I didn't
want<00:05:44.310> any<00:05:44.750> of<00:05:45.750> that<00:05:45.810> color<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:46.860> be<00:05:47.039> on<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.370> top

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
want any of that color to be on the top

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.940 
want any of that color to be on the top
layer<00:05:47.850> but<00:05:48.330> just<00:05:48.600> to<00:05:48.750> sit<00:05:49.169> in<00:05:49.320> those<00:05:49.500> cracks

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
layer but just to sit in those cracks

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.620

dry

00:05:56.549 --> 00:05:56.559 
dry

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:02.129 
dry
before<00:05:57.009> I<00:05:57.209> applied<00:05:58.209> the<00:05:58.569> paint<00:06:00.959> so<00:06:01.959> we're

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
before I applied the paint so we're

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.019 
before I applied the paint so we're
almost<00:06:02.319> done<00:06:02.589> here<00:06:02.739> now<00:06:03.129> I<00:06:03.159> just<00:06:03.339> put<00:06:03.699> on<00:06:03.759> the

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
almost done here now I just put on the

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:07.919 
almost done here now I just put on the
Chevron's<00:06:04.829> the<00:06:05.829> way<00:06:05.979> I<00:06:06.009> design<00:06:06.759> these<00:06:07.029> is<00:06:07.509> I

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:07.929 
Chevron's the way I design these is I

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:12.869 
Chevron's the way I design these is I
had<00:06:08.319> a<00:06:08.349> picture<00:06:08.799> I<00:06:09.599> took<00:06:10.599> offline<00:06:11.169> and<00:06:11.679> I<00:06:12.429> in

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
had a picture I took offline and I in

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:18.629 
had a picture I took offline and I in
Illustrator<00:06:15.989> marked<00:06:16.989> out<00:06:17.169> the<00:06:17.439> shape<00:06:17.829> of<00:06:18.069> the

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
Illustrator marked out the shape of the

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.649 
Illustrator marked out the shape of the
Chevron's<00:06:19.179> and<00:06:20.759> then<00:06:21.759> printed<00:06:22.179> it<00:06:22.329> out<00:06:22.479> on

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
Chevron's and then printed it out on

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.439 
Chevron's and then printed it out on
fairly<00:06:23.019> thick<00:06:23.349> cardstock<00:06:23.789> then<00:06:24.789> I<00:06:24.819> cut<00:06:25.209> those

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
fairly thick cardstock then I cut those

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.439 
fairly thick cardstock then I cut those
shapes<00:06:25.749> out<00:06:26.049> with<00:06:26.229> an<00:06:26.409> exacto<00:06:26.529> knife<00:06:27.419> then<00:06:28.419> I

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
shapes out with an exacto knife then I

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.929 
shapes out with an exacto knife then I
place<00:06:28.809> the<00:06:28.839> shapes<00:06:29.319> on<00:06:29.559> the<00:06:30.099> mask<00:06:30.489> and<00:06:30.849> just

00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:30.939 
place the shapes on the mask and just

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:34.859 
place the shapes on the mask and just
drew<00:06:31.479> with<00:06:31.689> a<00:06:31.719> pencil<00:06:32.049> around<00:06:32.469> them<00:06:33.869> placing

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:34.869 
drew with a pencil around them placing

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:36.929 
drew with a pencil around them placing
them<00:06:35.019> as<00:06:35.169> best<00:06:35.379> I<00:06:35.559> could<00:06:35.619> and<00:06:36.009> then<00:06:36.609> I<00:06:36.639> just

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
them as best I could and then I just

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.919 
them as best I could and then I just
taped<00:06:37.239> off<00:06:37.569> the<00:06:38.289> areas<00:06:38.829> that<00:06:39.099> I<00:06:39.719> didn't<00:06:40.719> want

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:40.929 
taped off the areas that I didn't want

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:44.869 
taped off the areas that I didn't want
the<00:06:41.079> paint<00:06:41.289> to<00:06:41.499> adhere<00:06:42.159> to<00:06:42.849> it<00:06:42.969> obviously<00:06:43.419> I

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:44.879 
the paint to adhere to it obviously I

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:49.619 
the paint to adhere to it obviously I
put<00:06:45.879> two<00:06:46.209> coats<00:06:46.689> of<00:06:47.079> this<00:06:47.819> fairly<00:06:48.819> bright<00:06:49.209> red

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:49.629 
put two coats of this fairly bright red

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:54.839 
put two coats of this fairly bright red
paint<00:06:50.079> on<00:06:50.399> the<00:06:51.399> mask<00:06:52.499> I<00:06:53.499> didn't<00:06:54.039> have<00:06:54.249> painters

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849 
paint on the mask I didn't have painters

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.389 
paint on the mask I didn't have painters
tape<00:06:55.149> and<00:06:55.559> I'm<00:06:56.559> not<00:06:56.739> sure<00:06:56.949> if<00:06:57.039> it<00:06:57.129> was<00:06:57.249> the

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:57.399 
tape and I'm not sure if it was the

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:59.939 
tape and I'm not sure if it was the
crackle<00:06:57.939> effect<00:06:58.299> underneath<00:06:58.839> or<00:06:59.409> if<00:06:59.649> it<00:06:59.769> was

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
crackle effect underneath or if it was

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:02.219 
crackle effect underneath or if it was
the<00:07:00.219> painters<00:07:00.729> tape<00:07:00.969> out<00:07:01.179> or<00:07:01.509> the<00:07:01.719> masking

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:02.229 
the painters tape out or the masking

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:04.379 
the painters tape out or the masking
tape<00:07:02.259> I<00:07:02.559> was<00:07:02.679> using<00:07:03.099> but<00:07:03.579> I<00:07:03.639> didn't<00:07:03.969> get<00:07:04.059> a<00:07:04.119> real

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
tape I was using but I didn't get a real

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.049 
tape I was using but I didn't get a real
nice<00:07:04.779> sharp<00:07:05.169> edge<00:07:05.379> I<00:07:05.679> had<00:07:06.039> to<00:07:06.189> go<00:07:06.369> back<00:07:06.579> in<00:07:06.879> and

00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:07.059 
nice sharp edge I had to go back in and

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:10.499 
nice sharp edge I had to go back in and
manually<00:07:07.719> with<00:07:07.959> the<00:07:07.989> brush<00:07:08.499> really<00:07:09.389> go<00:07:10.389> around

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:10.509 
manually with the brush really go around

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:14.029 
manually with the brush really go around
those<00:07:10.809> edges<00:07:11.019> and<00:07:11.409> fine-tune<00:07:11.860> them<00:07:12.069> and

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 
those edges and fine-tune them and

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.129 
those edges and fine-tune them and
that's<00:07:15.039> pretty<00:07:15.219> much<00:07:15.489> it<00:07:15.759> I<00:07:15.939> just<00:07:16.269> added<00:07:16.449> a

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139 
that's pretty much it I just added a

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:20.579 
that's pretty much it I just added a
couple<00:07:17.619> coats<00:07:17.979> of<00:07:18.269> satin<00:07:19.269> clear<00:07:19.959> coat<00:07:20.319> from

00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:24.119 
Kryolan over top to seal it all in and

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:27.539 
Kryolan over top to seal it all in and
that's<00:07:25.119> it<00:07:25.389> and<00:07:25.599> believe<00:07:26.589> it<00:07:26.709> or<00:07:26.829> not<00:07:26.979> this<00:07:27.279> is

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:27.549 
that's it and believe it or not this is

00:07:27.549 --> 00:07:30.299 
that's it and believe it or not this is
the<00:07:27.909> first<00:07:28.479> Jason<00:07:29.289> Voorhees<00:07:29.709> mask<00:07:29.979> I<00:07:30.279> have
