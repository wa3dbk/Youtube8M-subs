00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.010
 yes that's what I did what I did little here that 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.920
 indeed nothing given 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.220
 the initial round 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.190
 conference 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.450
 other than that it was not planned I do not know what happened a little ago 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.850
 bug 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 I landed in the bowels of the roller coaster 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.700
 clay had a young audience enough to get out 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.570
 there I go back 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.530
 I will return 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 not sure how it works 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.410
 he went off without me 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.410
 that's not bad 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.220
 I will arrive I am not very talented I admit 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 here we go 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.750
 she picked up 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.060
 so this part finally 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.370
 it's a pretty fayed 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.460
 I hope we have arrived 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.460
 I do not know how it works 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.730
 roj not sure it works the roller coaster system 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 ok I still have time I'm still a little bit and then here I come 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 not benefit from its shaded part 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 in the change not the case it's people 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.370
 unless I have to put it on the sport handle 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.719
 we did not work but it does not matter we did not insist 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.549
 unless I arrive myself 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:20.979
 so good account 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.289
 On the other hand 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.289
 a record 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.759

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.959
 the media ticket watching me on the weekend 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.259
 in one year 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.259
 it's like that 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.339

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:03.949

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.579
 beaupuy 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.579
 suddenly 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.039
 to see them join them 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.499
 no it was not planned at all 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.989

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.060

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.849
 wow really a lot of luck on this one there 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.499
 the night falls that's not very reassuring 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.430
 laurent pouyaud march to it works 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.100

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.070
 of episodes do it so much say it right away make it a door that better 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.580
 you do not dream 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.580
 it's a door 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.960
 I am always 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.669
 full episode before doing it 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.279

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:43.219
 r 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:44.939
