00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.220
 the links to download windows 10 and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.000
 its activators like the program 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.660

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.970
 Explanation 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.600
 windows will be the new vision of the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.610
 microsoft company here I leave you a 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.380
 small summary of what the system is 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.390
 windows 10 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.150
 the first windows 10 does not have the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.279
 metro interface that was not corrected 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.640
 until the update came out 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.129
 windows 8.1 and the amazing thing but that 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.670
 and the windows users asked is 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.309
 the start menu is very similar to that of 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.309
 windows 7 the start menu of the 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.469
 right is very similar to windows 8 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.739
 which in this menu we can 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.469
 customize to our liking as 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.890
 you watch the applications and the interface 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.570
 of windows 8 have not disappeared 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.820
 we can order them as we want or 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.339
 remove them even put new ones too 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.360
 the start bar is very similar 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.360
 from windows 7 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.310
 if you look in windows 10 the icons of 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.380
 the programs that we install are shown 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.960
 on the desk as if it were 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:34.120
 a running windows system not like in 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:36.850
 windows 8 we also have the 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.509
 Touch screen prepared applications 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.820
 like in windows 8 how awesome of 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.460
 windows 10 is that it is able to detect 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.740
 if you are using it from a tablet or a 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.070
 computer with touch screen or a 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.649
 normal computer on a device 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.170
 tactile we'll see the sidebar thing that 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.509
 it is a non-touch device this bar 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.450
 we will leave the company windows microsoft 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.790
 the view of the applications has improved 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.840
 and the form of the applications of a 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.840
 folder to another 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.959
 what was done now with windows and 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.260
 tabulator is now done with an icon that 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.480
 there is in the taskbar with the new 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.160
 feature we are allowed to see a 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.220
 previous characteristic of 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.120
 applications and larger than with 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.190
 windows 8 with that allows us to move from 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.610
 one application to another with greater 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.160
 ease we also have the option 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.430
 from there to close the applications that 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.739
 we want if we place ourselves on the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.900
 application does not offer us a view to 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.200
 full screen if it is not that you 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.930
 we finally clicked on things that happened 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.850
 in windows 8 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.540
 windows 10 allows us to create new 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.820
 virtual desktops so we can 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.440
 create the desks that we want 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.260
 organize us as we want 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.680
 to create a new desktop we access 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.020
 to the taskbar icon for the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 view of tasks and we choose to create a 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.250
 new virtual desktop and click on 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.620
 the other application is to click on a 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.020
 icon on the taskbar and click one 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.530
 application that we have open in the 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:39.570
 another virtual desktop and it will take us 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.030
 directly to this we also have in 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.940
 the start button the xbox interface 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.920
 video with its news etc. or the 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.920
 xbox music application 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.550
 here 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.860
 windows 10 has also improved the 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.620
 screens like the speed of the system 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.460
 according to the computer that we have for your 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.460
 higher performance 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.230
 the singer 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.240
 the organization of screens with windows 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.970
 10 has also been improved at sight 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.250
 being able to open up to four windows 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.680
 simultaneously and the novelty of it 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:53.960
 system suggests us applications for 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:56.120
 occupy the empty spaces I hope that 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.580
