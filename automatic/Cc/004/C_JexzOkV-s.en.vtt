00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
identical I don't think they've no I

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.770 
identical I don't think they've no I
don't<00:04:50.069> think<00:04:50.310> they've<00:04:50.460> actually<00:04:50.970> if<00:04:51.330> anything

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
don't think they've actually if anything

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.230 
don't think they've actually if anything
they<00:04:51.900> might<00:04:52.080> have<00:04:52.199> improved<00:04:52.590> this<00:04:52.770> sound

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
they might have improved this sound

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.240 
they might have improved this sound
slightly<00:04:54.349> but<00:04:55.349> I<00:04:55.379> don't<00:04:55.620> think<00:04:55.830> they've

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
slightly but I don't think they've

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.580 
slightly but I don't think they've
enhanced<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.970> video<00:04:57.300> quality<00:04:57.990> from<00:04:58.409> the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
enhanced the video quality from the

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.240 
enhanced the video quality from the
original<00:04:59.130> release<00:04:59.960> so<00:05:00.960> it's<00:05:01.680> really<00:05:01.889> a<00:05:02.009> matter

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
original release so it's really a matter

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.029 
original release so it's really a matter
of<00:05:02.370> preference<00:05:02.819> you<00:05:03.150> could<00:05:03.300> go<00:05:03.449> either<00:05:03.690> or<00:05:04.039> but

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
of preference you could go either or but

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.800 
of preference you could go either or but
I<00:05:05.099> do<00:05:05.190> like<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.610> fact<00:05:05.789> that<00:05:05.970> they've<00:05:06.180> now<00:05:06.479> got

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
I do like the fact that they've now got

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.980 
I do like the fact that they've now got
it<00:05:06.990> as<00:05:07.080> Mickey's<00:05:07.530> Christmas<00:05:07.710> Carol<00:05:08.780> this<00:05:09.780> will

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.950
