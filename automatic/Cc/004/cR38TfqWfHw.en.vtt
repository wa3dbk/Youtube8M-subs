00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:49.080 

and<00:02:33.550> bits

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:03:11.860 

just<00:02:50.090> do<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:56.379> and<00:02:57.379> some<00:02:57.709> raisins<00:03:09.849> so<00:03:10.849> just<00:03:11.120> make

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
just do it and some raisins so just make

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.890 
just do it and some raisins so just make

it boil for five minutes

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.920 
it boil for five minutes
so<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.319> think<00:03:15.500> some<00:03:16.160> milk<00:03:16.819> is<00:03:17.030> less<00:03:17.299> so<00:03:17.750> we'll

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
so I think some milk is less so we'll

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:26.699 
so I think some milk is less so we'll
put<00:03:18.140> some<00:03:18.170> more<00:03:18.650> milk<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:23.150> keep<00:03:23.660> it<00:03:23.810> in<00:03:23.900> semi

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.970 

just<00:03:27.709> make<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.220> boil<00:03:28.579> for<00:03:30.760> five<00:03:31.760> minutes<00:03:32.030> and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
just make it boil for five minutes and

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.559

put<00:03:33.980> sugar<00:03:34.489> also

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.709 

just<00:03:39.569> keep<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.900> in<00:03:40.019> Sydney<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:41.299> just<00:03:42.299> keep<00:03:42.540> a
