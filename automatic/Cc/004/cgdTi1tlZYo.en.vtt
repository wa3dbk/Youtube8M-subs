00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
completely alien to you that just the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.660 
completely alien to you that just the
driving<00:01:35.290> environment<00:01:35.560> e<00:01:35.860> feet<00:01:36.130> are<00:01:36.280> up<00:01:36.430> up

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
driving environment e feet are up up

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.410 
driving environment e feet are up up
here<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:37.780> your<00:01:38.170> shoulders<00:01:38.649> are<00:01:39.460> so<00:01:39.970> tightly

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
here and your shoulders are so tightly

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.539 
here and your shoulders are so tightly
squeezed<00:01:41.020> into<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.439> car<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:42.340> really

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
squeezed into the car you really

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.789 
squeezed into the car you really
struggle<00:01:43.000> for<00:01:43.420> space<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.470> feels<00:01:44.649> quite

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
struggle for space and it feels quite

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.530 
struggle for space and it feels quite
claustrophobic<00:01:45.210> there's<00:01:46.210> obviously<00:01:46.450> only

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
claustrophobic there's obviously only

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.240 
claustrophobic there's obviously only
two<00:01:46.810> pedals<00:01:47.200> because<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.649> clutch<00:01:47.890> is<00:01:48.070> on<00:01:48.159> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
two pedals because the clutch is on the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.090 
two pedals because the clutch is on the
steering<00:01:48.490> wheel<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:50.110> again<00:01:50.380> that's<00:01:50.560> an<00:01:50.829> e<00:01:50.860> half

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
steering wheel so again that's an e half

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.499 
steering wheel so again that's an e half
the<00:01:51.280> left<00:01:51.430> foot<00:01:51.579> brake<00:01:51.790> because<00:01:51.969> the<00:01:52.210> steering

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
the left foot brake because the steering

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.120 
the left foot brake because the steering
column<00:01:52.659> comes<00:01:52.990> down<00:01:53.170> between<00:01:53.500> your<00:01:53.649> feet<00:01:53.890> so

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
column comes down between your feet so

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.740 
column comes down between your feet so
you<00:01:54.219> haven't<00:01:54.490> really<00:01:54.579> even<00:01:54.969> got<00:01:55.210> an<00:01:55.299> option<00:01:55.450> of

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
you haven't really even got an option of

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.870 
you haven't really even got an option of
trying<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.560> brake<00:01:56.770> how<00:01:56.950> you're<00:01:57.159> comfortable

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
trying to brake how you're comfortable

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.310 
trying to brake how you're comfortable
so<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.930> it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
so this is it

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.789 
so this is it
I'm<00:01:59.890> absolutely<00:02:01.020> puffing<00:02:02.020> myself<00:02:02.469> at<00:02:02.680> the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
I'm absolutely puffing myself at the

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.310 
I'm absolutely puffing myself at the
moment<00:02:03.189> and<00:02:03.310> then<00:02:03.789> they<00:02:03.939> fire<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.390> thing<00:02:04.539> up

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.490 

buzzing<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:13.270> completely<00:02:14.270> overwhelmed<00:02:15.260> and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
buzzing and completely overwhelmed and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.990 
buzzing and completely overwhelmed and
then<00:02:15.650> you've<00:02:15.800> got<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.040> try<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.310> balance<00:02:16.730> the

it's so intense and so exciting

it<00:02:45.640> just<00:02:45.880> doesn't<00:02:46.240> feel<00:02:46.450> right<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.810> me<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:47.470> you

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
it just doesn't feel right to me but you

00:02:47.710 --> 00:03:00.490 
it just doesn't feel right to me but you
can't<00:02:48.010> bring<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.580> right

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.710 

though<00:03:25.100> I<00:03:25.130> didn't<00:03:26.000> drive<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.270> car<00:03:26.450> fast

though I didn't drive the car fast
enough<00:03:26.900> at<00:03:27.230> all<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.590> feel<00:03:27.740> any<00:03:27.920> downforce<00:03:28.460> and

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
enough at all to feel any downforce and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.820 
enough at all to feel any downforce and
to<00:03:28.760> be<00:03:28.880> honest<00:03:29.120> assert<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.630> corners<00:03:30.500> here<00:03:30.680> are

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
to be honest assert the corners here are

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.730 
to be honest assert the corners here are
very<00:03:31.240> tight<00:03:32.240> so<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.750> don't<00:03:32.990> think<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.230> the

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
very tight so that I don't think the the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.380 
very tight so that I don't think the the
wings<00:03:34.010> are<00:03:34.220> really<00:03:34.310> working<00:03:34.610> which<00:03:35.090> probably

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
wings are really working which probably

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.780 
wings are really working which probably
makes<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.840> car<00:03:36.110> feel<00:03:36.140> quite<00:03:36.560> awkward<00:03:36.790> to

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
makes the car feel quite awkward to

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.330 
makes the car feel quite awkward to
drive<00:03:38.060> so<00:03:38.690> it's<00:03:38.840> really<00:03:39.080> just<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.620> braking

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
drive so it's really just the braking

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.700 
drive so it's really just the braking
and<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.790> acceleration<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.470> gear

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
and the acceleration and the the gear

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.330 
and the acceleration and the the gear
shift<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.160> the<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:44.180> things<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.690> stand<00:03:45.110> out

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
shift that the the things that stand out

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.200 
shift that the the things that stand out
massively<00:03:46.340> from<00:03:46.580> anything<00:03:46.790> I've<00:03:47.030> driven

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
massively from anything I've driven

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:54.340 
massively from anything I've driven
before<00:03:50.560> having<00:03:51.560> now<00:03:51.800> driven<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.460> I<00:03:53.350> realize

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
before having now driven it I realize

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.660 
before having now driven it I realize
how<00:03:54.560> even<00:03:55.280> now<00:03:55.880> how<00:03:56.150> little<00:03:56.540> I<00:03:56.780> was<00:03:56.930> really

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
how even now how little I was really

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.210 
how even now how little I was really
pushing<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.940> car<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.450> think<00:04:00.020> probably<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.980> took

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
pushing the car I think probably it took

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.090 
pushing the car I think probably it took
for<00:04:02.060> six<00:04:02.780> laps<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.290> even<00:04:03.560> get<00:04:03.680> any<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:03.980> the

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
for six laps to even get any of the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.300 
for six laps to even get any of the
shift<00:04:04.340> light

properly live that is women when you

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.910 
properly live that is women when you
really<00:04:08.819> give<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.060> full<00:04:09.270> throttle<00:04:09.860> like<00:04:10.860> a

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
really give it full throttle like a

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.210 
really give it full throttle like a
bombs<00:04:11.370> gone<00:04:11.640> on<00:04:11.790> Sunday<00:04:12.290> it's<00:04:13.290> ridiculous

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
bombs gone on Sunday it's ridiculous

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:26.270

and<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.900> fires<00:04:23.360> and<00:04:24.360> then<00:04:24.980> so<00:04:25.980> that<00:04:26.130> rice

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
and it fires and then so that rice

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.120 
and it fires and then so that rice
really<00:04:26.669> need<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:26.970> start<00:04:27.210> breaking<00:04:27.389> now<00:04:27.720> and

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
really need to start breaking now and

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.230 
really need to start breaking now and
you<00:04:29.130> just<00:04:29.370> brush<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.210> brakes<00:04:30.480> and<00:04:30.870> it's<00:04:32.240> it's

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
you just brush the brakes and it's it's

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.220 
you just brush the brakes and it's it's
not<00:04:33.389> stopped<00:04:33.810> but<00:04:34.320> your<00:04:34.680> your<00:04:35.070> so<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.990> must

fifty meters before I should I just

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.020 
fifty meters before I should I just
can't<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:52.080> can't<00:04:52.740> ever<00:04:52.919> imagine<00:04:53.190> doing<00:04:53.730> that

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
can't I can't ever imagine doing that

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.600 
can't I can't ever imagine doing that
which<00:04:54.360> is<00:04:54.590> which<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.770> brilliant<00:04:55.980> actually

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
which is which is brilliant actually

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.270 
which is which is brilliant actually
because<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.270> see<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.930> guys<00:04:58.110> in<00:04:58.470> Formula<00:04:59.100> One

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
because you see the guys in Formula One

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.400 
because you see the guys in Formula One
and<00:04:59.520> they're<00:04:59.790> they're<00:05:00.450> superstars<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.290> their

and they're they're superstars and their

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.920 
and they're they're superstars and their
heroes<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.090> get<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.120> bit<00:05:03.330> cynical<00:05:03.600> about<00:05:03.780> that

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
heroes and get a bit cynical about that

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.600 
heroes and get a bit cynical about that
and<00:05:04.410> then<00:05:04.530> you<00:05:04.620> put<00:05:04.830> yourself<00:05:04.979> in<00:05:05.430> their

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
and then you put yourself in their

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.879 
and then you put yourself in their
position<00:05:05.760> in<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.660> car<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.110> they<00:05:07.229> drive<00:05:07.500> and

position in the car that they drive and
you<00:05:08.610> realize<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.060> they<00:05:09.419> are<00:05:09.630> there<00:05:10.490> skill<00:05:11.490> is
