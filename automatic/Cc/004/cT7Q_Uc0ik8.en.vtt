00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.740
 testimony because now I have the 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.560
 training to ring this garden 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.050

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.940

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.340
 make people medicine has me 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.870
 We are interested in our office job 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.640
 just never been something for me 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.399
 I am also on the whole time already 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.690
 consider what I should do 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.550
 I already thought about medicine 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.660
 but I believe in mine 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.579
 I will not graduate from high school 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.500
 come in or 8 degrees 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.360
 you can do the training first 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.730
 Make Nursing Helpers and Afterward 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.469
 Do you just continue then that would be 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.780
 but what for me what are you doing there 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.040
 were the whole day yes if it was you 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.559
 I'm really interested in you 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.559
 like to show something good 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.680
 Of course, you work in education 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.860
 a lot with the patient and there 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.270
 you get everything shown exactly 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.740
 I have to also provide the doctor 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.880
 become medications for the patients 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.260
 compile 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.210
 I have to pretty careful I am 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.840
 We should also be a team 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.910
 and research each other and 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.670
 I also have to write a lot and 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.010
 patient data in the jute , but maintains it 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.850
 it comes to break the whole lot 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.080
 or clearly you have to but worth it 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.259
 By the way, we also have a right one 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.180
 auditorium in the university and then have 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.700
 we made from group work 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.920
 or my place to different 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.970
 the results then become topics as well 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.650
 the class presented 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.810
 the school is pretty modern 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.810
 This helps to learn 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.250
 that sounds quite extensive 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.450
 But you have in the training on super 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.050
 us before the 14th 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.770
 Of course, I am always there with you and take anamnesis 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.790
 started 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.190
 may even just not right 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.800
 speak lead or for example 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.270
 Patients accompany both dismissed and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.840
 Give them a few more tips on the way 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.000
 to give away 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.910
 sometimes I have patients like that too 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.550
 I then understood how they felt about it 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.770
 now goes to the medication is 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.590
 for example, the fair pulse and 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.170
 Blood pressure is a special treat for you 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.000
 the work done with the children 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.310
 quite a lot warns Werther mill for 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.600
 well to the training but at kabi 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.400
 have over 20 locations throughout 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.810
 Upper Bavaria schools are at three 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.520
 different locations on one of these 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.730
 do you do your theoretical training ? 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.690
 training in practical training 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.950
 I have five different ones 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.200
 worked in hospitals 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.850
 not only with coffee because you have to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.190
 cover some disciplines 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.500
 then understands six times as an account the 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.380
 houses and stations around the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.910
 to hope for a complete overview or exactly me 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.540
 have now three years of education behind 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.260
 I did my exams and then 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.260
 a safe job
