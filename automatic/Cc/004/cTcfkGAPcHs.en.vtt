big<00:00:23.730> motor<00:00:24.240> which<00:00:24.990> includes<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> steering

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
big motor which includes the steering

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.510 
big motor which includes the steering
and<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:28.190> bathroom<00:00:29.190> for<00:00:29.610> words<00:00:31.279> what's<00:00:32.279> great

and the bathroom for words what's great

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.540 
and the bathroom for words what's great
about<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.449> is<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:34.199> I<00:00:34.500> felt<00:00:35.039> like<00:00:35.220> it<00:00:35.399> I

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
about this is I is if I felt like it I

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.270 
about this is I is if I felt like it I
could<00:00:35.760> break<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.960> we'll<00:00:37.560> take<00:00:37.739> off<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> body

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
could break and we'll take off the body

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
could break and we'll take off the body
and<00:00:38.960> put<00:00:39.960> my<00:00:40.110> own<00:00:40.880> car<00:00:41.880> design<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.840> which

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and put my own car design on it which

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.080 
and put my own car design on it which
would<00:00:43.470> be<00:00:43.620> critical<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.520> might<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.880> that<00:00:44.910> in

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
would be critical and I might do that in

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.270 
would be critical and I might do that in
the<00:00:45.149> future<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:48.230> just<00:00:49.230> said<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.100> see

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the future I just said as you can see

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.000 
the future I just said as you can see
the<00:00:50.460> remote<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.450> a<00:00:51.540> standard<00:00:52.170> power

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the remote is just a standard power

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
the remote is just a standard power
function<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.950> wireless<00:00:55.950> remote<00:00:56.960> what's<00:00:57.960> cool

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
function and wireless remote what's cool

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.840 
function and wireless remote what's cool
is<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.960> could<00:01:01.200> add<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:02.070> wheel<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.640> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
is that you could add this wheel to it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.840 
is that you could add this wheel to it
which<00:01:03.300> turns<00:01:04.250> obviously<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.309> wheels<00:01:05.519> left<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
which turns obviously the wheels left to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.170 
which turns obviously the wheels left to
right<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:08.070> obviously<00:01:08.400> that's<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.820> makes<00:01:09.030> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
right and obviously that's what makes it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.260 
right and obviously that's what makes it
go<00:01:09.299> backwards<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.930> forwards<00:01:16.940> yeah<00:01:17.940> as<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
go backwards and forwards yeah as you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:27.740 
go backwards and forwards yeah as you
can<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.689> goes<00:01:18.810> pretty<00:01:19.170> fast<00:01:26.240> with<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.450> set

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
can see it goes pretty fast with the set

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.999 
can see it goes pretty fast with the set
could<00:01:28.619> make<00:01:28.830> free<00:01:30.020> different<00:01:31.020> designs<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.890> you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
could make free different designs as you

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.510 
could make free different designs as you
can<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.340> that's<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.759> one<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> made<00:01:34.490> but<00:01:35.490> I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
can see that's the one I made but I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
can see that's the one I made but I
could<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.850> made<00:01:36.000> these<00:01:36.240> other<00:01:36.479> two<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.200> i

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
could have made these other two but i

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.980 
could have made these other two but i
like<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.220> make<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:39.000> main<00:01:39.270> lord

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
like to make the main lord

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.319 
like to make the main lord
there's<00:01:41.860> also<00:01:42.009> another<00:01:42.250> set<00:01:42.759> on<00:01:42.939> the<00:01:43.119> back

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
there's also another set on the back

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.740 
there's also another set on the back
that<00:01:43.570> shows<00:01:43.960> your<00:01:44.200> best<00:01:44.829> rock<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.509> haven't

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
that shows your best rock but I haven't

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.010 
that shows your best rock but I haven't
seen<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.200> sets<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.490> truck<00:01:48.820> set<00:01:49.090> yet<00:01:49.869> in
