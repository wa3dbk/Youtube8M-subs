00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello today I find for a 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.520
 new video and it's very strange to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.180
 say that after months and months 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.650
 of absence 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.000
 so that's it if you did not forget me 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.469
 maybe weird to see my 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.490
 mouth in your news feed of 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.080
 video but I will explain a 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.480
 little bit the situation I just 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.119
 receive a great message I believe that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.380
 it's a bit too clear I'm sorry 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.439
 but I have small problems of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 camera settings since I have 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.809
 already filmed this video once with a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 super micro who dropped me so I 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.239
 spoken in front of the other quarter of an hour without 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.100
 nothing but that saves it awesome brief there 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.590
 is not the subject of the day finds for 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.789
 a new video where I'm going to 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.320
 talk about my bitch on my return I 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.649
 will start on the why of 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.270
 how 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.699
 what am I doing here a euro that makes 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.699
 already no we will say a month and a half two 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.590
 month that I want to re filmed but that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.109
 I do not find a specific theme that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 could be original that's what 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.660
 was looking for it was an original theme but 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.180
 we are left to the docks is not 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 too hard to do because because 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.040
 that here we are 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.659
 and that's why at the beginning of the holidays 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.830
 great holidays I asked you about 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.630
 snapshot and facebook 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.640
 and I think that's all if you had 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.040
 no video theme ideas that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.259
 could be original that I could 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.820
 and make the majority of which we will understand 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.590
 since I had been offered to do 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.619
 unpublished quests of the favorites of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.939
 men crime blogs etc 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.759
 and that's not at all what I expected 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.210
 in fact because I kind of wanted to 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.690
 do something 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.170
 you like it etc but I have not found 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.619
 so yesterday on snapshot I have you 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.680
 asked what is it you like min it 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.119
 ya on this game yesterday on snapshot I 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.040
 asked you to tell me what you 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.720
 like in my videos before for 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.850
 that I can keep this hot this 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.140
 something for that you always like 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.119
 anyway such as I was going to do 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.009
 after that it's not at all clear 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.080
 majority of you have been very 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.090
 nice but very adorable etc 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.619
 you told me it's your good 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.850
 mood of personality and character 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.709
 etc and so it made me very happy 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.120
 I was like yes it motivates me go 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.170
 that I told myself we're going maybe its 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.250
 watermelons kind three seconds I'm 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.120
 I'm basically saying I can do anything 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.760
 what theme of videos 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.040
 as long as I am myself it should 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.750
 please I basically said that and so 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.370
 I said to myself, you're going to take your camera 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.709
 you will ask yourself as usual 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.860
 as before anyway and you'll talk 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.269
 of your chain this is all I 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.680
 were following for now in this 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.750
 video in any case it may last 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.950
 for a long time or not the grape variety risks 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.410
 sink a lot of things because I 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.519
 say anyway shit and this 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.510
 dude I lost the habit of talking 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.260
 because I'm always so much at 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.090
 comfortable in front of a camera but 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.010
 I have no long time I do not know 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.590
 what to say what is it there is no 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.439
 a lot of people that I actually know 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.329
 kind irl the contact all that they 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.950
 told me that I should take back that 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.769
 that was what I was doing 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.569
 before and all and one must who told me 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.250
 that it was not necessarily good but 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.959
 that I should take tam anyway 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.209
 is even more motivated and that's gold 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.470
 chain what's going to happen i 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.590
 will leave my old videos in 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.269
 line though strong after even though I do not 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.659
 assumes them absolutely not because 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.769
 clearly it's anything I'm going 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.180
 leave them for you because that's 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.409
 often, finally, after-effects 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.500
 I happen to receive from your messages that 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:28.650
 was telling me kind of yeah I looked at 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.120
 videos that's missing and all so I stay 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.090
 for you because I assume who have 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.709
 not what I could do before anything 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.760
 simply because in fact since 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.079
 college materials 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.250
 I changed a lot as pretty much 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.530
 everyone when going to high school and 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.849
 it's true that these are the videos they 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.950
 had before it was the college period 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.269
 that I do not assume so here I was leaving 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.440
 on youtube for you maybe take 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.910
 a little while maybe I'm 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.739
 taken as I go I do not 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.959
 but in any case it may well 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.329
 change then that's enough 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.730
 complicated to resume the videos after 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.049
 a little moment because when you have 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.400
 already a small community that's what 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.840
 I said on twitter because precisely 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.879
 people are used to that you 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.010
 did before no so you risk when 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.930
 even to be disappointed with 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.810
 disappoint a party by taking back 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.940
 videos of a different style but that's it 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.260
 that's how I listen I've already lost to 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.989
 about 1000 subscribers because I have 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.060
 does not pause pause ok but a 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.010
 pause and so 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.269
 I'm no I was going to say I'm sorry 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.870
 to have a break but no it's 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.000
 not the case 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.470
 frankly during these months I do not have 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.490
 all thought that youtube has told me 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.050
 really allowed me their sources and 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.810
 anything there but it allowed me to 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.419
 not forge me I did not think it was me 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.530
 not missed by his mother who is the 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.300
 relationship he had with you but 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.380
 that's all I did not have necessarily 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.669
 want to make videos and now 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.700
 that the computer resume I told myself 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.230
 go go I have no idea theme for my 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.370
 next videos I told myself that 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.900
 I was going to pose in front of the camera as 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.610
 usually and talk I hope you 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.930
 are happy anyway some of you 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.220
 see you on youtube 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.479
 that does not mean that I've ironed 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.330
 lives of three videos a week or what 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.440
 it's just that I want it 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.840
 just that I found themes I had 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.960
 already have ideas about what 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.680
 I could do before that is what 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.910
 that I liked 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.400
 finally what I liked what I 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.880
 did it before it was during a tackle I 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.020
 believe I had addressed taboo topics 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.530
 amassing my opinion on some 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.120
 things and and you liked it and that 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.380
 I liked it a lot too because 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.240
 in the comments we started 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.669
 to debate and it's not debates 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.919
 in mode without arguments insults and 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.930
 or not real debates built and 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.850
 it's true that I like it 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.229
 either on youtube or in general give 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.250
 my opinion on something and after 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.539
 discuss with other people who 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.060
 do not necessarily have the same opinion as me 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.440
 I like doing this in real life so I 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.910
 am told why not do it on 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.020
 youtube alone that the problem is that at 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.610
 level of themes it's something 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.100
 which is going to be quite restricted yet a 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.180
 time because it's hard to 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.020
 find themes are not already 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.419
 approached and I'm not enough let's say 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.000
 I'm 16 years old I'm not a life like that 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.539
 with crazy experiences for you 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.770
 that's brief 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.910
 so I can not talk about everything and 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.850
 anything but I would like when 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.810
 even well do that that's me what you 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:05.300
 just think about that on a theme during 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.650
 5 10 15 20 minutes I stand in front of the 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.810
 camera and I'm talking to you about a theme 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.160
 during your joke podcast with his 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.440
 purposes I mean I'll stay myself 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.550
 but just I should my opinion yes by 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.669
 report to my channel again I 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.050
 account change my nickname because even 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.490
 7 goals 6 bet somewhere else maybe 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.680
 when I publish this video I would have 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.490
 already changed do not know yet I do not 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.780
 did not change it right away 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.580
 I hope you remember anyway 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.750
 little who I am I will change I 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.730
 will not keep mam'zelle beauty because 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.870
 that it puts me in a category of 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.419
 videos that I do not appreciate 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.830
 i will call myself laura she hrx as 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.030
 the majority of my social networks 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.889
 now if you have noticed 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.660
 so I wanted to list anbar 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.000

 stuff like some favorite lives 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.610
 log and that's because I do not think in 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.590
 to forgive me I am themes 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:55.100

 in any case I am very happy because 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.830
 that it was still a little 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.510
 moment but I hesitated because it's 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.950
 true to have left you in plan 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.930

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:12.830
 maybe not but it does not matter you 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.020

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.340

 that's where I'm most active 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.979
 and where you risked having the most 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.539
 of information compared to what I 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:26.750
