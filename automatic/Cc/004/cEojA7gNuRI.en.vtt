 say a lot of quality we can say 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.910
 we'll say it to say we'll say it 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.130
 interesting test for mares 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.250
 we start to know a lot 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.360
 homogeneous but with bases with 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.399
 low but precisely we will see his 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 basics we listen to your mnl selection in 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.710
 head the nine the favorite action share 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.860
 in front of the 15 after river the cese 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.309
 on the 14th at the stage where the 8th 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 fiery of the closed the 7 to marana danover the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.399
 3 adrian of the Russian site and 11 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.780
 anantara jet 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.219
 so then to come back on the nine 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.559
 you said that will be the favorite of the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.449
 run the action share she won 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.799
 three of his last five outings 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.900
 could have even said frame since he is 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.220
 rented the first disqualified she 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.930
 has just returned to success so on 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.320
 this same course essential base 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.259
 test yes I think very bernier lumana 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.400
 opium flora breeding leveque stone 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.259
 because the bishop always told me that 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.280
 it was his beautiful hope in the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.490
 generation and that's a few months she 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.060
 proves on the track that she's agro 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.009
 wholesale quality of big potential outfits and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.380
 could even stay on four 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.330
 victories since she was crushed is 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.130
 dipped in turns on a 2100 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.780
 sense when she won that would make 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.790
 only 8 hours away last time 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.909
 the clock is not exceptional but 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.259
 piroi control the test 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.090
 frankly if has made its value on a 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.830
 course that fits him perfectly 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.390
 it's the winning is not winning 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.950
 will not be beaten but I think I 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.940
 take in the completely we go when 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.800
 even found an opposition with the 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.660
 number 15 after river that comes from 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.550
 reconnect with success on this same 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.740
 course in 30 years other time forgiveness 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.210
 below them a fortnight 14.9 for 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.159
 to be exact you have to be precise 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.990
 she is at the arrival of these last 9 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.940
 good attempts we can not dismiss it at 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.649
 butterfly can not no more so than 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.840
 she has for her one thing is she 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.819
 is on the rise so a period of 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.340
 much less well we had a doubt 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.880
 on his suitability for the big track the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.069
 doubt is lifted 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.420
 the reason is simple the mare took from 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.950
 the sebastian Sebastian force early on 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.600
 left a little time to mature 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.610
 and are now banking on the freshness 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.290
 proof is it stays on a success 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.750
 on this course and it's important 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.850
 and this goes back to a month and a half our 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.489
 tote for her the freshness a meeting 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.610
 it's important drivers September 14 pilots 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.079
 barefoot is better run hidden with 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.750
 she to spare her tip 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.730
 she can come tickle the mare kg 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.440
 with the battery I do not believe I 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.959
 think it can be the winning pair 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.459
 if you're lucky, we'll see if 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.109
 eric raffin agrees with you 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.650
 since arnaud lecomte was at his 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.120
 meet 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.890
 he tells us about the chances of number 15 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.170
 after rivers and the mini-terrain 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.310
 the ear 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.660
 eric raffin you are going to be the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.130
 living business partner that such 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.450
 Thursday in vincennes the mare is on a 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.580
 beautiful victory a month and a half ago 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.459
 this yeah that's right that line is very 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.709
 well where it takes commitments otherwise 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.690
 nothing competition is the same as in 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.150
 last place so again I think 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.980
 that she prefers to leave as soon as good 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.000
 combination of the quinté the course will do 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.630
 the difference for the victory 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.250
 possibly relatively short but 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:32.580
 continues to grow in August and plateau 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.930
 so it's a good guard on his part 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.640
 so we can even see her impose herself on 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.480
 again despite the monk neither of 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.830
 differences it's not an info that we've got it 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.019
 understood it's not an impossibility 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.500
 I take this opportunity to announce that we have 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.180
 met sebastien guarato 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.709
 our journalist david fricaud and that 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.650
 you will have very soon to 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.150
 report on paris turf.fr on 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.500
 Sebastian Guarato and especially by 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.209
 relation to the price of corncellor and the price 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.170
 of america we come back to our test 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.609
 the number 16 american ballet of america 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.019
 that's exactly our transition hand 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.760
 this is crazy is not least current 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.959
 since the fray but sometimes I'm amazed 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.370
 but hey we'll lead the race 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.140
 all these victories 3-2 then starts his 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.729
 career were acquired at three years 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.590
 since she collects the accessits 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.320
 but no victory it could 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.240
 to appear Thursday there is always missed the 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.550
 little more lately lately 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.289
 that the deferrer of the four he misses 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.030
 always the little more but the last 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.100
 time on 2100 it was still very 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.110
 well it's clear we come back from enough 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.940
 far a number in the second line and I 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.560
 liked as much his previous outings 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.840
 american bigard can not win 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.100
 but he's still missing the little trick 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.460
 admits the social lab defeat the 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.830
 compass 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.960
 but in the end it was much better 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.669
 why not I prefer him both 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.740
 mares his father of stone bishops and 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.990
 the dreamed by Eric raffin who I think 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.530
 often a better than she 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.390
 not a lot 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.669
 in the future I think that to go 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.620
 beat chef du chatelet the sea ​​is a 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.090
 other life a paper to age well 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.260
 Okay, we'll see that especially 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.639
 anthony barrier which will be his thriller 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.590
 is pretty confident I got him at 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.480
 phone just before the 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.820
 to do this show is rather the 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.200
 confidence in fourth position are going 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.140
 call again with the 14 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.670
 at the stage of somewhat disappointing louds 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.230
 at the beginning of the winter meeting 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.760
 especially knowing that laurent claude 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.840
 abrivard founded high hopes on 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.270
 she then what had told us this is a 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.560
 little my mare of the meeting 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.540
 since she caught up a little bit 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.670
 cannes it's true that he has something to be 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.680
 confident with it at least 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.380
 approaching the meeting but this sign of 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.960
 mans model cases are duly classy 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.130
 but go boiling his character 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.290
 often takes over 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.590
 again we go up the other day we 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.270
 did not see the first three 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.430
 must on your tickets of 5.5 this 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.290
 are the 3l is a class mare 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.850
 but it's definitely not a base one 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.440
 little about the photo anywhere go 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.030
 boiling is better let her do it 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.410
 she's going ahead that's why she 's 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.150
 a little better on 2100 she can 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.530
 to hold it is necessary to channel its ardor 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.630
 it's not obvious that it's driving 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.360
 it makes its value if we see the true 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.220
 aosta she finally deigns to trot is 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.250
 wise and go to the end she has her chance 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.480
 to paper an obvious now more 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.530
 in the reduced field that do not grant 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.970
 more poker game it will be understood 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.870
 a poker shot in fifth position 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.880
 number 8 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.680
 ardent duclos the still a mare of 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.510
 more regular she combines speed is 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.520
 kept well we are wary but here too 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.530
 really more for a place yes she 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.410
 is not déferré it will fair is rather 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.520
 lightly entrusted us matthieu abrivard 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.590
 will keep one of the men in shape he 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.200
 at the baraka three wins is that 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.760
 a few days it's his training the 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.420
 mare this is only his second outing 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.090
 of the meeting 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.510
 will probably not be at the top yet 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.580
 follow late January February why not 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.050
 on the side of a gain but there must be kept 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.520
 focus place because she proved 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.320
 that she was 2 that level while 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.490
 staying closed well bah listen we're going 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.710
 to follow you we understood we have three 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.790
 very solid bases and behind it's a 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.410
 little everyone with his little ones 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.070
 outsiders land at poker that's 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.900
 what to deserve 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.310
 ok thank you very much emmanuel mercier 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.630
