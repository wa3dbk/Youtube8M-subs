was killed
ouch<00:01:31.090> it<00:01:31.360> look<00:01:31.510> like<00:01:31.659> that<00:01:31.810> hurt<00:01:32.050> so<00:01:32.350> that's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
ouch it look like that hurt so that's

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.800 
ouch it look like that hurt so that's
one<00:01:33.159> of<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.280> configured<00:01:33.790> messages<00:01:34.240> obviously

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
one of the configured messages obviously

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.930 
one of the configured messages obviously
you<00:01:34.930> can<00:01:35.080> change<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.560> as<00:01:35.710> well<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.550> skill

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.480 
you can change that as well the skill
prefix<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:38.350> that's<00:01:38.560> why<00:01:38.710> it's<00:01:38.920> different<00:01:39.159> to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
prefix so that's why it's different to

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.210 
prefix so that's why it's different to
this<00:01:39.610> one<00:01:40.200> then<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.320> other<00:01:41.470> thing<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:42.070> can

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
can see you can't use that language on a

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.550 
can see you can't use that language on a
sign<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.040> that's<00:01:54.880> because<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.360> set<00:01:55.630> sign<00:01:56.020> says

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
sign and that's because I set sign says

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.289 
sign and that's because I set sign says
true<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.280> that<00:01:57.460> means<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.760> will<00:01:57.820> kick<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.180> if

the player was a noob or something like
that<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.080> think<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> really<00:03:07.769> good<00:03:07.920> a

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
that but I think this is a really good a

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.530 
that but I think this is a really good a
nice<00:03:08.280> where<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.519> plug<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.060> can<00:03:09.239> set<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
nice where I plug in you can set the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.390 
nice where I plug in you can set the
words<00:03:09.690> yourself<00:03:10.170> but<00:03:10.799> I<00:03:10.829> just<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.220> it

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
words yourself but I just like it

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.830 
words yourself but I just like it
because<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:11.850> configurable<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:12.600> you

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
because it's really configurable so you

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.990 
because it's really configurable so you
