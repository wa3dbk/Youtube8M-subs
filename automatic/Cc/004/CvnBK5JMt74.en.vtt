as we take a look at this low test we

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
as we take a look at this low test we
set<00:00:45.449> this<00:00:45.629> system<00:00:45.839> up<00:00:46.049> running<00:00:46.650> at<00:00:46.769> 2500<00:00:47.489> rpm

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
set this system up running at 2500 rpm

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.509 
set this system up running at 2500 rpm
which<00:00:48.720> is<00:00:48.900> approximately<00:00:49.229> 70<00:00:50.040> miles<00:00:50.220> per<00:00:50.369> hour

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519
