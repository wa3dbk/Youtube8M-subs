00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.039
 same time 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.039
 here 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.130
 it's a very lenient day 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.050
 I told myself on the bottom really what I want to work on what is 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.500
 which interests me on the bottom stop debt in stride in a 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.590
 mimicry were all responding 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.680
 pÃ©py and was then from two days rage I started to go 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.450
 about the questions that love me that fascinated me by telling me we wanted 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.350
 that all everything else any prejudice and religions of all 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.350
 refined 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:21.889
 yes I think that's what I had intuition that the bodies do not 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.189
 could not talk anymore 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.039
 chriseti was ready to talk 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.169
 makes Yemen speak of our day today 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:32.639
 so it's 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:36.899
 it was not really all the imagery of the dance or for all poutou 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:40.419
 aesthetics all the fairy side that attracted me not always I 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:42.099
 believe it's on the meaning 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.819
 in fact that I came to dance 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.809
 more and more anyway it's the 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:48.950
 it's about a topic 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.580
 is that it's a saying that at one point hand but not a purpose 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.890
 necessarily say well here we went back to earth the text and I think 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.169
 that this very solid team 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:02.029
 does not it have a hole it's not a theme like that it's a 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.519
 theme that more and more cited is clean my own in less 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.699
 on which graft 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:08.660
 % 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.680
 we have a little text since much could have been a lot 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.989
 on the contrary what painting goes on at a given moment of adjustment or if it 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.989
 she finds a field of intervention 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.379
 here and so the elements are grafted after overlay 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.719
 very complex layers I'm able I can use things 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.719
 extremely different because I think at one point 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.869
 they will help you in those hours where is a material you are a 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.869
 way to move forward 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.029
 2 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.029
 m 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.939
 it's good 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.939
 nothing 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.849
 rugby - world cup for everyone 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:47.930
 the mayor 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.930
 for her 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.629
 no 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:59.479
