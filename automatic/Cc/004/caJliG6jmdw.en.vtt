00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.450
 I have recently read my book . 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.250
 we have conquered here, nor did we 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.019
 just like on a cell phone in that first 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.019
 hour but has or has no law enforcement and 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:25.320
 yes for those who do not know and this type with 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 you reap 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:01:04.100
 well knows our athlete as 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100
 the flu 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:30.299
 the scene is that he is the suspect then you 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:33.479
 can choose who is the one in which 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.470
 all citizens in this range 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.470
 who sees when he looks 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.820
 He took off because 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:16.560
 the police arrived from the budget this morning 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:20.390
 with those who teach and do not get or china 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.390
 the other goalkeeper 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:35.480
 so the goose is so wins a start 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.359
 then it would be hard to get a little 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.359
 May 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:03:02.019
 the enem can not alexi barcelona can 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:11.939
 through better locking 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:15.639
 In this case , he takes the eye 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:28.689

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:36.480
 dollar paradise after naide was not the 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:40.500
 time of the house was to assume that 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.299
 spend so much is that it seems to me law 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:49.260
 also has to be as it is and 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.260
 if you meet now you will yes when 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.860
 so he claims that he is 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.860
 what you read on another team 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.450

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.849
