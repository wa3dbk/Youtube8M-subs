00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.789 

I<00:00:11.030> do<00:00:12.030> think<00:00:12.690> because<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.230> get<00:00:13.380> delayed<00:00:13.650> by<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
I do think because we get delayed by the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.310 
I do think because we get delayed by the
writers<00:00:14.160> strike<00:00:14.660> we<00:00:15.660> only<00:00:15.839> write<00:00:16.109> two

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
writers strike we only write two

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.200 
writers strike we only write two
episodes<00:00:16.710> at<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.920> time<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.460> we<00:00:17.490> respond<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
episodes at a time so we respond to the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.670 
episodes at a time so we respond to the
actors<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:18.840> how<00:00:18.960> they're<00:00:19.140> responding<00:00:19.500> to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
actors and see how they're responding to

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980 
actors and see how they're responding to
the<00:00:19.770> storylines<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.970> actors<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the storylines the actors with the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.960 
the storylines the actors with the
knowledge<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:23.070> guess<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.550> they<00:00:23.670> were<00:00:23.730> going

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
knowledge I guess that they were going

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.259 
knowledge I guess that they were going
to<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> full<00:00:24.930> 14<00:00:25.500> or<00:00:25.710> 15<00:00:26.070> months

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
to be going for a full 14 or 15 months

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.320 
to be going for a full 14 or 15 months
without<00:00:27.269> shutting<00:00:28.019> down<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:29.189> they<00:00:29.670> invested

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
without shutting down they they invested

this is what he told me he wants to take
a<00:03:00.440> character<00:03:01.310> from<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.420> milquetoast<00:03:03.040> mr.<00:03:04.040> chips

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
a character from a milquetoast mr. chips

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.599 
a character from a milquetoast mr. chips
kind<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.819> a<00:03:04.850> sweet<00:03:05.180> guy<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:06.410> Scarface<00:03:06.859> it's<00:03:07.459> a

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
kind of a sweet guy to Scarface it's a

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.690 
kind of a sweet guy to Scarface it's a
great<00:03:08.150> place<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.049> go<00:03:09.200> yeah<00:03:09.650> yeah<00:03:10.069> yeah<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.609> I'm

great place to go yeah yeah yeah and I'm

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.390 
great place to go yeah yeah yeah and I'm
thinking<00:03:11.329> how<00:03:11.690> is<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.049> possible<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:12.950> then

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
thinking how is that possible and then

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.309 
thinking how is that possible and then
he<00:03:13.579> created<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.209> set<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.540> circumstances<00:03:14.690> that

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
he created the set of circumstances that

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.580 
he created the set of circumstances that
lay<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.459> groundwork<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.630> is<00:03:17.930> possible

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
lay the groundwork that that is possible

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.979 
lay the groundwork that that is possible
and<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:18.829> just<00:03:19.040> have<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.420> carefully<00:03:20.420> navigate

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
and we just have to carefully navigate

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.780 
and we just have to carefully navigate
through<00:03:21.290> those<00:03:21.470> storylines<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.489> make<00:03:22.639> sure

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
through those storylines to make sure

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.520 
through those storylines to make sure
that<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.150> justified<00:03:23.510> all<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.959> way<00:03:24.109> and

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
that it's justified all the way and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.039 
that it's justified all the way and
you'll<00:03:25.250> start<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.609> see<00:03:25.700> it<00:03:25.880> he<00:03:26.510> starts<00:03:26.840> to
