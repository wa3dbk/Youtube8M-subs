00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.319
 most of the Chinese smartphones 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
 represent a few sensual 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.429
 products that can hardly 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.929
 interest modern buyer 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.299
 Of course attributed to this category meizu 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.070
 mx3 does not turn the language but still 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.800
 smartphone is not perfect and you will soon find out 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.720
 why with you dmitry project surgeon he and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.590
 Now I will name 5 reasons for which 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.830
 worth buying 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.599
 meizu mx3 reason number one design i 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.939
 I think for anyone will not be a revelation 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.880
 what meizu mx3 looks like an old iphone 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.649
 3g and many are repelled by this similarity but 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 it looks like an iphone means cheap 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.640
 Chinese fake gloss with no heel 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.920
 rounded edges single button 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 simple geometric shape on the front 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.789
 the panel is tightly associated with 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.579
 other products of the company from cupertino 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.989
 besides the above gloss is pretty 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.329
 brands that also can not be called 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.949
 body worth the only way 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.530
 somehow solve this lobov 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.360
 multi-colored back covers if question 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.340
 more bones probably donâ€™t solve it 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.379
 compare bright orange smartphone with 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.510
 products apple company can 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.549
 perhaps the most vehement apple fan 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.619
 reason number two is one inadequate 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.600
 technical solution those who have already watched 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.880
 our detailed review probably guessed 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 we are talking about the mechanism of opening the phone 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.619
 pick a cover for a small pick with a pick 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 hole and then another snaps off the panel 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.000
 not the easiest thing to do especially when 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 it happens the first time you are somewhere in 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.509
 ways in the absence of special 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.180
 tool at hand make it bare 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.829
 hands you certainly can not agree 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.409
 thanks to this technical solution 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.210
 managed to achieve chic solidity with 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.880
 the other side is the same samsung galaxy 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.920
 s4 is also well shot down but its cover 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.600
 removed much easier to the same can 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.640
 consider that under the hood is not waiting for us 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.860
 nothing but a micro sim card slot 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.479
 even this non-removable battery 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.490
 previous sentence follows 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.100
 the next reason for the lack of opportunity 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.689
 to expand the memory so it happened that we 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.700
 want to be free in all our 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.850
 making and when someone tries us 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.869
 limit we try to resist 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.670
 approximately the same situation with 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.500
 memory while buying a smartphone 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.680
 most of us surely know 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.270
 how much memory to him 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.790
 but we want to be able to 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.860
 expand storage if it is suddenly us 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.790
 will need this smartphone like 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.100
 many others 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.620
 this option has no reason number four 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.600
 work of third-party applications if with 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.730
 everyday programs all okay 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.260
 some games sometimes slow down though 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.660
 characteristics allow you to work 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.370
 ok but jaide trigger 2 and no 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.070
 not officially supported by the device 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.350
 although I get tired and carried away in the meantime to my 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.300
 surprise earned adequately well and 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.980
 last fifth reason refers not 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.410
 only to mx3 but to many others 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.090
 devices are biased towards 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.130
 products that are not just collected 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.550
 or made and completely made in 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.800
 China 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.930
 despite the existence of such giants 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.270
 in electronics like lenovo and huawei 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.400
 as well as small companies like xiaomi 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.230
 and meizu which produces top-notch 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.420
 equipment and sell it at a nice price 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.610
 Many still believe that the Chinese 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.800
 Darn only consumer goods precisely this 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.450
 leads to the fact that our hero and the like 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.700
 he does not have an ombre so big 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.650
 popularity despite the fact that its not 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.660
 Delivery must be listed on the fingers 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.000
 one hand now you know five reasons 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.890
 on which you should not buy the mxt base 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.900
