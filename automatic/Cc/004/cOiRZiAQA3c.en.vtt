00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.370
 before you have to build your computer 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.490
 They first open their housing for theirs 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.730
 entire hardware is indeed in the housing 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.490
 built-in 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.990
 not every housing can be at the same 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.910
 to be opened 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.689
 That's why I have here once 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.880
 different computer or 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.519
 computer case built around them the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.210
 to show different variants 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.349
 our endeavor is now this side wall 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.070
 to remove 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.670
 with many computer housings the leads 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.090
 away on the back panel of the computer on 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.399
 At first glance, all the housings look 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:48.570
 apart from the size from behind 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.199
 Immediately check out first 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.500
 the side wall as in this case one 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:00.719
 unit with the top forms or whether 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.140
 you like this is separate on the sides 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.570
 the back wall is screwed 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.780
 which the framed side wall with 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.930
 we connect as a frame 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.530
 first this housing to a common 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.970
 representatives for minitower first 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.070
 all four screws are loosened 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.900
 then pull the disguise 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.900
 towards the back wall 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.710
 then lift the fairing 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.140
 this page up a bit and pull it 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.450
 to himself now can the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.180
 cladding completely removed to the top 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.980
 become 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.670
 The principle is similar in these 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:55.290
 housings according to the size of the housing 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.560
 there are two or three 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.050
 screw on each side 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.590
 Again, this is the first of these 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.420
 to loosen screws 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.619
 then the side wall must be in the direction of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.080
 pulled back wall you will see that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.200
 at this purposes a depression in 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.300
 the side wall is located while with you 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.850
 the one hand, deeper clothes to himself 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.520
 you should pull with the other hand 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.340
 the housing has held the 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.620
 solved hang with help 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.400
 The second hand is the disguise 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.400
 their anchoring 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.920
 Following the same principle is the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:45.019
 other side wall attaches something different 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.019
 the opening takes place in this housing 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.400
 they do not see that this over the 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.660
 known screws on the back 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:01.380
 has only one up here 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.200
 inconspicuous screw but exactly this 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.500
 screw is the key to the inner 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.959
 of the housing, loosen the screw like that 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.060
 you will notice that the 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.600
 upper part in the direction of the back wall 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.780
 move and then remove 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.780
 leaves 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.989
 These four elevations suggest how 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.620
 it continues 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.780
 The side walls must be solved in this way 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.940
 because this is difficult with bare hands 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.480
 possible to help cut 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.730
 screwdrivers and these recesses 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.680
 The side wall is through the lever 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.680
 pressed over these elevations 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.890
 then the side wall can be folded down 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.710
 be through the refined locking 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.260
 on the ground, it is only in the unfolded 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.860
 condition possible the side wall too 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.040
 remove and free access to the inner 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.810
 of the computer 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.820
 due to the versatility of the housing 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.890
 I can not do all in this lesson 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.940
 possibilities for opening a housing 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.100
 show 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.400
 In some cases, first the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.880
 front or the top solved 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.060
 become 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.430
 But there are also some of the housing 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.920
 bottom can be opened 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.770
 in any case is thoughtful and 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.190
 beware of opening the housing 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.560
 to approach 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.260
 they should not be sure how 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.420
 Opening her housing is her turn 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.860
 contact the dealer of the 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.860
 has sold housing
