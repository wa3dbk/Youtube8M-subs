September<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.760> style<00:00:02.760> month<00:00:03.200> this<00:00:04.200> month

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
September is style month this month

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.940 
September is style month this month
we're<00:00:05.370> gonna<00:00:05.520> talk<00:00:05.819> about<00:00:05.850> sound<00:00:06.509> design

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
we're gonna talk about sound design

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.900 
we're gonna talk about sound design
originally<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.130> were<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.460> talk<00:00:08.610> about

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
originally we were going to talk about

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.930 
originally we were going to talk about
the<00:00:09.420> exhaust<00:00:09.870> system<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.530> Fiesta<00:00:11.040> but

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the exhaust system on the Fiesta but

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.669 
the exhaust system on the Fiesta but
instead<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:13.110> are<00:00:13.230> they<00:00:13.290> talking<00:00:13.440> about

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
instead what are they talking about

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.450 
instead what are they talking about
something<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.950> little<00:00:14.130> more<00:00:14.160> interesting

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
something a little more interesting

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.519 
something a little more interesting
we're<00:00:15.269> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> talk<00:00:15.630> about<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.139> sounds

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
we're going to talk about the sounds

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.580 
we're going to talk about the sounds
imposed<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.640> Fiesta<00:00:18.090> ST<00:00:18.260> so<00:00:19.260> we're<00:00:19.439> going

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
imposed on the Fiesta ST so we're going

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.880 
imposed on the Fiesta ST so we're going
to<00:00:19.830> SVT<00:00:20.789> at<00:00:21.090> Ford<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> we're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> talk

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
to SVT at Ford and we're going to talk

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.040 
to SVT at Ford and we're going to talk
to<00:00:23.010> some<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.310> engineers<00:00:23.730> about<00:00:24.240> how<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
to some of the engineers about how the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.910 
to some of the engineers about how the
sounds<00:00:25.500> impose<00:00:25.859> our<00:00:26.099> works<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.359> Fiesta<00:00:27.810> ST

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
sounds impose our works on the Fiesta ST

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.669 
sounds impose our works on the Fiesta ST
the<00:00:28.920> way<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.279> did<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.570> was<00:00:30.679> probably

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the way that we did that was probably

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.440 
the way that we did that was probably
something<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.189> most<00:00:32.969> people<00:00:33.270> wouldn't

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
something that most people wouldn't

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.080 
something that most people wouldn't
expect<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:34.860> necessarily<00:00:35.700> by<00:00:35.820> using

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
expect but it's not necessarily by using

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.020 
expect but it's not necessarily by using
the<00:00:36.600> exhaust<00:00:36.989> system<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.190> enhancing<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the exhaust system and enhancing the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.090 
the exhaust system and enhancing the
tailpipe<00:00:39.420> noise<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:40.440> make<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.680> sound<00:00:40.829> more

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
tailpipe noise to make it sound more

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.819 
tailpipe noise to make it sound more
like<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> performance<00:00:41.579> car<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.590> rather<00:00:43.590> what

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
like a performance car but rather what

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.209 
like a performance car but rather what
we<00:00:43.860> did<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.340> took<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.739> noise<00:00:46.739> coming<00:00:47.070> out

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
we did is we took the noise coming out

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.319 
we did is we took the noise coming out
of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> front<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> engine<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
of the front of the engine or the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.069 
of the front of the engine or the
induction<00:00:49.190> which<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.340> shown<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> we're

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
induction which is shown here and we're

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.340 
induction which is shown here and we're
taking<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.890> induction<00:00:53.520> noise<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.969> now

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
taking that induction noise and now

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.939 
taking that induction noise and now
re-plumbing<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.530> back<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.270> cabin<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
re-plumbing it back into the cabin and

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.799 
re-plumbing it back into the cabin and
as<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.640> plumbing<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.059> back<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> cabin

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
as we're plumbing it back into the cabin

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.360 
as we're plumbing it back into the cabin
we<00:01:00.930> put<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> through<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.890> device<00:01:02.190> that's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
we put it through the device that's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.000 
we put it through the device that's
called<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.789> sound<00:01:03.120> symposia<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:04.559> takes<00:01:04.860> that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
called a sound symposia which takes that

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
called a sound symposia which takes that
noise<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.610> shapes<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.320> we're

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
noise and shapes it so that we're

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.670 
noise and shapes it so that we're
getting<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:07.979> sound<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.900> that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
getting the right sound out of that that

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
getting the right sound out of that that
raw<00:01:10.979> signature<00:01:11.810> we<00:01:12.810> achieve<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.430> by<00:01:14.430> using

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
raw signature we achieve that by using

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.969 
raw signature we achieve that by using
the<00:01:14.939> sound<00:01:15.330> simpler<00:01:15.990> device<00:01:16.350> which<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.799> kind

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the sound simpler device which is kind

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.399 
the sound simpler device which is kind
of<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.939> seesaw<00:01:18.450> type<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.990> device

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
of like a little seesaw type of device

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.170 
of like a little seesaw type of device
where<00:01:19.740> pulsation<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.700> coming<00:01:20.939> from<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
where pulsation is coming from the

flapping<00:01:24.210> back<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.780> forth<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.500> output

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
flapping back and forth and the output

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.070

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
engine noise which is being passed to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.630 
engine noise which is being passed to
the<00:01:33.509> cabinet<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.979> valve<00:01:35.369> body

the cabinet that's that's the valve body
right<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.450> kind<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> look<00:01:37.079> at

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
right there and this is kind of look at

right there and this is kind of look at
the<00:01:37.259> interior<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:39.090> shake<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the interior of it so we shake the

characteristic<00:01:43.340> filter<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.860> after<00:01:46.860> we

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
characteristic filter so after we

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.460 
characteristic filter so after we
generate<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.090> sound<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:49.020> have<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.259> figure

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
generate that sound we have to figure

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.499 
generate that sound we have to figure
out<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> way<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> plumb<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:51.119> into<00:01:51.360> the

this particular application went up to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.319 
this particular application went up to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
the Fiesta

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.580 
the Fiesta
it's<00:02:12.800> actually<00:02:13.370> about<00:02:13.700> 12<00:02:14.210> dB<00:02:14.930> come<00:02:15.530> on

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
it's actually about 12 dB come on

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.890 
it's actually about 12 dB come on
zombies<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.130> it's<00:02:16.730> pretty<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:17.750> is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
zombies it it's pretty this is this is

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.430 
zombies it it's pretty this is this is
from<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.260> focus<00:02:19.420> 1.6<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.780> application

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
from the focus 1.6 but the application

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.560 
from the focus 1.6 but the application
of<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.680> Fiesta<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.340> it's<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.330> little<00:02:23.390> bit

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
of the Fiesta it's it's a little bit

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.450 
of the Fiesta it's it's a little bit
over<00:02:23.780> 12<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.590> it's<00:02:24.770> a<00:02:24.830> pretty<00:02:25.130> big<00:02:25.310> difference

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
over 12 so it's a pretty big difference

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.090 
over 12 so it's a pretty big difference
you'll<00:02:25.880> hear<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.240> play<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.960> sound<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.380> I'll

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
you'll hear that play the sound so I'll

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.320 
you'll hear that play the sound so I'll
go<00:02:28.220> ahead<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.460> play<00:02:28.610> these<00:02:28.730> two<00:02:29.000> different

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
go ahead and play these two different

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.480 
go ahead and play these two different
sound<00:02:29.510> cuts<00:02:29.780> for<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.170> okay<00:02:30.530> with<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.190> without

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
sound cuts for you okay with and without

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.940 
sound cuts for you okay with and without
the<00:02:31.910> simple<00:02:32.480> alright<00:02:32.900> until<00:02:33.260> what<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> sounds

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
the simple alright until what the sounds

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.180 
the simple alright until what the sounds
like<00:02:34.990> alright<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:39.190> wide

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
like alright so this is the the wide

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.210 
like alright so this is the the wide
open<00:02:40.430> throttle<00:02:40.610> case<00:02:41.920> first

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
open throttle case first

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:58.630 
open throttle case first
without<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:44.330> imposer<00:02:53.620> that's<00:02:54.620> without<00:02:54.850> okay

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.839 

and<00:02:58.970> this<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.390> with

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:13.800 

I'll<00:03:06.360> toggle<00:03:06.810> back<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.110> forth

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.040 

all<00:03:14.810> right<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.760> next<00:03:17.060> condition<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
all right the next condition is the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.320 
all right the next condition is the
going<00:03:18.980> into<00:03:19.280> wide<00:03:19.430> open<00:03:19.700> throttle<00:03:19.880> this<00:03:20.180> is

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
going into wide open throttle this is

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.320 
going into wide open throttle this is
from<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.600> kind<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.959> steady<00:03:21.200> state<00:03:21.319> cruise<00:03:21.890> at

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
from a kind of a steady state cruise at

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.210 
from a kind of a steady state cruise at
3500<00:03:23.330> rpm<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:24.110> Matt<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.500> gas<00:03:24.680> okay

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
3500 rpm and you just Matt the gas okay

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.050 
3500 rpm and you just Matt the gas okay
okay<00:03:26.030> so<00:03:26.090> first<00:03:27.020> case<00:03:27.230> is<00:03:27.880> without<00:03:28.880> this

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
okay so first case is without this

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.600 
okay so first case is without this
imposer

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
imposer

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:41.699 
imposer
sorry<00:03:31.760> what's<00:03:32.000> with<00:03:37.660> now<00:03:38.660> we'll<00:03:38.810> take<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.080> away

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.990 

and<00:03:42.709> that's<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.190> pretty<00:03:43.370> big<00:03:43.580> difference<00:03:43.700> in

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
and that's a pretty big difference in

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:58.229 
and that's a pretty big difference in
there<00:03:44.150> that's<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.720> real<00:03:44.989> big<00:03:45.200> difference<00:03:56.709> and

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
there that's a real big difference and

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.210 
there that's a real big difference and
this<00:03:59.239> is<00:03:59.390> kind<00:03:59.569> of<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.720> same<00:03:59.980> picture<00:04:00.980> we<00:04:01.100> were

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
this is kind of the same picture we were

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.370 
this is kind of the same picture we were
looking<00:04:01.430> at<00:04:01.519> before<00:04:01.630> it's<00:04:02.630> just<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.989> spectral

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
looking at before it's just the spectral

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:19.340 
looking at before it's just the spectral
content<00:04:03.560> okay<00:04:04.310> and<00:04:04.660> play<00:04:05.660> this<00:04:05.870> as<00:04:06.050> well

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.190 

so<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.370> can<00:04:20.520> see<00:04:20.700> I've<00:04:20.910> got<00:04:21.300> a<00:04:21.360> filter<00:04:21.780> applied

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
so you can see I've got a filter applied

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.570 
so you can see I've got a filter applied
right<00:04:22.770> here<00:04:23.210> which<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.240> kind<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.780> same

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
right here which is kind of the same

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.060 
right here which is kind of the same
frequency<00:04:26.580> as<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.650> symposium<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.860> some

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
frequency as the symposium to some

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.980 
frequency as the symposium to some
effectively<00:04:29.910> taking<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.360> out<00:04:30.450> petition<00:04:30.810> it

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
effectively taking it out petition it

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.840 
effectively taking it out petition it
but<00:04:31.470> you<00:04:31.560> can<00:04:31.680> see<00:04:31.890> where<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.310> opposers

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
but you can see where this opposers

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.000 
but you can see where this opposers
applying<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.050> sound<00:04:34.320> right<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:34.680> this<00:04:34.800> band

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
applying the sound right in this band

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.460 
applying the sound right in this band
right<00:04:35.370> here<00:04:35.520> okay<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:37.080> almost

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
right here okay and it's almost

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.220 
right here okay and it's almost
throughout<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:38.010> entire<00:04:38.310> rpm<00:04:38.760> range<00:04:39.230> where

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
throughout the entire rpm range where

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.970 
throughout the entire rpm range where
it's<00:04:40.460> enhancing<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.580> sound<00:04:42.440> so<00:04:43.440> play<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:43.830> one

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
it's enhancing the sound so play it one

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.590 
it's enhancing the sound so play it one
more<00:04:44.160> time

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:05:08.750 

with<00:04:49.600> it

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.670 

yeah<00:05:09.760> it<00:05:09.940> makes<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.210> pretty<00:05:10.450> big<00:05:10.510> pretty<00:05:11.440> big

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
yeah it makes a pretty big pretty big

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.800 
yeah it makes a pretty big pretty big
difference<00:05:12.070> when<00:05:12.310> you<00:05:12.520> um<00:05:12.760> you<00:05:13.570> know<00:05:13.660> between

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
difference when you um you know between

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.220 
difference when you um you know between
when<00:05:14.140> it's<00:05:14.290> on<00:05:14.440> and<00:05:14.740> when<00:05:15.490> it's<00:05:15.640> off<00:05:15.850> yeah<00:05:16.240> and

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
when it's on and when it's off yeah and

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.600 
when it's on and when it's off yeah and
really<00:05:17.470> across<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.740> whole<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.460> whole

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
really across the whole the whole

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.530 
really across the whole the whole
spectrum<00:05:19.260> really<00:05:20.260> doesn't<00:05:20.530> have<00:05:20.620> fire<00:05:20.830> yeah

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
spectrum really doesn't have fire yeah

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.910 
spectrum really doesn't have fire yeah
yeah<00:05:22.540> I<00:05:22.570> mean<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.960> biggest<00:05:23.410> difference<00:05:23.830> I

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
yeah I mean the biggest difference I

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.260 
yeah I mean the biggest difference I
think<00:05:23.950> is<00:05:24.190> just<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.550> what<00:05:25.000> we<00:05:25.090> call

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
think is just the what we call

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.380 
think is just the what we call
responsiveness<00:05:26.110> just<00:05:26.620> when<00:05:27.190> you<00:05:27.340> feel<00:05:27.670> the

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
responsiveness just when you feel the

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.570 
responsiveness just when you feel the
acceleration<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:29.230> you're<00:05:29.350> you're<00:05:30.040> launching

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
acceleration and you're you're launching

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.200 
acceleration and you're you're launching
right<00:05:30.760> if<00:05:30.910> I'm<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.240> steady<00:05:31.810> state<00:05:32.080> speed

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
right if I'm a steady state speed

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.700 
right if I'm a steady state speed
there's<00:05:34.210> no<00:05:34.420> like<00:05:34.750> audible<00:05:35.140> feedback<00:05:35.290> or

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
there's no like audible feedback or

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.650 
there's no like audible feedback or
minimal<00:05:36.070> audible<00:05:36.460> feedback<00:05:36.610> but<00:05:37.480> if<00:05:37.570> it

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
minimal audible feedback but if it

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.270 
minimal audible feedback but if it
sounds<00:05:38.020> louder<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.650> that<00:05:38.740> matches<00:05:39.160> the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
sounds louder and that matches the

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.220 
sounds louder and that matches the
acceleration<00:05:39.910> rate<00:05:40.090> then<00:05:40.720> it<00:05:40.840> just<00:05:40.960> makes<00:05:41.080> you

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
acceleration rate then it just makes you

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.780 
acceleration rate then it just makes you
want<00:05:41.380> to<00:05:41.470> push<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.740> car<00:05:41.920> harder<00:05:42.340> and<00:05:42.490> it's<00:05:42.610> fun

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
want to push the car harder and it's fun

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.180 
want to push the car harder and it's fun
to<00:05:42.970> drive<00:05:43.180> so<00:05:44.020> that's<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.470> whole<00:05:44.590> reason<00:05:44.980> for

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
to drive so that's the whole reason for

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.880 
to drive so that's the whole reason for
this<00:05:45.430> it's<00:05:45.870> just<00:05:46.870> to<00:05:47.380> enhance<00:05:47.650> the<00:05:47.830> experience

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
this it's just to enhance the experience

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.310 
this it's just to enhance the experience
and<00:05:48.520> kind<00:05:48.610> of<00:05:48.730> connect<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.180> driver<00:05:49.480> to<00:05:50.290> the

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
and kind of connect the driver to the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.050 
and kind of connect the driver to the
performance<00:05:50.830> characteristics<00:05:51.490> of<00:05:51.640> vehicle

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
performance characteristics of vehicle

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:00.150 
performance characteristics of vehicle
okay

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.220
