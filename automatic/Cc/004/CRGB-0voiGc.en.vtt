00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.270
 ae 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:30.289
 jorge me and I have not a mall 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.289
 louis 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.520
 O 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.310
 Back to the master here in the video 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.610
 today is very cool cm play 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.230
 I got it, it does not work right now 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.480
 was at the beginning of the month that 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.580
 I got where 100 in the session. 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.310
 I was really happy because the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.220
 More or less gameplay I had to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.500
 term now my memory does not fail 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.830
 I know if it was 11 or 12 hours 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.820
 I got the gameplay in exactly the same 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.410
 day in the same 24 hours in the first 24 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 Hours I got this gameplay. 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.470
 It was kind of like that, I started to 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.390
 play five o'clock in the morning there today until 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:41.690
 It's past 6:30 and pause and I'm back. 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.880
 half a day and a half day 11 and 40 kind 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.970
 Then I started to come back and 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.110
 7 am to 5 p.m. until midnight 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.979
 I got this game play and I did not do the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:01.259
 bills now if you want it was well worth it was the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.450
 The strategy used was that of JosÃ© 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.660
 is the fastest strategy of ascension 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.170
 the more kind she is the middleman 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.170
 She is a little quick and she is not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.760
 so risky but of course she has a 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.280
 Her interest is a bit dangerous. 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.440
 depending on a zombie if you also have to 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.740
 stay connected with one for example the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.900
 certain barriers have been loaded with two 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.900
 barriers you can see in the same zoom 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.520
 more in-depth later on the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.930
 This map's strategy is me if I did 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.780
 that up for example is an ep and mats 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 wilander gets too damn long 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:52.440
 and 16 hours doing this, but of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.700
 very high round of this kind is that 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.080
 I do not have the patience and so 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.090
 availability of time to make the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.560
 This is a game so I took one day 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.210
 I said I will not book that day for 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.640
 do that 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.560
 This game left, but only 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.660
 previously I had died on the street of 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.020
 86 and 89 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.290
 is the risk was still learning to 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:21.270
 make a strategy there put me there 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.280
 I really understood how it really does 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.810
 Do you understand how you do it? 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.460
 and also to show the pros who 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:33.960
 I think it is never how the guy 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.690
 says that there was a friend of mine years and is 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.430
 Works do not know how to judge men, right? 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.640
 I also really do not know how to play the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:45.030
 trash but I am also no myth of 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.880
 men, it 's also an exaggeration, but it's 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.720
 only a player like that is normal right 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.830
 a player who is at least 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.750
 the men connected 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.090
 Of course some maps to a background 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.610
 that others have already tried or 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.740
 trying to learn shangri there and I just 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.640
 I'm fucking I'm getting very 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.980
 embolado 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.380
 it's also seems like I know there baby wins 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.070
 Harder to take in the box I never saw 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.220
 that 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.950
 I think it's just me that I've never seen 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.020
 Somebody take the round 15 down but the 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.450
 Life is like that, man, do what I 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.810
 I'm thinking I was going to try to fulfill my 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.790
 masters in chile only it 's just that now 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.520
 this August to run out of time 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.250
 because of studies or as always 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.740
 days upset with the men's channel 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.360
 But it's only life for the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.030
 that the commentary will end here is 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.790
 I just wanted to say what I did. 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:49.410
 I 'll try to get you there. 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.490
 company bell maps of front and geldof 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.710
 alive 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.710
 I've trained a little risk anything too 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.820
 I tried that map to get a world is 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:03.140
 cairo where there for the 55 and 57 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.140
 I had never caught 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.910
 It was only then it was still connected. 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.000
 a long way back and also 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.060
 now in the semester I learned how to 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.980
 What to do correctly to try? 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.510
 more than 80 maybe 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.180
 well I see it's just thank you 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.070
 by works the visualization of sites and 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.830
 liked it and even a channel for more 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.830
 videos of the men so it was said
