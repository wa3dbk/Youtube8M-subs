is included by default with a buncha and
you<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.820> use<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.390> find<00:00:31.230> what's<00:00:32.070> using<00:00:32.489> most

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
you can use it to find what's using most

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.290 
you can use it to find what's using most
of<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.120> hard<00:00:33.809> drive<00:00:34.050> space<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:35.880> start<00:00:36.180> it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
of your hard drive space and to start it

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.410 
of your hard drive space and to start it
you<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.690> go<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> applications<00:00:37.890> accessories

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
you just go to applications accessories

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.889 
you just go to applications accessories
and<00:00:39.980> disk<00:00:40.980> usage<00:00:41.420> analyzer<00:00:44.239> okay<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.300> once<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and disk usage analyzer okay so once you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.130 
and disk usage analyzer okay so once you
launch<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.410> get<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.680> window<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
launch it you get this window here and

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.990 
launch it you get this window here and
you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> top<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.309> have<00:00:50.789> some

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
you can see on the top you have some

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.389 
you can see on the top you have some
options<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.199> scan<00:00:52.649> home<00:00:52.890> scanned

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
options here you have scan home scanned

file system scan folder and scan remote

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.439 
file system scan folder and scan remote
folder<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:58.620> if<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.489> want<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> find<00:00:59.940> out<00:01:00.149> what's

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
folder now if I want to find out what's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.240 
folder now if I want to find out what's
using<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.710> lot<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:02.789> hard<00:01:03.180> drive<00:01:03.449> space<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
using a lot of my hard drive space I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.330 
using a lot of my hard drive space I
probably<00:01:05.250> would<00:01:05.580> want<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.880> scan<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:08.070> file

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
probably would want to scan the file

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.700 
probably would want to scan the file
system<00:01:08.610> which<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.240> my<00:01:09.810> home<00:01:09.990> directory<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
system which is my home directory and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.300 
system which is my home directory and
everything<00:01:11.070> else<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.130> just

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
everything else so to do that you just

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.990 
everything else so to do that you just
click<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.960> should<00:01:16.020> take<00:01:16.470> some<00:01:16.740> time

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
click it and it should take some time

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.620 
click it and it should take some time
while<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.390> searches<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.850> files<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.540> are

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
while it searches for the files that are

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:31.880 
while it searches for the files that are
in<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.229> hard<00:01:22.500> drive

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.530 

so<00:01:32.890> let's<00:01:33.400> just<00:01:33.670> give<00:01:33.820> it<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:34.090> little<00:01:34.330> bit<00:01:34.480> of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
so let's just give it a little bit of

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.030 
so let's just give it a little bit of
time<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:36.240> once<00:01:37.240> it's<00:01:37.450> done<00:01:37.720> we'll<00:01:38.590> be<00:01:38.740> able<00:01:38.860> to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
time and once it's done we'll be able to

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.530 
time and once it's done we'll be able to
see<00:01:40.380> percentages<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.790> each<00:01:42.790> one<00:01:43.300> of<00:01:43.330> these

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
see percentages of each one of these

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.640 
see percentages of each one of these
directories<00:01:44.400> ok<00:01:45.400> so<00:01:45.460> it's<00:01:45.760> done<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.330> as<00:01:46.930> you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
directories ok so it's done and as you

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.800 
directories ok so it's done and as you
can<00:01:47.830> see<00:01:47.860> on<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.730> left<00:01:48.970> here<00:01:49.210> we<00:01:49.360> have<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.540> list

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
can see on the left here we have a list

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.850 
can see on the left here we have a list
of<00:01:50.080> all<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.980> directories<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.880> files<00:01:52.480> in<00:01:53.050> this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
of all the directories and files in this

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.940 
of all the directories and files in this
hard<00:01:54.100> drive<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.960> also<00:01:55.960> on<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.500> right<00:01:56.680> side

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
hard drive and also on the right side

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.880 
hard drive and also on the right side
you<00:01:56.980> can<00:01:57.400> see<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.610> there<00:01:57.940> is<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.180> graphical

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you can see that there is a graphical

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.930 
you can see that there is a graphical
representation<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.160> data<00:02:01.830> now<00:02:02.830> as<00:02:03.760> you

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
representation of that data now as you

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.570 
representation of that data now as you
can<00:02:04.090> see<00:02:04.150> here<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.460> root<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.810> root

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
can see here we have the root the root

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.640 
can see here we have the root the root
which<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.840> everything<00:02:10.840> on<00:02:11.020> this<00:02:11.320> hard<00:02:11.590> drive

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
which is everything on this hard drive

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
which is everything on this hard drive
and<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.260> see<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.709> next<00:02:14.950> thing<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.250> home

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
and you can see the next thing is home

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.320 
and you can see the next thing is home
which<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.660> my<00:02:16.930> home<00:02:17.170> directory<00:02:18.209> even<00:02:19.209> though

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
which is my home directory even though

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.720 
which is my home directory even though
it's<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.690> it's<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.230> separate<00:02:20.680> partition<00:02:21.370> it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
it's a it's a separate partition it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.470 
it's a it's a separate partition it
shows<00:02:22.240> it<00:02:22.450> here<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:23.820> even<00:02:24.820> if<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.300> have<00:02:25.450> a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
shows it here so even if you have a

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.630 
shows it here so even if you have a
different<00:02:25.900> part<00:02:26.440> by<00:02:26.800> different<00:02:27.160> partitions

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
different part by different partitions

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.140 
different part by different partitions
for<00:02:27.850> different<00:02:29.130> directories<00:02:30.130> you'll<00:02:30.880> still

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
for different directories you'll still

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.520 
for different directories you'll still
be<00:02:31.270> able<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.510> see<00:02:31.750> them<00:02:31.930> here<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:33.250> here<00:02:34.530> we

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
be able to see them here and here we

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.270 
be able to see them here and here we
have<00:02:35.560> home<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.820> can<00:02:36.970> see<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:37.510> a

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
have home and you can see that it's a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.000 
have home and you can see that it's a
83.4<00:02:39.280> percent<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.330> used<00:02:40.510> space<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.709> my

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
83.4 percent of the used space so my

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.240 
83.4 percent of the used space so my
home<00:02:42.190> directory<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:43.120> using<00:02:43.570> most<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.930> my<00:02:44.250> hard

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
home directory is using most of my hard

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.990 
home directory is using most of my hard
drive<00:02:45.489> space<00:02:45.640> or<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.660> used<00:02:47.019> hard<00:02:47.290> drive<00:02:47.500> space

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
drive space or the used hard drive space

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.310 
drive space or the used hard drive space
and<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.610> want<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:51.910> see<00:02:52.060> what's<00:02:52.300> using<00:02:52.810> most

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
and so I want to see what's using most

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.590 
and so I want to see what's using most
of<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.709> space<00:02:54.160> in<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.430> home<00:02:54.760> directory<00:02:55.239> so

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
of that space in that home directory so

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.280 
of that space in that home directory so

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
thing about the graphical representation

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.060 
thing about the graphical representation
here<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:20.730> if<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:22.090> hover<00:03:22.299> on<00:03:22.690> each<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.860> these

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
that graphical representation

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.580 
that graphical representation
so<00:03:44.980> now<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:45.340> know<00:03:45.550> what<00:03:46.180> each<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.900> those<00:03:47.050> colors

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590

so now I know what each of those colors
and<00:03:48.120> those<00:03:49.120> parts<00:03:49.570> are<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:52.030> can<00:03:52.180> go<00:03:52.360> even

and those parts are and you can go even

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.180 
and those parts are and you can go even
more<00:03:52.810> details<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.620> like<00:03:54.040> if<00:03:54.420> my<00:03:55.420> pictures<00:03:55.870> here

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
more details so like if my pictures here

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.240 
more details so like if my pictures here
if<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.250> expand<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:58.030> or<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:58.990> click<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.470> you<00:04:00.100> can

if I expand that or I click it you can
see<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.640> representation<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:02.140> now

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
see that the representation is now

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.450 
see that the representation is now
represented<00:04:03.100> in<00:04:03.340> just<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.940> pictures<00:04:04.330> and<00:04:05.460> you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
doing earlier you just hover over each

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.550 
doing earlier you just hover over each
of<00:04:12.280> these<00:04:12.460> and<00:04:13.020> it'll<00:04:14.020> tell<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.350> what

directories those colors are

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.300 
directories those colors are
representing<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.230> can<00:04:23.410> even<00:04:23.860> go<00:04:24.040> to<00:04:24.100> a

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
representing so you can even go to a

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.610 
representing so you can even go to a
folder<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.210> it'll<00:04:25.930> tell<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.260> how<00:04:26.290> much
