00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
hi guys converse on the right and this

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.240 
hi guys converse on the right and this
game<00:00:03.810> is<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.020> ZBZ<00:00:04.710> on<00:00:05.100> Python<00:00:06.200> and<00:00:07.250> I'm

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
game is a ZBZ on Python and I'm

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.459 
game is a ZBZ on Python and I'm
wondering<00:00:08.730> if<00:00:08.910> Isis<00:00:09.150> are<00:00:09.269> saying<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:10.260> game

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
wondering if Isis are saying this game

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.770 
wondering if Isis are saying this game
is<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.650> starcraft<00:00:11.219> one<00:00:11.490> game<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:12.059> pipe<00:00:12.540> down<00:00:12.570> or

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
is a starcraft one game on pipe down or

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.980 
is a starcraft one game on pipe down or
not<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:13.799> I'm<00:00:14.400> assuming<00:00:14.870> everyone<00:00:15.870> that

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
not but I'm assuming everyone that

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.269 
not but I'm assuming everyone that
watches<00:00:16.109> my<00:00:16.320> videos<00:00:16.350> can<00:00:16.920> differentiate

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
watches my videos can differentiate

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.029 
watches my videos can differentiate
between<00:00:17.580> stark<00:00:18.000> f1<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.390> starcraft<00:00:18.750> 2<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.170> if

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
between stark f1 and starcraft 2 and if

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.980 
between stark f1 and starcraft 2 and if
you<00:00:20.130> can't<00:00:20.490> then<00:00:21.470> you<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:23.279> some<00:00:23.460> problems

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
you can't then you have some problems

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.609 
you can't then you have some problems
straight<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.369> ok<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:27.210> game<00:00:27.449> ok<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.050> right

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
straight up ok so this game ok so right

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.169 
straight up ok so this game ok so right
now<00:00:28.680> most<00:00:29.340> important<00:00:29.730> thing<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.000> know

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
now most important thing is to know

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.970 
now most important thing is to know
right<00:00:30.359> now<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.869> both<00:00:31.109> scattered<00:00:31.679> each<00:00:31.800> other

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
right now we both scattered each other

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.910 
right now we both scattered each other
first<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.510> pretty<00:00:33.780> much<00:00:33.989> means<00:00:34.320> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
first now this pretty much means that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.959 
first now this pretty much means that
your<00:00:35.760> build<00:00:36.059> order<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.200> totally

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
your build order is going to be totally

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.119 
your build order is going to be totally
depicted<00:00:38.969> by<00:00:39.239> their<00:00:39.450> build<00:00:39.660> order<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.320> now

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
depicted by their build order like now

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.350 
depicted by their build order like now
that<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.430> both<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.820> kind<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.239> have

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
that we both it's kind of like you have

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.670 
that we both it's kind of like you have
vision<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.840> other<00:00:43.020> person<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.530> you're

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
vision on the other person so you're

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
vision on the other person so you're
trying<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> make<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> best<00:00:44.190> counter<00:00:45.030> build

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
trying to make the best counter build

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.900 
trying to make the best counter build
order<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.660> their<00:00:45.809> boat<00:00:46.020> build<00:00:46.500> order<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.190> so

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
order to their boat build order and so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.000 
order to their boat build order and so
what<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.750> usually<00:00:49.110> means<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.860> get

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
what this usually means is that you get

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.150 
what this usually means is that you get
your<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.730> generally<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.360> top<00:00:51.600> hatch<00:00:52.160> because

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
your you generally go top hatch because

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.130 
your you generally go top hatch because
both<00:00:53.370> players<00:00:53.670> note<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.149> say<00:00:54.629> people<00:00:54.930> nine

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
both players note that say people nine

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
both players note that say people nine
pool<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.620> counter<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.039> over<00:00:56.430> pool<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> go

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
pool the counter is over pool if you go

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
pool the counter is over pool if you go
over<00:00:57.149> pull<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> contours<00:00:58.050> 12<00:00:58.289> pool<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.160> go

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
over pull the contours 12 pool is to go

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.330 
over pull the contours 12 pool is to go
12<00:00:59.550> for<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.789> character<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.210> 12<00:01:00.510> edge<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.340> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
12 for the character is 12 edge and the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.709 
12 for the character is 12 edge and the
counter<00:01:02.640> at<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.239> nine<00:01:03.420> pool

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
counter at all that just nine pool

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.390 
counter at all that just nine pool
however<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.619> them<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.920> nine<00:01:05.159> pool

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
however if you see them going nine pool

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.539 
however if you see them going nine pool
then<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:05.880> over<00:01:06.030> pool<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.689> therefore

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
then you can go over pool so therefore

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.520 
then you can go over pool so therefore
generally<00:01:08.549> most<00:01:09.240> people<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.409> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
generally most people go to all that to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.140 
generally most people go to all that to
this<00:01:10.619> map<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.369> know<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> be

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
this map and I know that's going to be

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.429 
this map and I know that's going to be
that's<00:01:12.420> really<00:01:12.659> confusing<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.320> live

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that's really confusing when I just live

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.170 
that's really confusing when I just live
in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> past<00:01:13.770> 3<00:01:13.950> 10<00:01:14.189> seconds<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.729> rewind<00:01:15.119> this

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
in the past 3 10 seconds so rewind this

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.280 
in the past 3 10 seconds so rewind this
video<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.570> five<00:01:15.780> times<00:01:15.930> until<00:01:16.229> you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
video like five times until you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.240 
video like five times until you
understand<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:19.590> gist<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.070> pretty

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
understand that the gist of it is pretty

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.820 
understand that the gist of it is pretty
much<00:01:20.490> 12<00:01:21.030> hatch<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> most<00:01:22.140> part<00:01:22.380> right

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
much 12 hatch is for the most part right

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.770 
much 12 hatch is for the most part right
and<00:01:23.040> ok<00:01:23.460> yeah<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.759> notice<00:01:24.060> he<00:01:24.180> went<00:01:24.330> trough<00:01:24.540> for

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
and ok yeah so notice he went trough for

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.230 
and ok yeah so notice he went trough for
I<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.890> say<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> big<00:01:26.670> mistake<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.150> his

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
I would say this is a big mistake on his

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910 
I would say this is a big mistake on his
part<00:01:27.299> if<00:01:27.689> he<00:01:27.810> loses<00:01:28.020> his<00:01:28.259> name<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
part if he loses his name it's going to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.560 
part if he loses his name it's going to
be<00:01:29.040> strictly<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.909> build<00:01:30.329> order

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
be strictly because of this build order

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350 
be strictly because of this build order
win<00:01:31.250> generally<00:01:32.250> kids<00:01:32.430> like<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.670> said<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
win generally kids like I said if you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
win generally kids like I said if you
save<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.869> night<00:01:33.990> vision<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.470> opponent

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
save your night vision on your opponent

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.289 
save your night vision on your opponent
and<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.189> saw<00:01:35.369> them<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.670> pro-pro<00:01:35.939> what

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
and you saw them going pro-pro what

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.060 
and you saw them going pro-pro what
would<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.200> counter<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.650> 12<00:01:37.920> that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
would you do the counter is 12 that

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710 
would you do the counter is 12 that
obviously<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:38.909> therefore<00:01:39.150> right<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.630> I'm

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
obviously and so therefore right now I'm

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.420 
obviously and so therefore right now I'm
going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.049> 12<00:01:40.290> attached<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.220> pretty

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
going to go 12 attached and it's pretty

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.270 
going to go 12 attached and it's pretty
much<00:01:41.549> means<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.090> already<00:01:42.840> he's<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.770> build

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
much means that already he's in a build

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.480 
much means that already he's in a build
order<00:01:44.610> disadvantage<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:47.100> game's<00:01:47.280> already

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
order disadvantage this game's already

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.069 
order disadvantage this game's already
swinging<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.119> my<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.689> only<00:01:48.930> been<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
swinging in my way and it's only been a

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:49.860 
swinging in my way and it's only been a
minute<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.530> for

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
minute and for

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.010 
minute and for
and<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.410> like<00:01:50.620> it<00:01:51.490> kind<00:01:51.820> of<00:01:51.880> shows<00:01:52.150> like<00:01:52.330> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
and so like it kind of shows like the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.240 
and so like it kind of shows like the
crash<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.440> wall<00:01:53.560> when<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:53.770> kind<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:53.980> shows<00:01:54.130> you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
crash the wall when I kind of shows you

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.910 
crash the wall when I kind of shows you
a<00:01:54.280> skill<00:01:54.780> however<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.870> say<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:56.260> sea<00:01:56.530> level<00:01:56.890> so

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
a skill however you say is sea level so

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.910 
a skill however you say is sea level so
I'm<00:01:57.340> just<00:01:57.490> going<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.700> assume<00:01:57.820> that's<00:01:58.330> correct

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
I'm just going to assume that's correct

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.130 
I'm just going to assume that's correct
no<00:01:59.920> idea<00:02:00.160> that<00:02:00.340> or<00:02:00.580> not<00:02:00.760> but<00:02:00.790> you<00:02:01.270> know<00:02:01.390> let's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
no idea that or not but you know let's

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.240 
no idea that or not but you know let's
assume<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.190> now<00:02:04.830> he's<00:02:05.830> gonna<00:02:05.980> yeah

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
assume it is and now he's gonna yeah

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.980 
assume it is and now he's gonna yeah
pretty<00:02:06.520> much<00:02:06.610> i<00:02:06.940> think<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.210> only<00:02:07.360> thing<00:02:07.450> he

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
pretty much i think the only thing he

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.010 
pretty much i think the only thing he
can<00:02:08.170> do<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.680> make<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.369> game<00:02:09.580> equal<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.899> go

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
can do to make this game equal is to go

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.630 
can do to make this game equal is to go
for<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.260> hatchery<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.680> pump<00:02:11.920> or<00:02:12.040> drones<00:02:12.340> and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
for a hatchery and pump or drones and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.930 
for a hatchery and pump or drones and
then<00:02:13.150> hopefully<00:02:13.450> ah<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:15.220> get<00:02:15.400> lucky<00:02:15.550> in

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
then hopefully ah just get lucky in

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.370 
then hopefully ah just get lucky in
terms<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.540> circling<00:02:16.870> fight<00:02:17.080> or<00:02:17.230> something

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
terms in the circling fight or something

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.250 
terms in the circling fight or something
like<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:17.950> don't<00:02:18.190> know<00:02:18.370> like<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.690> now<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:20.140> you

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
like I don't know like as of now if you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.750 
like I don't know like as of now if you
think<00:02:20.500> about<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.740> I'm<00:02:21.040> gonna<00:02:21.280> have<00:02:21.490> drones

at<00:02:24.820> this<00:02:24.940> whole<00:02:25.090> game<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.580> don't<00:02:28.270> know

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
at this whole game and so I don't know

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330 
at this whole game and so I don't know
like<00:02:28.510> if<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.990> row<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.350> throw<00:02:29.560> over<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.220> have

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
like if I row and throw over it I have

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.590 
like if I row and throw over it I have
more<00:02:30.580> drones<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.000> throughout<00:02:31.300> this<00:02:31.420> whole

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
games and that's kind of going to

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.370 
games and that's kind of going to
translate<00:02:33.910> into<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.180> victory<00:02:34.450> later<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.930> now

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
translate into a victory later and now

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.050 
translate into a victory later and now
I'm<00:02:35.620> pretty<00:02:36.010> sure<00:02:36.190> he's<00:02:36.220> gonna<00:02:36.670> probably<00:02:36.880> get

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
I'm pretty sure he's gonna probably get

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.490 
I'm pretty sure he's gonna probably get
his<00:02:37.180> expansion<00:02:37.570> like<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.960> guys<00:02:38.080> are<00:02:38.290> things

if<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.450> think<00:02:40.630> about<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.900> that's<00:02:41.080> not<00:02:41.200> going

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
if you think about it that's not going

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.840 
if you think about it that's not going
to<00:02:41.470> make<00:02:41.530> any<00:02:41.590> difference<00:02:42.010> considering<00:02:42.700> my

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
I can get back Mexico and right now as

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.910 
I can get back Mexico and right now as
you<00:03:13.720> can<00:03:13.780> see<00:03:13.840> is<00:03:14.080> being<00:03:14.290> smart<00:03:14.380> by<00:03:14.560> containing

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
you can see is being smart by containing

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
you can see is being smart by containing
although<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.250> can<00:03:15.400> only<00:03:15.520> do<00:03:15.670> this<00:03:15.790> a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
although you can only do this a

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.760 
although you can only do this a
proponent<00:03:16.450> has<00:03:16.660> like<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.900> hatchery<00:03:17.140> outside

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
proponent has like a hatchery outside

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.620 
proponent has like a hatchery outside
because<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.580> exactly<00:03:18.640> happens<00:03:19.360> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
because this is exactly happens the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.340 
because this is exactly happens the
batteries<00:03:20.350> are<00:03:20.620> low

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
batteries are low

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.960 
batteries are low
and<00:03:23.590> yeah<00:03:24.590> actually<00:03:25.070> produces<00:03:25.610> lever<00:03:25.790> and

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
and yeah actually produces lever and

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.610 
and yeah actually produces lever and
that's<00:03:26.600> exactly<00:03:26.780> happened<00:03:27.260> he<00:03:27.320> gets<00:03:27.470> around

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
that's exactly happened he gets around

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.340 
that's exactly happened he gets around
it<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.430> now<00:03:28.760> yeah<00:03:29.270> so<00:03:29.600> this<00:03:29.780> is<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:29.960> three-time

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
it and now yeah so this is a three-time

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.800 
it and now yeah so this is a three-time
Madrid<00:03:30.770> done<00:03:31.040> however<00:03:31.340> as<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.330> can<00:03:32.480> see<00:03:32.630> my

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
the drillings over here I really

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.980 
the drillings over here I really
honestly<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.450> is<00:04:50.570> going<00:04:50.690> to<00:04:50.750> sound<00:04:50.870> really

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
honestly this is going to sound really

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.290
