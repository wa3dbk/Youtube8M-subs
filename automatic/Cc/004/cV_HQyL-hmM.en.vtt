than<00:02:51.239> forty<00:02:51.600> eight<00:02:51.720> millimeter<00:02:52.170> because<00:02:52.410> i

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
than forty eight millimeter because i

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.680 
than forty eight millimeter because i
like<00:02:52.650> my<00:02:52.769> board<00:02:53.010> row<00:02:53.280> low<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.609> ground<00:02:53.690> but

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
like my board row low to the ground but

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.110 
like my board row low to the ground but
on<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.900> nose<00:02:55.139> until<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.470> put<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> sponge<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.400> it

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
on the nose until I put a sponge and it

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.620 
on the nose until I put a sponge and it
works<00:02:57.329> perfectly<00:02:58.280> when<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.310> pop<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.150> don't

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.599 
works perfectly when I pop you don't
even<00:03:00.840> hear<00:03:01.019> anything<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.160> when<00:03:02.280> i<00:03:02.340> land

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
even hear anything it's just when i land

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.009 
even hear anything it's just when i land
because<00:03:02.940> these<00:03:03.060> wills<00:03:03.329> are<00:03:03.540> about<00:03:03.750> these

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
because these wills are about these

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.539 
because these wills are about these
wills<00:03:04.230> are<00:03:04.350> pretty<00:03:04.530> soft<00:03:04.739> though<00:03:04.980> they're

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
wills are pretty soft though they're

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.280 
wills are pretty soft though they're
about<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.760> 95<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.660> zero<00:03:07.560> meter<00:03:09.079> but<00:03:10.079> what<00:03:10.260> I

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
about a 95 a zero meter but what I

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.340 
about a 95 a zero meter but what I
really<00:03:10.680> need<00:03:10.889> is<00:03:11.130> about<00:03:11.639> a<00:03:11.670> 70<00:03:12.359> something<00:03:12.870> a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
really need is about a 70 something a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.420 
really need is about a 70 something a
durometer<00:03:14.160> will<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.870> very<00:03:16.260> very<00:03:16.380> soft<00:03:17.069> will

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
durometer will so very very soft will

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.360 
durometer will so very very soft will
that<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.290> very<00:03:19.290> small<00:03:19.709> like<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.040> size<00:03:20.069> of

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
that is very small like the size of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.720 
that is very small like the size of
these<00:03:20.489> these<00:03:20.730> are<00:03:20.790> about<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.620> 45<00:03:22.620> millimeter<00:03:23.459> i

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
these these are about a 45 millimeter i

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.330 
these these are about a 45 millimeter i
believe<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:27.170> on<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.380> tail<00:03:28.590> i<00:03:28.620> also<00:03:28.859> have<00:03:29.130> one

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
believe and on the tail i also have one

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.650 
believe and on the tail i also have one
of<00:03:29.400> those<00:03:29.459> punches<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.900> i<00:03:31.109> still<00:03:31.440> need<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.650> add

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
of those punches but i still need to add

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.960 
of those punches but i still need to add
a<00:03:33.660> little<00:03:33.780> bit<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.470> sponging<00:03:35.099> on<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.430> nose<00:03:35.639> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
a little bit of sponging on the nose and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.879 
a little bit of sponging on the nose and
tail<00:03:36.720> on<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.609> top<00:03:38.609> ply<00:03:38.880> because<00:03:39.780> when<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.650> catch

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
tail on the top ply because when I catch

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.890 
tail on the top ply because when I catch
it<00:03:41.010> upside<00:03:41.250> down<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.549> still<00:03:41.670> loud<00:03:42.450> like<00:03:42.750> it

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
it upside down it still loud like it

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.640 
it upside down it still loud like it
usually<00:03:43.049> would<00:03:43.349> be<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:44.780> also<00:03:45.780> i<00:03:45.989> need<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.470> put

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
usually would be and also i need to put

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.300 
usually would be and also i need to put
some<00:03:46.829> along<00:03:47.100> side<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.209> deck

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
some along side of the deck

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.220 
some along side of the deck
for<00:03:49.880> one<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.030> william<00:03:50.300> primo<00:03:50.660> just<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.050> could

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
for one I william primo just I could

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.559 
for one I william primo just I could
probably<00:03:51.440> like<00:03:51.910> divide<00:03:52.910> it<00:03:53.060> out<00:03:53.180> put<00:03:53.480> in

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
probably like divide it out put in

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.370 
probably like divide it out put in
different<00:03:53.720> spots<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.790> then<00:03:56.110> probably<00:03:57.110> like

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
different spots and then probably like

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.650 
different spots and then probably like
take<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.220> tape<00:03:58.520> on<00:04:01.060> say<00:04:02.060> like<00:04:02.330> cut<00:04:02.540> out<00:04:02.630> a

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
take and tape on say like cut out a

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.210 
take and tape on say like cut out a
little<00:04:02.930> small<00:04:03.260> piece<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.530> sponge<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.099> like

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
little small piece of sponge and like

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.900 
little small piece of sponge and like
tape<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.580> onto<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.970> axle<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:07.459> when<00:04:07.610> i<00:04:07.640> land

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
tape it onto the axle and so when i land

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.199 
tape it onto the axle and so when i land
primo<00:04:08.410> it'll<00:04:09.410> just<00:04:09.440> it'll<00:04:10.099> be<00:04:10.340> jolly<00:04:10.940> Wally

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
primo it'll just it'll be jolly Wally

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.420 
primo it'll just it'll be jolly Wally
and<00:04:11.480> fine<00:04:11.690> but<00:04:12.200> i'd<00:04:12.290> probably<00:04:12.530> do<00:04:12.769> is<00:04:12.890> like<00:04:13.250> get

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
and fine but i'd probably do is like get

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.240 
and fine but i'd probably do is like get
duct<00:04:13.640> tape<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.650> cut<00:04:15.650> out<00:04:15.739> a<00:04:15.769> little<00:04:16.010> piece<00:04:16.220> of

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
duct tape and cut out a little piece of

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.789 
duct tape and cut out a little piece of
sponge<00:04:16.609> put<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.239> like<00:04:17.450> not<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.230> there<00:04:18.470> directly

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
sponge put it like not on there directly

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.909 
sponge put it like not on there directly
but<00:04:19.010> i'll<00:04:19.130> make<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.310> little<00:04:19.669> um<00:04:20.709> kind<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.799> like<00:04:21.889> a

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
but i'll make a little um kind of like a

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.390 
but i'll make a little um kind of like a
thimble<00:04:22.610> out<00:04:22.790> of<00:04:23.180> duct<00:04:23.930> tape<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.380> have<00:04:25.070> the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
thimble out of duct tape and have the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.310 
thimble out of duct tape and have the
sponge<00:04:25.940> right<00:04:26.120> inside<00:04:26.419> of<00:04:26.570> it<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:26.720> I'll<00:04:26.930> tape

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
sponge right inside of it and I'll tape

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.260 
sponge right inside of it and I'll tape
it<00:04:27.440> on<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:29.680> axle<00:04:30.680> nut<00:04:30.919> and<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:32.120> would

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
it on to the axle nut and that would

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.710 
it on to the axle nut and that would
probably<00:04:32.540> work<00:04:32.690> out<00:04:33.020> really<00:04:33.410> nice<00:04:34.479> might<00:04:35.479> fall

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
probably work out really nice might fall

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.820 
probably work out really nice might fall
off<00:04:35.750> there<00:04:36.080> now<00:04:36.229> a<00:04:36.260> number<00:04:36.500> i<00:04:36.560> could<00:04:36.710> always

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
off there now a number i could always

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.180 
off there now a number i could always
just<00:04:37.070> retake<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.580> do<00:04:38.180> whatever<00:04:39.070> either<00:04:40.070> that

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
just retake and do whatever either that

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.180 
just retake and do whatever either that
or<00:04:40.430> if<00:04:40.910> i<00:04:41.030> get<00:04:41.240> really<00:04:41.600> really<00:04:41.990> lucky<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.710> i

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
or if i get really really lucky and i

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.240 
or if i get really really lucky and i
find<00:04:43.550> some<00:04:44.210> wheels<00:04:44.450> that<00:04:44.930> are<00:04:44.960> say<00:04:46.000> like<00:04:47.000> some

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
find some wheels that are say like some

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.159 
find some wheels that are say like some
penny<00:04:49.250> wheels<00:04:49.610> that<00:04:49.970> are<00:04:50.000> worn<00:04:50.270> down<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.990> be

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
penny wheels that are worn down to be

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.219 
penny wheels that are worn down to be
really<00:04:51.800> really<00:04:52.400> tiny<00:04:52.850> like<00:04:53.810> if<00:04:53.930> i<00:04:54.050> were<00:04:54.140> to

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
really really tiny like if i were to

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.050 
really really tiny like if i were to
skate<00:04:54.470> my<00:04:54.650> penny<00:04:54.919> wills<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.550> they'd<00:04:55.789> probably

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
skate my penny wills and they'd probably

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.330 
skate my penny wills and they'd probably
take<00:04:56.390> a<00:04:56.419> good<00:04:56.690> five<00:04:57.050> six<00:04:57.410> years<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:57.770> scan<00:04:58.100> those

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
take a good five six years of scan those

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.830 
take a good five six years of scan those
everyday<00:04:58.669> to<00:04:58.850> get<00:04:59.090> them<00:04:59.180> down<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.479> size<00:04:59.690> of

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
everyday to get them down to the size of

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.510 
everyday to get them down to the size of
these<00:05:00.020> but<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:00.890> would<00:05:01.070> be<00:05:01.190> absolutely

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
these but that would be absolutely

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.820 
these but that would be absolutely
perfect<00:05:02.890> because<00:05:03.890> if<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:06.169> will<00:05:06.410> will

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
perfect because if the will will

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.610 
perfect because if the will will
actually<00:05:07.340> come<00:05:07.580> up<00:05:07.870> come<00:05:08.870> out<00:05:08.990> further<00:05:09.289> than

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
actually come up come out further than

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.969 
actually come up come out further than
the<00:05:10.100> axle<00:05:10.520> so<00:05:11.210> when<00:05:11.330> i<00:05:11.360> land<00:05:11.570> primo<00:05:11.960> it<00:05:12.140> silent

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
the axle so when i land primo it silent

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.580 
the axle so when i land primo it silent
but<00:05:13.780> that<00:05:14.780> would<00:05:14.900> take<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:15.110> really<00:05:15.229> long<00:05:15.440> time

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
but that would take a really long time

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.430 
but that would take a really long time
to<00:05:15.890> do<00:05:16.039> and<00:05:16.690> yeah<00:05:17.690> i<00:05:17.720> need<00:05:17.930> to<00:05:17.990> get<00:05:18.080> some<00:05:18.260> wheels

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
to do and yeah i need to get some wheels

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.990 
to do and yeah i need to get some wheels
i<00:05:18.680> needa<00:05:18.860> buy<00:05:18.979> some<00:05:19.190> rules<00:05:19.400> are<00:05:19.550> about<00:05:19.850> this

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
i needa buy some rules are about this

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.370 
i needa buy some rules are about this
size<00:05:20.210> or<00:05:20.630> smaller<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:22.120> that<00:05:23.120> are<00:05:23.270> like<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.510> 70<00:05:24.139> a

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
size or smaller and that are like a 70 a

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.909 
size or smaller and that are like a 70 a
and<00:05:24.910> that<00:05:25.910> would<00:05:26.030> be<00:05:26.060> that<00:05:26.210> would<00:05:26.450> be<00:05:26.630> perfect

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
and that would be that would be perfect

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.170 
and that would be that would be perfect
like<00:05:27.919> a<00:05:27.979> 78<00:05:28.490> a<00:05:28.520> maybe<00:05:29.389> at<00:05:29.539> the<00:05:29.660> hardest<00:05:30.080> 83<00:05:30.800> a

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
like a 78 a maybe at the hardest 83 a

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.750 
like a 78 a maybe at the hardest 83 a
