00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.860
 this is the automatic controller 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.919
 to in sense according to hormilla 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.599
 so he can work 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.759
 automatically in maceration 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.240
 As you can see peking on the valve 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.429
 percent is the hymn ine 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.710
 the index acted by the controller 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.249
 although also 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.249
 its the color small but also today 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.449
 and finally 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.449
 nothing by villa with the pilot that is on 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.870
 you can see 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.920
 in these moments 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.210
 the artist temperature 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.340
 hundred 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.680
 30m a degree celsius and it keeps going down 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.340
 and as it goes down it will turn on when it is at 73 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.530
 when they are 73 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.830
 automatically the valve got rid of that it will act 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.410
 and once he acted he will throw the gas so that the burner she calibrated 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.320
 I can light 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.320
 you can appreciate that the temperature keeps going down 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.510
 and this temperature 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.610
 will go down to 73 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.920
 once it reaches 73 automatically the serene and what happens and descend 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.400
 as you can appreciate 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.430
 we have a regÃºs pressure gauge to regulate 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.500
 and verify 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.820
 the pressure that the gas balloon has 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.500
 in this case it is a test gas balloon 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.890
 small but anyway 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.000
 per cent enough pressure to open the serene valve and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.370
 per cent we also have to as a pilot 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.490
 is governed by an auxiliary valve 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.340
 this pilot that is governed by an auxiliary valve keeps the flame 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.760
 lit 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.200
 so that the equator acts, the valve will be noticed 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.070
 can ignite the flame and thus heat the kettle was in this case the master 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.100
 designer 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.050
 very well 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.530
 we see how the temperature is decreasing 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.530
 and that this pro for the ignition 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.290
 you see that that sense 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.359
 this is going to start when decreasing 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.179
 I'm going to start heating 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.329
 let's start heating 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.749
 this 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.329
 the pp feels which 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.119
 the physical volume 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.489
 so that automatically at the temperature is bread 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.299
 as you can see 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.239
 the temperature has risen 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.729
 and immediately the flame went out 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.179
 why his then now 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.779
 what we are going to see is that 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.309
 this temperature begins to decrease 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.599
 and when it starts to decrease 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.609
 gradually 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.529
 is going to act 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.529
 in this case the controller like you are going to see there 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.619
 if you will realize that we have 101 100 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.839
 90 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:02.079
 and they continue to govern quickly we are going to get here to listen to the 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.769
 serene g 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.759
 the valve is collected to act if right now 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.759
 and undoubtedly Portugal pointed 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:13.879
 this a tornado 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.659
 91 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.659
 now 73 is scheduled 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:26.779
 for not acting militarily 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:30.049
 g from the hand of the pilot 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.329
 and in that way 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.559
 we already have automatic control at a temperature assumed 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.959
 how temperature decreases 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.359
 if the temperature is decreasing 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.359
 undoubtedly yes the burner will remain on 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:46.369
 but when we warm up 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:47.829
 the orgy 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.349
 undoubtedly that 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.489
 the serene air will be turned off like what you see there 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.019
 it will go off because 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:58.989
 the controller 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.979
 has stopped acting the valve will be noir
