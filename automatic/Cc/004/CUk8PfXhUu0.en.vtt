00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone here I leave a creepy 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.529
 pasta that they enjoy comment and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.300
 subscribe to Tom's 13 short films 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.580
 and jerry formulated by the director 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.769
 Czechoslovakian gene dates are famous for 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.089
 its poor quality and nature 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.460
 disturbing with sound effects 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.650
 lousy and animation even worse and have a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.020
 more realistic feeling of violence 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 some speculate that gates do not 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.590
 liked the concept of the program and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.140
 created these chapters so that the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.060
 people will not like what much 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.219
 people do not know is that the heights signed 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.280
 originally to do more than the 13 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.899
 episodes the public has access 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.969
 desperate to get out of his contract 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.670
 spell one shorter tom and jerry that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.250
 few have seen the short was called toms 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.829
 basement opened with take a typical 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.840
 home of tom and jerry his owner was 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.539
 the rabid fat of other shorts of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.520
 made this one look even more angry than 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.559
 in his other appearances the first 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.329
 scene is seen stomping the tail 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.550
 of tom in a very realistic way and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.949
 sadistic because take is sleeping in the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 basement door the owner yells at 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.510
 ton you should never go to the basement I took 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.000
 is clearly terrified and I know 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.280
 to another room our point of view 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.410
 remains in the room through the door of the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.200
 basement and we see jerry come out of a cave 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.270
 of the mouse he looks really grotesque 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.940
 much more different from the original than in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.890
 other gates shorts puts a look 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.140
 diabolical in his face and still atom in 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.810
 the room next to the minutes 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.880
 following are quite realistic tom 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.830
 chases Jerry around the house like 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.780
 does usually but every time 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.910
 goes through the basement door the owner 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.070
 inflicts a wound on him with a stick 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.020
 this three times until everything ends 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.960
 bleeding in several places and with a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.880
 broken leg after this take starts at 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.490
 literally begging Jerry not to 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.860
 bother more he does not really talk but he 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.750
 is crying and talking between his teeth and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.450
 you can tell what he's doing for 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.280
 his body language jerry just laughs 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.100
 of him and pushes him back to the door 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.530
 from the basement the owner captures tom 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.690
 again and the camera is enraged 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.640
 about in your face that changes color and 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.290
 distorts with what yells atom with 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.959
 a voice much stronger than any 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.670
 another sound in the caricature I can not 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.230
 post what he said here but 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.780
 it is definitely vicious 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.360
 and furious' it seems that jerry has decided 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.340
 finally take pity on Tom Jerry Catch 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.110
 a knife that was lying around and stabbing 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.510
 to the owner in the leg very 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.310
 graphically tom opens the door of the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.250
 basement and carries the owner's body 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.049
 and throw it down the stairs there are dozens 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.150
 of other bodies down there in 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.610
 decomposition and with signs of death 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.620
 violent tom and jerry shake hands and 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.900
 it seems that they have triumphed over the bad 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.030
 of the episode but jerry puts a face 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.579
 deformed and devilish again and says 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.579
 atom with a ghostly voice in the background
