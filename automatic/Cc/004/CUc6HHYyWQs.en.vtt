00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
all right so no else another tutorial so

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.380 
all right so no else another tutorial so
I<00:00:04.259> thought<00:00:04.500> I<00:00:04.529> would<00:00:04.680> do<00:00:05.250> one<00:00:05.279> first<00:00:05.640> one<00:00:06.209> that

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
I thought I would do one first one that

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.969 
I thought I would do one first one that
people<00:00:06.660> were<00:00:06.839> asking<00:00:07.200> some<00:00:07.439> questions<00:00:07.470> about

00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:07.979 
people were asking some questions about

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.180 
people were asking some questions about
which<00:00:08.340> was<00:00:08.610> how<00:00:09.180> I<00:00:09.210> got<00:00:09.450> some<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.750> the

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
which was how I got some of the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.500 
which was how I got some of the
realistic<00:00:11.190> wind<00:00:11.460> effects<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.000> go<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> hair

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
realistic wind effects to go in the hair

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.380 
realistic wind effects to go in the hair
remain<00:00:12.810> and<00:00:13.020> the<00:00:13.110> tail<00:00:13.350> on<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.620> models<00:00:14.010> here

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.390 
remain and the tail on the models here

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.260 
remain and the tail on the models here
so<00:00:15.390> I<00:00:15.750> loaded<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.460> salute<00:00:17.460> -<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.030> had

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
so I loaded up the salute - that I had

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.740 
so I loaded up the salute - that I had
here<00:00:18.540> I'm<00:00:19.500> actually<00:00:19.620> -<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:21.030> can<00:00:21.210> put<00:00:21.720> your

if<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.090> look<00:00:30.270> here<00:00:30.300> it's<00:00:30.600> not<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:31.099> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
if you look here it's not just a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.059 
if you look here it's not just a
modification<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.539> the<00:00:34.079> rotation<00:00:34.679> it<00:00:34.800> actually

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:35.069 
modification of the rotation it actually

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:36.319 
modification of the rotation it actually
has<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.339> bit<00:00:35.519> of<00:00:35.579> life<00:00:35.789> to<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.149> yeah

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
has a little bit of life to it yeah

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.559 
has a little bit of life to it yeah
there's<00:00:37.199> a<00:00:37.309> pole<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.909> I<00:00:38.999> actually<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.359> change

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:39.569 
there's a pole that I actually do change

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:41.989 
there's a pole that I actually do change
the<00:00:39.719> position<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.440> -<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.859> a<00:00:41.579> lot<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.789> that

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:41.999 
the position on here - and a lot of that

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:43.790 
the position on here - and a lot of that
is<00:00:42.120> done<00:00:42.269> just<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.809> jitter<00:00:43.199> and<00:00:43.440> smooth

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
is done just with jitter and smooth

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.290 
is done just with jitter and smooth
which<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.339> a<00:00:44.370> 2d<00:00:45.030> options<00:00:45.389> here<00:00:45.629> under<00:00:47.300> either

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
which is a 2d options here under either

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.259 
which is a 2d options here under either
the<00:00:48.449> motion<00:00:48.809> editor<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.729> it's<00:00:50.729> going<00:00:51.089> through

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
the motion editor and it's going through

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.689 
the motion editor and it's going through
all<00:00:51.479> the<00:00:51.629> joints<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.889> the<00:00:53.280> hair<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
all the joints on the on the hair and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.889 
all the joints on the on the hair and
the<00:00:54.600> tail<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.289> basically<00:00:55.889> adding<00:00:56.519> in<00:00:56.899> those

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the tail and basically adding in those

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.500 
the tail and basically adding in those
little<00:00:58.079> bits<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.440> motion<00:00:58.799> so<00:00:59.549> here<00:01:00.179> I<00:01:00.209> have<00:01:00.389> an

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
little bits of motion so here I have an

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.049 
little bits of motion so here I have an
empty<00:01:00.659> model<00:01:01.139> now<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.159> kind<00:01:02.429> of<00:01:02.459> show<00:01:02.639> you<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
empty model now I kind of show you how I

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
empty model now I kind of show you how I
do<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.479> here<00:01:03.690> first<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> want<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.379> make<00:01:04.470> sure

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
do it here first you want to make sure

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.340 
do it here first you want to make sure
you<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.969> bake<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.630> procedural<00:01:07.140> bones

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you do is to bake the procedural bones

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.310 
you do is to bake the procedural bones
if<00:01:07.649> you<00:01:07.799> don't<00:01:08.219> do<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.110> don't<00:01:10.259> have

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
if you don't do that you don't have

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
if you don't do that you don't have
access<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> lot<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> jiggles<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.909> then

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
access to a lot of the jiggles and then

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.179 
access to a lot of the jiggles and then
you're<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:13.020> able<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> give<00:01:13.649> that<00:01:13.829> effect<00:01:13.920> that

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you're not able to give that effect that

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.450 
you're not able to give that effect that
you<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:16.409> might<00:01:16.619> want<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.829> do<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:16.979> last

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you want you might want to do that last

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.069 
you want you might want to do that last
if<00:01:17.789> you're<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.090> animate<00:01:18.359> anything<00:01:18.869> else

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
if you're going to animate anything else

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.080 
if you're going to animate anything else
just<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> make<00:01:19.680> sure<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.219> any<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.969> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
just to make sure that any of the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
just to make sure that any of the
natural<00:01:21.570> motion<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.109> the<00:01:22.229> model<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.590> going

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
natural motion that the model is going

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.649 
natural motion that the model is going
to<00:01:22.859> do<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.820> place<00:01:24.030> because<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.359> soon<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.539> you

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to do is in place because as soon as you

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.510 
to do is in place because as soon as you
bake<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.350> animate<00:01:25.770> anything<00:01:25.979> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
bake it if you animate anything you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880 
bake it if you animate anything you
can't<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:27.060> back<00:01:27.359> without<00:01:28.079> losing<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.740> you've

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
can't go back without losing what you've

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.569 
can't go back without losing what you've
done<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.789> here<00:01:29.969> we'll<00:01:30.179> bake<00:01:30.359> it<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> model

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
done so here we'll bake it on this model

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.980 
done so here we'll bake it on this model
and<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.700> should<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.090> access<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.929> all

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and we should have access then to all

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.719 
and we should have access then to all
the<00:01:34.109> triple<00:01:34.289> bonds<00:01:34.530> sure<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.460> open<00:01:36.450> those<00:01:36.570> up

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
the triple bonds sure so open those up

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.919 
the triple bonds sure so open those up
alright<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> top<00:01:39.689> main

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
alright so here we have the top main

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.690 
alright so here we have the top main
here<00:01:40.109> you're<00:01:40.829> going<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.039> want<00:01:41.219> to<00:01:41.250> try<00:01:41.429> to<00:01:41.460> pick

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
here you're going to want to try to pick

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.029 
here you're going to want to try to pick
a<00:01:41.759> direction<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:43.109> where<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.439> hair<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.649> going

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
a direction for where the hair is going

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.029 
a direction for where the hair is going
so<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.799> kind<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
so like you can see here it's kind of

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.319 
so like you can see here it's kind of
going<00:01:47.189> left<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> right<00:01:47.640> because<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.090> want<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
going left to right because I want to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.760 
going left to right because I want to
have<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> effect<00:01:48.929> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.109> wind<00:01:49.320> blowing<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
have the effect of the wind blowing that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.950 
have the effect of the wind blowing that
direction<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.710> we're<00:01:52.710> going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.070> open<00:01:53.700> up

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
direction so we're going to open up

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.389 
direction so we're going to open up
rotation<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.590> we're<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.039> to<00:01:56.100> find

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
rotation here and we're going to find

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.459 
rotation here and we're going to find
the<00:01:56.729> axis<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.359> rotation<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the axis as a rotation that are in the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.399 
the axis as a rotation that are in the
directions<00:01:58.859> that<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:58.979> want<00:01:59.280> so<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.319> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
directions that we want so we want to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.099 
directions that we want so we want to
have<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.649> kind<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.890> rotate<00:02:02.240> this<00:02:03.240> direction<00:02:03.780> so

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
have it kind of rotate this direction so

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.499 
have it kind of rotate this direction so
let's<00:02:04.439> find<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:05.009> traumatic

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.770 

okay<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.379> we<00:02:09.470> got<00:02:09.530> Z<00:02:09.739> here<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.789> by<00:02:11.540> having

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
okay so we got Z here so that by having

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.320 
okay so we got Z here so that by having
a<00:02:11.930> Z<00:02:12.080> selected<00:02:12.530> only<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.220> will<00:02:13.459> be<00:02:13.610> affected

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
a Z selected only that will be affected

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.949 
a Z selected only that will be affected
so<00:02:14.510> we're<00:02:15.140> just<00:02:15.170> going<00:02:15.349> to<00:02:15.440> add<00:02:15.590> some<00:02:15.620> jitter

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
so we're just going to add some jitter

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.699 
so we're just going to add some jitter
if<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.799> look<00:02:19.040> at<00:02:19.280> how<00:02:19.610> what<00:02:19.879> that<00:02:20.060> does

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
if you look at how what that does

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.800 
if you look at how what that does
creates<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.799> little<00:02:21.950> bit<00:02:22.239> sharp<00:02:23.239> that's<00:02:23.599> not

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
creates a little bit sharp that's not

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
creates a little bit sharp that's not
the<00:02:23.959> effect<00:02:24.230> you're<00:02:24.349> going<00:02:24.379> to<00:02:24.530> want<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.709> go

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
the effect you're going to want to go

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.440 
the effect you're going to want to go
for<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.890> instead<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.670> can<00:02:28.849> do<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.060> little<00:02:29.330> bit

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
for so instead you can do a little bit

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.949 
for so instead you can do a little bit
of<00:02:29.540> smooth<00:02:29.870> here<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:31.420> it'll<00:02:32.420> smooth<00:02:32.750> out<00:02:32.930> that

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
of smooth here and it'll smooth out that

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.780 
of smooth here and it'll smooth out that
motion<00:02:33.379> might<00:02:33.950> have<00:02:34.040> overdone<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.430> little<00:02:34.670> bit

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
motion might have overdone a little bit

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.850 
motion might have overdone a little bit
there

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
there

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.100 
there
let's<00:02:36.860> try<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.280> smooth<00:02:37.579> yeah<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.019> now

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
let's try this one smooth yeah so now

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.600 
let's try this one smooth yeah so now
you<00:02:39.170> see<00:02:39.379> that<00:02:39.409> it's<00:02:39.920> got<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.159> little<00:02:40.459> bit<00:02:40.579> more

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
you see that it's got a little bit more

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.009 
you see that it's got a little bit more
that<00:02:40.940> smooth<00:02:41.209> emotion<00:02:41.690> what<00:02:41.810> you'd<00:02:41.930> expect

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
that smooth emotion what you'd expect

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.789 
that smooth emotion what you'd expect
from<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.440> wind<00:02:42.910> now<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:44.410> just<00:02:45.410> looks<00:02:45.709> like

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
from the wind now that just looks like

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.250 
from the wind now that just looks like
it's<00:02:46.040> rotating<00:02:46.519> on<00:02:46.609> its<00:02:46.640> base<00:02:46.970> these<00:02:47.329> not<00:02:47.959> as

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
it's rotating on its base these not as

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.199 
it's rotating on its base these not as
realistic<00:02:48.470> as<00:02:48.799> you<00:02:48.890> might<00:02:49.040> want<00:02:49.340> so<00:02:50.030> let's

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
realistic as you might want so let's

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.680 
realistic as you might want so let's
grab<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.200> position<00:02:51.799> here<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:53.090> position

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
grab the position here and the position

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.780 
grab the position here and the position
only<00:02:53.840> position<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.349> I<00:02:54.500> change<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.310> going<00:02:55.730> to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
only position that I change is going to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.550 
only position that I change is going to
be<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.450> length<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.989> hair<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:57.319> in<00:02:57.440> this

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
be the length of the hair so in this

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.270 
be the length of the hair so in this
case<00:02:57.769> going<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.040> be<00:02:59.170> the<00:03:00.170> green<00:03:00.560> one<00:03:00.709> here<00:03:00.890> the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
case going to be the green one here the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.069 
case going to be the green one here the
one<00:03:01.430> that's<00:03:01.579> pulling<00:03:01.790> out<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.690> can<00:03:02.810> play<00:03:02.900> some

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
one that's pulling out you can play some

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.660 
one that's pulling out you can play some
of<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.230> other<00:03:03.319> ones<00:03:03.440> if<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.590> want<00:03:03.680> I'm<00:03:04.160> tight

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
of the other ones if you want I'm tight

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.390 
of the other ones if you want I'm tight
on<00:03:04.790> time<00:03:04.940> too<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:05.810> again<00:03:06.739> grab<00:03:07.040> just<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
on time too so again grab just the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.250 
on time too so again grab just the
access<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:07.879> this<00:03:08.090> in<00:03:08.269> this<00:03:08.329> case<00:03:08.510> it's<00:03:08.720> Y<00:03:08.900> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
access for this in this case it's Y and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.710 
access for this in this case it's Y and
we'll<00:03:09.890> do<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.099> same<00:03:10.280> thing<00:03:10.450> position<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.690> a

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
we'll do the same thing position is a

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.860 
we'll do the same thing position is a
little<00:03:11.989> bit<00:03:12.200> more<00:03:13.190> touchy<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:14.060> jitter<00:03:14.329> so<00:03:14.720> it's

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
little bit more touchy on jitter so it's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.780 
little bit more touchy on jitter so it's
just<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.200> little<00:03:15.560> bit<00:03:15.680> of<00:03:15.769> jitter<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.579> you'll

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
just a little bit of jitter and you'll

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.940 
just a little bit of jitter and you'll
notice<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.120> big<00:03:17.150> change<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.870> then<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.709> might

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
notice a big change and then you might

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.750 
notice a big change and then you might
need<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.250> smooth<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.639> quite<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.940> bit<00:03:20.169> but<00:03:21.549> if<00:03:22.549> you

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
need to smooth it quite a bit but if you

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.120 
need to smooth it quite a bit but if you
do<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.239> you'll<00:03:24.109> notice<00:03:24.319> that<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.650> hair<00:03:24.829> kind

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
do that you'll notice that the hair kind

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.030 
do that you'll notice that the hair kind
of<00:03:25.220> pulls<00:03:25.459> out<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.730> little<00:03:26.000> bit<00:03:26.209> with<00:03:26.989> adding<00:03:27.919> a

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
of pulls out a little bit with adding a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.780 
of pulls out a little bit with adding a
little<00:03:28.310> bit<00:03:28.430> more<00:03:28.519> realistic<00:03:29.150> effect<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.660> it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
little bit more realistic effect to it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.640 
little bit more realistic effect to it
all<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:32.000> have<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.209> do<00:03:32.329> then<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:32.720> just<00:03:33.319> do<00:03:33.530> the

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
all you have to do then is just do the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.710 
all you have to do then is just do the
exact<00:03:33.980> same<00:03:34.010> thing<00:03:34.549> to<00:03:34.849> all<00:03:35.269> these<00:03:35.419> little

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
exact same thing to all these little

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.830 
exact same thing to all these little
pieces<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.380> hair<00:03:36.500> along<00:03:36.919> the<00:03:37.069> way<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.840> I'll

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
pieces of the hair along the way so I'll

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.250 
pieces of the hair along the way so I'll
just<00:03:38.989> do<00:03:39.139> one<00:03:39.349> more<00:03:39.560> here<00:03:40.299> grab<00:03:41.299> this<00:03:41.450> one<00:03:41.660> find

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
just do one more here grab this one find

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.659 
just do one more here grab this one find
the<00:03:42.319> rotation<00:03:42.440> we<00:03:42.889> want<00:03:43.069> to<00:03:43.130> go<00:03:43.250> left<00:03:43.489> and

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
the rotation we want to go left and

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.550 
the rotation we want to go left and
right<00:03:43.730> again<00:03:43.970> it's<00:03:44.780> probably<00:03:44.989> gonna<00:03:45.230> be<00:03:45.290> Z

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
right again it's probably gonna be Z

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.409 
right again it's probably gonna be Z
again<00:03:46.239> nope<00:03:47.239> let's<00:03:48.200> see<00:03:48.380> here<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:50.180> it's<00:03:50.329> going

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
again nope let's see here so it's going

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:52.300 
again nope let's see here so it's going
to<00:03:50.510> be<00:03:50.599> X<00:03:50.780> oh<00:03:51.169> are<00:03:51.620> going<00:03:51.919> you're<00:03:52.069> actually

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
to be X oh are going you're actually

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.309 
to be X oh are going you're actually
grab<00:03:52.459> rotation<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:53.090> would<00:03:53.180> help<00:03:53.319> alright

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
grab rotation that would help alright

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.020 
grab rotation that would help alright
there<00:03:54.889> we<00:03:54.919> go<00:03:55.040> so<00:03:55.489> it's<00:03:55.579> gonna<00:03:55.700> be<00:03:55.790> out<00:03:55.879> left

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
there we go so it's gonna be out left

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.180 
there we go so it's gonna be out left
and<00:03:56.180> right<00:03:56.560> we're<00:03:57.560> going<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.709> do<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:57.980> same

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
and right we're going to do the same

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.920 
and right we're going to do the same
thing<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.669> bit<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.359> jitter<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.840> then<00:04:00.410> smooth<00:04:00.680> it

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
thing a bit of jitter and then smooth it

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.180 
thing a bit of jitter and then smooth it
now<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:02.989> see

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
now you see

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.670 
now you see
it<00:04:05.030> moves<00:04:05.210> a<00:04:05.270> little<00:04:05.360> independently<00:04:06.110> of<00:04:06.530> the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
it moves a little independently of the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.920 
it moves a little independently of the
other<00:04:06.800> main<00:04:07.040> just<00:04:07.460> like<00:04:07.640> what<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.810> would

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
other main just like what you would

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.550 
other main just like what you would
expect<00:04:09.140> going<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.500> do<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.920> then<00:04:11.320> same<00:04:12.320> way

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
expect going to do and then same way

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.430 
expect going to do and then same way
we'll<00:04:12.920> go<00:04:13.100> to<00:04:13.160> position<00:04:13.630> find<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.810> one<00:04:15.290> that

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
we'll go to position find the one that

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.490 
we'll go to position find the one that
pulls<00:04:15.680> out<00:04:19.570> it's<00:04:20.570> going<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.810> be<00:04:20.900> easy

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
pulls out it's going to be easy

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.970 
pulls out it's going to be easy
yeah<00:04:22.120> add<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.150> little<00:04:23.390> bit<00:04:23.510> of<00:04:23.600> jitter<00:04:23.750> not<00:04:24.710> too

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
yeah add a little bit of jitter not too

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.500 
yeah add a little bit of jitter not too
much<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:26.530> smooth<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.710> quite<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:27.980> bit

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.250 

okay<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:33.670> see<00:04:34.670> you<00:04:34.730> got<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.450> two<00:04:35.690> pieces<00:04:35.930> done

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
okay I see you got the two pieces done

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.080 
okay I see you got the two pieces done
and<00:04:36.560> if<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:37.070> were<00:04:37.280> to<00:04:37.370> repeat<00:04:37.730> that<00:04:37.880> process

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
and if you were to repeat that process

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.320 
and if you were to repeat that process
all<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.690> way<00:04:38.720> across<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.680> entire<00:04:39.950> main<00:04:40.330> you

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
all the way across the entire main you

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.980 
all the way across the entire main you
would<00:04:41.510> get<00:04:41.720> an<00:04:41.900> effect<00:04:42.260> that's<00:04:42.970> closer<00:04:43.970> to<00:04:44.150> the

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
would get an effect that's closer to the

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.150 
would get an effect that's closer to the
one<00:04:45.140> this<00:04:45.380> one<00:04:45.500> over<00:04:45.710> here<00:04:46.180> where<00:04:47.180> I<00:04:48.110> also<00:04:48.740> went

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
one this one over here where I also went

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.790 
one this one over here where I also went
right<00:04:49.550> about<00:04:50.290> right<00:04:51.290> about<00:04:51.350> at<00:04:51.560> this<00:04:51.710> point

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
right about right about at this point

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.170 
right about right about at this point
you<00:04:52.040> see<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.280> main<00:04:52.430> pulled<00:04:52.670> back<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.120> the

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
you see the main pulled back and the

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.060 
you see the main pulled back and the
tail<00:04:53.390> pulls<00:04:53.690> back<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:53.930> little<00:04:54.140> more<00:04:54.380> I<00:04:54.560> just

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
tail pulls back a little more I just

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.890 
tail pulls back a little more I just
basically<00:04:55.460> just<00:04:55.820> selected<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.300> point<00:04:56.780> right

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
basically just selected a point right

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.040 
basically just selected a point right
here<00:04:57.250> of<00:04:58.250> time<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.820> just<00:04:59.180> hold<00:04:59.780> it<00:04:59.900> that

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
here of time and just hold it that

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.810 
here of time and just hold it that
direction<00:05:00.230> and<00:05:00.620> that's<00:05:00.710> slide<00:05:01.070> back<00:05:01.280> it<00:05:01.520> was<00:05:01.790> a

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
direction and that's slide back it was a

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.700 
direction and that's slide back it was a
really<00:05:02.150> easy<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.540> add<00:05:02.720> a<00:05:02.810> gust<00:05:03.080> effect<00:05:03.500> after

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
really easy to add a gust effect after

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.830 
really easy to add a gust effect after
you<00:05:04.010> have<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.310> base<00:05:04.460> effect<00:05:04.820> done<00:05:05.000> if<00:05:05.750> you

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
you have the base effect done if you

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.060 
you have the base effect done if you
want<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:06.050> add<00:05:06.140> win<00:05:06.350> to<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.530> ears<00:05:06.740> it's

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
want to add win to the ears it's

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.150 
want to add win to the ears it's
basically<00:05:07.310> the<00:05:07.430> same<00:05:07.610> thing<00:05:07.670> AB<00:05:08.150> jitter<00:05:09.160> to

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
basically the same thing AB jitter to

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.400 
basically the same thing AB jitter to
the<00:05:10.190> rotation<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.240> position<00:05:11.600> just<00:05:11.780> make

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
the rotation and the position just make

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.090 
the rotation and the position just make
sure<00:05:12.560> you<00:05:12.680> don't<00:05:12.890> select<00:05:13.250> all<00:05:14.150> of<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:15.290> the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
sure you don't select all of the the

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.480 
sure you don't select all of the the
accesses<00:05:16.610> because<00:05:17.380> for<00:05:18.380> effect<00:05:19.010> here<00:05:19.220> for<00:05:19.400> the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
accesses because for effect here for the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.390 
accesses because for effect here for the
jiggler<00:05:19.790> here<00:05:20.169> will<00:05:21.169> if<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.890> were<00:05:22.070> to<00:05:22.130> grab<00:05:22.310> the

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
jiggler here will if I were to grab the

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.640 
jiggler here will if I were to grab the
whole<00:05:22.550> position<00:05:22.730> and<00:05:23.120> add<00:05:23.240> jitter<00:05:23.570> um<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:26.060> can

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
whole position and add jitter um it can

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.659 
whole position and add jitter um it can
it<00:05:27.650> can<00:05:27.710> start<00:05:28.010> throwing<00:05:28.280> it<00:05:28.430> in<00:05:28.490> REM

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
it can start throwing it in REM

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:29.920 
it can start throwing it in REM
directions<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.330> it's<00:05:29.480> not<00:05:29.630> giving<00:05:29.870> the

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
directions and it's not giving the

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.600 
directions and it's not giving the
effective<00:05:30.350> moving<00:05:30.620> in<00:05:30.770> a<00:05:30.919> single<00:05:31.280> direction

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
effective moving in a single direction

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.420 
effective moving in a single direction
like<00:05:31.760> when<00:05:31.910> it<00:05:32.120> looks<00:05:32.600> more<00:05:32.840> like<00:05:33.050> you're<00:05:33.080> just

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
like when it looks more like you're just

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.970 
like when it looks more like you're just
whipping<00:05:34.430> your<00:05:34.490> head<00:05:34.669> around<00:05:35.710> but<00:05:36.710> it's<00:05:36.890> going

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
whipping your head around but it's going

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.820 
whipping your head around but it's going
to<00:05:37.040> take<00:05:37.160> some<00:05:37.340> practice<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:38.590> kind<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:39.650> just

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
to take some practice I kind of just

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.950 
to take some practice I kind of just
figured<00:05:40.460> it<00:05:40.520> out<00:05:40.580> over<00:05:40.820> time<00:05:41.000> and<00:05:41.060> just<00:05:41.419> gotten

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
figured it out over time and just gotten

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.790 
figured it out over time and just gotten
better<00:05:42.110> at<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.470> as<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.740> went<00:05:43.720> but<00:05:44.720> if<00:05:45.470> you<00:05:45.650> have

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
better at it as I went but if you have
