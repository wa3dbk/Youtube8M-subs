evo rail system saddle design around a
lot<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.040> miles<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.719> I<00:00:13.519> looked<00:00:14.519> at<00:00:14.759> many

lot of miles and I looked at many
different<00:00:15.540> parts<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.990> bike<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.529> years

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
different parts of the bike for years

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.429 
different parts of the bike for years
and<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.789> unique<00:00:18.390> thing<00:00:18.420> about<00:00:20.240> about<00:00:21.439> about

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
and the unique thing about about about

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.670 
and the unique thing about about about
this<00:00:22.680> product<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:24.439> started<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.529> this

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
this product is that I started on this

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.000 
this product is that I started on this
design<00:00:26.070> 40<00:00:27.000> years<00:00:27.210> ago<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.500> really<00:00:28.710> hasn't

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
design 40 years ago and it really hasn't

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.130 
design 40 years ago and it really hasn't
been<00:00:29.279> until<00:00:29.820> until<00:00:30.779> modern<00:00:32.000> materials<00:00:33.140> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
been until until modern materials that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.440 
been until until modern materials that
there's<00:00:34.440> materials<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:36.090> are<00:00:36.180> able<00:00:36.360> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
there's materials now that are able to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.290 
there's materials now that are able to
make<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.260> design<00:00:37.649> work<00:00:40.730> it's<00:00:41.730> more<00:00:42.059> than

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
make this design work it's more than

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.869 
make this design work it's more than
just<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:44.120> saddle<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.930> seat<00:00:46.200> post<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:47.460> really<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
just a saddle or seat post it's really a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.689 
just a saddle or seat post it's really a
system<00:00:50.870> being<00:00:51.870> both<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.800> seat<00:00:53.039> post<00:00:53.219> company

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
system being both the seat post company

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.720 
system being both the seat post company
and<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.149> saddle<00:00:54.510> company<00:00:54.949> was<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> unique<00:00:56.399> way

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and a saddle company was a unique way

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.360 
and a saddle company was a unique way
for<00:00:56.760> me<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.690> kind<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.109> attack<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
for me to kind of attack it in a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.490 
for me to kind of attack it in a
holistic<00:00:59.699> sense<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:01.489> what<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.789> Evo

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
holistic sense and that's what the Evo

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.789 
holistic sense and that's what the Evo
vector<00:01:04.500> rail<00:01:04.710> system<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:06.260> I<00:01:07.260> was
