00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
and you know they were still tweaking

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.279 
and you know they were still tweaking
the<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.520> polishing<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> input<00:01:54.719> up<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.049> two

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
the and polishing the input up to two

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.380 
the and polishing the input up to two
days<00:01:55.469> I<00:01:55.500> think<00:01:55.740> before<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.219> went<00:01:56.909> gold<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.299> the
