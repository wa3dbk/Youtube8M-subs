we<00:00:18.380> really<00:00:18.680> want<00:00:18.860> to<00:00:18.890> make<00:00:19.040> sure<00:00:19.070> that<00:00:19.400> there's

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
we really want to make sure that there's

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.609 
we really want to make sure that there's
that<00:00:19.610> contrast<00:00:20.240> between<00:00:20.450> the<00:00:20.990> negative<00:00:21.470> space

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
that contrast between the negative space

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.600 
that contrast between the negative space
and<00:00:22.599> then<00:00:23.599> the<00:00:23.840> high-tension<00:00:24.349> spikes<00:00:24.860> you

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
and then the high-tension spikes you

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.519 
and then the high-tension spikes you
need<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:26.150> exploration<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.110> need<00:00:27.349> the

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
need the exploration you need the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.220 
need the exploration you need the
scavenging<00:00:28.160> you<00:00:28.340> need<00:00:28.580> something<00:00:29.119> to<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:30.050> say

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
scavenging you need something to to say

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.740 
scavenging you need something to to say
like<00:00:30.439> okay<00:00:30.740> I'm<00:00:31.130> setting<00:00:31.699> a<00:00:31.760> certain<00:00:32.059> tone<00:00:32.239> and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.200 
like okay I'm setting a certain tone and
a<00:00:33.140> patina<00:00:33.470> here<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:34.640> that<00:00:34.820> then<00:00:35.000> we<00:00:35.180> can

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
a patina here so that then we can

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.240 
a patina here so that then we can
contrast<00:00:35.870> that<00:00:36.080> with<00:00:36.140> some<00:00:36.410> stark<00:00:36.739> like

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
contrast that with some stark like

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.729 
contrast that with some stark like
changes<00:00:37.820> we<00:00:38.269> need<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.660> intensity<00:00:39.199> to<00:00:39.350> strike

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
changes we need the intensity to strike

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.520 
changes we need the intensity to strike
a<00:00:39.980> different<00:00:40.730> chord<00:00:40.970> it<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:41.690> only<00:00:41.840> works<00:00:42.199> if

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
a different chord it that only works if

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.590 
a different chord it that only works if
you<00:00:42.590> have<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.280> negative<00:00:43.610> space<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:44.210> play<00:00:44.330> off

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
you have the negative space to play off
