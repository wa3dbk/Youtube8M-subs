00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.070 
opponent a little bit lightly in that
opening<00:06:52.140> set<00:06:52.440> and<00:06:53.420> he's<00:06:54.420> been<00:06:54.780> all<00:06:54.900> business

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
opening set and he's been all business

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.250 
opening set and he's been all business
in<00:06:55.440> this<00:06:55.560> second<00:06:55.980> set<00:06:56.450> come<00:06:57.450> out<00:06:57.630> much<00:06:57.960> better

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
in this second set come out much better

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.920 
in this second set come out much better
much<00:06:58.770> stronger<00:06:59.400> I<00:06:59.610> think<00:07:00.360> it's<00:07:00.450> a<00:07:00.510> matter<00:07:00.780> of

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
much stronger I think it's a matter of

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.390 
much stronger I think it's a matter of
Harrison<00:07:01.380> not<00:07:01.500> playing<00:07:01.800> as<00:07:01.950> well<00:07:02.130> I<00:07:02.160> think

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
Harrison not playing as well I think

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.250 
Harrison not playing as well I think
