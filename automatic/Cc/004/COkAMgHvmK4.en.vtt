seems like a pretty fun thing and then
when<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:11.040> in<00:02:11.130> college<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:14.040> sort<00:02:14.220> of

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
when I was in college I I just sort of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.850 
when I was in college I I just sort of
think<00:02:15.000> about<00:02:15.240> what's<00:02:15.660> what's<00:02:16.080> gonna<00:02:16.230> most

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
think about what's what's gonna most

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.690 
think about what's what's gonna most
affect<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> world<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:18.270> they<00:02:19.110> were<00:02:19.700> actually

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
affect the world and they were actually

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.820 
affect the world and they were actually
sort<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.269> thought<00:02:21.450> there<00:02:21.780> were<00:02:21.870> five<00:02:22.440> things

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
sort of I thought there were five things

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.350 
sort of I thought there were five things
that<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.100> thought<00:02:23.310> would<00:02:23.700> most<00:02:23.910> like<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> world

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
that I thought would most like the world

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.259 
that I thought would most like the world
3<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.630> which<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.900> thought<00:02:25.110> would<00:02:26.269> it's

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
3 of which I thought would it's

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.509 
3 of which I thought would it's
definitely<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.260> positive<00:02:28.590> things<00:02:29.100> to<00:02:29.190> solve

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
definitely a positive things to solve

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.870 
definitely a positive things to solve
two<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.239> which<00:02:30.390> are<00:02:30.690> slight<00:02:31.050> question<00:02:31.290> mark

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
two of which are slight question mark

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.590 
two of which are slight question mark
and<00:02:33.260> then<00:02:34.260> as<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.500> turned<00:02:34.739> out<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.920> was<00:02:35.070> able<00:02:35.340> to

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
and then as it turned out I was able to
