00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy with the

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.490 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy with the
upcoming<00:00:03.149> update<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.870> new<00:00:04.020> ash<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.470> the

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
upcoming update to the new ash in the

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.200 
upcoming update to the new ash in the
next<00:00:04.890> patch<00:00:05.100> I<00:00:05.370> figured<00:00:05.850> it'd<00:00:05.940> be<00:00:05.970> worth

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
next patch I figured it'd be worth

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.820 
next patch I figured it'd be worth
taking<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.720> look<00:00:06.750> over<00:00:07.200> since<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.500> think<00:00:07.680> it's<00:00:07.770> a

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
taking a look over since I think it's a

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.200 
taking a look over since I think it's a
pretty<00:00:07.950> cool<00:00:08.189> kit<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.550> will<00:00:08.760> prove<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.179> be

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
pretty cool kit and will prove to be

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.709 
pretty cool kit and will prove to be
quite<00:00:09.480> strong<00:00:09.990> let's<00:00:10.679> get<00:00:10.830> started<00:00:11.660> now<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
quite strong let's get started now the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.360 
quite strong let's get started now the
main<00:00:12.960> changes<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.440> ash<00:00:13.559> come<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.009> form<00:00:14.219> of

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
main changes to ash come in the form of

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.029 
main changes to ash come in the form of
her<00:00:14.490> passive<00:00:15.000> her<00:00:15.420> Q<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.960> her<00:00:16.049> Hawk<00:00:16.289> shot<00:00:16.560> her

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
her passive her Q and her Hawk shot her

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.250 
her passive her Q and her Hawk shot her
volley<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.640> her<00:00:17.760> ultimate<00:00:18.119> remained<00:00:18.510> mostly

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
volley and her ultimate remained mostly

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.250 
volley and her ultimate remained mostly
unchanged<00:00:20.010> her<00:00:20.670> old<00:00:20.939> Q<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.510> now<00:00:21.750> moved<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.170> her

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
unchanged her old Q is now moved to her

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.259 
unchanged her old Q is now moved to her
passive<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:22.980> every<00:00:23.279> single<00:00:23.550> auto<00:00:23.730> attack<00:00:24.029> with

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
passive so every single auto attack with

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.810 
passive so every single auto attack with
her<00:00:24.480> now<00:00:24.990> slows<00:00:25.439> at<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> cost<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.250> zero<00:00:26.310> mana

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
her now slows at the cost of zero mana

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.970 
her now slows at the cost of zero mana
the<00:00:27.449> trade-off<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.840> now<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> slow<00:00:28.769> at

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the trade-off is now that the slow at

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.339 
the trade-off is now that the slow at
early<00:00:29.310> levels<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.880> really<00:00:30.480> really<00:00:30.750> weak<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
early levels is really really weak and

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.920 
early levels is really really weak and
kind<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.130> non-existent<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.450> really

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
kind of non-existent but it's really

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.020 
kind of non-existent but it's really
nice<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> not<00:00:34.530> use<00:00:34.860> man<00:00:35.100> at<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.309> perma<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.730> people

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
nice to not use man at a perma so people

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
nice to not use man at a perma so people
now<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.450> scales<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.899> really<00:00:37.170> well<00:00:37.380> in

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
now and it scales up really well in

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
now and it scales up really well in
addition<00:00:38.309> she<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:38.969> no<00:00:39.090> longer<00:00:39.270> critically

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
addition she can no longer critically

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
addition she can no longer critically
strike<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.500> her<00:00:40.590> passive<00:00:41.040> scales<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.610> gives

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
strike but her passive scales and gives

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
strike but her passive scales and gives
her<00:00:41.879> bonus<00:00:42.120> damage<00:00:42.390> depending<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.200> how<00:00:43.320> much

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
her bonus damage depending on how much

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
her bonus damage depending on how much
crit<00:00:43.739> chance<00:00:43.770> she<00:00:44.280> has<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.510> also

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
crit chance she has this is also

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
crit chance she has this is also
actually<00:00:46.320> pretty<00:00:46.500> good<00:00:46.739> because<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.190> bonus

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
actually pretty good because the bonus

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.250 
actually pretty good because the bonus
damage<00:00:47.670> scales<00:00:48.120> well<00:00:48.390> enough<00:00:48.629> with<00:00:48.930> crit

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
damage scales well enough with crit

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
damage scales well enough with crit
chance<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.800> make<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.670> really<00:00:51.149> do

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
chance to make it so that you really do

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.900 
chance to make it so that you really do
just<00:00:51.780> about<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.350> same<00:00:52.559> amount<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:53.010> damage<00:00:53.399> but

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
just about the same amount of damage but

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.459 
just about the same amount of damage but
without<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> RNG<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.199> crit<00:00:55.440> chance

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
without the RNG that crit chance

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.799 
without the RNG that crit chance
normally<00:00:56.160> brings<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.120> really<00:00:57.420> sweet

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
normally brings which is really sweet

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.840 
normally brings which is really sweet
now<00:00:58.440> she<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:59.010> doesn't<00:00:59.309> run<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> mana

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
now she really doesn't run out of mana

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.490 
now she really doesn't run out of mana
that<00:01:00.149> much<00:01:00.390> unless<00:01:00.600> you're<00:01:00.870> spamming<00:01:01.109> volley

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that much unless you're spamming volley

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
that much unless you're spamming volley
off<00:01:01.770> cooldown<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.730> gives<00:01:02.850> her<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> lot<00:01:03.300> more

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
off cooldown so it gives her a lot more

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.240 
off cooldown so it gives her a lot more
resources<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.140> work<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.860> really

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
resources to work with which is really

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.250 
resources to work with which is really
awesome<00:01:05.489> especially<00:01:05.970> since<00:01:06.689> mana<00:01:07.020> issues

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
awesome especially since mana issues

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.109 
awesome especially since mana issues
were<00:01:07.650> such<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> big<00:01:08.220> problem<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.820> her<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
were such a big problem for her in the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.039 
were such a big problem for her in the
past<00:01:10.460> her<00:01:11.460> Q<00:01:11.820> now<00:01:11.970> builds<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.659> stack<00:01:13.020> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
past her Q now builds up a stack of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.170 
past her Q now builds up a stack of
focus<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.830> lasts<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.369> five<00:01:14.670> seconds

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
focus that lasts for about five seconds

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.880 
focus that lasts for about five seconds
whenever<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> hit<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.780> target<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.380> when<00:01:16.680> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
whenever you hit a target and when you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.740 
whenever you hit a target and when you
activate<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> ability<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.330> increased

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
activate the ability you get increased

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.330 
activate the ability you get increased
attack<00:01:19.080> speed<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.500> your<00:01:19.710> passive<00:01:20.159> slow

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
attack speed and your passive slow

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190 
attack speed and your passive slow
amount<00:01:20.640> increases<00:01:21.119> based<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.990> how<00:01:22.140> many

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
amount increases based on how many

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.320 
amount increases based on how many
focused<00:01:22.680> stacks<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.490> addition<00:01:24.240> if

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
focused stacks you have in addition if

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.910 
focused stacks you have in addition if
you<00:01:24.450> had<00:01:24.540> five<00:01:24.780> stacks<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.350> focus<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you had five stacks of focus when you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
you had five stacks of focus when you
use<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.280> ability<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.909> now<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.210> gives<00:01:27.299> you

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
use this ability and now it gives you

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.149 
use this ability and now it gives you
some<00:01:27.600> rapid-fire<00:01:27.990> attacks<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> nice

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
some rapid-fire attacks that do a nice

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.429 
some rapid-fire attacks that do a nice
chunk<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.579> damage<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.509> decently<00:01:30.930> strong<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
chunk of damage it's decently strong it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.840 
chunk of damage it's decently strong it
makes<00:01:31.590> her<00:01:31.680> early<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.130> mid<00:01:32.250> game<00:01:32.430> damage

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
makes her early and mid game damage

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.219 
makes her early and mid game damage
reasonably<00:01:33.360> higher<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.049> nice<00:01:34.200> change

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
reasonably higher so it's a nice change

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.640 
reasonably higher so it's a nice change
and<00:01:35.299> lastly<00:01:36.299> her<00:01:36.540> hog<00:01:36.780> shot<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.140> pretty<00:01:37.500> much

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
and lastly her hog shot is pretty much

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.370 
and lastly her hog shot is pretty much
the<00:01:37.710> same<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.549> global<00:01:39.360> which<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.259> be

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the same but it's now global which to be

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.090 
the same but it's now global which to be
honest<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.970> totally<00:01:41.970> insane<00:01:42.979> especially<00:01:43.979> at

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
honest is totally insane especially at

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.399 
honest is totally insane especially at
the<00:01:44.220> competitive<00:01:44.549> level<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.540> alone<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the competitive level this alone is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.530 
the competitive level this alone is
enough<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.770> make<00:01:46.890> ash<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.790> strong<00:01:48.149> add

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
enough to make ash really strong add

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.749 
enough to make ash really strong add
into<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:49.920> uses<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.340> charge

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
into that that it now uses a charge

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.030 
into that that it now uses a charge
system<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.450> stores<00:01:51.600> two<00:01:52.110> charges<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.920> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
system that stores two charges and so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.190 
system that stores two charges and so
it's<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.700> good<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.180> honestly<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.140> my

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
it's really good and honestly in my

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.560 
it's really good and honestly in my
opinion<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.280> biggest<00:01:56.759> buff<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.270> this

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
opinion is the biggest buff of this

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
opinion is the biggest buff of this
update<00:01:58.140> since<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.829> you're<00:01:58.979> skilled<00:01:59.250> enough

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
update since if you're skilled enough

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
update since if you're skilled enough
this<00:01:59.700> skill<00:01:59.969> pretty<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.570> becomes<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
this skill pretty much just becomes a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.410 
this skill pretty much just becomes a
clairvoyance<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.040> better<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.270> use

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
clairvoyance but better and you can use

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.179 
clairvoyance but better and you can use
it<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.659> track<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.079> enemy<00:02:04.380> jungler<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.950> set<00:02:05.100> up

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
it to track the enemy jungler and set up

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.190 
it to track the enemy jungler and set up
a<00:02:05.280> boatload<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.700> place<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.360> really<00:02:06.540> deny<00:02:06.869> so

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
a boatload of place and really deny so

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.120 
a boatload of place and really deny so
many<00:02:07.350> options<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.860> your<00:02:08.069> opponents

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
many options for your opponents

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.190 
many options for your opponents
so<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:10.940> played<00:02:11.150> ash<00:02:11.330> for<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.630> few<00:02:11.780> games<00:02:11.960> on<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
so I played ash for a few games on the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.750 
so I played ash for a few games on the
PBE<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.710> I<00:02:12.770> have<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.010> say<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.190> now<00:02:13.490> she's

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
PBE and I have to say that now she's

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.490 
PBE and I have to say that now she's
really<00:02:14.090> cool<00:02:14.270> as<00:02:14.630> someone<00:02:14.960> who<00:02:15.050> really<00:02:15.290> likes

using it effectively her mid game team

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.900 
using it effectively her mid game team
fights<00:02:23.360> are<00:02:23.740> reasonably<00:02:24.740> better<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.520> in

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
fights are reasonably better now and in

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.700 
fights are reasonably better now and in
combo<00:02:26.330> with<00:02:26.450> her<00:02:26.570> arrow<00:02:26.810> her<00:02:27.080> team<00:02:27.320> fights<00:02:27.560> in

her raw damage as a whole has gone up by

her raw damage as a whole has gone up by
a<00:02:31.880> decent<00:02:32.390> amount<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.410> lot

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
more room to work with and it's really

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.340 
more room to work with and it's really

it<00:02:59.990> got<00:03:00.320> a<00:03:00.350> bit<00:03:00.530> better<00:03:00.710> with<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.070> change<00:03:01.280> to

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
it got a bit better with the change to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.010 
it got a bit better with the change to

her Q and so relating has gone from
below<00:03:03.380> average<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:04.070> about<00:03:04.730> average<00:03:05.270> early<00:03:05.630> on

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
below average to about average early on

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.110 
below average to about average early on

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
and it does get a lot better once he

and it does get a lot better once he
hits<00:03:08.360> level<00:03:08.630> six<00:03:08.870> since<00:03:09.080> Rotom<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.500> just<00:03:09.740> so

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.130
