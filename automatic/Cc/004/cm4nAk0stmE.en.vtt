00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.610
 two 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.099
 you guys are going to see me prepare some 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.740
 Carrier is because I'm going on a trip 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.570
 I go to the beach and I take my hamster 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.180
 well I'm going to take the hamsters to me 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.759
 bring a richardson squirrel and I 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.079
 I will also bring two of august and I 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.970
 I'm going to take you in these carriers is 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.920
 which are totally suitable for the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.350
 transport of these small pets 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.780
 small rodents the truth that in 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.030
 small rigid cages or carriers 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.030
 They travel phenomenally as we are going to do them 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.860
 Well look super easy , you have already 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.780
 seen in other times as I have 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.270
 prepared and you know the products the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.060
 nature litter we are going to use it 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.540
 soil we will have a good layer that 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:59.490
 absorbs pixels well 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.490
 and the chapels of these animals 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.080
 I'm going to put a little on everyone and this is 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.160
 similar to preparing a flower pot 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.950
 down here the substrate after you 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.860
 we will put a little bit of sweetdreams that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.370
 It is a substrate that is going to make 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.630
 go and travel more warm and also 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.790
 which also has an absorption power 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.940
 very good and with which you can do 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.230
 bed 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.230
 and here another little 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.159
 and finally the hay 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.980
 He does not do two functions the animals if 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.810
 they are hungry they can eat it but 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.820
 they are also going to take refuge in it 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.820
 we put a good goop of hay 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.640
 perfect and now I only have to put the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.460
 the cages to their travel carriers 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.940
 You see that everything is very fluffy in case the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.530
 Swaying and the bustle of the car 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.750
 by the way the car is the worst means of 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.060
 pet transportation because it's where 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.760
 more accelerations and brakings and where else 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.530
 vaivenes are going to have but well here 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.330
 in these in this type of transport is 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.250
 I put it well all very very very very gone 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.900
 so you do not have any problem if 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.110
 we brake or pass any 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.950
 Accident come hamster first 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.040
 little carny here you have them 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.099
 lets go 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.200
 we put them we are going to take a 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.200
 little bit of food 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.360
 just in case they are hungry on the trip 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.330
 but nothing very little because normally 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.130
 on the trip they are going to eat very little 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.960
 I put a little food on them 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.560
 and that it stays well insured and well 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.970
 closed you see how good here they go phenomenal 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.700
 for a trip that can last 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.930
 quietly about three or four or 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.840
 even up to five hours 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.560
 perfect the hamsters placed 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.569
 because this second is for verbs 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.569
 also transport two here 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.060
 in the same way I put a 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.060
 little bit of food 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.000
 but very little in case you feel like it 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.330
 eat along the way but it's not what 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.150
 you can add a piece to them 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.099
 a mini piece of fruit because as I do not 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.930
 we are going to put water on the trip 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.060
 Worry hold three four or five 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.769
 hours without drinking without any problem 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.420
 because they are also animals that are very 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.160
 of dry climates ah does not happen absolutely 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.650
 nothing, yes, you can put a 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.030
 small piece of fruit because with the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.730
 same fruit will take the water that 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.319
 they need and finally here we go to 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.319
 put the squirrel 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.410
 Well, here I take the couple 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.690
 of korea squirrels 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.340
 we'll put them here calm 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.750
 that I've caught them sleeping these is 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.670
 important that you catch them sleeping 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.380
 because you are going to see that they move a lot 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.190
 less and we'll put a little bit of 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.190
 I think of squirrel 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.700
 in case you feel like eating 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.060
 it's interesting to put the squirrels 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.530
 some kind of good shelter in the 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.120
 squirrels to hamsters to all 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.090
 animals some kind of shelter if you want 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.950
 well subject so that they make bed and 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.380
 They can protect inside, although as 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.630
 I said the main function of this what 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.690
 will make the hay fixes right away how 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.590
 they shelter under the hay that seems 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.930
 that are not even 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.479
 we will put you inside the little house 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.060
 and we have prepared all three 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.710
 transportation 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.710
 to go on vacation to the beach
