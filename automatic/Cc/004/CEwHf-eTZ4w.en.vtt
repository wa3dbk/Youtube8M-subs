00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.179 
tackling commentary what is the point
we're<00:00:06.870> going<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.259> show<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> few<00:00:07.560> examples<00:00:08.160> but

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
we're going to show a few examples but

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
get out of it it's the easiest way to

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.480 
get out of it it's the easiest way to
actually<00:00:11.639> get<00:00:12.000> any<00:00:12.179> kind<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.630> turnover

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
actually get any kind of turnover

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.589 
actually get any kind of turnover
everyone's<00:00:14.490> got<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.639> make<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> tackle<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.509> it's

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
everyone's got to make a tackle and it's

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.820 
everyone's got to make a tackle and it's
just<00:00:15.809> been<00:00:15.960> really<00:00:16.170> effective<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.800> that

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
just been really effective in that

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.650 
just been really effective in that
tackle<00:00:17.369> it's<00:00:17.789> an<00:00:17.880> opportunity<00:00:18.270> where<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.600> can

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
tackle it's an opportunity where you can

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
tackle it's an opportunity where you can
turn<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> tackle<00:00:19.380> into<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.680> mall<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.340> once<00:00:20.580> that

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
turn a tackle into a mall and once that

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.939 
turn a tackle into a mall and once that
more<00:00:20.939> collapses<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.779> can<00:00:22.199> win<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> ball<00:00:22.740> so

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
more collapses you can win the ball so

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.859 
more collapses you can win the ball so
it's<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> said<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.939> best<00:00:24.449> way<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
it's so like I said the best way in the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.290 
it's so like I said the best way in the
quickest<00:00:25.289> way<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.890> owner<00:00:26.130> turnover<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
quickest way of owner turnover so as the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.609 
quickest way of owner turnover so as the
ball<00:00:27.420> carrier<00:00:27.750> you've<00:00:27.869> got<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.380> floor

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
ball carrier you've got to get to floor

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.589 
ball carrier you've got to get to floor
if<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.609> ball<00:00:29.760> doesn't<00:00:29.970> come<00:00:30.210> out<00:00:30.240> otherwise

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
if the ball doesn't come out otherwise

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.240 
if the ball doesn't come out otherwise
the<00:00:30.869> opposition<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> ball<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.070> put

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the opposition get the ball for the put

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.069 
the opposition get the ball for the put
in<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.520> scrub<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.149> yes<00:00:33.510> let's<00:00:33.930> take

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
in at the scrub so that's yes let's take

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.780 
in at the scrub so that's yes let's take
a<00:00:34.170> look<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> few<00:00:34.829> examples<00:00:34.950> actually<00:00:35.760> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
a look at a few examples actually a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.850 
a look at a few examples actually a
couple<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.630> good<00:00:36.870> choke<00:00:37.110> tackles<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> then

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
couple of good choke tackles and then

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.590 
couple of good choke tackles and then
one<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.129> doesn't<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.640> well<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.510> could

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
one that doesn't go so well so you could

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.790 
one that doesn't go so well so you could
argue<00:00:39.780> Ben<00:00:40.079> are<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> best<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> league

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
argue Ben are the best in the league

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.790 
argue Ben are the best in the league
that's<00:00:41.070> two<00:00:41.309> guys<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.790> braids<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.320> seam<00:00:43.620> all

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
that's two guys in braids and seam all

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.650 
that's two guys in braids and seam all
the<00:00:43.890> actors<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.280> pack<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.879> then<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.420> all

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the actors a pack and then it's all

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.990 
the actors a pack and then it's all
about<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.140> mindset<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.980> if<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.340> team<00:00:47.579> all

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
about the mindset because if a team all

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.549 
about the mindset because if a team all
know<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.780> they're<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> try<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.350> get

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
know that they're going to try and get

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.930 
know that they're going to try and get
this<00:00:49.680> choked<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:50.370> why<00:00:50.489> Island<00:00:50.850> was

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
this choked up and that's why Island was

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
this choked up and that's why Island was
so<00:00:51.059> successful<00:00:51.350> everyone<00:00:52.350> buys<00:00:52.590> into<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
so successful everyone buys into it

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.920 
so successful everyone buys into it
comes<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.789> see<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.120> opportunity<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
comes in they see the opportunity and

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.350 
comes in they see the opportunity and
they<00:00:55.289> flood<00:00:55.620> them<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.670> case<00:00:56.940> they

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
they flood them all in this case they

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.119 
they flood them all in this case they
get<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> turnover<00:00:57.960> here's<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:58.949> not

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
get the turnover here's one that's not

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
get the turnover here's one that's not
quite<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.399> successful<00:01:00.239> Saracens<00:01:00.899> try<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> hold

hands<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> ball<00:01:06.270> now<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.110> hand<00:01:07.290> slips

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
hands on the ball now if your hand slips

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.289 
hands on the ball now if your hand slips
off<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.799> ball<00:01:08.130> slips<00:01:08.460> over<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.970> allows<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
center of gravity that's the result

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.820 
center of gravity that's the result
because<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.960> happens<00:01:13.260> any<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.560> you've<00:01:13.680> got

about<00:01:21.630> was<00:01:21.900> their<00:01:22.080> choke<00:01:22.320> tuck<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.710> mentioned

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
about was their choke tuck you mentioned

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.859 
about was their choke tuck you mentioned
Brad<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> mentioned<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.150> results<00:01:24.600> for

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
Brad you mentioned see more results for

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.300 
Brad you mentioned see more results for
the<00:01:24.930> reaction<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.380> every<00:01:25.740> other<00:01:25.830> player<00:01:26.189> as

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the reaction of every other player as

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.920 
the reaction of every other player as
soon<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.670> see<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> tackle<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.479> made<00:01:27.720> high

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
soon as I see that tackle be made high

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.649 
soon as I see that tackle be made high
they<00:01:28.439> flood<00:01:28.860> into<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.250> contact<00:01:29.700> area<00:01:30.090> given

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
they flood into that contact area given

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.179 
they flood into that contact area given
them<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> numerical<00:01:31.500> advantage<00:01:31.920> well<00:01:32.009> maybe

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
them a numerical advantage well maybe

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.649 
them a numerical advantage well maybe
ask<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> bit<00:01:32.880> about<00:01:32.909> how<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.360> can

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
ask you a bit about how you can

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.539 
ask you a bit about how you can
counteract<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.290> after<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.740> show<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
counteract that after we show you the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.280 
counteract that after we show you the
actual<00:01:35.880> technique<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.540> choke<00:01:36.750> tackle<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
actual technique for a choke tackle so

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
actual technique for a choke tackle so
these<00:01:37.680> two<00:01:37.950> guys<00:01:38.159> are<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.490> my<00:01:38.729> side<00:01:39.000> let's<00:01:39.540> have

have a look at the defenders do i attack
Benkei<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.520> mobile<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.360> go<00:01:51.509> after<00:01:51.659> one

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
Benkei not that mobile do I go after one

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.999 
Benkei not that mobile do I go after one
of<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> Mitchell<00:01:52.320> brothers<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.829> left

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
of the Mitchell brothers on the left

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.639 
of the Mitchell brothers on the left
hand<00:01:53.159> side<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.700> sure<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:54.450> now

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
hand side not so sure about go right now

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.780 
hand side not so sure about go right now
this<00:01:55.649> guy<00:01:55.890> looks<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.189> he<00:01:56.369> plays<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
this guy looks like he plays in the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.280 
this guy looks like he plays in the
center<00:01:57.149> probably<00:01:57.479> quite<00:01:57.600> agile<00:01:57.960> maybe<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
center probably quite agile maybe a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.850 
center probably quite agile maybe a
bat-rope

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
bat-rope

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.800 
bat-rope
so<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.430> target<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.210> too<00:02:00.570> now

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so I'm going to be target you too now

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.149 
so I'm going to be target you too now
once<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.079> get<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.409> point<00:02:01.590> I'm<00:02:01.799> trying<00:02:01.829> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
once I get to this point I'm trying to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.980 
once I get to this point I'm trying to
offset<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.670> I'm<00:02:02.850> trying<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.180> get<00:02:03.329> away<00:02:03.450> from

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
offset you I'm trying to get away from

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.780 
offset you I'm trying to get away from
your<00:02:04.140> center<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.560> gravity<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.579> longer

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
your center of gravity so it's a longer

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.069 
your center of gravity so it's a longer
reach<00:02:05.969> tackle<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.509> there'll<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.780> point

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
reach tackle but there'll be a point

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.690 
reach tackle but there'll be a point
where<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.290> realize<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.740> I've<00:02:08.009> got<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.399> go<00:02:08.520> into

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
where I realize that I've got to go into

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.430 
where I realize that I've got to go into
the<00:02:08.910> tackle<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.899> don't<00:02:09.989> want<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.319> do

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the tackle and what I don't want to do

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.199 
the tackle and what I don't want to do
is<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.709> don't<00:02:10.890> want<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.550> where<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> stick

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
is I don't want to go in where I stick

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.890 
is I don't want to go in where I stick
on<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.510> tackle<00:02:12.870> because<00:02:12.959> if<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.379> happens

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
on the tackle because if that happens

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.869 
on the tackle because if that happens
you<00:02:14.170> often<00:02:14.349> find<00:02:14.829> that<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.250> balls<00:02:15.459> held<00:02:15.730> high

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
you often find that the balls held high

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.429 
you often find that the balls held high
and<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.150> usually<00:02:16.360> find<00:02:16.689> this<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.079> when<00:02:17.260> a

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
and you usually find this is when a

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.319 
and you usually find this is when a
player's<00:02:17.920> taking<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.430> off<00:02:18.549> a<00:02:18.579> pass<00:02:18.879> a<00:02:18.909> little

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
player's taking it off a pass a little

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.300 
player's taking it off a pass a little
bit<00:02:19.420> slower<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.959> bit<00:02:20.170> static<00:02:20.439> and<00:02:20.769> hasn't

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
bit slower is a bit static and hasn't

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.759 
bit slower is a bit static and hasn't
got<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.700> that<00:02:22.510> impetus<00:02:23.019> in<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.290> contact<00:02:23.680> you

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
got that that impetus in the contact you

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.289 
got that that impetus in the contact you
get<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.189> point<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.640> will<00:02:24.790> try<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.180> get

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
get to that point you will try and get

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.449 
get to that point you will try and get
to<00:02:25.450> ground<00:02:25.659> so<00:02:25.989> your<00:02:26.290> players<00:02:26.590> can<00:02:26.860> absolutely

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
to ground so your players can absolutely

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.949 
to ground so your players can absolutely

my center of gravity once the ball is
below<00:02:32.769> there<00:02:33.159> there's<00:02:33.609> a<00:02:33.670> pretty<00:02:33.909> good<00:02:34.120> chance

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
below there there's a pretty good chance

below there there's a pretty good chance
you're<00:02:34.599> going<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.780> find<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.079> very<00:02:35.290> difficult

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
you're going to find it very difficult

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.319 
you're going to find it very difficult
unless<00:02:35.859> you<00:02:36.099> can<00:02:36.280> completely<00:02:36.700> pick<00:02:37.000> me<00:02:37.120> up<00:02:37.209> off

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
unless you can completely pick me up off

counteract<00:03:58.180> it<00:03:58.510> well<00:03:59.169> there's<00:03:59.319> two<00:03:59.500> things<00:03:59.530> I

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
counteract it well there's two things I

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.349
