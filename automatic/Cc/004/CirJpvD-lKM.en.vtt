00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 I was impressed by buda 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.610
 old wheel change from new 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.420
 career already looking after the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.420
 impressively stopping treatment 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.480
 why not turn without an ace rifle a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:24.780
 fabio by the way maxxus which is so 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:28.460
 congratulations congratulations to the family 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.460
 also the continuous lever chain 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:43.460
 nothing is the wheel of feelings though 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:43.460
 normally they feel personal 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.700
 hello everyone i'm alex zanardi today 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.239
 we had curiosity with friends 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.120
 of meta bonds to prove the difference 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.890
 precisely treating chain bearings e 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.589
 however all moving parts with 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.040
 their product with this oil 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:07.500
 special meta bonds let's say that 0.2 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.600
 kilometers per hour of speed 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.490
 making a fairly empirical calculation 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.950
 we are about on the order of the second al 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.600
 km which is so much difference because in one 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.470
 time trial as can be the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.479
 exhibitions that is 16 17 km are precisely 16 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.050
 and 17 seconds in short who wins is lost 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.600
 so a stopwatch has passed anyway 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.040
 thanks to a resounding god 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.040
 60 to 50 seconds 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.500
 then how it turned empty and yesterday I have 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.600
 done 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.750
 a minute to make a mile 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.540
 10 and today 51 net seconds 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.990
 divided into 9 seconds the peak visit 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:56.020
 yesterday I touched the beauty of today 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.820
 88 and a half there are machines 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.820
 athlete words to send 11 medals 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.100
 paralympic used to these 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.619
 lubricants if oil that 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.390
 thanks are exceptional discovered that in 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 good substance when I go to pronoun between 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.200
 my bicycle runs in a flow 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.950
 best way the map was in a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.959
 better way 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.940
 I don't know what the magic of this is 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.650
 what the concept is that it works there 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.840
 it could be a certain way because 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.500
 the oil that the instrument is about to pour 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.850
 with the dropper I say do it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.510
 miracles 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:34.620
 max is a soldier you have a double reason 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.140
 to participate one to try these 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.130
 reels and a variant win a prize 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.170
 clouds to actually try the 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.410
 juice your legs and yours 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.840
 physical abilities such as the miracle 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.010
 who performs this extraordinary oil that 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.459
 I wonder why he hasn't yet 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.530
 states fusion that deserves as well 55 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.600
 We applaud applause 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.459
 luca falasca compliments him but 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.980
 especially the magic oil not 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.920
 enough duplicate for luca 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.060
 Falasca 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.010
 twenty seconds are thirty seconds in the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.280
 100 seconds minutes yesterday with four 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.470
 Long oil drops begin to think 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.709
 what you want to do with start was he is there 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:24.140
 then the second performance 52 the 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.870
 power meter that allowed us 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.790
 to do this test is free of power 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.830
 be m 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.530
 so we had six bearings on it 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.540
 earned at the same power 7 seconds 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.180
 on ten gilera tracks clear data veil 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.620
 yes I must say that it is not bad but not 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.670
 tell your opponents too much 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.670
 why else?
