00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello to everyone today i will tell you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.510
 how to do 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:16.139
 birch kvass bottled now pouring 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:20.820
 birch sap is fresh to us in every 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.269
 a bottle of 10 raisin stuff is 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.230
 and stuff for each bottle and for each 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.230
 a bottle of pouring six canteens 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.500
 good spoons of sugar, I take the first 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:53.809
 got a bottle and not now we will show 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:53.809
 here are the legs here 646 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.250
 I want to say right away that I need a little bit 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.840
 less juice basically go in principle 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.190
 and so but when we will open 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:22.130
 bottle when the juice will be ready kvass 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:25.610
 due to the fact that he will be a lot of pressure 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.460
 there will be a long time going down 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.380
 of this airspace if 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.869
 more if there is more air 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.869
 space, then we will quickly lower the pressure 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:44.270
 because he starts to foam and than 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:49.580
 less there will be instead for gas for 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:52.130
 air the more foam will be long 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:55.880
 will unscrew but we we 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.970
 prepared so do so now 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.580
 we close the brew immediately say 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.179
 cold not fasting liz rabani that's how he 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.910
 came with a birch so he leaves 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:12.709
 here is this muscle 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.959
 mix you can do everything in one 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.150
 tare 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.250
 let's put all the juice into the pan 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.420
 add sugar stir 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.200
 add bottled raisins 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:31.209
 you can do well for you because 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 that we have a few bottles of only eight 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.890
 I already have the noise not to flow back and forth 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.670
 doing it like this 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.510
 it means the sugar will melt the bottle well 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.519
 we twist 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.739
 very good because the pressure will be 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.560
 big and we lay in horizontal 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.610
 position a dark place is possible under the field 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.260
 can basement 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:58.340
 Well, so that he does not freeze for a period 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.420
 about two or three months I did not make a reservation 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:07.480
 two or three months and it turns out in the middle 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.480
 end of summer perfect class chic 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.550
 good luck to you
