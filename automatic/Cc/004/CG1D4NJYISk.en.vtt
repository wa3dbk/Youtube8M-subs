00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
I'm working with loose by the way that's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.960 
I'm working with loose by the way that's
why<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:21.240> saying<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.500> once<00:01:23.460> that's<00:01:23.670> done

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
why I'm saying we so once that's done

why I'm saying we so once that's done
now<00:01:24.270> that's<00:01:24.689> boiling<00:01:25.280> we're<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> go

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
now that's boiling we're going to go

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.700 
now that's boiling we're going to go
right<00:01:26.759> ahead<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.119> check<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.320> right

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
right ahead and check and that right

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100 
right ahead and check and that right
there<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.159> done<00:01:29.790> because<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.270> soft<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:31.020> I'm

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
there is done because it's soft now I'm

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
there is done because it's soft now I'm
going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> strain<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.210> I'm<00:01:33.329> also

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
going to strain that and then I'm also

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.130 
going to strain that and then I'm also
we<00:01:34.350> are<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.890> wash<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:36.210> cool<00:01:36.810> water

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
we are going to wash it with cool water

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
we are going to wash it with cool water
so<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.610> will<00:01:38.700> stop<00:01:38.909> cooking<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.360> then

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
so that it will stop cooking and then

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
so that it will stop cooking and then
after<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.650> we'll<00:01:40.920> drain<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.610> if

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
after that we'll drain that so if

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.030 
after that we'll drain that so if
there's<00:01:41.970> no<00:01:42.150> water<00:01:42.360> left<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.140> we<00:01:43.799> are

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
there's no water left and then we are

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.490 
there's no water left and then we are
going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.579> set<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:44.909> aside<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.750> really<00:01:46.140> cool

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
going to set that aside to really cool

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.319 
going to set that aside to really cool
