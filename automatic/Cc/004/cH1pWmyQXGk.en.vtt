what<00:00:11.610> will<00:00:11.820> Texas<00:00:12.240> look<00:00:12.450> like<00:00:12.690> 100<00:00:13.559> years<00:00:13.860> in

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
what will Texas look like 100 years in

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.740 
what will Texas look like 100 years in
the<00:00:14.190> future<00:00:16.609> what<00:00:17.609> are<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.820> doing<00:00:18.119> now<00:00:18.420> that

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
the future what are we doing now that

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.439 
the future what are we doing now that
will<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> greatest<00:00:19.590> significance<00:00:20.189> then

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.509 

where<00:00:24.449> will<00:00:24.720> our<00:00:24.750> most<00:00:25.140> basic<00:00:25.439> resources<00:00:26.189> come

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
where will our most basic resources come

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.870 
where will our most basic resources come
from<00:00:26.550> food<00:00:27.449> water<00:00:28.439> energy<00:00:31.160> one<00:00:32.160> thing<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.610> know

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
from food water energy one thing we know

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.959 
from food water energy one thing we know
is<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.840> climate<00:00:34.200> will<00:00:34.800> be<00:00:35.040> different

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
is that the climate will be different

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.479 
is that the climate will be different
we<00:00:37.480> also<00:00:37.629> know<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.559> sea<00:00:38.800> level<00:00:39.160> will<00:00:39.460> be

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
we also know the sea level will be

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.709 
we also know the sea level will be
higher

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
higher

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.470 
higher
we<00:00:42.260> know<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.649> because<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.489> happening<00:00:43.940> right

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
we know it because it is happening right

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.270 
we know it because it is happening right
now<00:00:44.780> right<00:00:45.620> here<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:46.280> Texas<00:00:47.739> you<00:00:48.739> just<00:00:48.980> have<00:00:49.129> to

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
now right here in Texas you just have to

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.750 
now right here in Texas you just have to
look<00:00:49.460> very<00:00:49.670> closely<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.899> be<00:00:51.010> very<00:00:52.010> very

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
look very closely and be very very

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.020 
look very closely and be very very
patient

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.209 

based<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.239> tide<00:01:00.660> gauges<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.440> we've<00:01:01.649> had<00:01:02.010> out

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
based on tide gauges that we've had out

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.630 
based on tide gauges that we've had out
there<00:01:02.519> since<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.360> early<00:01:04.350> 1900's<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.430> some

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
there since the early 1900's in some

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.660 
there since the early 1900's in some
cases<00:01:05.909> we're<00:01:06.720> seeing<00:01:06.750> about<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.040> two<00:01:08.369> feet

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
cases we're seeing about one to two feet

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.300 
cases we're seeing about one to two feet
in<00:01:09.170> 100<00:01:10.170> years<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:12.780> translates<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.830> about

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
in 100 years that translates into about

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.780 
in 100 years that translates into about
two<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> half<00:01:15.810> millimeters<00:01:16.440> per<00:01:17.310> year<00:01:17.340> up

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
two and a half millimeters per year up

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.160 
two and a half millimeters per year up
to<00:01:18.000> six<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> half<00:01:18.690> millimeters<00:01:19.110> per<00:01:19.740> year

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
to six and a half millimeters per year

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.139 
to six and a half millimeters per year
so<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.500> substantial<00:01:23.280> rate<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.909> bit

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
so it's a substantial rate of a bit

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.090 
so it's a substantial rate of a bit
higher<00:01:24.659> than<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.380> global<00:01:26.100> rate<00:01:28.039> depending<00:01:29.039> on

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
higher than the global rate depending on

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.460 
higher than the global rate depending on
where<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.880> Texas<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.750> sea<00:01:30.990> level<00:01:31.350> is

where you are in Texas the sea level is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.340 
where you are in Texas the sea level is
rising<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:32.160> different<00:01:32.580> rates<00:01:32.960> there's<00:01:33.960> higher

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
rising at different rates there's higher

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.990 
rising at different rates there's higher
rates<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.429> upper<00:01:35.880> Texas<00:01:36.330> coast<00:01:38.000> rates

sea level doesn't just suddenly go down
again<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:17.370> will<00:02:17.670> continue<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.390> upward<00:02:18.600> trend

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
again it will continue that upward trend

again it will continue that upward trend
and<00:02:19.530> continue<00:02:20.070> rising<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.360> the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.630 

the<00:02:27.120> question<00:02:27.629> is<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.140> how<00:02:29.010> much<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.430> see

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
the question is just how much you see

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.539 
the question is just how much you see
level<00:02:29.910> going<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.180> rise

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.849 

Antarctica<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:36.849> Greenland<00:02:37.079> hold<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.319> central

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
Antarctica and Greenland hold a central

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.429 
Antarctica and Greenland hold a central
position<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.879> sea<00:02:40.510> level<00:02:40.780> rise<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.230> date

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
position in the sea level rise to date

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.879 
position in the sea level rise to date
because<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.879> ice<00:02:42.999> sheets<00:02:43.450> hold<00:02:44.409> a<00:02:44.590> great<00:02:44.829> deal

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
because the ice sheets hold a great deal

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.849 
because the ice sheets hold a great deal
of<00:02:45.310> ice<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:46.420> could<00:02:46.719> melt<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.319> become<00:02:47.590> part

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
of ice that could melt and become part

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.319 
of ice that could melt and become part
of<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.069> oceans<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.579> would<00:02:48.670> raise<00:02:48.909> the<00:02:49.150> ocean

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
of the oceans and would raise the ocean

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.330 
of the oceans and would raise the ocean
and<00:02:52.329> this<00:02:52.599> is<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.900> biggest<00:02:53.230> uncertainty<00:02:53.739> that

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
and this is the biggest uncertainty that

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.080 
and this is the biggest uncertainty that
we<00:02:54.459> have<00:02:54.670> about<00:02:55.180> sea<00:02:55.450> level<00:02:55.599> rise<00:02:56.939> there<00:02:57.939> are

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
we have about sea level rise there are

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.179 
we have about sea level rise there are
other<00:02:58.269> contributions<00:02:59.079> to<00:02:59.200> future<00:02:59.680> sea<00:02:59.859> level

other contributions to future sea level

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.759 
other contributions to future sea level

predict<00:05:30.949> that<00:05:31.039> in<00:05:31.310> 100<00:05:31.550> years<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.720> sea<00:05:32.960> level

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
predict that in 100 years the sea level

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.710 
predict that in 100 years the sea level
could<00:05:33.590> rise<00:05:33.650> 3<00:05:34.430> feet<00:05:34.729> that<00:05:35.539> would

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
could rise 3 feet that would

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.920 
could rise 3 feet that would
significantly<00:05:36.310> alter<00:05:37.310> our<00:05:37.550> coastline<00:05:38.210> the

significantly alter our coastline the

significantly alter our coastline the
current<00:05:39.680> sea<00:05:39.860> level<00:05:40.190> rise<00:05:40.340> is<00:05:40.729> not<00:05:41.090> a

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
current sea level rise is not a

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.210 
current sea level rise is not a

situation that humans have faced in

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.089 
situation that humans have faced in
modern<00:05:43.550> times<00:05:43.820> that<00:05:44.210> is<00:05:44.930> since<00:05:45.199> we<00:05:45.380> started<00:05:45.680> to

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
modern times that is since we started to

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.839 
modern times that is since we started to
create<00:05:46.699> built<00:05:47.000> environments<00:05:47.750> cities<00:05:48.080> and

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
create built environments cities and

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.219 
create built environments cities and
bulkheads<00:05:49.849> and<00:05:50.090> things<00:05:50.270> along<00:05:50.449> the<00:05:50.630> coast<00:05:50.870> sea

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.719 
level has never been rising in that
period<00:05:53.710> sea<00:05:54.710> level<00:05:55.039> is<00:05:55.190> going<00:05:55.310> to<00:05:55.580> rise

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
period sea level is going to rise

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.670 
period sea level is going to rise
between<00:05:56.479> a<00:05:56.509> meter<00:05:56.840> and<00:05:57.020> 2<00:05:57.199> in<00:05:57.349> the<00:05:57.440> next

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
between a meter and 2 in the next

between a meter and 2 in the next
hundred<00:05:57.860> years<00:05:58.190> we<00:05:58.699> actually<00:05:59.090> can't<00:05:59.360> change

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
hundred years we actually can't change

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.140 
hundred years we actually can't change
that<00:06:00.380> at<00:06:00.620> this<00:06:00.800> point<00:06:01.190> so<00:06:01.789> what<00:06:01.940> we're<00:06:02.060> going

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
that at this point so what we're going

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.610 
that at this point so what we're going
to<00:06:02.210> have<00:06:02.360> to<00:06:02.509> do<00:06:02.630> too<00:06:02.780> is<00:06:02.810> adapt<00:06:03.169> to<00:06:03.380> it<00:06:03.500> and

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
to have to do too is adapt to it and

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.040 
to have to do too is adapt to it and
there<00:06:04.250> are<00:06:04.280> two<00:06:04.460> ways<00:06:04.639> to<00:06:04.849> do<00:06:04.970> it<00:06:05.000> one<00:06:05.750> is<00:06:05.900> to

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
there are two ways to do it one is to

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.260 
there are two ways to do it one is to
try<00:06:06.259> to<00:06:06.320> defend<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:07.340> way<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.669> Netherlands

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
try to defend the way the Netherlands

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.450 
try to defend the way the Netherlands
has<00:06:08.449> historically<00:06:09.229> over<00:06:09.500> the<00:06:09.650> last<00:06:09.860> thousand

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
has historically over the last thousand

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.740 
has historically over the last thousand
years<00:06:10.490> or<00:06:11.889> you<00:06:12.889> can<00:06:13.159> move<00:06:13.580> and<00:06:13.909> retreat<00:06:14.720> from

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
years or you can move and retreat from

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.290 
years or you can move and retreat from
it<00:06:15.169> and<00:06:15.949> I<00:06:16.099> have<00:06:16.250> to<00:06:16.430> say<00:06:16.639> that<00:06:16.970> we're<00:06:17.270> not

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
it and I have to say that we're not

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.510 
it and I have to say that we're not
going<00:06:17.780> to<00:06:17.840> defend<00:06:18.139> most<00:06:18.620> places<00:06:19.220> on<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.490> coast

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
going to defend most places on the coast

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.850 
going to defend most places on the coast
because<00:06:20.000> it's<00:06:20.180> simply<00:06:20.539> going<00:06:20.659> to<00:06:20.780> be<00:06:20.840> too<00:06:21.259> hard

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
because it's simply going to be too hard

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.700 
because it's simply going to be too hard
and<00:06:22.159> too<00:06:22.220> expensive<00:06:22.789> so<00:06:23.719> we<00:06:23.900> will<00:06:24.050> defend<00:06:24.349> some

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
and too expensive so we will defend some

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.219 
and too expensive so we will defend some
places<00:06:24.979> but<00:06:25.700> we<00:06:25.909> will<00:06:26.120> in<00:06:26.300> fact<00:06:26.330> retreat<00:06:27.050> from

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
places but we will in fact retreat from

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:28.590 
places but we will in fact retreat from
most<00:06:27.500> places<00:06:27.770> that<00:06:27.950> the<00:06:28.190> cove

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
most places that the cove

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:40.620 
most places that the cove
over<00:06:28.780> the<00:06:28.870> next<00:06:29.020> century<00:06:39.240> historically<00:06:40.240> sea

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
over the next century historically sea

over the next century historically sea
level<00:06:40.930> has<00:06:41.050> gone<00:06:41.110> up<00:06:41.440> and<00:06:41.590> down<00:06:41.650> over<00:06:41.800> geologic

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.930 
level has gone up and down over geologic
time<00:06:43.320> before<00:06:44.320> people<00:06:44.590> built<00:06:45.070> cities<00:06:45.550> and

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
time before people built cities and

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.970 
time before people built cities and
bridges<00:06:46.300> and<00:06:46.450> things<00:06:46.570> natural<00:06:47.530> environment

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:47.980 
bridges and things natural environment

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.280 
bridges and things natural environment
just<00:06:48.160> moved<00:06:48.400> but<00:06:48.640> now<00:06:48.790> we're<00:06:49.120> in<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.360> way<00:06:52.290> if

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
just moved but now we're in the way if

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.260 
just moved but now we're in the way if
we're<00:06:53.530> gonna<00:06:53.650> have<00:06:53.980> natural<00:06:54.640> environments

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
we're gonna have natural environments

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.630 
we're gonna have natural environments
like<00:06:55.450> French<00:06:55.810> swamps<00:06:56.290> and<00:06:56.410> marshes<00:06:56.640> lowland

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
like French swamps and marshes lowland

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.120 
like French swamps and marshes lowland
forests<00:06:58.060> where<00:06:58.870> are<00:06:59.170> they<00:06:59.500> going<00:06:59.680> to<00:06:59.740> move<00:06:59.920> to

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
forests where are they going to move to

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.700 
forests where are they going to move to
we're<00:07:00.310> gonna<00:07:00.370> have<00:07:00.580> to<00:07:00.700> plan<00:07:01.000> that<00:07:01.080> and<00:07:02.080> the

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
we're gonna have to plan that and the

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.050 
we're gonna have to plan that and the
question<00:07:03.100> is<00:07:03.220> what<00:07:03.520> are<00:07:03.550> we<00:07:03.700> gonna<00:07:03.820> do<00:07:03.940> with

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
question is what are we gonna do with

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.220 
question is what are we gonna do with
the<00:07:04.120> stuff<00:07:04.330> we<00:07:04.360> leave<00:07:04.630> behind

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
the stuff we leave behind

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
the stuff we leave behind
I<00:07:09.840> understand<00:07:10.840> it's<00:07:11.080> difficult<00:07:11.470> for<00:07:12.010> people

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
I understand it's difficult for people

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.830 
I understand it's difficult for people
to<00:07:12.520> put<00:07:13.390> a<00:07:13.420> lot<00:07:13.630> of<00:07:13.780> faith<00:07:14.050> or<00:07:14.560> trust<00:07:15.550> in<00:07:16.120> things

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 
to put a lot of faith or trust in things

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.290 
to put a lot of faith or trust in things
that<00:07:16.990> they<00:07:17.110> can't<00:07:17.440> put<00:07:17.620> their<00:07:17.800> finger<00:07:18.370> on<00:07:18.400> can

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
that they can't put their finger on can

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.980 
that they can't put their finger on can
be<00:07:19.330> curious<00:07:20.730> and<00:07:21.730> so<00:07:22.180> that's<00:07:22.390> why<00:07:22.570> I<00:07:22.600> often

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
be curious and so that's why I often

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.730 
be curious and so that's why I often
fall<00:07:23.470> back<00:07:23.740> to<00:07:24.100> the<00:07:24.310> actual<00:07:24.820> measurements

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
fall back to the actual measurements

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.070 
fall back to the actual measurements
don't<00:07:26.740> emphasize<00:07:27.730> the<00:07:28.270> the<00:07:28.570> computer

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080 
don't emphasize the the computer

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.050 
don't emphasize the the computer
modeling<00:07:29.680> or<00:07:29.920> the<00:07:30.040> projections<00:07:30.760> or<00:07:30.940> the

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
modeling or the projections or the

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.500 
modeling or the projections or the
theory<00:07:31.680> just<00:07:32.680> look<00:07:32.890> at<00:07:33.010> the<00:07:33.100> facts<00:07:33.670> that<00:07:34.240> we

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.510 
theory just look at the facts that we

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.660 
theory just look at the facts that we
have<00:07:34.540> actually<00:07:35.350> observed<00:07:35.860> to<00:07:36.130> have<00:07:36.280> occurred

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:36.670 
have actually observed to have occurred

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.250 
have actually observed to have occurred
over<00:07:37.030> the<00:07:37.570> last<00:07:37.600> 100<00:07:38.530> years<00:07:38.560> and<00:07:39.660> it's<00:07:40.660> obvious

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.260 
over the last 100 years and it's obvious

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.140 
over the last 100 years and it's obvious
that<00:07:41.530> we<00:07:42.400> need<00:07:42.580> to<00:07:42.670> do<00:07:42.790> things<00:07:43.000> differently

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.150 
that we need to do things differently
