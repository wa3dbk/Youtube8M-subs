00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.140 

with<00:00:08.830> brink<00:00:09.160> we're<00:00:09.370> just<00:00:09.550> trying<00:00:09.760> to<00:00:09.820> make<00:00:09.970> a

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
with brink we're just trying to make a

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.730 
with brink we're just trying to make a
game<00:00:10.360> which<00:00:10.780> allows<00:00:11.440> easy<00:00:12.040> movement<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:14.349> not

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
game which allows easy movement it's not

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.010 
game which allows easy movement it's not
about<00:00:14.980> moving<00:00:15.790> all<00:00:15.969> shooting<00:00:16.480> it's<00:00:16.660> moving

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
about moving all shooting it's moving

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.570 
about moving all shooting it's moving
and<00:00:17.260> shooting<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:23.710> we're<00:00:23.830> doing<00:00:24.130> in<00:00:24.280> brink

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
and shooting what we're doing in brink

that<00:00:57.850> kinda<00:00:58.090> stuff

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.150 

we<00:01:02.820> went<00:01:02.970> through<00:01:03.260> probably<00:01:04.260> about<00:01:04.680> four<00:01:05.129> or

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
we went through probably about four or

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.430 
we went through probably about four or
five<00:01:05.430> stages<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.540> different<00:01:07.050> types<00:01:07.290> of

five stages of different types of

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.440 
five stages of different types of
prototype<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.550> for<00:01:08.820> figuring<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
prototype just for figuring out the

prototype just for figuring out the
technical<00:01:09.900> issues<00:01:10.290> we're<00:01:10.860> throwing<00:01:11.220> away

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
technical issues we're throwing away

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
technical issues we're throwing away
ideas<00:01:11.880> we're<00:01:12.180> picking<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.840> new<00:01:12.990> ones

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
ideas we're picking up new ones

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.460 
ideas we're picking up new ones
experimenting<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.190> kind<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.490> stuff<00:01:15.350> one<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
experimenting that kind of stuff one of

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.680 
experimenting that kind of stuff one of
the<00:01:16.530> secret<00:01:17.040> sauce<00:01:17.610> elements<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.330> break<00:01:18.510> is

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
the secret sauce elements of break is

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.180 
the secret sauce elements of break is
we've<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.770> nailed<00:01:20.100> controls<00:01:22.010> the<00:01:23.010> way<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
we've really nailed controls the way it

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.360 
we've really nailed controls the way it
works<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.610> you'll<00:01:24.210> run<00:01:24.660> at<00:01:24.870> obstacle<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.560> if

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
works is you'll run at obstacle and if

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.070 
works is you'll run at obstacle and if
you<00:01:26.490> hold<00:01:26.760> down<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.150> smart<00:01:27.420> button<00:01:27.660> you'll

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you hold down the smart button you'll

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.830 
you hold down the smart button you'll
actually<00:01:28.620> be<00:01:29.010> launched<00:01:29.550> over<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.540> it'll

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
actually be launched over it and it'll

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.450 
actually be launched over it and it'll
feel<00:01:30.990> completely<00:01:31.440> smooth<00:01:31.830> when<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.160> do<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
feel completely smooth when you do it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.359 
feel completely smooth when you do it
and<00:01:32.990> if<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.140> ain't<00:01:34.170> below<00:01:34.560> your<00:01:34.979> slide

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and if you ain't below your slide

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.870 
and if you ain't below your slide
underneath<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:37.650> smart<00:01:37.920> system<00:01:38.310> really

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
underneath it the smart system really

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.050 
underneath it the smart system really
does<00:01:39.090> impact<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.690> way<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.869> design<00:01:40.229> spaces

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
does impact the way you design spaces

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.190 
does impact the way you design spaces
you<00:01:42.060> sort<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.330> have<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> look<00:01:42.690> at<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> spaces<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
you sort of have to look at the spaces a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.370 
you sort of have to look at the spaces a
whole<00:01:43.530> different<00:01:43.890> way<00:01:44.750> when<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> level

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
whole different way when the level

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.499 
whole different way when the level
designers<00:01:46.830> put<00:01:47.009> together<00:01:47.280> levels<00:01:47.759> they're

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
designers put together levels they're

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.050 
designers put together levels they're
very<00:01:48.869> careful<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.770> make<00:01:50.580> sure<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.910> anything

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
very careful to make sure that anything

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.450 
very careful to make sure that anything
they<00:01:51.270> put<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.690> there<00:01:51.840> which<00:01:52.110> implies<00:01:52.710> some

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
they put in there which implies some

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.070 
they put in there which implies some
form<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.820> interaction<00:01:54.420> actually<00:01:54.840> does<00:01:55.050> that

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
form of interaction actually does that

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.350 
form of interaction actually does that
thing<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.460> doesn't<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.000> won't<00:01:57.210> put

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
thing and if it doesn't they won't put

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.900 
thing and if it doesn't they won't put
it<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.720> first<00:01:57.990> place<00:01:58.080> for<00:01:59.040> us<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.550> brink

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
it in the first place for us and brink

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.400 
it in the first place for us and brink
is<00:02:00.119> looking<00:02:00.509> more<00:02:00.660> at<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> environment<00:02:01.290> like

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
is looking more at the environment like

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.680 
is looking more at the environment like
you<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.800> a<00:02:02.070> real<00:02:02.310> environment<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.330> opens

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
you would a real environment just opens

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.670 
you would a real environment just opens
up<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.170> million<00:02:04.560> different

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
up like a million different

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.440 
up like a million different
possibilities<00:02:05.460> for<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.790> would<00:02:05.909> happen<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
possibilities for what would happen in a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
possibilities for what would happen in a
level<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:09.110> guess<00:02:10.110> what<00:02:10.260> I'm<00:02:10.350> most<00:02:10.769> proud<00:02:11.070> about

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
level I guess what I'm most proud about

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.130 
level I guess what I'm most proud about
with<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.820> smart<00:02:12.090> button<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.959> really

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
with the smart button is this is really
