00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
from the lava then I could be in real

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.609 
from the lava then I could be in real
trouble<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.580> could<00:01:06.789> be<00:01:06.970> glowing<00:01:07.630> red<00:01:08.020> one<00:01:08.410> more

hit and I'm down so that's the one

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.350 
hit and I'm down so that's the one

view on the PC set to max and the only
reason<00:04:01.910> I'm<00:04:02.300> playing<00:04:02.570> on<00:04:02.780> PC<00:04:03.080> is<00:04:03.140> we<00:04:03.350> have<00:04:03.470> the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
reason I'm playing on PC is we have the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.590 
reason I'm playing on PC is we have the
game<00:04:03.770> paused<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.910> hyper<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.300> I<00:04:05.360> were<00:04:05.480> doing

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
game paused that hyper and I were doing

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.360 
game paused that hyper and I were doing
for<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.900> high<00:04:06.020> rounds<00:04:06.470> so<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.070> can<00:04:07.190> fire

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
for the high rounds so you can fire

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.070 
for the high rounds so you can fire
multiple<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:08.000> look<00:04:08.090> at<00:04:08.180> that<00:04:08.240> I<00:04:08.300> almost<00:04:08.750> kill

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
multiple and look at that I almost kill

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.500 
multiple and look at that I almost kill
myself<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.680> actually<00:04:10.400> thought<00:04:10.820> I<00:04:10.880> was<00:04:11.090> gonna<00:04:11.300> go

down after jumping out that window and

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.310 
down after jumping out that window and
then<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:14.180> catch<00:04:14.390> myself<00:04:14.600> on<00:04:14.870> fire<00:04:15.020> I'm<00:04:15.200> like

these grenades until your empty

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.460 
these grenades until your empty
obviously<00:04:26.030> so<00:04:26.330> up<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.720> eight<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:26.960> them<00:04:27.230> at<00:04:27.440> a

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
obviously so up to eight of them at a

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.790 
obviously so up to eight of them at a
time

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
time

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.030 
time
see<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.490> played<00:04:28.760> on<00:04:28.910> PC<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:29.750> actually<00:04:30.290> it

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
see I played on PC it's actually it

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.400 
see I played on PC it's actually it
seems<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.490> bit<00:04:31.640> different<00:04:32.060> with<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.080> increased

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
seems a bit different with the increased

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.500 
seems a bit different with the increased
field<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:33.860> view<00:04:34.010> maybe<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.640> is<00:04:34.820> it

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
field of view maybe that is it

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.570 
field of view maybe that is it
but<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.990> zombies<00:04:36.440> seemed<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.040> be<00:04:37.220> taking

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
but the zombies seemed to be taking

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.730 
but the zombies seemed to be taking
slightly<00:04:38.240> different<00:04:38.810> pathways<00:04:39.290> when<00:04:39.560> I<00:04:39.590> was

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
slightly different pathways when I was

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.560 
slightly different pathways when I was
running<00:04:39.920> them<00:04:40.130> through<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:41.000> bar<00:04:41.210> I<00:04:41.450> got

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
running them through the bar I got

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.290 
running them through the bar I got
caught<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.900> few<00:04:42.140> times<00:04:42.440> man<00:04:43.160> went<00:04:43.400> down<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:44.090> only

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
caught a few times man went down I only

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.610 
caught a few times man went down I only
made<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.750> like<00:04:44.870> round<00:04:45.050> 30<00:04:45.380> or<00:04:45.560> something

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
made it to like round 30 or something

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.960 
made it to like round 30 or something
like<00:04:45.800> that<00:04:45.890> or<00:04:46.250> close<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:46.970> or<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.240> high<00:04:47.540> 20s

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
like that or close to it or the high 20s

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.730 
like that or close to it or the high 20s
here<00:04:49.970> on<00:04:50.060> PC<00:04:50.420> and<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:50.900> got<00:04:51.050> down<00:04:51.170> a<00:04:51.230> few<00:04:51.560> times

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
here on PC and I got down a few times

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.060 
here on PC and I got down a few times
just<00:04:51.890> because<00:04:52.220> they<00:04:52.520> seem<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:52.970> be<00:04:53.090> taking

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
just because they seem to be taking

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.460 
just because they seem to be taking
pathways<00:04:55.070> that<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:55.970> weren't<00:04:56.750> exactly<00:04:56.900> what

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
pathways that that weren't exactly what

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.470 
pathways that that weren't exactly what
I'm<00:04:57.560> used<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.920> but<00:04:58.670> that<00:04:59.060> doesn't<00:04:59.360> make<00:04:59.420> sense

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
I'm used to but that doesn't make sense

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.990 
I'm used to but that doesn't make sense
either<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.230> maybe<00:05:00.770> it's<00:05:01.010> just<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.460> change<00:05:01.490> in

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
either so maybe it's just the change in

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.910 
either so maybe it's just the change in
the<00:05:02.090> field<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.480> view<00:05:02.660> but<00:05:03.170> I<00:05:03.230> really<00:05:03.560> like<00:05:03.770> this

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
the field of view but I really like this

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.620 
the field of view but I really like this
field<00:05:04.160> of<00:05:04.310> view<00:05:04.430> you<00:05:04.610> can<00:05:04.670> see<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.540> know

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
field of view you can see you know

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.140 
field of view you can see you know
you've<00:05:05.810> got<00:05:06.050> that<00:05:06.080> wider<00:05:06.530> angle<00:05:07.160> you<00:05:07.700> can<00:05:07.880> see

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
you've got that wider angle you can see

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.260 
you've got that wider angle you can see
more<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:08.690> if<00:05:08.870> zombies<00:05:09.640> sneak<00:05:10.640> up<00:05:10.850> on<00:05:11.060> you

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
more and if zombies sneak up on you

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.760 
more and if zombies sneak up on you
you'll<00:05:11.900> be<00:05:12.020> able<00:05:12.080> to<00:05:12.200> see<00:05:12.320> them<00:05:12.440> a<00:05:12.470> bit<00:05:12.650> better

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
you'll be able to see them a bit better

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.920 
you'll be able to see them a bit better
than<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.100> can<00:05:13.370> on<00:05:13.700> console<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:14.510> they're<00:05:14.750> just

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
than you can on console and they're just

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.350 
than you can on console and they're just
trying<00:05:15.350> to<00:05:15.650> double<00:05:16.400> pack<00:05:16.580> punch<00:05:16.910> it<00:05:17.090> but<00:05:17.240> you

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
trying to double pack punch it but you

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.380 
trying to double pack punch it but you
can't<00:05:18.010> unfortunately<00:05:19.010> it's<00:05:19.250> too<00:05:19.400> bad<00:05:19.550> but<00:05:20.330> I

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
can't unfortunately it's too bad but I

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.640
