00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.759
 Hello and welcome to the state parliament my name is Timo Schulte today with the 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.189
 Piemont judge on the hand and thus not imagine so the announcement you can 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.119
 Little overcoming at the supermarket in search of the ten days 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 and maybe I'm so beautiful 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 so useful on my first stop on land I need transport for 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.390
 a preparation 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.800
 the Finnish below 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.640
 Of course that's just the question what is rice paper 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.200
 Dedicated enough is produced that means, of course, lives the 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.990
 Price from Pass Marcus Reis or Langkornreis 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.930
 is ground very finely 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.640
 and did not win 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.420
 then you have the full strength of starchy and whole 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.590
 Of course versatile use 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.400
 3 s 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.160
 Paper plattling 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.530
 then become just 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.220
 From this, I'm tearing it dead with water paint today into thin plates 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.990
 pressed 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.990
 gives a pen 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.240
 in gossamer 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.090
 chi-x layers like this 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.910
 Processed the whole thing you can see on the structure OFC oven dried 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.110
 and so it comes then just in the trade 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.420
 and in the preparation of rice paper, the possibilities are quite diverse 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.600
 That means this is enough explains not only in water in cold water 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.229
 Inlet is on sources and then it can fold in any direction and 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.520
 of course fillings from fishy meaty to vegetarian things 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 There are no limits to the imagination 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.890
 and in any form 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.930
 Well, the whole thing is of course more varied in Andes 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.860
 Not only can rice paper fry you can do it too stupid you can do it too 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.100
 You can bake it in the yard for a few minutes or just like at the typical 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.300
 Japanese Samo SAS first to Brawn and a bit of Knust Barumer too 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.860
 get raw materials released and then fight 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.079
 and for mine means no cross 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.669
 Namely, a package with you can not in the supermarket has to travel 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.289
 therefore 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.579
 namely as with custom II 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.089
 go on 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:28.469
 so cared for and as well as whole 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.819
 This is also a great food not only in the Asian cuisine 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.979
 no longer indispensable but also in the Vital kitchen 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.039
 There are of course different varieties once the unpeeled them 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.299
 say the peeled sesame and the completely natural black sesame 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.079
 naturally also unpeeled 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.659
 the pressed flower from the duffel bag Corvallis, of course, also one more 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.379
 great thing not only by the essential fatty acids very healthy 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.619
 can also be very action-packed 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:58.769
 Percent targeted in the application for salads fruit and because that's one 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.909
 great thing is and how our meatballs high schools want to climb Vital I 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.939
 do it as you expect 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.619
 and thus also to the cash register Barrichello a little something to prepare 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:09.579
 you have to see that soon
