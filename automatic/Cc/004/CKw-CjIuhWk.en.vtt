00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
ocarina code manager so I may decide to

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.600 
ocarina code manager so I may decide to
make<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.350> video<00:00:07.589> about<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:08.240> so<00:00:09.240> here<00:00:09.690> we<00:00:09.719> go

the code you're gonna click on that all

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.880 
the code you're gonna click on that all
we'll<00:00:50.399> just<00:00:50.789> use<00:00:51.210> God<00:00:51.629> mode<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.559> very

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
always had the code a hundred percent

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.789 
always had the code a hundred percent
correct<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:48.079> if<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:49.470> weird<00:01:49.680> reason

correct and if for some weird reason
that<00:01:50.250> code<00:01:50.460> does<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.700> work<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.540> might<00:01:51.869> not<00:01:52.290> be

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that code does not work it might not be

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.600 
that code does not work it might not be
a<00:01:52.590> working<00:01:53.130> code<00:01:53.310> anymore<00:01:55.280> because<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
a working code anymore because of the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.039 
a working code anymore because of the
patches<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.360> few<00:01:57.540> websites<00:01:57.689> still

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
patches I know a few websites still

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.719 
patches I know a few websites still
keeps<00:01:58.290> those<00:01:58.439> codes<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.310> their<00:01:59.430> website<00:01:59.700> I

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
keeps those codes on their website I

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.330 
keeps those codes on their website I
have<00:01:59.909> no<00:02:00.119> clue<00:02:00.329> why<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.439> after<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.009> you're

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
have no clue why so after that you're
