okay who's got this I can't stand to
think<00:01:55.760> of<00:01:56.060> dolphins<00:01:56.450> cotton<00:01:57.020> those<00:01:57.200> nets

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
think of dolphins cotton those nets

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.460 
think of dolphins cotton those nets
maybe<00:01:58.760> if<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.270> nets<00:01:59.540> were<00:01:59.750> made<00:02:00.050> out<00:02:00.080> of<00:02:00.260> a

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
maybe if the nets were made out of a

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.470 
maybe if the nets were made out of a
different<00:02:00.620> material<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.790> Dolphins<00:02:02.300> could

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
different material the Dolphins could

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.990 
different material the Dolphins could
slip<00:02:02.750> through<00:02:02.780> them<00:02:03.200> cool<00:02:03.800> idea<00:02:04.370> Olivia

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
slip through them cool idea Olivia

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.990 
slip through them cool idea Olivia
dolphins<00:02:05.960> also<00:02:06.530> use<00:02:06.800> echolocation<00:02:07.220> to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
dolphins also use echolocation to

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.969 
dolphins also use echolocation to
navigate<00:02:08.320> maybe<00:02:09.320> there's<00:02:09.619> something<00:02:09.830> there

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
navigate maybe there's something there

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.680 
navigate maybe there's something there
that<00:02:13.870> for<00:02:14.870> today<00:02:15.190> yeah<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:16.640> I<00:02:16.880> want<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.510> stay
