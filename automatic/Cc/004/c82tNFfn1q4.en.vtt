00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.790
 I would also like to take advantage of 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.250
 these project stories 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.320
 we are already in a complicated moment 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.820
 politician all leave to forget about 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.860
 the mortgage but do not forget they have 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.630
 mortgages have problems in the mood 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.220
 not always there suffering a bit better 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.330
 but we have the big problem that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.180
 we want right now is that no 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:34.280
 we understand and we are also tried 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.890
 bring to mix the theme of gestures 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.690
 of mime carry the words of the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.699
 politicians to all the people then 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.680
 material and try to create now a 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.680
 link between politicians and the people 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.390
 and the link the link 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.540
 I will try to explain a little bit what 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.650
 that they 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.650
 the volume more 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.520
 the finalization that was agreed upon was a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.869
 deferred idealization and how it was a 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.610
 compensation 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.180
 injured 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.840
 in the form of effectively simulating 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.320
 simulation or what is the deferred in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.940
 parts of one of what was once with the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.950
 reproduction had to have the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.180
 retention of social security is that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.100
 If it had not been 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.660
 now there is a lot of talk about payments that are not 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.180
 they have social security deductions 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.760
 true then here is that it was removed that 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.800
 he wanted to do as you have to do it is 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.450
 say with retention to safety 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.430
 social whose exterior I'm going to say something 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.250
 very clear there would have been something that 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.490
 hidden if it had led to that hide 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.640
 The party is more accomplished in Spain 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.320
 socialist and bouncing having access 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.050
 Absolutely to all the documentation 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.410
 official 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.030
 because a payment would not have been made in 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.790
 deferred compensation in the form 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.150
 of compensation or that payment had been made 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.060
 also giving it the form in its part of 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.950
 social contributions it was not understood that 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.500
 there was nothing to hide and there was nothing 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.600
 to hide and that's why bieber was made with 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.480
 that clarity was an agreement between parties 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.630
 today there are people who can discuss if 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.480
 it is more or less opportune if legally 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.390
 they are better or worse taken to a better or 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.020
 worse done than if there had been something 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.470
 military 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.470
 I repeat 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.560
 I have to remember that this does not happen 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.540
 never but that he also did not have any 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.910
 will to hide because I have to 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.560
 remember that he governed in Spain the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.050
 socialist party for which access 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.760
 to his position imagine both hacienda 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.760
 Social security is very easy 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.350
 of the popular party neither has nor has 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.350
 had accounts in a foreign country 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.620
 has given orders to open accounts in a 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.459
 foreign country 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.069
 we do not have anything to see and do not 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.720
 I have the least doubt that this is 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.569
 confirm by the administration of 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.599
 Justice 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.269
 as I have no doubt that 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:26.499
 the courts and the tax agency 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:30.969
 will do we know what it is that you have to 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:33.340
 do and we are going to do what we have 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:35.829
 said that we were going to do and that's why 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.290
 we will continue doing what we have to do 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:42.180
 do even though you do not believe that 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.180
 let's do it is that we have said
