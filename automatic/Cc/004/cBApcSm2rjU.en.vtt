00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
connected to the voice commands because

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.060 
connected to the voice commands because

commands rather than actual interacting

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.460 
commands rather than actual interacting
with<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.200> animals<00:00:23.790> and<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.960> just<00:00:26.170> doesn't

with the animals and it just doesn't
work<00:00:26.560> for<00:00:26.620> me<00:00:27.010> it<00:00:27.430> gets<00:00:27.640> a<00:00:27.760> little<00:00:27.880> bit

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.120 
work for me it gets a little bit

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.370 
work for me it gets a little bit
annoying<00:00:28.270> it<00:00:28.510> does<00:00:28.690> work<00:00:28.930> but<00:00:29.140> it's<00:00:29.289> just

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
annoying it does work but it's just

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.260 
annoying it does work but it's just
annoying<00:00:29.740> it's<00:00:30.010> easier<00:00:30.670> for<00:00:30.700> me<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.910> use<00:00:31.150> the

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
control pad don't know if that's because

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.189

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
how to do stuff before it can actually

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.460 
how to do stuff before it can actually
doing<00:00:51.250> such<00:00:51.760> as<00:00:51.910> tricks<00:00:52.270> because<00:00:53.020> sometimes

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
doing such as tricks because sometimes

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.170 
doing such as tricks because sometimes
ask<00:00:53.739> it<00:00:53.920> to<00:00:54.010> do<00:00:54.130> stuff<00:00:54.460> from<00:00:54.550> its<00:00:54.700> alias<00:00:55.030> the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
extra means are not available as we've

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.500 
extra means are not available as we've
just<00:00:56.469> seen<00:00:56.739> so<00:00:57.460> that<00:00:57.820> might<00:00:57.969> be<00:00:58.000> part<00:00:58.120> of<00:00:58.420> the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
just seen so that might be part of the

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
just seen so that might be part of the
problem<00:00:58.899> as<00:00:58.989> well

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
problem as well

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.610 
problem as well
first<00:01:00.850> impressions<00:01:01.450> it<00:01:01.690> looks<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.440> same

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
first impressions it looks the same

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.799 
first impressions it looks the same
sorta<00:01:03.100> layout<00:01:03.370> is<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.730> sim<00:01:03.910> Aspray<00:01:04.329> which<00:01:04.659> I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
sorta layout is the sim Aspray which I

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.660 
sorta layout is the sim Aspray which I
guess<00:01:04.960> is<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.259> idea<00:01:05.619> just<00:01:06.159> that<00:01:06.310> this<00:01:06.430> is

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
guess is the idea just that this is

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.340 
guess is the idea just that this is
added<00:01:07.240> pets<00:01:07.509> which<00:01:07.780> makes<00:01:08.020> it<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.200> bit<00:01:08.319> more

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
added pets which makes it a bit more
