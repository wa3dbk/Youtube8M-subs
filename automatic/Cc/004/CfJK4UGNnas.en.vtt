quality of any type of recording or
voice<00:00:28.750> transformation<00:00:29.560> let's<00:00:30.520> start<00:00:30.850> by

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
voice transformation let's start by

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.119 
voice transformation let's start by
listening<00:00:31.330> to<00:00:31.539> some<00:00:31.690> different<00:00:32.469> microphones

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
listening to some different microphones

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.119 
listening to some different microphones
and<00:00:33.839> seeing<00:00:34.839> how<00:00:34.960> it<00:00:35.109> affects<00:00:35.409> the<00:00:35.589> quality<00:00:35.710> of

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
and seeing how it affects the quality of

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.149 
and seeing how it affects the quality of
the<00:00:36.760> recording<00:00:38.129> okay<00:00:39.129> let's<00:00:39.640> start<00:00:39.909> with<00:00:39.999> this

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
the recording okay let's start with this

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.439 
the recording okay let's start with this
generic<00:00:42.159> microphone<00:00:42.819> that<00:00:42.999> came<00:00:43.210> with<00:00:43.420> a

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
generic microphone that came with a

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.660 
generic microphone that came with a
computer<00:00:44.019> that<00:00:44.229> I<00:00:44.260> purchased<00:00:45.039> about<00:00:45.129> 10<00:00:45.460> years

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
computer that I purchased about 10 years

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.040 
computer that I purchased about 10 years
ago<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.739> been<00:00:47.859> stepped<00:00:48.729> on<00:00:48.879> thrown<00:00:49.690> around<00:00:49.839> a

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
ago it's been stepped on thrown around a

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.700 
ago it's been stepped on thrown around a
bit<00:00:50.260> but<00:00:50.649> still<00:00:51.489> works<00:00:51.729> right<00:00:52.149> as<00:00:52.589> you<00:00:53.589> can

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
bit but still works right as you can

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.069 
bit but still works right as you can
hear<00:00:53.859> the<00:00:53.979> spectrum<00:00:54.460> is<00:00:54.690> fairly<00:00:55.690> tinny

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
hear the spectrum is fairly tinny

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.059 
hear the spectrum is fairly tinny
sounding<00:00:56.620> it's<00:00:57.039> got<00:00:57.339> an<00:00:57.670> OK<00:00:58.179> directional

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069 
sounding it's got an OK directional

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.360 
sounding it's got an OK directional
sound<00:01:00.959> signal<00:01:01.959> to<00:01:02.079> noise<00:01:02.109> ratio<00:01:02.829> though<00:01:02.979> isn't

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
sound signal to noise ratio though isn't

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.789 
sound signal to noise ratio though isn't
very<00:01:03.549> good<00:01:03.670> as<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.750> picks<00:01:04.899> up<00:01:05.049> other<00:01:05.229> things<00:01:05.560> in

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
very good as it picks up other things in

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:12.660 
very good as it picks up other things in
the<00:01:06.340> room<00:01:08.159> next<00:01:09.159> we<00:01:09.789> have<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.670> webcam

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
the room next we have the webcam

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.249

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
microphone that's attached to the

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.039 
microphone that's attached to the
computer<00:01:15.130> that<00:01:15.219> I'm<00:01:15.340> using<00:01:15.789> and<00:01:16.030> as<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:16.930> could

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
computer that I'm using and as you could

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.880 
computer that I'm using and as you could
hear<00:01:17.409> it's<00:01:17.799> got<00:01:18.009> a<00:01:18.039> tinny<00:01:18.430> sound<00:01:18.670> spectrum<00:01:19.890> not

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
hear it's got a tinny sound spectrum not

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.330 
hear it's got a tinny sound spectrum not
so<00:01:21.189> good<00:01:21.430> signal-to-noise<00:01:22.240> ratio<00:01:23.079> and<00:01:23.469> it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
so good signal-to-noise ratio and it's

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.920 
so good signal-to-noise ratio and it's
omnidirectional<00:01:24.700> it<00:01:25.270> seems<00:01:25.479> to<00:01:25.630> pick<00:01:25.810> up

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
omnidirectional it seems to pick up

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.450 
omnidirectional it seems to pick up
everything<00:01:26.439> that's<00:01:26.619> going<00:01:27.369> on<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.729> room

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
everything that's going on in the room

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.660 
everything that's going on in the room
next<00:01:30.460> you<00:01:31.420> hear<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.840> weird<00:01:32.409> sound<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:33.609> is

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
next you hear this weird sound this is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.139 
next you hear this weird sound this is
sound<00:01:34.479> coming<00:01:34.960> from<00:01:35.079> a<00:01:35.789> microphone<00:01:36.789> with<00:01:37.030> the

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
sound coming from a microphone with the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.130 
sound coming from a microphone with the
60<00:01:37.570> Hertz<00:01:37.799> electrical<00:01:38.799> hum<00:01:39.119> problem<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.299> some

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
60 Hertz electrical hum problem and some

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.800 
60 Hertz electrical hum problem and some
people<00:01:41.560> may<00:01:41.679> have<00:01:41.829> problems<00:01:42.100> with<00:01:42.609> this<00:01:43.119> when

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
people may have problems with this when

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.599 
people may have problems with this when
recording<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:44.499> it<00:01:44.590> definitely<00:01:44.799> it<00:01:45.189> causes<00:01:45.579> a

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
recording and it definitely it causes a

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.960 
recording and it definitely it causes a
problem<00:01:45.909> with<00:01:46.119> voice<00:01:46.600> morphing

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
problem with voice morphing

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.940 
problem with voice morphing
okay<00:01:49.120> back<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.690> original<00:01:49.950> microphone

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
okay back to the original microphone

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.190 
okay back to the original microphone
which<00:01:51.159> uses<00:01:51.400> a<00:01:51.520> USB<00:01:51.700> microphone<00:01:52.270> headset

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
which uses a USB microphone headset

which uses a USB microphone headset
it's<00:01:53.320> got<00:01:54.070> good<00:01:54.310> sound<00:01:54.670> spectrum<00:01:55.299> its

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
it's got good sound spectrum its

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.920 
it's got good sound spectrum its
unidirectional<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:58.450> got<00:01:58.659> good

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
unidirectional and it's got good

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.749 
unidirectional and it's got good
signal-to-noise<00:01:59.409> ratio<00:02:00.159> with<00:02:00.369> very<00:02:00.580> little

signal-to-noise ratio with very little

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.350 
signal-to-noise ratio with very little
background<00:02:01.330> sound<00:02:02.790> next<00:02:03.790> I'll<00:02:03.909> run<00:02:04.119> some

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
background sound next I'll run some

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.719 
background sound next I'll run some
tests<00:02:04.659> with<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.470> various<00:02:05.800> microphones<00:02:06.369> in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
tests with the various microphones in

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.059 
tests with the various microphones in
terms<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.180> how<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.899> transformation<00:02:08.860> comes

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
terms of how the transformation comes

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.440 
terms of how the transformation comes
out<00:02:09.399> you'll<00:02:09.970> be<00:02:10.030> able<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.239> hear<00:02:10.330> the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
out you'll be able to hear the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.150 
out you'll be able to hear the
difference<00:02:10.750> in<00:02:10.869> quality<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:12.040> voice

transformation<00:03:05.420> if<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:06.350> microphone<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:07.070> of

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
transformation if the microphone is of

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.100 
transformation if the microphone is of
poor<00:03:07.550> quality<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:08.480> will<00:03:08.870> significantly

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
poor quality it will significantly

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.730 
poor quality it will significantly
degrade<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.070> quality<00:03:10.100> of<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.300> results<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.620> if

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
degrade the quality of the results so if

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.200 
degrade the quality of the results so if
you're<00:03:12.890> having<00:03:13.040> quality<00:03:13.610> issues<00:03:13.970> with<00:03:14.120> your

you're having quality issues with your

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.410 
you're having quality issues with your
recordings<00:03:14.750> what<00:03:14.900> I'd<00:03:15.020> recommend<00:03:15.380> doing<00:03:15.860> is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
recordings what I'd recommend doing is

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.000 
recordings what I'd recommend doing is
evaluating<00:03:17.420> your<00:03:17.540> microphone<00:03:18.080> to<00:03:18.320> see<00:03:18.770> if<00:03:18.860> it

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
evaluating your microphone to see if it

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.510 
evaluating your microphone to see if it
actually<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.460> the<00:03:19.700> source<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.240> problem

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
actually is the source of the problem

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.630 
actually is the source of the problem
well<00:03:22.520> that's<00:03:22.790> it<00:03:23.030> for<00:03:23.270> now<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.890> is<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.190> end

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
well that's it for now this is the end

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.180
