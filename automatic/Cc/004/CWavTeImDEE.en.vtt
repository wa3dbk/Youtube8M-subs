00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
lot of times you get these little peaks

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.660 
lot of times you get these little peaks
of<00:01:19.570> highlights<00:01:19.960> on<00:01:20.170> top<00:01:20.679> of<00:01:20.859> your<00:01:21.009> details<00:01:21.219> and

those Peaks of highlights on top of
those<00:01:23.740> details<00:01:24.009> allow<00:01:24.939> the<00:01:25.299> viewer<00:01:25.570> to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
those details allow the viewer to

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.989 
those details allow the viewer to
navigate<00:01:26.829> right<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.340> those<00:01:27.520> things<00:01:27.789> that

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:27.999 
navigate right to those things that

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.480 
navigate right to those things that
you're<00:01:28.240> trying<00:01:28.689> to<00:01:28.869> point<00:01:29.049> out<00:01:29.170> them<00:01:29.409> so<00:01:29.979> the

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
you're trying to point out them so the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.090 
you're trying to point out them so the
quickest<00:01:30.880> way<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.570> like<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.170> like<00:01:32.499> to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
quickest way that I like that I like to

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.580 
quickest way that I like that I like to
selectively<00:01:34.030> sharpen<00:01:34.479> is<00:01:34.569> to<00:01:34.719> go<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:34.899> select

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
selectively sharpen is to go to select

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.609 
selectively sharpen is to go to select
and<00:01:35.829> go<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.700> color<00:01:37.179> range<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.780> then<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:38.409> go<00:01:38.590> to

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
and go to color range and then you go to

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.130 
and go to color range and then you go to
mid-tones<00:01:39.369> so<00:01:40.179> we<00:01:40.329> only<00:01:40.479> want<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.749> sharpen<00:01:41.020> our

mid-tones so we only want to sharpen our

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.270 
mid-tones so we only want to sharpen our
mid-tones<00:01:41.530> in<00:01:41.679> this<00:01:41.829> case<00:01:42.039> we<00:01:42.189> don't

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
mid-tones in this case we don't

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.270 
mid-tones in this case we don't
necessarily<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:44.560> don't<00:01:44.710> want<00:01:44.829> to<00:01:44.890> sharpen<00:01:45.100> our

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
necessarily we don't want to sharpen our
