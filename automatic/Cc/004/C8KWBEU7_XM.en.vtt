00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.140
 good to all of you nice guys in this one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.720
 new little tutorial 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.850
 today I will show you how to get the logo 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.530
 amulet what is it that was clean 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.530
 practically that instrument that you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.180
 was dining in the bring for speech 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.000
 Who has seen 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.950
 this time to take it will be 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.050
 must contact the bomber ex di 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.130
 so chaos is not a business at all 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.830
 with poetry 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.750
 if you like to collect pokémon and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.820
 you are particularly interesting 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.009
 breathing is a tool I recommend 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.750
 take this tool really are 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.060
 very simple to take once 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.160
 complete with the poles in fact it will suffice 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.320
 go to the second floor of the laboratory 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.480
 of professor club and once here 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.540
 show him the progress we've made 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.510
 with our vote the former then take 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.989
 their coins a necessity by force that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.260
 capturing the pokemon of chaos but that's enough 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.520
 but simply having seen them for me 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 achieve this goal i 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.500
 however preferred bill reform though 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.930
 this is simply a choice that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.749
 it concerns you after showing all 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.200
 progress of the pop texans of tara that 

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:15.240
 it is precisely 150 meetings for the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.369
 central kalos 153 for the coastal 151 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 the mountain one we will arrive so to 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.189
 finally get the husband or like 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.270
 the professor suggests the moleto 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.850
 allow to the point of finding some 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.039
 eggs more easily 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.310
 once this goal is reached, not 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:35.189
 which you can also complete the bobcats 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.630
 national to take an additional 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.299
 tool that will be given to us by 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.279
 professor club or whose I love very much a 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.889
 difference of this coin and before 

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.539
 money will allow us to increase instead 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:48.209
 the percentages of finding few but 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.340
 charlie also this would not be a 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.310
 bad tool indeed would indeed 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.039
 very useful and can also favor the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.950
 however, the masut method has failed to 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.899
 200 very high but not recommended 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.299
 with bones that should always be taken 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.159
 in consideration concluded therefore towards 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.560
 talk about the tools that 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.869
 need data completed pokédex completed 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.759
 I also wanted to say two words about i 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.819
 videos that will come these days 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.980
 then to the next video I intend to make 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.069
 going out will probably be that of 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.050
 and that will conclude the speeches of the pines is 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.870
 concluded this another very argument 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.720
 an important one will instead be a 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.360
 next contest very close that will be 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.599
 to undermine the thousand writings whose prizes 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.730
 they will be very interesting and winners 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.030
 will be three, but this is not the case 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.540
 I want to spoil you just as well 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.489
 boys 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.380
 so we are at the conclusion of the son 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.380
 thank you for watching this video 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.790
 and next we'll see you in short, all from 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.790
