00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.260
 hello then let's make a tiger 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.210
 using a toilet paper tube 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.250
 let's divide it in half one of 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.960
 they will be the body of the tiger and with 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.500
 the other half let's do the rest of 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.120
 parts the little ears and all that 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.910
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.220
 is to paint it like a tiger or kitten 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.990
 what do you want, I'm going to paint orange 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.599
 You could also use a color 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.800
 little bit more yellowish I'm going to paint 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.660
 outside and inside 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.780
 and if it's needed I'll give you two layers to 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.670
 that does not transparent the color brown 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.280
 while it is drying as I say with 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.840
 the other half we open it and I'm going to draw 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.260
 two triangles that are going to be the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.260
 ears 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.660
 after trimming and also I will paint them 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.070
 of the same color 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.560
 so that my triangles are the same 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.520
 I place one on top of the other and I go to 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.520
 remember the same way 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180
 here I have them 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.110
 I'm going to do the little legs too 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.650
 sitting down is going to be like a baby 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.650
 Tiger 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.180
 so I just do a kind of 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.500
 circle a little elongated you frame 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.040
 in front three crimes 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.560
 4 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.260
 it confirms it from the other I draw it and so 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.060
 I have two equal shapes simply 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.110
 you remember how I have done with the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.110
 ears mails this topic 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.470
 and for the tail I will also use the 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.120
 paperboard 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.770
 and the drawing as you are seeing a 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.820
 slightly wider on one side and thinner 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.820
 where the tail ends 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.270
 Well, I have my pieces here and the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.740
 I paint orange also for both 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.810
 sides 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.890
 waiting for it to dry and I'll give it a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.890
 second layer as I said 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.090
 it's acrylic paint you can use 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.399
 Temperas also 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.079
 then once I have everything dry with 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.310
 a permanent black marker I'll 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.750
 Draw the typical stripes of the tiger 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.750
 I'll do the queue on both sides 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.950
 and then I will make the body 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.850
 and that nap with horizontal lines 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.130
 now for the body to do the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.050
 stripes 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.230
 I'm going to simplify it and I'm going to draw 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.850
 three on each beige side and now I'm going 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.850
 to fill in to teach better 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.440
 you will see it when it is colored so 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.440
 Look good 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.620
 it's a kind of arch that I make from the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.459
 center to the top 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.459
 be curved 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.970
 You can do it differently if 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.440
 you want to draw the most lines 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.330
 randomized throughout the body 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.330
 the moons of the tigers are usually 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.150
 parallel between them more or less and I do 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.950
 the same on the other side 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.000
 when you see it drawn the dreams are 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.000
 you will see better do not worry 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.610
 and the marker has to be permanent 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.829
 so you paint well on the paint 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.170
 acrylic but by swiping the finger you can 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.040
 move the ink 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.040
 internal more 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.629
 in the back he finished it like this 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.010
 for the nose I made a triangular 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.370
 Pink color 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.320
 for eyes and whiskers with the same 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.400
 marker I make the two dots for the 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.400
 eyes and little mustaches 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.140
 if we have the little face without stripes in the 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.490
 ears to give them depth I do 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.490
 another little triangle inside in black 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.720
 and we would have here the parts of the 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.720
 Tiger 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.190
 well I will place the ears with a 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.870
 little bit of glue at the base and 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.139
 I put the part of alante near the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.139
 face 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.110
 where the eyes end a little 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.340
 open not too close together since the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.340
 they have separate 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.289
 other animals and I'm going to round them a 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:37.270
 little that I have been very pointy 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.719
 for the legs here I have them 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.719
 painted 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.020
 the little feet rather with a bit of 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.370
 glue I will place them as well as if 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.620
 I was sitting 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.620
 and you can see the little legs like that vÃ©lez 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.860
 we have the tail last as it is 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.249
 finite better I'm going to record it because 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.199
 completely the same if you let go 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:02.960
 he recorded it a little bit on the side so that 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.990
 see and we would have our tiger trio 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.240
 or kittens as you see it ready 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.680
 Here I leave you two other crafts for 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.020
 do if you want also with children 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.520
