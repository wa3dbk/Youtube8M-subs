00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.890
 so hello and welcome to learn 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.530

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.790
 happy to welcome you to this site 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.710
 on which I will teach you three 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.240
 very short fundamental lessons that 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.100
 will allow us the first 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.690
 to learn the first chords the 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.950
 second all that will be tablatures 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.960
 so you'll see it's a very average 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.030
 nice to be able to play small 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.710
 pieces and of course the rhythmic that 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.480
 will allow you to stay in the tempo 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.090

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.350

 but 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.310

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.299
 Yes
