00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.400
 Hello everyone today will be talking about 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.800
 This flowers in the card saw 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.309
 called a dollar tree by scientific 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.210
 replacing the paper bags you break the language well I will 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.150
 I will talk 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.460
 dollar tree how do I care because 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.730
 what was in the survey how to look after him 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.820
 so that it grows 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:32.219
 so when you purchase it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.649
 This tree is well small in pots here it 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.469
 need to transplant transplant need to 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.379
 pots a little bigger 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.170
 of what you purchased because it is very 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.860
 loves when he has 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.829
 the tubers right sit well potted and place 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.829
 so that was a little when the place 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.420
 little he throws more of these 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.789
 small shoots and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.370
 and quickly go down here you see I 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.850
 I bought it was probably 2 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.680
 or 3 branches here transplanted the average 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.790
 such a gruel was small 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.880
 he thickened me then transplanted here 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.680
 I think it's such a big deal 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.640
 put him in a big pot 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.130
 because he see instead of little he already 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.310
 a little slowed down in growth but not 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.970
 less growing and the soil should for it 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.340
 to be so whole as a light loose 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.280
 then he will be more comfortable 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.030
 feel another important moment like that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.329
 it does not does not like waterlogged watering 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.390
 I need it then I water it when 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.210
 the ground is already dry see that the ground is dry 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.549
 not once a week there as usual i 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.470
 I water all the flowers once a week this 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.259
 the flower is understood then when I see the earth 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.840
 already white and starts to dry right then 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.460
 we water it as a cacti family then 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.159
 there is he loves such a drought here sometimes 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.350
 it with splashes right now in front of the camera 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.009
 he washed to make him look of course 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.670
 beautiful too likes to wash here sometimes 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.340
 simply 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.750
 Dust splash some water through 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.299
 spray all 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.910
 he generally considers color to be lazy 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.519
 much care for him do not need any there 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.010
 gadgets sometimes feed up too 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.319
 however, when that's all these other 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.480
 flowers are fed normal 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.090
 purchased conventional fertilizer for 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.299
 flower and indoor plants for 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.030
 flowers for flowering and individuals and deciduous 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:41.269
 I didnâ€™t hit plants like that 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:45.390

 I haven't tried for me before 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.510
 such care is needed 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.220

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.849
