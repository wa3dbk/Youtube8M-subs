00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
most their models it's I think it's a

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.380 
most their models it's I think it's a
little<00:02:49.620> bit<00:02:49.709> better<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:53.390> articulation

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
little bit better so the articulation

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.110 
little bit better so the articulation
has<00:02:54.810> Pistons<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.709> both<00:02:55.950> sides<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.910> think

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
has Pistons on both sides and I think

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.220 
has Pistons on both sides and I think
articulates<00:02:57.690> pretty<00:02:57.959> well<00:02:58.170> each<00:02:58.920> side<00:03:00.230> the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
articulates pretty well each side the

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.190 
articulates pretty well each side the
wheels<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.860> am<00:03:02.040> really<00:03:02.370> impressive<00:03:03.200> because

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
wheels I am really impressive because

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.479 
wheels I am really impressive because
they<00:03:04.830> look<00:03:05.099> very<00:03:05.340> similar<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.500> actual

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
they look very similar to the actual

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.380 
they look very similar to the actual
prototype<00:03:09.180> wheels<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.459> including<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.880> tread

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
prototype wheels and including the tread

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.500 
prototype wheels and including the tread
design<00:03:15.410> ok<00:03:16.410> going<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.910> boom<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
design ok going on to the boom in the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.430 
design ok going on to the boom in the
bucket

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
bucket

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.490 
bucket
the<00:03:19.890> boom<00:03:20.459> race<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.239> about<00:03:21.359> this<00:03:21.720> far<00:03:22.049> this<00:03:22.350> is

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
the boom race is about this far this is

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.920 
the boom race is about this far this is
as<00:03:22.620> bad<00:03:22.829> as<00:03:22.890> high<00:03:23.100> as<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.310> goes

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
as bad as high as it goes

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.800 
as bad as high as it goes
really<00:03:25.440> nice<00:03:25.799> see<00:03:26.250> linkage<00:03:26.700> right<00:03:26.910> here<00:03:27.120> one

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
really nice see linkage right here one

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.800 
really nice see linkage right here one
thing<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.079> like<00:03:28.380> about<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.480> as<00:03:30.480> far

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
thing I like about it is this is as far

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.319 
thing I like about it is this is as far
as<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.140> bucket<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.709> dump<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.730> that's<00:03:33.150> as

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
as the bucket can dump this that's as

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.289 
as the bucket can dump this that's as
much<00:03:33.450> as<00:03:33.630> it<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:33.900> go<00:03:34.310> but<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.400> can<00:03:35.549> curl<00:03:35.819> up<00:03:36.000> a

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
much as it can go but it can curl up a

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.970 
much as it can go but it can curl up a
lot<00:03:36.750> more<00:03:38.209> but<00:03:39.209> yeah<00:03:39.870> that's<00:03:40.109> that's<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.680> fair

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
lot more but yeah that's that's a fair

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.879 
lot more but yeah that's that's a fair
height<00:03:41.400> for<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> wheel<00:03:42.600> loader<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.139> race<00:03:45.889> this

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
height for a wheel loader to race this

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:49.400 
height for a wheel loader to race this
SWA<00:03:47.220> end<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.209> bucket<00:03:48.540> were<00:03:48.690> attaches<00:03:49.200> to

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
SWA end of the bucket were attaches to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.680 
SWA end of the bucket were attaches to
the<00:03:49.920> boom<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:51.660> plastic<00:03:52.319> but<00:03:52.560> only<00:03:53.220> because<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
the boom is plastic but only because the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.150 
the boom is plastic but only because the
bucket<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.620> bucket<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:56.040> removable<00:03:56.989> so<00:03:58.160> I'm

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
bucket the bucket is removable so I'm

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.370 
bucket the bucket is removable so I'm
not<00:03:59.609> gonna<00:03:59.730> show<00:03:59.819> you<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.150> right<00:04:00.329> now<00:04:00.510> but<00:04:01.170> it

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
not gonna show you that right now but it

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.849 
not gonna show you that right now but it
is<00:04:01.620> removable<00:04:02.959> it<00:04:03.959> has<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.290> quick<00:04:04.560> attach

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
is removable it has a quick attach

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.559 
is removable it has a quick attach
system<00:04:05.310> right<00:04:05.430> here<00:04:06.980> so<00:04:07.980> that's<00:04:08.190> critical

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
system right here so that's critical

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.569 
system right here so that's critical
moving<00:04:09.569> on<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.900> back<00:04:10.049> of<00:04:10.230> machine<00:04:13.340> so<00:04:14.340> it

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
moving on to the back of machine so it

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.779 
moving on to the back of machine so it
has<00:04:14.850> six<00:04:15.239> opening<00:04:15.690> compartments<00:04:16.229> on<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> back

has six opening compartments on the back

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.710 
has six opening compartments on the back
in<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.970> first<00:04:18.209> two<00:04:19.039> are<00:04:20.120> just<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.329> normal

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
in the first two are just the normal

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.440 
in the first two are just the normal
engine<00:04:21.930> housing<00:04:22.610> compartments<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:24.030> get<00:04:24.270> into

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
engine housing compartments to get into

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.850 
engine housing compartments to get into
your<00:04:24.570> engine<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.530> even<00:04:25.710> have

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
your engine you even have

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.120 
your engine you even have
door<00:04:27.860> interior<00:04:28.550> detail<00:04:29.390> for<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.440> and<00:04:30.680> on

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
door interior detail for that and on

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.950 
door interior detail for that and on
both<00:04:31.340> sides<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:34.160> engine<00:04:34.520> block<00:04:34.790> is

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
both sides and the engine block is

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.190 
both sides and the engine block is
really<00:04:35.960> detailed<00:04:36.380> right<00:04:36.770> there<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.990> next

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
really detailed right there so the next

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.230 
really detailed right there so the next
two<00:04:39.380> doors<00:04:39.590> are<00:04:39.980> your<00:04:40.310> radiator<00:04:40.760> housing

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
two doors are your radiator housing

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.560 
two doors are your radiator housing
doors<00:04:41.450> on<00:04:41.780> your<00:04:42.020> side's<00:04:43.030> one<00:04:44.030> opens<00:04:44.390> right

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
doors on your side's one opens right

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.670 
doors on your side's one opens right
there<00:04:44.840> really<00:04:45.830> not<00:04:46.070> much<00:04:46.280> in<00:04:46.610> there<00:04:46.850> but<00:04:47.680> at

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
there really not much in there but at

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.890 
there really not much in there but at
least<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:48.980> opens<00:04:50.140> as<00:04:51.140> well<00:04:51.320> as<00:04:51.410> this<00:04:51.560> side<00:04:52.900> now

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
least it opens as well as this side now

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.470 
least it opens as well as this side now
I'm<00:04:54.200> actually<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.680> do<00:04:54.740> like<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.340> door<00:04:56.060> detail

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
I'm actually I do like the door detail

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.640 
I'm actually I do like the door detail
because<00:04:56.720> on<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.380> outside<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.640> actually<00:04:58.820> feel

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
because on the outside you actually feel

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.040 
because on the outside you actually feel
the<00:05:00.650> grill<00:05:00.920> each<00:05:01.190> tin<00:05:01.550> I'm<00:05:02.360> not<00:05:02.510> sure<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.750> do

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
the grill each tin I'm not sure I do

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.780 
the grill each tin I'm not sure I do
that<00:05:03.200> cuz<00:05:03.380> see<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:04.100> don't<00:05:04.220> see<00:05:04.430> anything<00:05:04.610> on

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
that cuz see you don't see anything on

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.240 
that cuz see you don't see anything on
the<00:05:04.880> inside<00:05:05.150> of<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.390> but<00:05:05.720> I'm<00:05:06.050> not<00:05:06.800> sure<00:05:06.860> but

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
the inside of it but I'm not sure but

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.530 
the inside of it but I'm not sure but
it's<00:05:07.370> all<00:05:07.430> awesome<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:08.270> then<00:05:08.960> on<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.440> top

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
it's all awesome and then on the top

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.480 
it's all awesome and then on the top
this<00:05:11.540> opens<00:05:11.990> this<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:12.980> top<00:05:13.160> of<00:05:13.310> a<00:05:13.340> radiator

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
this opens this is the top of a radiator

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.790 
this opens this is the top of a radiator
I<00:05:14.030> believe<00:05:14.570> this<00:05:14.720> is<00:05:14.780> where<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.320> put<00:05:15.590> your

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
I believe this is where you put your

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.850 
I believe this is where you put your
water<00:05:16.190> or<00:05:16.610> engine<00:05:17.060> coolant<00:05:17.510> into<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.560> machine

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
water or engine coolant into the machine

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.670 
water or engine coolant into the machine
on<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.550> engines<00:05:19.880> hot<00:05:20.380> now<00:05:21.380> if<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.400> open<00:05:23.680> these

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
on the engines hot now if you open these

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
to the price at the dealership that I

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.160 
to the price at the dealership that I
bought<00:06:26.510> it<00:06:26.600> from<00:06:26.750> I<00:06:27.590> only<00:06:28.190> paid<00:06:28.840> $26<00:06:30.100> so<00:06:32.170> you

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
bought it from I only paid $26 so you

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.960 
bought it from I only paid $26 so you
know<00:06:33.290> I<00:06:33.320> think<00:06:33.680> that's<00:06:33.980> a<00:06:34.630> really<00:06:35.630> good<00:06:35.720> price

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
know I think that's a really good price

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.220 
know I think that's a really good price
that's<00:06:37.970> with<00:06:38.360> tax

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
that's with tax

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.650 
that's with tax
so<00:06:40.620> I'm<00:06:41.190> not<00:06:41.370> sure<00:06:41.520> that's<00:06:41.730> how<00:06:41.970> they<00:06:42.150> set<00:06:42.570> the

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
so I'm not sure that's how they set the

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.650 
so I'm not sure that's how they set the
price<00:06:42.840> for<00:06:42.870> every<00:06:43.320> dealership<00:06:43.830> but<00:06:44.660> that's

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
price for every dealership but that's

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.090 
price for every dealership but that's
where<00:06:45.900> I<00:06:45.960> got<00:06:46.140> it<00:06:46.290> and<00:06:46.320> there<00:06:46.530> wasn't<00:06:46.740> even<00:06:46.860> on

where I got it and there wasn't even on

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.400 
where I got it and there wasn't even on
a<00:06:47.130> sale<00:06:47.460> and<00:06:47.670> that's<00:06:47.880> just<00:06:48.060> great<00:06:48.960> price<00:06:49.200> I've
