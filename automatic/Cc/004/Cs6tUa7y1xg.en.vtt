00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:03.909
 Becker and so there was and the return to the start 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.569
 my answer is again so the 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.889
 18 game day 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.329
 we last 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:13.810
 exchanged vigorously 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.429
 Become a player 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:17.320
 sold 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.999
 and everything and 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.550
 The coat will also take a few weeks 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.580
 but it's just about the Bundeswehr again 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.989
 my chips back here too 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.229
 the opening game of this second round and this game day is between 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.170
 Bayer Leverkusen and the autumn champion Borussia Dortmund 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.450
 the topgame 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.830
 is between 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.830
 climb 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 further 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.440
 the opening game 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.470
 eg milk 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.770
 as in the first round 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.810
 on a draw 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.810
 if I'm on one 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.870
 the Dortmund lost and in the first round only home game 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.360
 Bayer Leverkusen 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.390
 Dortmund won the euro 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.570
 many following games 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.800
 after the 0 2 defeat 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.380
 whole first round 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.720
 on the first day of a mail 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.450
 this match is between VfL Wolfsburg and Bayern Munich 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.960
 who or what else is the opening game now it's a Saturday games 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.610
 and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.410
 this encounter 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.410
 on an already to 1-home victory 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.320
 there Wolfsburg now 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.170
 can start again 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.140
 and 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.979
 the Bayern 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.000
 20 is the most optimal opponent right at the beginning 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.710
 but 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.880
 Aigner 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.680
 with that on 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.700
 good start to the second half 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.979
 for these encounters 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.800
 that between the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.129
 SV Werder Bremen and TSG Hoffenheim 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.129
 Therefore question is no longer coach of Hoffenheim 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.119
 and solo 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.869
 Generally this is the encounter 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.379
 the about 1 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:25.839
 Hoffenheim view 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:29.119
 good we have a super start 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:33.459
 I think that Hoffenheim now who wins but not so high 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.459
 if only with a 2 0 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.489
 because this meeting 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.839
 that between the first FC Nuremberg and 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:51.229
 Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach and the Gladbacher yes this goal in distress 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.359
 meanwhile 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.709
 most win 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.909
 with it 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.809
 come back from the top 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.809
 from the relegation battle and Don Berg 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.799
 they must not lose otherwise 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.529
 It could be that they went in there German 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:10.969
 and Skibbe way out bans I wins the new plant with two to zero 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.079
 de Maistre encounter between FC St Pauli and SC Freiburg and thanks 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.779
 Pauli has in the first round 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.369
 won impressively 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.499
 against the Freiburg 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.619
 but 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.519
 Now if you look at the table 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.219
 and 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.090
 Since you can almost be sure that 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.729
 iBooks will break light for the first half 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.189
 and I think they will do that, they will win 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 2 back 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.089
 the next meeting is one 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.029
 can one say surprise encounter 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.449
 I dont know 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:02.189
 if I am between VfB Stuttgart and FSV Mainz 05 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.190
 both teams surprisingly in their seats 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.410
 Stuttgart behind Mainz over who would have thought the beginning of the season 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.569
 I personally might not be here 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:19.720
 Forint 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.009
 I was Otts that Mainz 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.580
 win again 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.740
 namely with one 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.740
 2 1-win 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.789
 the next match is between FC Schalke 04 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.469
 and the Hamburger SV 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:43.360
 and 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.419
 XPhone to both camps 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.590
 Have friends 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.819
 I find it hard to actually clubs 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.699
 a team 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.699
 SuS to say that or that wins extremely 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.620
 but I think so 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.699
 that Hamburg 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.349
 with his many injury worries 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.599
 it does not manage to defeat Scheike 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.580
 but terror wins 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.689
 since she is currently 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.110
 maybe 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.379
 have found 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.639
 You can see that he plays like they do on matchday one 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.370
 and that's why carpet scares wins with 3 2 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.909
 In this encounter is also embarrassing 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.770
 in the table situation a surprise 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.770
 not Frankfurt more like the Hannover 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.969
 He can not expect healthy both to look so good 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.039
 and that's why the two are so good 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.089
 I can not win 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.329
 foresee and condemned for failing to draw 2 TSI 2 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:02.229
 Kauder for the last meeting 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.589
 which is there 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:06.589
 Kaiserslautern against Cologne 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.930
 Dirk Enke I once Kaiserslautern wins
