 Alice in Wonderland' 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.870
 I was in my boring house was one of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.300
 those days when you do not feel like it 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.429
 of doing nothing I told my mother that I was going 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.200
 to go out and find something to do I took the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.540
 keys and I left the house closing the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.550
 door behind me I started walking 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 towards the avenue to see if there was something 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.630
 interesting before I got there I got into 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.119
 a street I came to a kind of 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.130
 flea market began to loiter 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 in the posts first I came to a 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.720
 toy stand I noticed that there was a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.940
 pretty nice plastic plane me 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.250
 I fixed but there was nobody to attend 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.590
 the post when I took it to see it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.960
 better a hand I take mine raise the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.750
 look and I saw him an old man about 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.450
 85 years old I asked him the price 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.640
 of the plane he told me 20 pesos I gave them 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.309
 in my hand when I was preparing to follow 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.440
 seeing the posts he told me you hear that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.690
 toy comes with something special with a 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.910
 gift extended the hand in which there was 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.250

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.290
 I had never seen her I took her I smiled 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.400
 that old man and I started to see other 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.950
 posts 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.050
 besides that toy which was for 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.840
 my brother bought me a figurine of the 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.760
 girl death note and another one of bleach after 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.010

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.660
 of his friends I told him I was 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 well that I would be in the house frowned 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.830

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.900

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.390
 newly purchased the truth seemed pirate 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.580
 I put it in the DVD started with the screen 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.800
 in black little by little a kind of 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.140
 red mist formed the words Alice in 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.910
 the country of wonders' the truth 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.970
 had good image quality and the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.460
 sound also sounded pretty good 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.860
 film began as always alone 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.260
 that this time Alice looked very anxious 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.780
 anxious was in the kitchen took a 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.180
 knife from a drawer the camera focused the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.640
 door which slowly opened 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.740
 ie Alicia turned quickly 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.410
 He ducked and went into a small cupboard 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.720
 located under the sink entered a 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.120
 servant stayed in the kitchen watching and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.090
 then left her Alice is still 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.680
 she closed her eyes and fell asleep 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.260
 He woke up in a clearing full of trees and 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.629
 rare plants there were fantastic animals 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.599
 of colors had shapes which 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.840
 I had never seen I thought good 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.120
 silly effects of me she still had 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.010
 the knife then after walking 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.010
 for a long time the cat appeared 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.840
 smiling but his smile was different 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.569
 it showed sharp teeth and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.909
 stained upon seeing it alicia showed a 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.090
 demonic smile when the cat is 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:46.109
 approached he said you have small you're 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.970
 lost 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.310
 she just shook her head 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.319
 camera showed alicia's hand her hand 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.660
 only subject the handle of that one stronger 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.010
 sharp knife I just watched very 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.530
 attentive what happened 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.170
 the cat made a puzzled face said to 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.450

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.579
 hit her she smiled again 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.859
 very strange way she raised the 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.230
 knife stabbed him in the back the 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.209
 knife pierced the cat the cat moaned 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.159
 in a horrible way is even more 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.010
 he vibrated the chair he was in 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.870
 I stick even more to the seat the truth 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.390
 I liked the movie but it was 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.670
 the blood of the cat came out jets of 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.159
 blood all over the mouth and from 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.709
 her wound she was just standing there 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.260
 smiling watching as the cat was dying 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.269
 his moans little by little ceased until 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.730
 the cat died Alicia bent down and 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.950
 he opened the belly pulled out his intestines and the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.379
 left pulled he got up and left the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.299
 corpse aside kept walking until 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.519
 meet the mad hatter and the 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.500
 hare her before arriving hid the 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.690
 knife in a pocket of his apron 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.000
 sky blue color they invited her to take the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.340
 tea in the middle of the talk she pretended that 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.709
 his fork fell, he asked for forgiveness and he 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.140
 he arranged to lift it she put herself under 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.030
 from the table and pulled out the knife he put on 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.790
 front of the hatter's genitals 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.680
 Alice blushed I laughed at her every 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.049
 Once he was closer to the private area 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.090
 from the hat there came a time when 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.579
 he was less than two centimeters from his 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.379
 genitals she caressed the camera 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.780
 changed to the face of the hatter which 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.940
 blushed returned the camera to 'alicia 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.400
 she kissed the genitals of the hatter 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.199
 while he caressed them again he took out the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.539
 knife and he stuck it in the genitals 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.290
 began to drain blood from his penis 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.570
 trade 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.430
 a macabre giggle and took a swig of his 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.740
 blood while draining came out 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.930
 hastily and he stuck the knife to 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.090
 the hare in the throat she turned to 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.640
 the camera zoomed in on their 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.440
 eyes these suddenly changed him 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.820
 small spills began to come out 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.850
 until his eyes remained 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.220
 completely red I felt a pressure 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.260
 in the throat the screen went black 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.670
 but the pressure started to get more 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.940
 strong to the point of not being able 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.130
 breathing everything began to cloud I di 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.380
 a swipe to the front and I felt like 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.970
 If I had hit something I left the house 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.850
 and I ran into that old man while 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.040
 I ran he told me very calmly with 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.650
 that Alice liked you I will 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.870
 I kept seeing he told me if you do not believe that 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.820
 You are stronger than she is that bad 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.160
 by forgiving you will follow you until you get fed up 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.500
 you will continue it until you die 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.600
 he left and disappeared in the distance I 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.030
 I was thinking and I heard a voice behind me 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.100
 hee hee hee hee hee was she was alicia 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.080
 Now I'm never alone and every time 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.330
 there is a murder there is a stain on your 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.460
 blood on my back just in the 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.150
 neck of my shirt as if she 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.150
 will cleanse me
