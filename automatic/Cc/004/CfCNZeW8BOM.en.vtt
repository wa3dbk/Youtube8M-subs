00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.510 
beginning do know that and I would think
that's<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> reason<00:00:52.980> why<00:00:53.010> those<00:00:53.309> people

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
that's the reason why those people

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.639 
that's the reason why those people
