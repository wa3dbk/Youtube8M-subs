00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 the world agreement impossible in the 200s 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.200
 mixed in the less effective freestyle 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.840
 remains a claimant to the same sheet 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.870
 of one of the opponents vectors so to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.299
 three there is an Olympic champion 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.279
 18-year-old Asian champion 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.199
 faces unprecedentedly to one 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.789
 final so we'll see 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.130
 and then they are still suspended lane 5 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.170
 come to serious and star priests e 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.800
 strips the world champion in 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.779
 charge 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.009
 the woman of the Olympic double a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.170
 london in the back 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.120
 beyond any physical condition 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.149
 of law between the favorites and then 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.030
 federica pellegrini lane 4 the cimina 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.090
 one of the strongest players ever 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.360
 no other words are needed for her serves 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.829
 power serves the heart of federica 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.750
 to fly towards sports eternity 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.480
 the race in which the crazy variable is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.570
 up there in lane 1 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.670
 because he is the only athlete who could 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.370
 venture a very long passage 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.470
 fast is a more fragile thing thing 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.540
 which is not the net who and we have seen it 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.630
 some physical defects will come 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.240
 a few of them were recorded in the 200s 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.970
 left especially in the first part 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.450
 solid super mixed franklin champion 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.729
 at 5 but maybe not in great condition 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.680
 and then there 's america that came back to 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.800
 let us hope with the two great ones 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.899
 performance in the last two months from 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.479
 little moment of truth 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:39.250
 federica pilgrims lane 4 the final 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:43.470
 world in the 200 freestyle entrance 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.470
 the race begins in the water 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.979
 of federica pilgrims 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.619
 at the rocket and lane 6 and katinka 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.790
 hosszu but it is a competition to read 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.820
 all to use and tip to develop 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.340
 strong part 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.990
 if this morning showed a thread of 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.350
 fragility and fatigue 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.540
 this afternoon look for the ball right away 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.209
 in the rash passage for medicine 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.280
 it is seen in the 28 a passage that for 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.310
 she amazes the classic 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.110
 20 euro 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.420
 52 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.160
 hour of tests 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.790
 sixth with the passage we have 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.640
 then he felt once again 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.069
 in career because it is a chessboard 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.000
 aggressive part carlo bo the action 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.950
 of the bone in the return tank 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.050
 alive past 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.500
 passage becomes clear that of 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.310
 truth that is a sketch in some 184 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.760
 trentino 56 and 15 workouts 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.760
 if that 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.990
 and then this 56 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.910
 than one step was 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:57.140
 it's moving 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.300
 updated and the leg with delayed a 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.640
 look for them 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.760
 it was without the realization of 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.069
 favor the fund 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.280
 in the race but they are all Milan closes 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.280
 will induce katy to return 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.879
 one who meet 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.530
 26 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.530
 and now 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.950
 and the 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.950
 that of re buy 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.069
 the second during the game 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:44.409
 so far 55 32 flagship cordoned and the 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.069
 sixth consecutive time on the podium 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:51.910
 world federica but what it did 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.549
 that and the incredible echoes almost not 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.170
 she doesn't even believe the world record 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:01.930
 in the 1500 1 55 16200 gold medal for 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.049
 yet another time and then the approach of 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.440
 Melissa 55 and 49 procedures for the 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:11.379
 podium completeness but there is a federica 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.920
 pilgrims who answer this towards 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.590
 the Rio 2016 Olympic Games is one 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.190
 champion who never ended that 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.750
 federico show just the inter of the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:28.630
 time that does not pass to see her compete 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.970
 to always see it there at the top like 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.889
 this house structure is consolidated 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.500
 in the years 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.710
 perfect interpretation that does not leave 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.410
 escape 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.680
 the young woman who has something in 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.320
 more brilliant but she still 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.600
 present to always annoy the 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.480
 uncomfortable presence for anyone a unicum 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.360
 and if we want in the feminine field in one 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.670
 single race be competitive ten 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.740
 years away from the first medal 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:03.550
 the world with women is really is 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.050
 somewhat unusual something 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.490
 extraordinary federica got us used to 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.240
 always be over time 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.770
 present but it is when one walks his own 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.560
 road backwards that you see 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.540
 the enormity of this athlete in the day 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.450
 of his birthday federica pilgrims 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.510
 does anything ever done in the landscape 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:28.700
 of the female motorcycle six editions of 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:31.070
 row of the world on the podium and in the 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:36.680
 last four editions the story there 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:39.560
 Silver tells a gold or silver 55 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.380
 if I feel like I'm in termoli and secrets that 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.690
 feeling a hundred is this here lasts 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:49.539
 pilgrims in the last few weeks can 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.539
 quietly say that next year
