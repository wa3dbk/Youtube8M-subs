00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.830
 kevin prince boateng was not in the 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.840
 christmas bakery but in the university hospital 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.320
 Food here is part of the Schalke 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.310
 professionals children teenagers from the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.040
 company kindergarten as well as patients 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.960
 of hospital visits were naturally 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.000
 it after the welcome from professor 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.129
 eckhard nail to the medical director 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.620
 The clinic is a surprise for everyone 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.850
 and for the professionals, that's one 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.890
 naturalness 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.059
 we only see the sunny side of life 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.979
 we are football stars we have 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.690
 Actually we are fine and then we have to 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.280
 Of course you hold people who it 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.720
 not so good and the old one 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.229
 maybe have disability or sick 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.269
 are 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.100
 but I think with our appearance 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.129
 or with simple our presence 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.629
 we help the people already the danes 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.330
 a smile on my face and me 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.390
 think that makes us too 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.760
 happy can only ever 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.530
 then see what health means for 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.690
 people and also just for children 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.159
 This was especially hard to hit 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.710
 if we just go everyday 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.510

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.729

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.080
 Our trainer has you when you charge 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.030
 trained exercises today 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.520
 we were really good 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.380
 and then we have tactical 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.210
 trains like the chain of four too 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.190
 has to move like the four-chain 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.350

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.640

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.340
 impressed by the courage of the children 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.500
 supposedly appear big problems 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 but so small you can see that we on 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.180
 have very very small problems 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.739
 We lose or lose too 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.780

 buy if you see what everything here 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.470
