00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.750
 present a video to have the basics 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.450
 a little tutorial of the basics to create a 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.360
 to create a vehicle flying a robot 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.890
 kraft so first of all you go 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.359
 take the basic materials or finally 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.800
 your choice but I do it with the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.869
 basic materials to introduce you and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.050
 really it exceeds the game passes of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.449
 rotten words ok so continue you are 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.910
 a little girl like this for now 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:34.079
 so I'm going to take a seat pilot 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:41.129
 France pilot seat I grow 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:43.559
 a little the vehicle I take 2.6 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.210
 tétreault sister level 1 which will 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.390
 position like that for them to go 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 backwards it's very important to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.449
 on both sides we will give this 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.390
 unbalanced taxation so here is so 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.760
 after took 0.1 the aerosols e mail a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 man was the black man who points to 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.220
 before you do the same here but this 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:14.820
 name sense that 's the same thing like that 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.430
 here and I did not put this one tech 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.680
 here is not to remove that and we will put a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.150
 drift here like that so here you are 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.930
 have the basics to fly a 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.400
 device after after we can read added 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.860
 full of cosmetics wanted to add some 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.460
 radars a radar words I advise you 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.310
 to put a radar to put some 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.829
 guns 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.930
 everything you want and the job in 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.780
 underneath and avoid making kinds of 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.820
 branch like its width something like 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.780
 do not wait to make branches 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.170
 like that tac tac tac tac tac tac 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.250
 because if you break one of the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.720
 pins you're going really 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.580
 unbalanced compared to the other side 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.420
 and you are going to spit so I you 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.820
 do not advise to put branches 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.970
 like this is really to stay as 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.479
 that or putting cosmetics to the limit 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.360
 which is the custom simply so then 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:21.760
 now we will go to tests in 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:24.370
 gt mode are then so to move forward 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.650
 you're going to press z you do 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.000
 advance the vehicle he climbed a little and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.650
 to show even more to do 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.260
 mount the nose vehicle you to support 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.549
 on space the nose will go up the goal aja 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.730
 then fps choice and then it'll be 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:39.549
 stabilize normally authors here and 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.370
 then after you head with 7 usd 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.079
 normal unless you are all kinds 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.049
 qwerty keyboard and if you want you 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.519
 spend 11m usd for movements made 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.900
 stop shift 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.000
 even though I think everyone else 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.000
 know and on cool mc and windows 8 that 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.299
 walk there we see it's a little tutorial 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.299
