00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.780
 hi all users spaceshames are 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.950
 doctor white I'm here today with a video 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.629
 so scared of customers 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.969
 after a pretty full week 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.320
 passed on and honey stage 15 la 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.940
 review out the found in home 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.520
 page on spazioogames.it we are here with a 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.110
 new year video new glitches though 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.510
 then the clichet similar to that of the year 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.810
 last because many people already have 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.850
 started having a market gain 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.789
 over 40 million high 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.829
 credits without playing games and without 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.810
 have the players because best rose 0 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.079
 to say that they do n't even have a rose 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.340
 what is quite strange but mass 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.530
 accustomed because already last year 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.290
 there had been these problems already 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.090
 reported in a video as I discovered 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.780
 I discovered all this because 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.920
 reading on twitter I followed the boss 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.559
 ex cap should I say of last of bnl that 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.850
 it was a site that helped kids do 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.920
 understand why it marked you 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.570
 price trends during the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.040
 weeks so he has a curve ahead 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.560
 what he says but when prices went up 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.369
 and when the prices went down he has 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.499
 wrote this yesterday that there is a glitch 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.509
 which is affecting the xbox market 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:20.270
 so playstation market is not touched 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.249
 and reported it between reinforcements and vi 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.929
 I invite you to bring it back too 

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:26.270
 electronics to which there is this gleacher 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.329
 who are made to know that there are these 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.369
 people would only need a screen of 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.659
 market profits of the first and hope that 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.429
 they do something eventually not 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.929
 are real profiles because nobody a 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.329
 these gamertags that are those that you 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.389
 damage as soon as you start playing on xbox 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.270
 live so they are ruining this 

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:46.579
 play another one again 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.549
 honestly he wasn't undoing me 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.590
 food 15 because in any case the sale 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.950
 I grew quite easily 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.200
 I'm doing it with the players in shape 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.329
 a method that is practically equal to 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.709
 the one from our son is version 2 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.719
 then of last year's method 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.520
 take the information and make some use of the 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.009
 market, however, we will talk more about it 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.110
 in-depth in a new video was made 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.500
 quite well but this way loses 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.370
 however a little taste to do just the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.629
 basic intent 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.480
 it's not trying to make money 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.430
 money honestly other things than 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.950
 this first month of play to me 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.860
 personally I'm not feeling that much 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.250
 momentum and I want to say I don't have 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.780
 noticed the moment one by one a moment 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.950
 so strong then maybe there are those 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.780
 matches where normal but not 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.090
 certainly as strong as other years 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.879
 I noticed however that defenses are still from 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.730
 is also the goalkeepers register 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.769
 a little something is not good because it really is 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.540
 easy for agile players to aim the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.010
 leads directly from the kick-off 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.720
 if you are good at dribbling 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.420
 went to the door quietly then 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.239
 I still hope in a patch that the first one 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.209
 it's not been a month of play though I am 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.250
 already three weeks has not yet arrived 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.560
 hope for the best 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.129
 I want to be confident about a judgment 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.620
 more bad I'll wait for next month 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.239
 so we'll be back in November with 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.560
 these videos then update since 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.970
 I ask you your experience then 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.590
 tell me what you have in your hands 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.920
 weeks I have already asked on facebook not 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.389
 I want to ask you for it you can 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.340
 still save this game in my opinion 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.130
 still confirm my 8 why 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.019
 a drop of beautiful things and other things 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.519
 a little less too alone it is right to have 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.169
 it is not in b and campo vinci that he took 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.480
 name however is an excellent soccer game 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.889
 I think it's nicer than 14 in every 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.389
 case as we have done today if you see 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.739
 released bligh competitors registered on 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.519
