 [Music] 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.599
 we're back with the automatic your 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.840
 program on the world of automobiles 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.000
 made by and for those who are passionate about 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.010
 they evaluation this week brings a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.210
 old known our market and that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.920
 a lot of people like 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.880
 Let's see the impressions of Bethlehem Gomez. 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.880
 about the pitbull 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:34.110
 [Music] 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.540
 the fiat punto is another compact hatch of the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.100
 premium category using this 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.750
 signature to remind you that it offers a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.879
 a little more refinement in the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.230
 finish and also the best content 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.329
 technological 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.430
 but in his case has the strength of that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.309
 visual here more invoked than certainly 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.110
 also helps you with sales here in Brazil 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.360
 more than sufficient grounds for 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.010
 let's take a look at what has changed in your 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.010
 line for 2014 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 novelties that require attention to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.700
 understand what was changed because 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.610
 the line 2014 of the point gained more in 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.580
 content and practically kept the visual 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.890
 renovated last year outside only 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.960
 small touch-ups in the bumper 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 headlights and lanterns that have 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.479
 set of LEDs and the new wheels inside 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.600
 new white illumination for the controls 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.360
 and matte design effect which is a guide to 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:39.340
 light on the dashboard and door handles 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.340
 [Music] 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.640
 and how it has this feature of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.229
 sportsmanship on the outside you notice 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.909
 this in here too 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.740
 so it is worthwhile to go over those 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.729
 points here in the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.979
 interior 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.080
 first of all you really notice the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.810
 greater care with the finish and a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.640
 general visual very modern but what 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.979
 draws attention here and the good condition 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.380
 for the driver is that you have banks 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.689
 and has something very 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:17.160
 important that height adjustments 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:20.190
 and depth of the steering wheel space as 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.680
 good compact good for four people 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.380
 however this is not the strong of models 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.950
 from this segment the trunk for example 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.540
 has 280 liters of capacity size 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.030
 both standard and also offered 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.209
 by its direct competitors 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.860
 another novelty of the 2014 line is the increase 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.250
 of the serial items 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.220
 the first version to treat as 1.4 engine 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.769
 now features standard air conditioning and 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.109
 modern key of the penknife type with 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.620
 remote control while the most 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.510
 jet sport guys leave the factory with 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.359
 dna selector 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.190
 summary of the three modes of driving 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.190
 dynamic and autonomy 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.100
 [Music] 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.980
 but next to that a thing that comes 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.349
 helping the point a lot lately is 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.690
 the very clear division amusements that are 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.760
 offered by the model each account 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.220
 with the name of course but you can 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.170
 identify which version has a lot of 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.380
 only by seeing the size of the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.380
 motor 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.110
 [Music] 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.560
 we have the attractive fire evo 1.4 engine 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:40.620
 the essence with 1.6 engine and the torque 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.680
 sporting as 1.8 engine and torque and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.130
 sports t-jet equipped with 1.4 engine 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.849
 turbocharged petrol and 152 horsepower 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.190
 and the one you see here is the essence of 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.180
 intermediate and has more revenue 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.890
 balanced 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.120
 thinking about the price and package 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.120
 equipment that offers 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.180
 and that brings that kit practically 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.070
 for a car of this size where 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.560
 brakes with abs are included. 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:18.090
 front airbags for example 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.910
 in this case the 1.6 flex engine of 117 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.280
 horses with ethanol that wears well on 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.500
 size of this car here contributes to 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.810
 the good handling of the point that brings 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.210
 a well balanced balance between comfort 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.600
 and for those who also like a bit of 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.600
 sportiness 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.549
 [Music] 

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:42.799
 And look even with so many new features. 

00:04:40.549 --> 00:04:45.049
 quite interesting that they have just 

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:46.039
 arrive to dispute space with the point 

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:47.929
 Here in Brazil 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.389
 the truth is that it keeps on giving 

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:52.610
 very well because of these characteristics that 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.949
 we have here included the good 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.049
 strategy of clear division amusements 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.629
 but it's helped too. 

00:04:57.049 --> 00:05:01.489
 forget the strength of the brand that most 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.180
 sell cars here in brazil for the last 

00:05:01.489 --> 00:05:06.259
 years
