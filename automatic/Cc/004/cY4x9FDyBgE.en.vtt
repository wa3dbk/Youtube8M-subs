RC<00:00:23.340> plan<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.790> I'm<00:00:23.910> building<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.500> found

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
RC plan that I'm building so I found

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.570 
RC plan that I'm building so I found
this<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.490> glider<00:00:27.390> at<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.260> dollar<00:00:28.500> store<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
this like glider at the dollar store and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.869 
this like glider at the dollar store and
so<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.450> was<00:00:30.780> going<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.200> put<00:00:31.860> my<00:00:31.950> first<00:00:32.129> build<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
so I was going to put my first build I

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.110 
so I was going to put my first build I
was<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> build<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:35.160> flight<00:00:35.610> test<00:00:35.820> nut

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
was going to build the flight test nut

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.520 
was going to build the flight test nut
ball<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.050> flight<00:00:37.409> test<00:00:37.649> flyer<00:00:38.609> or<00:00:39.289> ft<00:00:40.289> fly

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
ball or the flight test flyer or ft fly

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.439 
ball or the flight test flyer or ft fly
or<00:00:40.589> whatever<00:00:40.949> it<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.190> called<00:00:41.429> but<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.269> found

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
or whatever it is called but I found

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.540 
or whatever it is called but I found
that<00:00:42.600> thing<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> buck<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.069> that's

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that thing and it was a buck so that's

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
that thing and it was a buck so that's
why<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.789> decided<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.359> go<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.230> mean

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
why I decided to go with that I mean

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:56.599 
why I decided to go with that I mean
it's<00:00:47.339> already<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.730> plane<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:49.019> it<00:00:49.890> weighs<00:00:55.609> 29

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
it's already a plane so it weighs 29

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.419 
it's already a plane so it weighs 29
grams<00:00:57.120> 28<00:00:57.629> grams<00:00:57.870> without<00:00:58.829> any<00:00:59.249> of<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
grams 28 grams without any of the

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.959 
grams 28 grams without any of the
electronics<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.229> this<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.159> what<00:01:02.519> I<00:01:02.549> add

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
electronics on it so this is what I add

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.480 
electronics on it so this is what I add
it<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:03.749> I<00:01:05.690> added<00:01:07.730> two<00:01:09.170> five<00:01:10.170> gram<00:01:10.590> servos<00:01:11.160> in

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
it to it I added two five gram servos in

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.480 
it to it I added two five gram servos in
the<00:01:11.580> back<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:12.330> five<00:01:12.510> gram<00:01:12.750> servo<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.490> 13.7

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the back or one five gram servo and 13.7

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.190 
the back or one five gram servo and 13.7
gram<00:01:14.640> servo<00:01:15.120> I<00:01:15.530> added<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.620> rudder<00:01:17.660> so<00:01:18.660> I<00:01:18.690> had<00:01:18.960> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
gram servo I added a rudder so I had to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.910 
gram servo I added a rudder so I had to
I'll<00:01:19.860> show<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> had<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.550> cut<00:01:20.730> off<00:01:20.880> I

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
I'll show you what I had to cut off I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.050 
I'll show you what I had to cut off I
basically<00:01:24.140> cut<00:01:25.140> off<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.500> back<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
basically cut off the back of this and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.440 
basically cut off the back of this and
extended<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.870> about<00:01:28.800> another<00:01:29.040> inch<00:01:30.860> added

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
extended it about another inch added

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.800 
extended it about another inch added
elevators<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.010> so<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> took<00:01:35.370> this<00:01:35.730> off<00:01:35.970> added

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
elevators to it so I took this off added

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.310 
elevators to it so I took this off added
the<00:01:36.990> dollar<00:01:37.830> trimming<00:01:38.280> foam<00:01:38.520> board<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.320> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the dollar trimming foam board one to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.410 
the dollar trimming foam board one to
make<00:01:40.620> it<00:01:40.800> just<00:01:41.660> a<00:01:42.660> little<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:42.960> thicker<00:01:44.420> yeah

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
make it just a little bit thicker yeah

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.770 
make it just a little bit thicker yeah
so<00:01:46.410> edit<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.070> put<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> servo<00:01:47.970> on<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:48.510> it's<00:01:48.690> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
so edit that put a servo on it so it's a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.420 
so edit that put a servo on it so it's a
lot<00:01:48.990> thicker<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.800> it<00:01:49.950> should<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.250> lot

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
lot thicker so it should be a lot

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.750 
lot thicker so it should be a lot
stronger<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:52.050> bottom<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.530> use<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:53.070> turnigy

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
stronger the bottom I use the turnigy

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.380 
stronger the bottom I use the turnigy
receiver<00:01:54.120> that<00:01:54.360> came<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:56.420> 9x<00:01:59.180> if<00:02:00.180> that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
receiver that came with the 9x if that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.570 
receiver that came with the 9x if that
in<00:02:00.510> focus<00:02:01.460> anyway<00:02:02.460> yeah<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.140> there<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.230> go

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
in focus anyway yeah but there we go

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.580 
in focus anyway yeah but there we go
yeah<00:02:05.580> that's<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.060> first<00:02:06.420> radio<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> chose

batteries and two motors which also I

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.060 
batteries and two motors which also I
have<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.330> motor<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.470> don't<00:02:35.530> know<00:02:35.770> what<00:02:35.950> to

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
have this motor and I don't know what to

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.620 
have this motor and I don't know what to
do<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.460> it<00:02:36.610> I'm<00:02:36.700> going<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.060> make<00:02:37.150> another

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
do with it I'm going to make another

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.170 
do with it I'm going to make another
scratch<00:02:38.050> build<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:38.800> any<00:02:39.010> suggestions<00:02:39.910> or<00:02:40.150> tips

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
scratch build so any suggestions or tips

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.030 
scratch build so any suggestions or tips
leave<00:02:40.840> them<00:02:40.960> in<00:02:41.020> the<00:02:41.110> comment<00:02:41.530> section

I<00:02:42.070> don't<00:02:42.910> even<00:02:43.000> know<00:02:43.150> how<00:02:43.210> much<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:43.510> weighs<00:02:43.750> I

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
I don't even know how much this weighs I

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.520 
I don't even know how much this weighs I
guess<00:02:44.110> that's<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.350> good<00:02:44.500> time<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.710> find<00:02:45.010> out

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
guess that's a good time to find out

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.570 
guess that's a good time to find out
let's<00:02:47.530> see<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:51.270> 31<00:02:52.270> gram<00:02:52.570> servo<00:02:53.110> or<00:02:53.580> 30

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
let's see this is a 31 gram servo or 30

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.350 
let's see this is a 31 gram servo or 30
gram<00:02:54.910> 32<00:02:55.450> grand<00:02:55.690> motor<00:02:56.020> and<00:02:56.740> it<00:02:57.070> is<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> 2000<00:02:57.970> kV

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
gram 32 grand motor and it is a 2000 kV

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.960 
gram 32 grand motor and it is a 2000 kV
so<00:02:58.780> any<00:02:59.590> suggestions<00:03:00.310> for<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:00.700> would<00:03:00.940> be

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
so any suggestions for that would be

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.930 
so any suggestions for that would be
much<00:03:01.780> appreciated<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:03.580> plane<00:03:04.290> weighs

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
much appreciated and the plane weighs

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.520 
much appreciated and the plane weighs
well<00:03:06.940> I<00:03:06.970> still<00:03:07.300> have<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.660> add<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.080> landing

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
well I still have to add the landing

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.320 
well I still have to add the landing
gears<00:03:08.830> but<00:03:09.220> I'm<00:03:09.340> waiting<00:03:09.520> to<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.970> propeller

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
gears but I'm waiting to the propeller

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.140 
gears but I'm waiting to the propeller
comes<00:03:10.720> for<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:13.300> it<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.720> about<00:03:15.120> 157<00:03:16.120> grams

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
comes for that so it is about 157 grams

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.530 
comes for that so it is about 157 grams
I<00:03:16.890> figure<00:03:17.890> with<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.070> propeller<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.120> everything

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
I figure with a propeller and everything

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.740 
I figure with a propeller and everything
it'll<00:03:19.780> be<00:03:19.870> between<00:03:20.400> 160<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.430> 170<00:03:21.940> for<00:03:22.390> total

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
it'll be between 160 and 170 for total

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.220 
it'll be between 160 and 170 for total
weight<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.970> think<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.720> should<00:03:25.900> be<00:03:25.930> good

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
weight so I think that should be good

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.510 
weight so I think that should be good
I<00:03:26.470> use<00:03:26.830> this<00:03:27.280> homemade<00:03:28.060> CG<00:03:28.720> machine<00:03:29.400> just<00:03:30.400> to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
I use this homemade CG machine just to

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.910 
I use this homemade CG machine just to
consoles<00:03:31.120> on<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.270> box<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.810> test<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.170> CG<00:03:32.560> and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
consoles on the box to test the CG and

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.670 
consoles on the box to test the CG and
how<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.459> calculated<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.450> was<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.989> just<00:03:35.230> checked

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
how I calculated that was I just checked

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.440 
how I calculated that was I just checked
the<00:03:35.739> balance<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.250> this<00:03:36.430> plane<00:03:36.670> without

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
the balance of this plane without

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.180 
the balance of this plane without
anything<00:03:37.900> on<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.410> then<00:03:38.590> after<00:03:38.860> I<00:03:38.890> put<00:03:38.920> all

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
anything on it and then after I put all

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.130 
anything on it and then after I put all
the<00:03:39.370> electronics<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.180> just<00:03:40.750> made<00:03:40.930> sure<00:03:40.959> it

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
the electronics I just made sure it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.330 
the electronics I just made sure it
balanced<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.890> same<00:03:42.130> spot<00:03:42.580> so<00:03:43.950> yeah<00:03:44.950> that's

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
balanced in the same spot so yeah that's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.460 
balanced in the same spot so yeah that's
how<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:45.610> worked<00:03:46.600> out<00:03:46.840> for<00:03:47.230> me<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:50.080> it's<00:03:50.320> the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
how that worked out for me so it's the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.740 
how that worked out for me so it's the
same<00:03:50.709> CG<00:03:51.340> as<00:03:51.520> this<00:03:51.760> one<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.030> hopefully<00:03:52.720> I

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
same CG as this one so hopefully I

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.229 
same CG as this one so hopefully I
should<00:03:52.930> have<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.200> same<00:03:53.410> flight

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
should have the same flight

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.180 
should have the same flight
characteristics<00:03:56.580> but<00:03:57.580> yeah<00:03:58.739> one<00:03:59.739> dollar

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
characteristics but yeah one dollar

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.130 
characteristics but yeah one dollar
the<00:04:00.670> glider<00:04:01.000> playing<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.810> is<00:04:02.380> um<00:04:03.810> 22<00:04:04.810> inches

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
the glider playing it is um 22 inches

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.320 
the glider playing it is um 22 inches
wingspan

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.980 

yeah<00:04:08.990> does<00:04:09.320> loops<00:04:10.160> stunts<00:04:10.760> long<00:04:11.180> flights<00:04:11.570> I

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
yeah does loops stunts long flights I

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.370 
yeah does loops stunts long flights I
did<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.560> glide<00:04:12.890> test<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:14.290> get<00:04:15.290> these<00:04:15.500> tires<00:04:15.890> off

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
did a glide test and get these tires off

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.020 
did a glide test and get these tires off
yesterday<00:04:18.380> when<00:04:18.560> I<00:04:18.590> did<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:18.920> glide<00:04:19.190> test<00:04:19.580> it

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
yesterday when I did the glide test it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.710 
yesterday when I did the glide test it
landed<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.860> the<00:04:21.860> motor<00:04:22.160> blew<00:04:22.610> up<00:04:22.850> but<00:04:23.540> that

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
landed and the motor blew up but that

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.750 
landed and the motor blew up but that
was<00:04:23.870> good<00:04:24.140> because<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.830> learned<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:25.340> lot<00:04:25.490> it<00:04:25.700> was

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
was good because I learned a lot it was

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.110 
was good because I learned a lot it was
actually<00:04:26.420> a<00:04:26.450> lot<00:04:26.720> weaker<00:04:27.280> because<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.940> hot

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
actually a lot weaker because the hot

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.390 
actually a lot weaker because the hot
glue<00:04:29.450> melted<00:04:29.990> this<00:04:30.140> foam<00:04:30.850> but<00:04:31.850> with<00:04:32.150> the

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
glue melted this foam but with the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.250 
glue melted this foam but with the
dollar<00:04:34.400> tree<00:04:34.700> foam<00:04:34.940> board<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.540> doesn't<00:04:36.110> melt

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
dollar tree foam board it doesn't melt

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.100 
dollar tree foam board it doesn't melt
and<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:36.830> made<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.160> motor<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.460> lot<00:04:37.730> stronger

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
and so I made the motor a lot stronger

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:49.630 
and so I made the motor a lot stronger
so<00:04:39.110> let's<00:04:39.530> give<00:04:39.980> it<00:04:40.010> a<00:04:40.160> test<00:04:48.100> all<00:04:49.100> right<00:04:49.280> there

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
so let's give it a test all right there

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.970 
so let's give it a test all right there
we<00:04:49.730> go

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
we go

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.030 
we go
the<00:04:52.000> elevator<00:04:53.000> works

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
the elevator works

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:04.000 
the elevator works
ailerons<00:04:55.040> work<00:04:55.990> rudder<00:04:56.990> works<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:59.470> motor<00:05:03.010> the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
ailerons work rudder works and motor the

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.210 
ailerons work rudder works and motor the
only<00:05:04.340> thing<00:05:04.520> I'm<00:05:04.760> waiting<00:05:05.090> for<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:06.220> prop

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
only thing I'm waiting for is the prop

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.700 
only thing I'm waiting for is the prop
and<00:05:07.490> then<00:05:07.730> I'll<00:05:07.880> be<00:05:08.030> all<00:05:08.180> good<00:05:08.330> to<00:05:08.390> go<00:05:08.710> this

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
and then I'll be all good to go this

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.970 
and then I'll be all good to go this
will<00:05:09.920> be<00:05:10.040> my<00:05:10.220> first<00:05:10.580> RC<00:05:11.450> plane<00:05:12.260> that<00:05:12.680> I've<00:05:12.800> ever

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
will be my first RC plane that I've ever

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.000 
will be my first RC plane that I've ever
built<00:05:13.340> or<00:05:13.610> flown<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:15.440> started<00:05:15.770> off<00:05:15.860> with

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
built or flown and I started off with

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.560 
built or flown and I started off with
this<00:05:16.220> little<00:05:16.550> helicopter<00:05:17.860> so<00:05:19.240> it's<00:05:20.240> kind<00:05:20.419> of<00:05:20.480> a

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
this little helicopter so it's kind of a

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.540 
this little helicopter so it's kind of a
big<00:05:20.750> upgrade<00:05:21.140> but<00:05:21.350> this<00:05:21.590> was<00:05:21.770> perfect<00:05:22.280> to

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
big upgrade but this was perfect to

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.140 
big upgrade but this was perfect to
learn<00:05:22.880> or<00:05:23.600> at<00:05:24.050> least<00:05:24.260> get<00:05:24.410> an<00:05:24.530> idea<00:05:24.650> of<00:05:25.280> flying

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
learn or at least get an idea of flying

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.810 
learn or at least get an idea of flying
something<00:05:26.630> so<00:05:27.590> I<00:05:27.650> got<00:05:27.830> that<00:05:28.010> because<00:05:28.190> I<00:05:28.669> can

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
something so I got that because I can
