completely Dwarfs the games when you put
them<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.790> which<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.510> kind<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
them in which I like it's kind of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.770 
them in which I like it's kind of
imposing<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:11.250> looks<00:01:11.490> serious<00:01:12.000> we'll

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.780 

which<00:01:18.710> I<00:01:18.890> believe<00:01:19.250> means<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.670> was

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
which I believe means it was

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.249 
which I believe means it was
manufactured<00:01:20.360> in<00:01:21.549> 1996<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:23.540> Saturn<00:01:23.960> first
