00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
mean this is like a huge bottle I don't

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.899 
mean this is like a huge bottle I don't
know<00:01:47.990> it's<00:01:48.200> like<00:01:48.289> making<00:01:48.770> heavy<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.429> I<00:01:49.610> don't

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
know it's like making heavy and I don't

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.120 
know it's like making heavy and I don't
know<00:01:50.000> but<00:01:51.130> right<00:01:52.130> now<00:01:52.310> they're<00:01:52.520> 24<00:01:52.909> 22<00:01:53.299> I<00:01:53.659> mean

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
know but right now they're 24 22 I mean

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.459 
know but right now they're 24 22 I mean
originally<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:55.390> $12<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:58.840> if<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.990> get<00:02:00.170> two

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
originally it's $12 and if you get two

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.490 
originally it's $12 and if you get two
then<00:02:01.310> this<00:02:01.939> would<00:02:02.090> be<00:02:02.149> 12<00:02:02.539> plus<00:02:03.319> 15<00:02:05.049> so<00:02:06.049> that

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
then this would be 12 plus 15 so that

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.400 
then this would be 12 plus 15 so that
would<00:02:06.770> be<00:02:07.239> twenty<00:02:08.239> four<00:02:08.479> dollars<00:02:08.509> for<00:02:09.140> two<00:02:09.259> of

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
would be twenty four dollars for two of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.100 
would be twenty four dollars for two of
these<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:10.009> together<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:11.450> would<00:02:11.540> be<00:02:11.720> twenty

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
these and together that would be twenty

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.250 
these and together that would be twenty
seven<00:02:12.440> dollars<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:13.099> 22<00:02:13.459> /<00:02:13.849> 24<00:02:14.390> 22<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:15.049> pretty
