00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.460
 today we are going to make a chicken salad 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.460
 grilled 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.630
 We started by chopping the pepper we cut 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.800
 in first in strips and then we're going to 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.800
 make some very finite dice 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.590
 sir the same with red pepper 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.590
 first some thin strips 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.880
 and then we cut without dice the moro 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.880
 own with the tomato 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.829
 we divide into four or five pieces 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.829
 of shells 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.469
 and then we chop 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.620
 the lettuce let's go back is important in 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.150
 see her and drain the good now 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.950
 let's apply the onion that I 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.950
 will accompany the sautéed chicken 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.900
 we clean the chicken I always advise 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.390
 remove the skin because they are less good 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.130
 fats that we lose the body and are not 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.630
 necessary and now in this case it is a 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.790
 against thigh what we are going to do is 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.460
 chop the fifth with a size that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.350
 we can eat that we are going to sauté in the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 pan back and forth and they'll be 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.270
 delicious and finally we cut the garlic 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.240
 on this occasion you also need 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.280
 Too much more and we're going to add the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.409
 chicken and when tempered what 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.299
 we will incorporate the salad we throw a 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.299
 little olive oil and sauté 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.610
 we incorporated the chicken 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.229
 it was time to assemble the plate 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.150
 then on the basis of lettuce 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.570
 We distribute the red and green pepper and 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.570
 tomato 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.380
 a little bit of fresh cheese with 50 grams is 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.730
 enough now it's time to 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.280
 put the neck that like him is already cold 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.230
 we take advantage of juice and see what we have 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.790
 asked before 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.189
 and we distribute it for all 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.340
 the caramelized onion to give it a 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.319
 special touch of insurance we give you a 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.700
 touch bringing a little cheese in 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.700
 this case semi-cured cheese 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.910
 a dash of oil before serving and 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.910
 great to enjoy 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.430
