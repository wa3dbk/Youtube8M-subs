00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
100% trust its accuracy but people don't

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.670 
100% trust its accuracy but people don't
consider<00:03:19.420> where<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.600> stats<00:03:20.900> are<00:03:21.170> coming<00:03:21.530> from

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
consider where the stats are coming from

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.190 
consider where the stats are coming from
okay<00:03:22.370> here's<00:03:23.090> one<00:03:23.269> thing<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.569> consider<00:03:23.660> about

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
okay here's one thing to consider about

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.059 
okay here's one thing to consider about
this<00:03:24.680> chart<00:03:25.540> seventy<00:03:26.540> percent<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.889> lead

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
this chart seventy percent of the lead

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.580 
this chart seventy percent of the lead
community<00:03:28.250> is<00:03:28.700> either<00:03:29.120> bronze<00:03:29.599> or<00:03:29.989> silver

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
community is either bronze or silver

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.210 
community is either bronze or silver
okay<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:32.090> seventy<00:03:32.959> percent<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.859> numbers

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
okay so seventy percent of the numbers

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.640 
okay so seventy percent of the numbers
that<00:03:34.400> go<00:03:34.609> into<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.030> chart<00:03:35.510> come<00:03:36.200> from<00:03:36.500> the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
that go into that chart come from the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.300 
that go into that chart come from the
lowest<00:03:37.010> divisions<00:03:37.819> in<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.480> community<00:03:39.310> so

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
lowest divisions in the community so

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.550 
lowest divisions in the community so
this<00:03:40.700> isn't<00:03:40.940> an<00:03:41.239> accurate<00:03:41.810> portrayal<00:03:42.260> of

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
this isn't an accurate portrayal of

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.009 
this isn't an accurate portrayal of
what's<00:03:42.980> good<00:03:43.459> right<00:03:43.730> now<00:03:43.970> this<00:03:44.690> shouldn't<00:03:44.959> be

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
what's good right now this shouldn't be

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.530 
what's good right now this shouldn't be
called<00:03:45.290> best<00:03:45.829> champions<00:03:46.609> in<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:47.090> game<00:03:47.269> or

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
called best champions in the game or

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.870 
called best champions in the game or
highest<00:03:48.079> win<00:03:48.319> rate<00:03:48.349> champions<00:03:49.069> this<00:03:49.639> should
