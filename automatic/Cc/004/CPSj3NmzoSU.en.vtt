three nails and a silver dime all

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.190 
three nails and a silver dime all
together<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:28.460> sound<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:29.000> it<00:03:29.150> gave<00:03:29.420> was

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
together and the sound that it gave was

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.190 
together and the sound that it gave was
an<00:03:30.410> iron<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.730> occasionally<00:03:32.360> jumped<00:03:32.870> up<00:03:32.960> to

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
an iron and it occasionally jumped up to

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.760 
an iron and it occasionally jumped up to
foil<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.390> couple<00:03:35.390> hits<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.960> got<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.380> to<00:03:36.470> jump

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
foil on a couple hits I got it to jump

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.280 
foil on a couple hits I got it to jump
up<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:36.950> nickel<00:03:37.640> but<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.300> kept<00:03:38.750> bouncing

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
up to nickel but it kept bouncing

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.260 
up to nickel but it kept bouncing
between<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.620> iron<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.520> nickel<00:03:40.940> or<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
between the iron and the nickel or the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.980 
between the iron and the nickel or the
foil<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.650> that's<00:03:43.130> silver<00:03:43.490> number<00:03:43.910> three<00:03:44.300> work

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
foil so that's silver number three work

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.190 
foil so that's silver number three work
