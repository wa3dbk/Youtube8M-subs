00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.390 
hot pan yes it starts to coagulate
instantly<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.840> get<00:03:22.049> lumps<00:03:22.380> if<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.250> add<00:03:23.370> a

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
instantly so you get lumps if you add a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.370 
instantly so you get lumps if you add a
bit<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.609> water<00:03:23.880> in<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.660> start<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.109> you<00:03:25.290> can

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
bit of water in to start with you can

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.080 
bit of water in to start with you can
break<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.769> up<00:03:25.859> very<00:03:26.069> very<00:03:26.310> easily<00:03:26.670> while<00:03:26.970> the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
break it up very very easily while the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.580 
break it up very very easily while the
heat<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.420> still<00:03:27.569> going<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:27.989> there's<00:03:28.170> no<00:03:28.319> lump

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
heat is still going and there's no lump

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.319 
heat is still going and there's no lump
forming<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:29.340> how<00:03:29.489> long<00:03:29.670> before<00:03:29.880> we<00:03:30.150> put

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
forming and so how long before we put

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.670 
forming and so how long before we put
the<00:03:30.420> chopped<00:03:30.630> tomatoes<00:03:30.660> we<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.380> break<00:03:31.560> this

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
the chopped tomatoes we just break this

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.770 
the chopped tomatoes we just break this
up<00:03:31.859> because<00:03:32.519> mince<00:03:32.880> you<00:03:33.090> know<00:03:33.209> if<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.750> are

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
up because mince you know if you are

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.770 
up because mince you know if you are
cooking<00:03:34.109> chunks<00:03:35.099> of<00:03:35.220> meat<00:03:35.459> yes<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.480> will<00:03:36.599> add

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
cooking chunks of meat yes you will add

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.319 
cooking chunks of meat yes you will add
tomato<00:03:37.139> in<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.859> meat<00:03:38.040> becomes<00:03:38.370> tough<00:03:38.639> okay

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
tomato in the meat becomes tough okay

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.199 
tomato in the meat becomes tough okay
okay<00:03:40.049> because<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.010> ascorbic<00:03:41.730> acid<00:03:41.760> in

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
okay because the the ascorbic acid in

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.449 
okay because the the ascorbic acid in
the<00:03:42.299> tomato<00:03:42.680> reacts<00:03:43.680> from<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.010> protein<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the tomato reacts from the protein the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.120 
the tomato reacts from the protein the
protein<00:03:44.489> suddenly<00:03:45.590> becomes<00:03:46.590> tight<00:03:46.799> isn't

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
protein suddenly becomes tight isn't

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.770 
protein suddenly becomes tight isn't
loose<00:03:47.310> enough<00:03:47.579> quickly<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.389> you<00:03:48.480> must<00:03:48.660> always

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
loose enough quickly so you must always

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.780 
loose enough quickly so you must always
put<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.230> matter<00:03:49.410> in<00:03:49.530> chunky<00:03:50.010> meat<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
put the matter in chunky meat and the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.300 
put the matter in chunky meat and the
meat<00:03:50.819> is<00:03:51.090> more<00:03:51.269> than<00:03:51.419> half<00:03:51.630> cooked<00:03:52.040> okay<00:03:53.040> go

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
meat is more than half cooked okay go

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.780 
meat is more than half cooked okay go
for<00:03:53.459> it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
for it

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.500 
for it
okay<00:03:54.569> let's<00:03:54.780> pour<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.079> in<00:03:55.430> perfect<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:57.450> want

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
nicely all around okay so the times for

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.690 
nicely all around okay so the times for
this<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.930> cook<00:04:07.139> depends<00:04:07.950> how<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.099> like<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.370> I

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
this to cook depends how you like it I

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.490 
this to cook depends how you like it I
would<00:04:09.030> cook<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.329> for<00:04:09.450> 10<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.840> 12<00:04:10.019> minutes<00:04:10.109> but

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
would cook it for 10 to 12 minutes but

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.500 
would cook it for 10 to 12 minutes but
up<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.709> half<00:04:10.889> ni<00:04:11.190> is<00:04:11.250> perfect<00:04:11.700> yeah<00:04:12.030> but<00:04:12.419> if

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
up to half ni is perfect yeah but if

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.360 
up to half ni is perfect yeah but if
it's<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.840> nice<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.319> low<00:04:13.470> fryer<00:04:13.799> just<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.220> liquid
