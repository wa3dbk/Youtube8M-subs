00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.810 
perfectly a second arrow or that switch
really<00:02:19.630> shoot<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:20.560> now<00:02:20.709> going<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.100> rain

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.730 

that<00:02:24.820> was<00:02:24.970> terrible<00:02:25.380> alright<00:02:26.380> let's<00:02:26.530> do<00:02:26.620> that

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
that was terrible alright let's do that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.920 
that was terrible alright let's do that
again<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.130> if<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.880> type<00:02:28.030> perfectly<00:02:28.570> as<00:02:28.780> just

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
again and if you type perfectly as just

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.420 
again and if you type perfectly as just
a<00:02:29.050> second<00:02:29.320> arrow<00:02:29.470> will<00:02:29.650> actually<00:02:29.980> spawn<00:02:30.220> so

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
a second arrow will actually spawn so

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.520 
a second arrow will actually spawn so
try<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.670> do<00:02:30.730> that

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
try and do that

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.470 
try and do that
