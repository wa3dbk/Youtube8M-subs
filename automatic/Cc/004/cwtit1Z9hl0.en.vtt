00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 welcome dear people at the pro 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.710
 passion than on the place we hide 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.240
 play assassin's creed black flag and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.550
 we have a little tip for you 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.099
 as you sit with your little troop 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.590
 conquer the larger ships 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.890
 as you can see we have one here 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.519
 level 21 known as just waiting 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.630
 to become better off 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.779
 what did you do for a stage and 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.230
 at the moment I can still do that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.230
 not say 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.480
 I have always been very excited 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.350
 instead of a sea battle with us now 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.600
 to deliver these things 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.440
 we leave the wheel and if you go 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.850
 was the piece here 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.500
 so you have to be careful sometime 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.340
 spotted one such a sharpshooter there 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.570
 but you should be in the right one 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.649
 rhythm dive breathe dive breathe 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.649
 so he actually gets caught 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.780
 You can do the same trick as this one 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.310
 Also apply to ships on the high seas 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.090
 it's just a bit more complicated 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.090
 answer 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:28.719
 everyone exactly or pursues if one 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:32.310
 pursued by but pirate hunter it is 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.310
 also quite easy to turn off 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:47.140
 luisa diving breathe diving in beautiful 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.679
 rhythm evenly so you get piece 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.679
 closer by piece 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.549
 so now we go on board first 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.960
 should the sharpshooters from above 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.280
 switch off do not hold off 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.920
 because we are pretty annoying when you are 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:28.799
 Down in the turmoil is constantly on one 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:31.489
 that's pretty nervous now 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.690
 let us plunge down into the turmoil 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.760
 It is essential in any case 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.580
 easier with edward we know that 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.600
 ship to go and the people all flat 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:48.000
 to do as with our ship us 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:50.810
 against such a 21-year-old frigate in the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.810
 to overthrow battle 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.980
 how hans that cleaned now again 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.750
 swim back 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.609
 as long as we are here a ship 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.609
 arrived us the jackpot 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.560
 the only person who prefers over 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.560
 planking 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:49.690
 Press here rather 1 and that is 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.690
 everything that lifts everyone's command 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.500
 we only have to keep going for 30 minutes 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.680
 not yet march on mars 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.680
 conquered 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.379
 finished now yes yes gaal scored then 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:11.420

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.420
