the orange light you put in your new
code<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.709> hit<00:02:14.860> pound<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.489> that's<00:02:15.910> pretty

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
code you hit pound and that's pretty

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.940 
code you hit pound and that's pretty
much<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.940> second<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.290> then<00:02:20.650> I'll<00:02:20.739> show

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950

kids don't get to one more anything
along<00:03:48.819> those<00:03:49.030> lines<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.980> seems<00:03:51.340> pretty

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
along those lines this seems pretty

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.900 
along those lines this seems pretty
sturdy<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.359> it's<00:03:52.600> pretty<00:03:52.959> tough<00:03:53.230> to<00:03:53.410> get<00:03:53.530> into

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
sturdy and it's pretty tough to get into

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.340 
sturdy and it's pretty tough to get into
it's<00:03:54.910> gonna<00:03:55.000> take<00:03:55.239> some<00:03:55.389> effort<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.900> get<00:03:56.049> into
