00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:05.010
 In fact companies eat the system has been introduced 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.790
 I heard about shipping 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.530
 7 of Sick House Syndrome in Daily TV News 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.629
 Ignite the platform 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.869
 I have to raise a little 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.869
 I think I will do it three times 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.039
 Profit for a drinking party newspaper 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:23.789
 mere 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.789
 The department commented that fraud occurred frequently 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.460
 So it won't be for plain mobile devices 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.270
 It feels like it's pretty good to be addressed 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.510
 It was refreshing 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.000
 At that house, I am raising the power of the couple who came as a daughter couple beautifully 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.710
 Entering 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.050
 That just 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.089
 I'm around high school students 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:56.169
 In Germany that version of nuclear power planters can say 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.930
 Watanabe communication 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.470
 I am interested in hitting 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.910
 Takayama also in Japan 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.240
 It is said that 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 In front of Atsugi city system 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.719
 I thought it might have been to maintain 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.050
 Mainstay 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.560
 Because it differs by about 23 degrees when it is used, the 65th place of high is a general candidate 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.090
 This is also quite different from 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.630
 Full length. Comfortable 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.030
 It's that heat, so I entered the room, and in the meanwhile, I felt so much like it 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.810
 Even if I can not see it 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.870
 It's been accused of entering from outside that 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.920
 That very 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.110
 That's comfortable It's my first victory from now on 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.460
 If you use it 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.560
 That there really is that nuclear power generation 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.630
 It may be that second point 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.630
 I think it's kind of going forward 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.780
 Get up early 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.240
 It feels like that cold 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.770
 It is not 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.580
 Battle chat 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.580
 It is natural but in Minneapolis 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.140
 As I wanted to make the most of living 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.369
 As we take s 8 years with 62.7% 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.109
 By any means 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.299
 Then there is no temperature difference 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.899
 I want to live 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.539
 I thought 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.539
 I'm going to keep going 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:21.740
 I am satisfied
