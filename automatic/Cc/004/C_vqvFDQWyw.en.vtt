00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.840
 hi there is mixon 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.030
 m our today's lesson 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.160
 how to paint cement pancakes and so 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.500
 to start us 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.630
 will install it and so damn 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.110
 it is now set to paint it 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.480
 we take paint on the way one more such 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.099
 moment 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.099
 pancake corners when you cook them 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:47.269
 on paper but herringbone there is empty without corners 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.460
 were a little bit accurate because if their 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.829
 Nice to put can break off 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.040
 let's say I have a little bit 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:02.480
 it turned out that from the very reason for 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:16.399
 you see it and so the edges are cut off and 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:19.990
 Now we will start to start painting so 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.990
 here is the top 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.910
 so the upper part is painted now 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:58.020
 We will paint the side of the first with 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:58.020
 one side then the other 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.680
 so damn completely painted now 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.810
 leave it so in that position on 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.160
 a few hours to Casco froze and 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.650
 so went a couple of hours 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.090
 the paint is already under the frost, you can even 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.420
 check but that's all 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.010
 it remains only now and in general to invest 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.580
 bag show kilogram because I 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:03:37.519
 still not take now we are there 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:42.739
 so we put his bag his wheel well as 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:48.340
 see 10 kilogram and so made 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.340
 now we will sign that there are 10 kilograms in it 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.670
 what else would you like to say about 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.090
 paint selection well paint can 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.459
 use any night of course taking 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.140
 primer as it is not peeled off 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.120
 when you paint on cement and it is cheaper 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.900
 the rest 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.720
 what else can I say such pancakes 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.329

 pieces that is 200 kilograms 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.270
 and I completely miss them because even though I 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.920
 I go to the gym 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.550
 because some exercises are 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.310
 as bench press or squat already with good 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.430
 weight itself can not be overcome because 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.880
 what happens can push but such 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.650

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.730
