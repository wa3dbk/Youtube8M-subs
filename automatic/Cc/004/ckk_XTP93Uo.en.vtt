so<00:00:12.900> here<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.790> an<00:00:14.790> example<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.389> our<00:00:15.540> new

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
so here we have an example of our new

so here we have an example of our new
star<00:00:15.870> map<00:00:16.130> people<00:00:17.130> familiar<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.000> from

star map people familiar with it from
the<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:18.449> game<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.930> terms<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:20.220> being<00:00:20.279> 3d

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
the first game in terms of it being 3d

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.500 
the first game in terms of it being 3d
but<00:00:22.769> whereas<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.310> first<00:00:23.550> game<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.269> color

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
but whereas in the first game the color

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.300 
but whereas in the first game the color
field<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.380> affectionately<00:00:25.890> nicknamed

field that we affectionately nicknamed
the<00:00:26.730> skittle<00:00:27.029> verse<00:00:28.310> look<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.670> was<00:00:29.880> pretty

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the skittle verse look it was pretty

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
solar systems built in around them so

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.670 
solar systems built in around them so
there<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> more<00:00:47.940> information<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.379> gleaned

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
there is more information to be gleaned

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.970 
there is more information to be gleaned
from<00:00:49.890> looking<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.520> star<00:00:50.700> map<00:00:51.829> which<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
from looking at your star map which is a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
from looking at your star map which is a
big<00:00:53.160> change<00:00:53.340> from<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> first<00:00:53.940> game<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.449> idea

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
big change from the first game the idea

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.220 
big change from the first game the idea
that<00:00:55.910> instead<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.239> star<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:57.510> planet<00:00:58.079> now

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that instead of one star one planet now

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.319 
that instead of one star one planet now
you're<00:00:58.379> looking<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.890> star<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> you're

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you're looking at one star and you're

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.779 
you're looking at one star and you're
looking<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:01.170> orbits<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.789> multiple

planets and planets having moons and
also<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> refines<00:01:06.900> when<00:01:07.110> putting<00:01:07.350> in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
also one of the refines when putting in

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.719 
also one of the refines when putting in
is<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:07.740> putting<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.010> terrain<00:01:08.280> along<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
is we're putting in terrain along the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.960 
is we're putting in terrain along the
lines<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.119> gas<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.659> dust<00:01:10.049> nebulas<00:01:10.770> which<00:01:11.700> will

lines of gas and dust nebulas which will

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
lines of gas and dust nebulas which will
have<00:01:12.119> detrimental<00:01:12.330> effects<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.590> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
have detrimental effects if you have to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
have detrimental effects if you have to
travel<00:01:14.040> between<00:01:14.340> them<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.850> get<00:01:14.970> two<00:01:15.119> stars

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
travel between them to get two stars

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.399 
travel between them to get two stars
depending<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:17.180> your<00:01:18.180> race<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> engine

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
depending on your race and the engine

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.499 
depending on your race and the engine
technology<00:01:19.830> use<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.189> even<00:01:20.850> if<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
technology use or even if you have to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.330 
technology use or even if you have to
fight<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> middle<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> nebula<00:01:22.740> there

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
fight in the middle of a nebula there

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.270 
fight in the middle of a nebula there
are<00:01:23.610> pros<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.119> cons<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:25.049> well

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
are pros and cons to that as well

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.640 
are pros and cons to that as well
certainly<00:01:26.280> some<00:01:26.520> stealth<00:01:27.350> bonuses<00:01:28.350> coming

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
certainly some stealth bonuses coming

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
certainly some stealth bonuses coming
out<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.890> having<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.189> travel<00:01:29.430> through<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.030> gas

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
out of having to travel through a gas

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 
out of having to travel through a gas
cloud<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> same<00:01:31.470> time<00:01:31.680> fighting<00:01:32.040> in

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
cloud but at the same time fighting in

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.530 
cloud but at the same time fighting in
one<00:01:32.460> tends<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.909> affect<00:01:33.000> weapon<00:01:33.540> systems<00:01:33.930> etc

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
one tends to affect weapon systems etc

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.109 
one tends to affect weapon systems etc
and<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:38.450> would<00:01:39.450> show<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.840> off<00:01:40.520> soul<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.939> here

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and I would show it off soul is in here

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.090 
and I would show it off soul is in here
somewheres<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.930> never<00:01:43.049> find<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.680> it's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
somewheres but I can never find it it's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.170 
somewheres but I can never find it it's
like<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> designer<00:01:44.850> hit<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.570> me<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.890> then

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
like the designer hit it on me so then

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.270 
like the designer hit it on me so then
this<00:01:48.229> some<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.530> familiar<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> some

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
this some of this is familiar to some

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.609 
this some of this is familiar to some
people<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.970> others<00:01:51.290> we've<00:01:52.290> retained

people but not to others we've retained

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.490 
people but not to others we've retained
the<00:01:52.890> three<00:01:53.130> size<00:01:53.340> classes<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.390> system<00:01:55.229> from<00:01:55.439> the

destroyer then the cruiser into
dreadnought<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> first<00:01:59.850> game<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.600> start

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
dreadnought of the first game you start

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.959 
dreadnought of the first game you start
at<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.899> cruiser<00:02:01.229> era<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.009> from<00:02:02.430> Cruiser<00:02:02.790> you

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
at the cruiser era and from Cruiser you

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.700 
at the cruiser era and from Cruiser you
go<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.740> grad<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:05.810> I'll<00:02:06.810> zoom<00:02:07.049> out<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.290> bit<00:02:07.380> and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
go to grad not I'll zoom out a bit and

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.859 
go to grad not I'll zoom out a bit and
then<00:02:08.640> ultimately<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:09.300> you've<00:02:09.479> played<00:02:09.840> your

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
then ultimately if you've played your

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.380 
then ultimately if you've played your
cards<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.500> bid<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> good<00:02:11.190> player<00:02:12.030> and

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
cards right and bid a good player and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.030 
cards right and bid a good player and
built<00:02:12.959> up<00:02:13.080> your<00:02:13.200> resources<00:02:13.590> and

notice is these guys coming in here your

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.740 
notice is these guys coming in here your
build<00:02:34.379> space<00:02:34.709> for<00:02:35.129> your<00:02:35.280> ships<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:36.480> time

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
build space for your ships this time

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.929 
build space for your ships this time
around<00:02:36.900> isn't<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.799> build<00:02:38.430> screen<00:02:38.760> that

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
around isn't the build screen that

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:39.949 
around isn't the build screen that
you're<00:02:39.060> familiar<00:02:39.209> with<00:02:39.420> from<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.689> first<00:02:39.900> game

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
you're familiar with from the first game

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.009 
you're familiar with from the first game
which<00:02:40.319> was<00:02:40.470> quite<00:02:41.189> static<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:42.540> time<00:02:42.780> we've

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
which was quite static this time we've

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.539 
which was quite static this time we've
decided<00:02:43.409> well<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.859> actually<00:02:44.010> makes<00:02:44.310> quite<00:02:44.519> a

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
decided well it actually makes quite a

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.640 
decided well it actually makes quite a
bit<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.790> sense<00:02:44.939> to<00:02:45.000> just<00:02:45.120> let<00:02:45.389> people<00:02:45.650> design

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
bit of sense to just let people design

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.690 
bit of sense to just let people design
their<00:02:46.859> ship<00:02:47.099> in<00:02:47.629> a<00:02:48.680> like<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> look<00:02:50.129> for<00:02:50.579> lack<00:02:50.670> of

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
their ship in a like a look for lack of

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.059 
their ship in a like a look for lack of
a<00:02:50.819> better<00:02:50.849> term<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.299> combat<00:02:51.629> space<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.409> we

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
a better term the combat space and we

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.289 
a better term the combat space and we
can<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.370> things<00:02:53.609> that<00:02:53.700> give<00:02:54.000> them<00:02:54.180> these

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
can do things that give them these

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.479 
can do things that give them these
targets<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.169> as<00:02:55.379> they<00:02:55.859> drop<00:02:56.099> in<00:02:56.310> their

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
targets so that as they drop in their

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.300 
targets so that as they drop in their
weapons<00:02:56.879> onto<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:59.750> ship<00:03:00.799> they<00:03:01.799> can<00:03:01.950> test-fire

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
weapons onto the ship they can test-fire

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.379 
weapons onto the ship they can test-fire
those<00:03:02.700> weapons<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.790> see<00:03:05.790> how<00:03:05.879> much<00:03:06.000> they<00:03:06.209> like

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
those weapons and see how much they like

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:13.009 
those weapons and see how much they like
them<00:03:09.200> similar<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.409> the<00:03:11.189> first<00:03:11.340> game<00:03:11.750> I'll<00:03:12.750> zoom

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
them similar to the first game I'll zoom

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:23.460 
them similar to the first game I'll zoom
in<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.230> soon

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.660 

in<00:03:24.470> designing<00:03:24.650> your<00:03:24.950> ship<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.310> can<00:03:25.490> cycle

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
in designing your ship you can cycle

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.400 
in designing your ship you can cycle
through<00:03:25.850> all<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.330> different<00:03:26.780> sections<00:03:27.140> you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
through all the different sections you

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.800 
through all the different sections you
have<00:03:27.560> available<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:29.240> you<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:29.540> see

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
have available to you and you can see

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:39.580 
have available to you and you can see
them<00:03:29.990> in<00:03:30.140> game

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.440 

I'd<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:40.700> do<00:03:40.790> like<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.090> battle<00:03:41.330> Bridge

I'd really do like the battle Bridge

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.119 
I'd really do like the battle Bridge
with<00:03:41.720> that<00:03:43.330> beetle<00:03:44.330> dough's<00:03:44.510> on<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.870> there<00:03:45.129> the

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
with that beetle dough's on it there the

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.290 
with that beetle dough's on it there the
art<00:03:46.280> guys<00:03:46.459> have<00:03:46.640> put<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:46.819> lot<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.000> time<00:03:47.180> and

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
art guys have put a lot of time and

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.339 
art guys have put a lot of time and
effort<00:03:47.390> into<00:03:47.629> making<00:03:47.780> some<00:03:48.019> really<00:03:48.140> cool

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349

effort into making some really cool
looking<00:03:48.650> chips<00:03:49.450> different<00:03:50.450> engine<00:03:50.690> sections

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
looking chips different engine sections

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.830 
looking chips different engine sections
which<00:03:51.920> also<00:03:52.099> visually<00:03:52.670> denote<00:03:53.360> whoever's

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:51.869 

maybe<00:05:47.499> not<00:05:47.709> that<00:05:47.739> bit<00:05:48.159> but<00:05:48.459> I<00:05:50.789> people<00:05:51.789> have

designation<00:05:56.429> so<00:05:57.429> this<00:05:57.579> denotes<00:05:57.879> the<00:05:58.059> armor<00:05:58.419> of

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
designation so this denotes the armor of

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.089 
designation so this denotes the armor of
your<00:05:58.689> ship<00:05:58.929> and<00:05:58.959> as<00:05:59.229> weapons<00:05:59.409> hit<00:05:59.769> it<00:05:59.919> it<00:06:00.039> will

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
your ship and as weapons hit it it will

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.379 
your ship and as weapons hit it it will
eat<00:06:00.249> away<00:06:00.279> at<00:06:00.489> it<00:06:00.699> so<00:06:00.939> you<00:06:01.029> have<00:06:01.119> a<00:06:01.149> quick
