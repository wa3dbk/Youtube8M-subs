00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.840

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.919

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.649

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.420
 that if you have a little because I really do not know how it's called vale melara 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.559
 buy one of these bazaars that aeg live china 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.610
 i complaint 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.940
 some figures 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.490
 so rock min 2 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.890
 biden in a little box explain how another one you have to put 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.760
 the things that you put on your hair 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.449
 and I really do not remember what it's called 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.739
 I used to say you know that you can leave a mark under what is called 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.880
 what we would like if you do not want to buy 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.320
 this is very elastic they are like two aunts 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.040
 metallica 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.040
 maybe you have to press 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.030
 so that it is in straight lines 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.390
 and the truth is that it is a very easy way since the pp joined when the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.460
 hair time use in the whole house only the top and sweden as it 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.070
 puts in both ways both to irrigate the just this area and for everything in the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.130
 head 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.940
 we take a little hair 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.940
 from up here 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.539
 I will not have much to 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.539
 the alternation 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.190
 we separate 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.920
 and what we do is 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.450
 open 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.690
 the two palettes these 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.420
 we open them asylum 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.250
 we paint the hair 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.370
 It should have been better 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.380
 stretch 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.680
 and he does it through dating 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 5 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.499
 that is bent 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:09.889
 down 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.489
 down i for now does not have but to regulate 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.719
 Free seats that do not show the hair 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.029
 the veracity super subject 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.379
 nothing nothing moves nothing 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.580
 and what I'm going to tell you is that you have to be careful when 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.180
 propose airs however three poems before buying it 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.409
 to the relocation or 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.409
 when you are running around the sector 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.939
 this is logical in one direction 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.609
 Sands explained 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.909
 Sometimes it's enough to do it 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.819
 if we have the hair collected and down here we have here and we want here 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.509
 down we will not be able to 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:56.989
 and if we do upwards that's where exactly he clicks where the one that jumps 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.279
 in the loose world when the betis with the insurance you know I mean

 barclays eviction 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.489
 and it is already 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.239
 and this week 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.790
 a little more to report a little more hectic but they are also given a 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.929
 interpretation 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.079
 9a is another way to exercise such
