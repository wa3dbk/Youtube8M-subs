00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.730
 the saga of hitler say heatley bar what 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.300
 that is Japanese is a saga of rpg is 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.880
 created in 1984 by the company dead and 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.560
 sound is considered one of the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.840
 first rpg of the history of the 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.910
 videogames a title that always 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.460
 they give it to the legend of zelda a 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.040
 Unlike other rpg is this account 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.300
 with a password of pas works the place 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.300
 to be able to save the game 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.320
 in the land of the fairies there are three 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.809
 magic crystals when a thief steals 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.610
 one of the three the others all lose 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.050
 its value and that's going to be awakening a 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.049
 demon called bogaris good by alice 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.360
 so he steals the three magic crystals and the 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:04.030
 Princess Anna becomes three fairies 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.549
 to be able to save the country from the fairies 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.450
 Jim has to go through it and look for the 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.450
 magic crystals 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.320
 it is played just like a simple rpg 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.470
 while some versions do not have 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.820
 music the version of the nes has a 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.820
 plagiarism of the theme of indiana jones 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.630
 and like many euros of rpg is the typical 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.680
 character with a armor that carries 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.680
 horns on helmets 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.510
 the following year the sequel to 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.270
 computers and this one had a 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.580
 moral meter now could be good 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.840
 or bad person depending on how 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.960
 you treat the characters 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.910
 if you kill innocent creatures you are bad 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.420
 and the game characters have you 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.290
 fear and they will not want to help you 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.140
 personally I think it's a bit 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.510
 ridiculous because for me the evil does not 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.610
 there exists what exists are moral prisms 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.520
 and that each human being usually has his 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.840
 own moral prism for example things 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.690
 what am I doing that look like they're 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.970
 well how to make this series for many 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.500
 people life that is wrong to do it but 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.730
 it's because I have a moral prism 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.680
 incompatible with them 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.590
 It also gives you the opportunity to 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.820
 Slow down the game bet and so power 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.820
 lower the difficulty of the enemies 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.090
 in 1987 the third installment and more 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.490
 late you could see on consoles like the 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.620
 mega drive a rain of fire is 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.690
 destroying the forests and our 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.210
 goal is to find the source of evil 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.510
 in playing is similar to the previous one but 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.670
 you also had to eat and sleep 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.800
 because if you do not end up weak and if 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.780
 You wore many things, you weighed 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.970
 inventory making you move 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.410
 slowly it's not like lin wearing a 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.410
 magic pocket like doraemon 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:20.330
 in 1995 the last delivery for 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.940
 sega saturn virtual hitler virtual 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.850
 the marketing length since the games 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.130
 in third person not in first has 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.110
 a plot similar to the first game and the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.720
 animation is 5 frames per second 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.300
 and although it was a failure I had something 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.400
 pretty original 20 designs 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.620
 labyrinths for seven more morrÃ¡s del 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.140
 game allowing no two 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.400
 equal items since this is not 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.400
 they returned to make more titles
