00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.320
 friendly is christian again 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.090
 from the day.de and as I just said 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.240
 I'll have you in the second video 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.350
 show how to set up the iphone 5 c 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.050
 you need exactly three things for that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.970
 namely of course the iphone 5 c her 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.369
 requires a nano sim card on the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.920
 sown display and of course here this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.170
 small pin with which I simulate the nano 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.410
 can unlock card slot that is too 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.910
 the first the first action we do 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.649
 make on the right side 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.250
 we really are very filigree and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.620
 almost invisible the nano sim card slot 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.629
 incorporated this correspond with and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.050
 so a small sled appears 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.480
 we can see the victory here 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.700
 and it will only be a possibility 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.590
 give the nanos in the squad 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.460
 to put in this sled that is 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.539
 they can actually be here at all 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.210
 make no mistake 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.340
 the nanos in the squad can only be sort of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.039
 and wisely so I have 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.570
 pulled out the sledge 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.100
 the nanos in just those of yours 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.650
 provider is sent or else 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.220
 maybe you will have to change 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.659
 with the golden surface down 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 use and then you push all 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.549
 in here and that just works 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.229
 impeccable and now before me now 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.860
 I'm still doing the microphone 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.619
 dropped off and I'll do that too 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.270
 make the display very clean for a short time 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.009
 you of course see how the whole 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.560
 works so now I have the sim 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.299
 card inlaid hello i am welcomed 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.930
 and just go to the right 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.409
 over and you see it in the slot and the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.509
 of course I will unlock now 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.649
 so that we can continue here 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.299
 and right now she is unlocked and 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.340
 now menu language already appears 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.070
 I can pick that up on the iphone 5 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.030
 c are present under ios 7 and me 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.869
 I will of course become German 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.710
 he sets me the german language 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.370
 and I have in connection the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.620
 possibility even that 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.550
 choose where I am, of course 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.280
 located 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.850
 and that will happen accordingly 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.680
 Germany selects and I choose 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.630
 Germany and now we will 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.470
 Wlan networks displayed with those of me 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.210
 can connect me 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.280
 because I have to be closer now too 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.380
 future already with apple logs on 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.630
 my apple id I will now on 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.180
 a fritzbox and also the password 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.740
 I give a short time outside the 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.140
 a camera so that wlan is now 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.970
 finally entered correctly and you see 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.890
 I have my fritz box 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.450
 connected and the activation of the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.700
 iphones starts now i will be asked 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.840
 Activate public service that is for it 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.400
 so that the iphone 5 c your gps 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.050
 Determining position can be important to 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.050
 for example, if you like the maps apple 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.580
 maps or google maps or 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.580
 Of course, sometime later for yours 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.690
 to find iphone again and i say yes 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.730
 enable it is mine 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.620
 first iphone and i would like it as well 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.780
 configure new iphone 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.710
 that's why paint as a new iphone 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.210
 configure 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.060
 otherwise if you already have one 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.680
 we can also use the iphone user watt 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.380
 existing attitudes from yours 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.530
 Restore iCloud as a backup 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.110
 point 2 or from itunes under point 3 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.770
 i choose iphone new iphone 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.140
 Sign in 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.989
 sign up with my apple id and that is 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.930
 the apple id also used 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.030
 when shopping at the apple store that means 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.850
 you have to buy something at apple before you 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.720
 can you have to lay you an id 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.640
 So an identification with the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.110
 then later then any buyers 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.780
 can perform among other things then 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.870
 with itunes for ex, that's important though 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.709
 also here on the iphone around the iphone 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.200
 to register and accordingly you have to 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:59.060
 do not just enter your e-mail address 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.680
 but also your password so that 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.860
 i made now i am logged in and 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.600
 now there is security here 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.180
 add security questions yes or 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.660
 later I 'll do that later that means 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.430
 it's a security issue 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.380
 if you forget eg new password 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.290
 you can have the security question 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.130
 just reset your device 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.350
 now comes a few more 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.450
 terms of use for ios for iCloud 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.310
 and whatever I'm going to open 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.350
 accept and I assume that 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.640
 It's okay because a few million 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.010
 users have that in front of me 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.870
 Made and set up with mine 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.070
 apple id on this iphone takes now 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.410
 a few more seconds 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.450
 I would like to ask the next question 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.890
 cloud use a backup 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.280
 possibility where i take pictures with others 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.840
 ios devices sync hand take 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.550
 I want to do that too and I want to 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.640
 If you like me, look for my iphone 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.870
 At some point, I lose it and I click 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.880
 on and I have to go now 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.550
 once enter a four-digit code 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.000
 I'll use that later 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.490
 I have to get it a second time 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.260
 confirm and will be back in 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.060
 connection asked I want siri 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.910
 configure or turn back 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.060
 is this voice assistant of the 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.620
 which led the apple with 1 where you 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.090
 for example, ask from t how is that 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.920
 weather in los angeles or wherever 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.810
 and that's it already stands 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.540
 Welcome to my iphone and here 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.000
 Let's go and what you see now 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:29.340
 is the surface ios 7 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.930
 also very new and as you can see that works 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.220
 here at first glance very fluffy 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.440
 actually like the one from apple 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.820
 knows something new for example now 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.190
 the folder view and this too 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.700
 animation like here these menus purely 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.110
 fly or go out again and you 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.200
 look at the first glance that is 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.940
 really very fluid and very fast 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.820
 just as you actually heard of 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.890
 apple devices can be a dealer to the 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.200
 ios function has already made moritz 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.930
 I like to link in our video 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.150
 and I think that's it with a first 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.280
 Hands on to set up the apple
