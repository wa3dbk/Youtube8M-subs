00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
volume buttons over here for how the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
volume buttons over here for how the
area's<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> volume<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.289> going

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.390 
area's going to have a volume up going
down<00:01:01.969> you<00:01:02.969> look<00:01:03.149> back<00:01:03.390> there<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.400> probably

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
down you look back there you probably

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.080 
down you look back there you probably
barely<00:01:05.850> make<00:01:06.119> them<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:06.450> monitor<00:01:07.320> light

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
barely make them out monitor light

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.710 
barely make them out monitor light
they're<00:01:10.090> right<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.360> there<00:01:12.570> I've<00:01:13.570> also

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
they're right in there I've also

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.740 
they're right in there I've also
installed<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.350> second<00:01:14.710> fin<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.360> now<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:16.540> have

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
installed a second fin so now you have

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.390 
installed a second fin so now you have
one<00:01:16.780> thin<00:01:17.259> blowing<00:01:17.680> out<00:01:17.830> which<00:01:18.040> I<00:01:18.130> think<00:01:18.340> was

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
one thin blowing out which I think was

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.859 
one thin blowing out which I think was
pretty<00:01:18.640> much<00:01:18.790> needed<00:01:19.090> because<00:01:19.330> all<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.690> heats

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
pretty much needed because all the heats

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.109 
pretty much needed because all the heats
rising<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.890> spend<00:01:21.159> sucking<00:01:21.610> air<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:21.790> going

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
rising to spend sucking air and going

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.320 
rising to spend sucking air and going
right<00:01:22.299> to<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:23.369> right<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.550> main<00:01:24.729> processor

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
right to the right to the main processor

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.160 
right to the right to the main processor
on<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.479> motherboard

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
on the motherboard

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.109 
on the motherboard
which<00:01:27.740> has<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.890> fan<00:01:28.159> also<00:01:28.400> but<00:01:28.729> this<00:01:28.850> one's<00:01:29.030> just

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
which has a fan also but this one's just

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.630 
which has a fan also but this one's just
blowing<00:01:29.960> directly<00:01:30.110> on<00:01:30.500> there<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:31.400> one's

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
blowing directly on there this one's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.920 
blowing directly on there this one's
blowing<00:01:31.850> all<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.150> hot<00:01:32.270> air<00:01:32.299> out<00:01:32.509> from<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
blowing all the hot air out from the

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.120 
blowing all the hot air out from the
light<00:01:33.140> which<00:01:33.439> really<00:01:33.650> doesn't<00:01:33.799> make<00:01:33.950> too<00:01:34.100> much

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
light which really doesn't make too much

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.590 
light which really doesn't make too much
but<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.520> monitor<00:01:34.909> generates<00:01:35.299> a<00:01:35.360> good<00:01:35.479> amount

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
but the monitor generates a good amount

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.020 
but the monitor generates a good amount
of<00:01:35.750> heat<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:36.979> is<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.159> working

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
of heat and this is a working

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.990 
of heat and this is a working
beautifully<00:01:38.240> right<00:01:38.600> now<00:01:39.189> got<00:01:40.189> one<00:01:40.369> power<00:01:40.640> cord

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
beautifully right now got one power cord

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.510 
coming out to a power strip mounted back
here

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.760

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
them right here going back up power

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.420 
them right here going back up power
button<00:02:27.290> tried<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.380> bundle<00:02:28.710> all<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> wires<00:02:29.100> and
