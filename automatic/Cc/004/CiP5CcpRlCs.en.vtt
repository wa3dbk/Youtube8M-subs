00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
several ingredients together so you're

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.580

since I've obviously I've grown up a lot

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.770 
since I've obviously I've grown up a lot
now<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:02.879> think<00:03:03.090> when<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.269> was<00:03:03.329> younger<00:03:03.420> has<00:03:03.750> a

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
now and I think when I was younger has a

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.660 
now and I think when I was younger has a
lot<00:03:03.959> more<00:03:03.989> darker<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.769> as<00:03:05.340> I've<00:03:05.489> grown<00:03:05.579> up

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
lot more darker and as I've grown up

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.400 
lot more darker and as I've grown up
I've<00:03:05.940> kind<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.209> signed<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.569> love<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:06.900> skin<00:03:07.170> I

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
I've kind of signed to love my skin I

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.110 
I've kind of signed to love my skin I
kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.739> do<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:07.920> once<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.280> month<00:03:08.310> now<00:03:08.700> out<00:03:09.030> of

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
kind of do it once a month now out of

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.479 
kind of do it once a month now out of
laziness<00:03:09.269> but<00:03:10.079> I<00:03:10.290> probably<00:03:10.769> wouldn't<00:03:11.220> because

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
laziness but I probably wouldn't because

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.309 
laziness but I probably wouldn't because
I<00:03:11.640> think<00:03:11.879> it's<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.209> fault<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.780> media<00:03:13.079> that

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
I think it's the fault of the media that

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.530 
I think it's the fault of the media that
make<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.860> feel<00:03:14.280> like<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.819> well<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.030> guess<00:03:15.209> I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
mean we sort of spend our days saying

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.920 
mean we sort of spend our days saying

class system as you know is still very

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.030 
class system as you know is still very
much<00:03:44.340> exist<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:46.169> light<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.769> skin

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
much exist that the light of the skin

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.680 
much exist that the light of the skin
what<00:03:47.310> do<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.579> what<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.000> as<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.120> final<00:03:48.540> word

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690

think<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.579> answer<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:51.060> not<00:03:51.599> to<00:03:51.900> use<00:03:52.410> any

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
think the answer is not to use any

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.849 
think the answer is not to use any
unregulated<00:03:53.790> product<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:55.169> remember<00:03:55.500> that
