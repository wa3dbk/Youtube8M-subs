00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:18.340
 This time I would like to the commentary attached to the black-and-white point of view 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:23.640
 Please see this image first 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.990
 This is the plum garden of Yugawara Makuyama Park 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.610
 this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.270
 Choose the place that will be the most photo from the points 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:38.080
 This is 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:39.980
 The president using the so looks good it is here in el filter 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.660
 It then will 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:49.600
 And it is this work that was known 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.300
 The aperture is 11 and the shutter speed is 1/200 sec. 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.719
 Earlier 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:00.480
 Because the pl filter is working, the feeling is quite blue 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:05.010
 I think it's beautiful but just that plum is so much color is vivid 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.190
 I think that it is not visible in quite colorful image because it is not intended 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.290
 Mountain is also ne considerably green is still 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.610
 It doesn't float and it looks like the part of the ground almost yet 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:21.130
 In such a case it is very difficult to contrast the mouth 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:25.600
 Even if you put the contrast by force, the picture will not come out as a picture 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.080
 Speaking of what I should say, it is still monochrome, so try to express in black and white 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.420
 I would like 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.840
 This is 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.080
 It will be the original or picture taken from here 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.540
 It is the first time we will process monochrome 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.240
 Adjust the cropping angle 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:46.560
 Because there is a slight tilt, it is also less likely to correct the tilt 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.210
 The profile is called camera standard 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:56.200
 And yes the vertical direction 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.010
 Adjust will become a shape that bends backward behind it is the vehicle body by a little wide-angle lens 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.100
 Than 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:07.570
 And the adjustment at you key how e It is this 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:09.229
 Here is the work that adjusted the vertical direction In this way, I saw the vertical direction back to the original 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.430
 Get close to eyes 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.120
 Say the raise is this distortion amount calculated because the paper comes out that available to you absolutely close 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.120
 It is 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.560
 It is important to keep it to some extent 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.130
 And like this time 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.970
 It means that we will process using salt donation 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.540
 Here is processing in the lightroom a change to salt black 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:34.290
 This is black and white. 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:40.010
 The color contrast is not reproduced in black and white 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:45.739
 And this reproduction needs to be adjusted again. 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.500
 The final adjusted work will be here This is what the contrast was adjusted and finished 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:53.340
 It is that work 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.340
 Add a stage filter and a little more empty tone 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.140
 I will drop 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:05.540
 It will be this work of the final finish utilizing the detil 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:11.090
 Well, of course I was explaining the process to the black-and-white from Why color image 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.170
 It is decided that this will be black and white when shooting, so naturally it is finished in black and white 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.490
 Though 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:20.130
 Although I think that there is a fact that will take is usually just a black-and-white mode of 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:25.140
 It is the case of a very desune raw data basically is to ne black-and-white 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:27.500
 If it is possible to color information there are still by connecting to finish taking advantage of this color information well 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.500
 I think
