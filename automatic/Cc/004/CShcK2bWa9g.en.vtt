that does a lieutenant is that tougher
than<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.959> super<00:03:25.290> flip<00:03:25.500> where<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.800> just<00:03:25.980> throw

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
than the super flip where you just throw

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.190 
than the super flip where you just throw
your<00:03:26.790> legs<00:03:27.060> straight<00:03:27.239> out<00:03:27.420> as<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.690> harder<00:03:28.080> to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
your legs straight out as a harder to

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
reach back and grab i think so i think a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000 
reach back and grab i think so i think a
seat<00:03:30.209> grab<00:03:30.360> clip<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.959> tougher<00:03:31.530> you're<00:03:31.739> letting

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
seat grab clip is tougher you're letting

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
perpendicular so is it a turn down flip

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.140

know I don't think this run is as good

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.390 
know I don't think this run is as good
as<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.990> last<00:04:26.020> one<00:04:26.440> we<00:04:26.590> saw<00:04:26.620> from<00:04:27.010> him<00:04:27.190> in<00:04:27.310> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
as the last one we saw from him in the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.670 
as the last one we saw from him in the
semi<00:04:27.640> so<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.690> going<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.960> be<00:04:29.020> tight<00:04:29.320> for<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
semi so it's going to be tight for the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.850 
semi so it's going to be tight for the
judging<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.820> stripper<00:04:31.270> flip<00:04:31.740> mixing<00:04:32.740> it

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860
