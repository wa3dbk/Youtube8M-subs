with these two are basically the same

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.830 
with these two are basically the same
model<00:04:59.050> machine<00:04:59.350> but<00:04:59.680> their<00:05:00.780> country<00:05:01.780> of

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
model machine but their country of

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.470 
model machine but their country of
origin<00:05:02.020> are<00:05:02.650> is<00:05:03.100> different<00:05:03.640> this<00:05:03.880> is<00:05:04.090> this<00:05:04.300> is

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
origin are is different this is this is

back<00:05:45.910> in<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.300> late<00:05:47.260> sixties<00:05:47.680> early<00:05:47.710> seventies

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
back in the late sixties early seventies

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.370 
back in the late sixties early seventies
as<00:05:49.870> far<00:05:50.320> as<00:05:50.530> any<00:05:50.740> type<00:05:51.010> of<00:05:51.040> value<00:05:52.380> basically

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
as far as any type of value basically

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.800 
as far as any type of value basically
you're<00:05:53.979> you<00:05:54.310> get<00:05:54.550> more<00:05:54.700> value<00:05:54.940> out<00:05:55.180> of<00:05:55.360> machine

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
you're you get more value out of machine

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.990 
you're you get more value out of machine
if<00:05:55.990> you<00:05:56.080> took<00:05:56.229> a<00:05:56.290> scrap<00:05:56.800> yard<00:05:56.860> to<00:05:57.220> get<00:05:57.310> to<00:05:57.490> get

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
if you took a scrap yard to get to get

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.060 
if you took a scrap yard to get to get
the<00:05:58.150> cost<00:05:58.360> of<00:05:58.630> whatever<00:05:58.870> the<00:05:59.229> cast<00:05:59.560> iron<00:05:59.800> would

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
the cost of whatever the cast iron would

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.810 
the cost of whatever the cast iron would
would<00:06:00.550> be<00:06:00.729> worth<00:06:01.320> as<00:06:02.320> far<00:06:02.979> as<00:06:03.100> particle<00:06:03.490> yeah

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
would be worth as far as particle yeah

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.190 
would be worth as far as particle yeah
there's<00:06:04.120> parts<00:06:04.419> that<00:06:04.450> you<00:06:04.630> could<00:06:04.780> take<00:06:04.960> off

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
there's parts that you could take off

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.159 
there's parts that you could take off
but<00:06:06.190> in<00:06:06.490> reality<00:06:07.090> being<00:06:07.510> that<00:06:07.780> they<00:06:07.900> would<00:06:08.050> be

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
but in reality being that they would be

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.600 
but in reality being that they would be
used<00:06:08.380> parts<00:06:09.720> you'd<00:06:10.720> be<00:06:11.080> kind<00:06:11.650> of<00:06:11.830> play<00:06:12.070> playing

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
used parts you'd be kind of play playing

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.820 
used parts you'd be kind of play playing
a<00:06:12.790> game<00:06:13.030> with<00:06:13.360> whoever<00:06:14.229> might<00:06:14.470> want<00:06:14.650> to<00:06:14.680> buy

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
a game with whoever might want to buy

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.280 
a game with whoever might want to buy

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
the cast iron that's in the machine made

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.860 
the cast iron that's in the machine made
coke<00:06:55.000> they<00:06:55.240> kind<00:06:56.050> of<00:06:56.170> what<00:06:56.880> you<00:06:57.880> kidding<00:06:58.360> they

came from the scrap yard Wow but but I
mean<00:07:02.140> that's<00:07:02.440> what<00:07:03.010> yeah<00:07:03.220> basically<00:07:03.640> most<00:07:04.180> of

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
mean that's what yeah basically most of

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.750 
mean that's what yeah basically most of
these<00:07:04.480> are<00:07:04.810> is<00:07:05.140> scrap<00:07:05.620> value<00:07:06.070> there<00:07:06.490> there's

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
these are is scrap value there there's

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
these are is scrap value there there's
really<00:07:07.030> no<00:07:07.450> market<00:07:08.440> for<00:07:08.470> reselling<00:07:09.340> these

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 
really no market for reselling these

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.660 
really no market for reselling these
based<00:07:10.780> on<00:07:11.020> the<00:07:11.140> fact<00:07:11.410> that<00:07:11.560> the<00:07:11.980> age<00:07:12.190> of<00:07:12.220> them

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670
