00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
like little barrier and you know jump

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.460 
like little barrier and you know jump
from<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.760> actual<00:00:30.060> step<00:00:30.330> area<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.350> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
from the actual step area on to this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.590 
from the actual step area on to this
corner<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.340> when<00:00:32.579> you're<00:00:32.699> on<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.969> corner<00:00:33.420> you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
want to use your actual double dashing

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.660 
want to use your actual double dashing
like<00:00:36.570> spring<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.140> your<00:00:37.739> land<00:00:37.950> onto<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.430> like

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
like spring in your land onto this like

Tails<00:00:39.059> head<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.200> rock<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.739> when<00:00:41.010> you're<00:00:41.130> up

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
Tails head on the rock so when you're up

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.490 
Tails head on the rock so when you're up
here<00:00:41.700> you'll<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.600> someone<00:00:42.960> else<00:00:42.989> as

here you'll have to have someone else as

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.100 
here you'll have to have someone else as
well<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:45.090> very<00:00:45.390> placed<00:00:45.660> down<00:00:45.870> their

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
well up here so very placed down their

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.869 
well up here so very placed down their
shield<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.070> top<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.399> their<00:00:47.550> shield

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
shield you get on top of their shield

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.940 
shield you get on top of their shield
and<00:00:48.420> what<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.530> could

and what you can do is now you could
actually<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> overclock<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.420> actually

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
actually use the overclock to actually

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.450 
actually use the overclock to actually
get<00:00:51.989> up<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> there's<00:00:53.100> gonna<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
get up here and there's gonna be a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
get up here and there's gonna be a
barrier<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.660> land<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.020> here

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
barrier on here so you can land on here

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.110 
barrier on here so you can land on here
so<00:00:55.800> make<00:00:56.129> sure<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.610> own<00:00:56.670> shield

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
there's gonna be a barrier on the rock

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.539 
there's gonna be a barrier on the rock
just<00:01:16.079> on<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.439> actual<00:01:16.799> edge<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.279> when<00:01:17.429> you're

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
clock and you wanna basically just do

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.959 
clock and you wanna basically just do
like<00:01:22.409> double<00:01:22.770> dash<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.099> line<00:01:23.219> spin<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.670> number

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
like double dash in line spin in number

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.639 
like double dash in line spin in number
and<00:01:24.209> you<00:01:24.539> like<00:01:24.719> to<00:01:24.749> like<00:01:24.959> get<00:01:25.139> out<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.439> map

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
and you like to like get out the map

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.969 
and you like to like get out the map
it's<00:01:26.009> really<00:01:26.849> easy<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.719> a<00:01:27.869> way<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.829> me

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
it's really easy in a way but for me

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.859 
it's really easy in a way but for me
this<00:01:29.459> is<00:01:29.639> really<00:01:29.909> tricky<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.389> this<00:01:30.749> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
this is really tricky because this is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.659 
this is really tricky because this is
probably<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.469> the<00:01:31.679> hardest<00:01:32.069> glitches

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:32.669 
probably one of the hardest glitches

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:34.969 
probably one of the hardest glitches
I've<00:01:32.880> ever<00:01:33.029> done<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.529> just<00:01:34.560> takes

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
I've ever done it's just it just takes

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.649 
I've ever done it's just it just takes
time<00:01:35.219> basically<00:01:35.609> but<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:35.999> you're<00:01:36.149> a<00:01:36.359> good

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
time basically but if you're a good

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.330 
time basically but if you're a good
glitter<00:01:36.959> you<00:01:37.169> love<00:01:37.319> no<00:01:37.529> problems<00:01:37.979> doing<00:01:38.159> this

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
glitter you love no problems doing this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.699 
glitter you love no problems doing this
