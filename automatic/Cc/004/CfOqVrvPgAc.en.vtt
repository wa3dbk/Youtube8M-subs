00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.450 

there<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.970> case<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> locked<00:01:57.659> together

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
there we go the case is locked together

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.910 
there we go the case is locked together
here's<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> camera<00:02:00.000> cut<00:02:00.299> out<00:02:00.830> here's<00:02:01.830> the
