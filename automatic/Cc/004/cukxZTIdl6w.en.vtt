 corner of this team from Algeria 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.359
 Smain with his starting eleven point 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.850
 of questioning was to know if 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.930
 bougherra was holder or not 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.180
 the answer is no 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.790
 yes it's no it 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.830
 exit 15 minutes from the end against the 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.590
 korea was so a little bit just he 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.060
 is replaced by essaÃ¯d belkalem and this 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.110
 will be the central hinge belkalem has 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.760
 said I spoke to you earlier 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.730
 Captain Halliche who replaces 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.530
 actually at the captain's position me 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.820
 said google see then we will find 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.030
 for the rest and well this group 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.489
 classic who had ignited it glowing 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.860
 go face south korea this 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.540
 was not and it was no longer the one 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.580
 two three viva algeria but the big for 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.680
 Algeria with four goals scored 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.180
 but tonight it will be an entirely different 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.160
 pair of sleeves facing this team 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.430
 Russian that we will also discover 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.170
 with tonight two forwards yeah fabio 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.000
 capello is forced to win he decided 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.580
 to slightly change his game system 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.950
 where it was more a 4-3-3 tie to two 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.170
 type attackers with horny and kazakov 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.490
 the youth and the experience he has to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.259
 absolutely go get the victory of 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.909
 anyway this Russian team did not have 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.829
 the more the choice they have to go towards 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.140
 why there are two attackers here is the 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.030
 match to life to death as the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.829
 highlights and some Algerian players 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.079
 that we met at the hotel since 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.659
 for two days the match certainly 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.549
 the most important today of 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.350
 the history of Algerian football because 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.539
 that it has been said and repeated in case of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.859
 victory they would be qualified for the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.780
 round of 16 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.429
 exactly gentlemen you've crossed them 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.829
 his Algerian players you had 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.969
 the opportunity and time to discuss with 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.969
 how did you find them 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.210
 at 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.480
 listen to tell you we felt 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.420
 the temperature goes up relaxed when they 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.160
 have arrived smile because relieved 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.470
 of this beautiful victory face to face at the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.450
 korea but last night people saw 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.580
 a few faces were closing and again 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.110
 more this morning nothing worried in his 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.490
 match for a long time it's vahid 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.840
 an oil has the closed face it does not have 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.640
 laughed I think for some time 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.070
 but the players looked rather 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.230
 relaxed even though they still feel 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.459
 the weight of a whole nation the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.050
 responsibility to enter 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.090
 the history of Algerian football 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.770
 so that's not to do too much either 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.200
 let the event come to you rather 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.239
 200 arriving is to make the match 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.950
 100 times during the day before 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.040
 it's always the most complicated to manage 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.050
 it's a very important moment this 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.390
 mental preparation vahid halilhozdic the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.260
 said gentlemen change in the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.150
 defense of algeria 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.620
 philippe genin and bruno cheyrou we have 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.940
 confirmed all this we heard a 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.980
 nice atmosphere also at the time of the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.880
 output for warming up to help 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.260
 green without majid bougherra but with 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.310
 belkalem in central defense alongside 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.080
 from rafik halliche 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.840
 we still keep a continuity 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.549
 with a player used to playing with the 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.959
 selection 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.270
 that's exactly what it takes 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.490
 must do 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.510
 after the choice even though he was a little 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.400
 little hurt it is to change the speed 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.140
 he was there it's true it's a 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.420
 team that is going fast Russia is a 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.330
 player who is still used to 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.620
 play with with the muse today he 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.900
 need players who are more 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.210
 are present from 100% of the mental side 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.610
 because it's long it's very long 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.660
 preparation was long before there's going 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.760
 to be too because they want that 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.200
 it starts and that and that's where will be 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.970
 the mental side is in this 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.120
 preparation the passade is very long 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.290
 to whistle and that's what 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.670
 that they will prepare themselves they will 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.470
 may be hotter than usual 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.720
 because they want to be pro and there he 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.460
 must do all the same things 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.750
 since the beginning of the competition it has 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.820
 cheap but there is still a 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.900
 player or two who will go farther 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.730
 because he wants to like odette 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.040
 exploded he pays attention to the wounds 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.630
 because you make it sweeter than 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.950
 the usual we risk having 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.860
 injuries we kept the same team 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.840
 is not remember adrien 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.690
 rogers we kept everyone for 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.160
 continue all this elie this training 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.930
 Algerian under pressure since Sunday 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.880
 evening yes but you have good talk 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.709
 this defense and those who come 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.650
 to be announced the fittings made 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.200
 kokorin two one-sided attacks to va 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.420
 to be consistent for this defense 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.330
 central or even for the defensive midfielder 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.889
 it will have to adapt to a 4-4-2 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.840
 knowing that 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.189
 it changes anyway a little gives it 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.479
 must communicate a lot between 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.199
 central defenders and circles 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.969
 defensive 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.860
 because we have two attackers like that 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.990
 he always has one who sets the defense 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.330
 central another moving and it's going 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.849
 ask for a lot of coordination between 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.139
 we are still talking about the mind of Algeria 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.610
 because Algeria before coming in 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.849
 world cup had nothing to lose 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.889
 it was a team that was not told 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.180
 to go to the round of 16 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.069
 this world cup it was an outsider 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.050
 in this group h 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.060
 listen to vahid halilhozic before we 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.860
 had nothing to lose now it's 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.979
 different 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.009
 at the start world cup my team 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.509
 he had nothing to lose but tomorrow we 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.250
 had something to lose 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.250
 this moment to go down in history 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:14.099
 it must be exemplary I have not bad on 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:19.430
 these crates which my team to match the 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:23.249
 shows and efficiency good games 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.319
 now to go to the second round 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:27.740
 when we talk about it always 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:32.150
 match exception it is necessary to match 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:36.229
 you have to do a match that you need and 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:40.460
 for that I must be well prepared - team 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:42.169
 psychological mans for this type of match 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.710
 you are a little tense 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.360
 team is pretty yellow with this game and 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.440
 talented who misses a little bit 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.630
 expressed in this type of match but 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.870
 I hope my team of members 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:01.099
 we were good match and efficient and 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.199
 I hope we go there our 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.860
 qualification 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.860
 he assumes
