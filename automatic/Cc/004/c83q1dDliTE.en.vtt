00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
for a longer time I generally don't do

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.520 
for a longer time I generally don't do
that<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.570> want<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.960> just

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
that but you can if you want to just

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.080 
that but you can if you want to just
make<00:01:55.710> sure<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.070> you're<00:01:56.189> only<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.850> be

spraying the lining side not the fashion

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.050 
spraying the lining side not the fashion
profit<00:01:59.729> because

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
profit because

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.460 
profit because
you<00:02:00.180> don't<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.170> stay<00:02:01.409> in

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
you don't know if it's going to stay in

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.069 
you don't know if it's going to stay in
the<00:02:01.619> fashion<00:02:01.950> fabric<00:02:02.100> um<00:02:02.899> generally<00:02:03.899> I

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the fashion fabric um generally I

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.190 
the fashion fabric um generally I
wouldn't<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:05.850> spray<00:02:06.299> directly<00:02:07.079> at

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
wouldn't you know just spray directly at

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.589 
wouldn't you know just spray directly at
it<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.560> maybe<00:02:07.799> spray<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.640> air<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.149> then

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
it I would maybe spray the air and then

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.370 
it I would maybe spray the air and then
move<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.340> corset<00:02:11.810> through<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.110> mist

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
move the the corset through that mist

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.920 
move the the corset through that mist
you<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.790> probably<00:02:15.060> outside<00:02:15.450> it's

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
you can do this probably outside it's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.540 
you can do this probably outside it's
probably<00:02:16.290> safer<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.010> do<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.459> a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
probably safer to do that in a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.400 
probably safer to do that in a
well-ventilated<00:02:17.730> area<00:02:18.599> so<00:02:18.840> yeah<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.260> you're

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
well-ventilated area so yeah that you're

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.290 
well-ventilated area so yeah that you're
not<00:02:19.530> filling<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.550> air<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:20.760> any<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.209> those

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
not filling the air with any of those

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.650 
not filling the air with any of those
things<00:02:21.830> also<00:02:22.830> get<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.519> Febreze<00:02:23.700> that's<00:02:24.239> in<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
things also get the Febreze that's in a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.350 
things also get the Febreze that's in a
squeezy<00:02:24.989> bottle<00:02:25.459> not<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.610> aerosol<00:02:27.090> cans

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
squeezy bottle not the aerosol cans

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.210 
squeezy bottle not the aerosol cans
because<00:02:27.599> aerosol<00:02:28.170> cans<00:02:28.380> they<00:02:28.530> they<00:02:28.800> do<00:02:28.860> have

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
because aerosol cans they they do have

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.479 
because aerosol cans they they do have
some<00:02:29.519> additives<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:31.590> can<00:02:31.950> make<00:02:32.340> your

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
some additives in it that can make your
