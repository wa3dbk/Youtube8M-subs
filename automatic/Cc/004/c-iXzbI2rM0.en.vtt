00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 this is the digital access channel 2003 and the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.410
 tip today is the gm ventilation system 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.380
 as you can see, it 's very common for you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.560
 get in the gm car and come here 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.240
 the ventilation system and a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.119
 little air mixuruca syrup without grace 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.880
 does not even spill the dog's hair 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.039
 so the tip is quite simple there are two 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.090
 reasons for this when the car has air 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.460
 conditioning 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.230
 the effect can be caused by the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.870
 pollen that is there in the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.989
 compartment of the engine that has just 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.980
 covering up with dirt and making it 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.780
 air passage 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.120
 the other most common reason 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.239
 the car that does not have the air system 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.879
 conditioning and hot air is simply 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.399
 component that exists in the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.250
 internal fan we go 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.809
 explain now that you already have the system 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 disassembled from the ventilation part and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.630
 remember that the fan and this car here is 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 the European astra that famous star 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.790
 astro had the year 95 and system of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.110
 ventilation occupies several gm cars 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.950
 including the Corsican line which is well 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.439
 like 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.049
 responsible for decreased 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.500
 speed is this zygo component here 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.580
 this component is a few resistor 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.610
 cars that do not have an air conditioner 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.369
 There are only four pins in this part here. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.470
 most are from cars with air 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.540
 conditioning is done in such a way that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.810
 this here is a resistor and as far as 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.939
 you turn the knob it selects the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 fan speed and within that 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.170
 component 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.600
 here you have part already disassembled this 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.250
 here is the cover where the filter of 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.440
 pollen in cars containing air 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.720
 conditioning 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.400
 in this part that the filter becomes 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.680
 Sometimes it gets confusing that the air does not 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.630
 then you only have to remove the filter 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.720
 from above and do the cleaning 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.760
 This is where the diffuser cover is. 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.220
 responsible for compressing and if there 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.380
 Judge the air there into the cabin. 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.960
 this component that is here it stays 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.050
 housed in this position he stays here 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.300
 in this part of the chamber because here because 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.490
 this component is boil it heats up 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.890
 due to the operation in which the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.920
 itself out of this part of the 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.620
 fan also cools this part is 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.200
 very common to cook because of the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.840
 Heat he cooks these terminals here 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.230
 causing poor contact in the socket and then 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.870
 happens you spin there the speed of air 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.690
 decreases or sometimes even disappears and the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.000
 responsible for this is this component is 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.220
 only you withdraw to do a good cleaning of 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.290
 tea to the terminals and you will have your 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.630
 ventilation in some cases 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.120
 when it's rotting because of 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.220
 moisture generated by the air conditioning you 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.080
 is obliged to change this component 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.630
 Can you find it here in the 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.440
 free market or even in the 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.840
 To access here you'll have to do 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.110
 some assemblies and disassemblies that the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.080
 people will show later because 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.180
 now it's already here all set 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.489
 Okay, we'll take everything out. 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.970
 again to be able to mount cover cover 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.580
 What is this one that stands apart from 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.590
 filter is it passes here inside the 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.720
 cables do not have to mount go through here 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.640
 in my case it was more complicated a 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.709
 I had to replace 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.230
 that outlet that ended up cooking for 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.300
 inside here also the yarns cooked 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.540
 here in the kitchen 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.730
 the metal sockets and then in the case we 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.490
 we made new metal rockets and 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.590
 we put here finishing this part 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.360
 now it's just change and the assembly you go 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.240
 see now 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.880
 now we're going to close this part here 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.120
 where is the filter and for this we will 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.060
 use here in this part a layer 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.880
 material here that is to avoid 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.130
 water in this part here 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.130
 after it is used it usually becomes a 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.840
 little threatened so use this eraser 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.970
 part of the cables here inside and 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.830
 screw in place you'll already be with 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.590
 a party ready as we see it 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.380
 here the body is already working. 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.540
 placed in place has been tested in the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.430
 A whip will be made and it will be 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.500
 mounted everything in there do not forget 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.990
 what the coal filter that passes 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.300
 right there for you to be able to mount it comes 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:37.010
 from here on the part of the brake 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:39.140
 part of coal filter there ok ok and 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.600
 now so look what beauty already 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.650
 operating the four speeds of the 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.230
 air system 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.080
 the first two here are very weak 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.870
 this Wednesday is already much stronger 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.320
 everything is working right in there 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.560
 All right, we're almost ready. 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.130
 here to close the cover of the 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.130
 ventilation
