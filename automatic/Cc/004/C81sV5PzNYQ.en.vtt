00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.250
 booklet and we are in a new news 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 of playstation 4 and xbox one and is that the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.530
 image that you are seeing is the clear 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.660
 difference between the two consoles is the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.080
 internal difference of playstation 4 and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.410
 xbox one in a single image with the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.199
 picture the image you are seeing now 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.869
 same is a quick glance of the interior 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.420
 of the new generation consoles as 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.640
 you can see are and get a potential 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.690
 greater something that since microsoft have 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.520
 called insignificant really 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.829
 allege that does not really affect 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.530
 the players at the time of playing but 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.780
 neither to the companies at the time of 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 develop the games 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.019
 it must be said that it is possible this is a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.140
 personal opinion I've always said that 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:58.379
 playstation 4 the exclusive games in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.469
 a future may be may be more 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.300
 powerful or better optimized but 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.129
 as far as multiplatform everything 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.960
 it seems that we will be in a tie 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.940
 technical just as was happening this 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.860
 console generation really 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.350
 and I've already said it always 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.850
 generation then the exclusive games of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 Playstation 4 were one step ahead 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 ahead in terms of graphic potential 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.700
 that of xbox 360 but the games 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.230
 multiplatform then to now as 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.120
 you all know how to develop them as 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.000
 they will be much easier for the xbox 360 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.600
 that for playstation 4 because the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.570
 developers optimize they go much better 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.430
 these games for the xbox 360 but this 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.770
 generation the future generation that we 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.900
 comes on it's not going to be like that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.790
 therefore good good I do not know if it's going to 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.130
 be very easy to develop for the 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.890
 two consoles so we face 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.900
 a technical draw and only the exclusive ones 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.520
 the difference will be clearly noticed 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.320
 abysmal between the two things the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.010
 abysmal difference not the difference that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.900
 there's between the two consoles so no 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.210
 I want you to tell me that you tell me 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.850
 just leave your like and favorites 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.350
 that helps us spread the news and 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.350
 see you in the next chao
