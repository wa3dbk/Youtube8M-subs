hello<00:00:12.460> it's<00:00:12.730> matt<00:00:12.940> from<00:00:12.969> JK<00:00:13.719> and<00:00:13.929> today<00:00:14.139> we're

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
hello it's matt from JK and today we're

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.810 
hello it's matt from JK and today we're
looking<00:00:14.380> at<00:00:14.620> some<00:00:14.679> of<00:00:14.889> the<00:00:15.009> new<00:00:15.190> t-rex<00:00:15.550> pedals

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
looking at some of the new t-rex pedals

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.550 
looking at some of the new t-rex pedals
I've<00:00:15.940> got<00:00:16.150> the<00:00:16.270> vulture<00:00:16.570> Distortion<00:00:17.050> really

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
I've got the vulture Distortion really

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.680 
I've got the vulture Distortion really
love<00:00:17.680> this<00:00:17.830> unit<00:00:18.160> it's<00:00:18.910> not<00:00:19.210> really<00:00:19.570> like

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.690 
love this unit it's not really like

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.170 
love this unit it's not really like
anything<00:00:20.109> else<00:00:20.230> it<00:00:20.470> does<00:00:20.650> a<00:00:20.680> huge<00:00:21.160> range<00:00:21.880> of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
anything else it does a huge range of

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.540 
anything else it does a huge range of
game<00:00:22.449> tones<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.930> game<00:00:23.080> control<00:00:23.470> itself<00:00:23.859> goes

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
game tones the game control itself goes

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.220 
game tones the game control itself goes
from<00:00:24.789> almost<00:00:25.090> like<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.300> clean<00:00:25.600> boost<00:00:25.869> to<00:00:26.050> kind

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
from almost like a clean boost to kind

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.529 
from almost like a clean boost to kind
of<00:00:26.350> really<00:00:26.710> full-on<00:00:27.130> distortion<00:00:27.670> so<00:00:27.880> it's<00:00:28.330> not

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
of really full-on distortion so it's not

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.720 
of really full-on distortion so it's not
kind<00:00:28.810> of<00:00:28.930> your<00:00:29.080> 808<00:00:29.650> style<00:00:29.980> overdrive<00:00:30.460> and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
kind of your 808 style overdrive and

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.790 
kind of your 808 style overdrive and
it's<00:00:30.820> not<00:00:31.000> kind<00:00:31.240> of<00:00:31.359> a<00:00:31.420> ds1<00:00:32.050> it<00:00:32.199> it's<00:00:32.500> something

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
it's not kind of a ds1 it it's something

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.009 
it's not kind of a ds1 it it's something
totally<00:00:32.980> different<00:00:33.129> you've<00:00:34.030> got<00:00:34.239> also<00:00:34.449> the

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
totally different you've got also the

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.500 
totally different you've got also the
nice<00:00:35.350> inclusion<00:00:35.829> of<00:00:35.920> a<00:00:36.070> low<00:00:36.309> boost<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.270> a<00:00:37.329> fat

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
nice inclusion of a low boost and a fat

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.900 
nice inclusion of a low boost and a fat
boost<00:00:37.750> so<00:00:37.989> one<00:00:38.170> does<00:00:38.350> your<00:00:38.500> mid-range<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.790> one

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
boost so one does your mid-range and one

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.010 
boost so one does your mid-range and one
does<00:00:40.090> your<00:00:40.210> bottom<00:00:40.390> end<00:00:40.510> so<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.690> can<00:00:40.780> get<00:00:40.870> some

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
does your bottom end so you can get some

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.020 
does your bottom end so you can get some
really<00:00:41.260> booming<00:00:41.890> some<00:00:42.129> huge<00:00:42.520> sounds<00:00:42.850> out<00:00:42.940> of

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
really booming some huge sounds out of

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.340 
really booming some huge sounds out of
it<00:00:43.180> just<00:00:43.540> nice<00:00:43.750> if<00:00:43.930> you're<00:00:44.050> going<00:00:44.170> through

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
it just nice if you're going through

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.110 
it just nice if you're going through
something<00:00:44.410> this<00:00:44.739> like<00:00:44.920> a<00:00:44.950> 1<00:00:45.190> by<00:00:45.340> 12<00:00:45.610> or<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:45.850> 2<00:00:45.969> by

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
something this like a 1 by 12 or a 2 by

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.299 
something this like a 1 by 12 or a 2 by
12<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:46.510> want<00:00:46.719> to<00:00:46.899> emulate<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.590> much<00:00:48.010> bigger

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
12 and you want to emulate a much bigger

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.040 
12 and you want to emulate a much bigger
cab<00:00:48.610> or<00:00:48.820> that<00:00:48.940> you're<00:00:49.059> pushing<00:00:49.360> much<00:00:49.660> more<00:00:49.870> air

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
cab or that you're pushing much more air

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.540 
cab or that you're pushing much more air
and<00:00:50.320> also<00:00:50.649> you<00:00:50.770> can<00:00:50.920> roll<00:00:51.100> them<00:00:51.219> off<00:00:51.370> so<00:00:51.489> you

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
and also you can roll them off so you

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.529 
and also you can roll them off so you
can<00:00:51.670> get<00:00:51.789> something<00:00:51.969> a<00:00:52.059> little<00:00:52.090> bit<00:00:52.329> brighter

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
can get something a little bit brighter

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.139 
can get something a little bit brighter
so<00:00:53.079> if<00:00:53.170> you're<00:00:53.289> using<00:00:53.500> it<00:00:53.739> as<00:00:54.430> a<00:00:54.489> boost<00:00:54.820> on<00:00:55.000> top

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
so if you're using it as a boost on top

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.910 
so if you're using it as a boost on top
of<00:00:55.300> more<00:00:55.480> gain<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:56.170> works<00:00:56.379> really<00:00:56.559> well<00:00:56.649> for

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
of more gain it works really well for

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.240 
of more gain it works really well for
that

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
that

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.100 
that
it's<00:00:57.610> just<00:00:57.760> mono<00:00:57.969> in<00:00:58.149> and<00:00:58.300> out<00:00:58.390> obviously<00:00:58.780> with

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
it's just mono in and out obviously with

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.290 
it's just mono in and out obviously with
a<00:00:59.410> standard<00:00:59.920> nine-volt<00:01:00.370> so<00:01:00.730> let's<00:01:00.879> plug<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.210> in

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
a standard nine-volt so let's plug it in

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.150 
a standard nine-volt so let's plug it in
and<00:01:01.449> go<00:01:02.020> through<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.260> range<00:01:02.379> of<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.559> sounds<00:01:02.770> so

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
and go through a range of the sounds so

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.260 
and go through a range of the sounds so
I've<00:01:03.250> got<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.520> vulture<00:01:03.760> plugged<00:01:03.969> in<00:01:04.089> we're

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
I've got the vulture plugged in we're

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.700 
I've got the vulture plugged in we're
going<00:01:04.420> American<00:01:04.780> Standard<00:01:05.050> tele<00:01:05.229> into<00:01:05.680> a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
going American Standard tele into a

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.260 
going American Standard tele into a
blues<00:01:05.890> jr.<00:01:06.280> just<00:01:06.580> for<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:06.729> nice<00:01:06.880> clean<00:01:07.119> sound

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.060 

and<00:01:10.689> I've<00:01:10.960> got<00:01:11.079> the<00:01:11.170> pedal<00:01:11.439> setup<00:01:11.680> for<00:01:11.890> saw<00:01:12.039> a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
and I've got the pedal setup for saw a

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.679 
and I've got the pedal setup for saw a
relatively<00:01:12.579> mild<00:01:12.909> gain<00:01:13.210> setting<00:01:13.479> something

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
relatively mild gain setting something

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.060 
relatively mild gain setting something
that<00:01:13.840> you<00:01:13.899> could<00:01:14.020> leave<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.740> know<00:01:14.859> all<00:01:14.979> the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
that you could leave on you know all the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:38.370 
that you could leave on you know all the
time<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.390> it's<00:01:37.509> quite<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.689> nice<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:38.049> brings<00:01:38.259> out

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
time so it's quite a nice it brings out

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.469 
time so it's quite a nice it brings out
the<00:01:38.500> dynamics<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:38.979> Italian<00:01:42.119> we've<00:01:43.119> returned

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
the dynamics of Italian we've returned

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.359 
the dynamics of Italian we've returned
the<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.989> gain<00:01:44.140> up<00:01:44.319> a<00:01:44.349> bit<00:01:44.530> something<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:45.099> little

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
the the gain up a bit something a little

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:55.980 
the the gain up a bit something a little
bit<00:01:45.489> heavier

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.090 

that's<00:01:56.990> really<00:01:57.259> increases<00:01:57.649> little<00:01:57.920> bit<00:01:58.009> at

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
that's really increases little bit at

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.709 
that's really increases little bit at
the<00:01:58.159> bottom<00:01:58.249> end<00:01:58.460> but<00:01:58.609> we<00:01:58.700> can<00:01:58.909> actually<00:01:59.090> add

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
the bottom end but we can actually add

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.050 
the bottom end but we can actually add
some<00:02:00.140> more<00:02:00.289> in<00:02:00.409> with<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.710> low<00:02:00.859> boost<00:02:01.130> and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
some more in with the low boost and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.279 
some more in with the low boost and
we've<00:02:02.210> got<00:02:02.359> the<00:02:02.450> fat<00:02:02.630> boost<00:02:02.840> as<00:02:02.960> well<00:02:03.020> for<00:02:03.259> a

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
we've got the fat boost as well for a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.139 
we've got the fat boost as well for a
bit<00:02:03.409> more<00:02:03.530> much<00:02:06.369> really<00:02:07.369> fills<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.759> out<00:02:07.850> gives

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
bit more much really fills it out gives

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.430 
bit more much really fills it out gives
the<00:02:08.269> emulation<00:02:08.599> you're<00:02:08.899> going<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.259> much

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
the emulation you're going to a much

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:29.910 
the emulation you're going to a much
bigger<00:02:09.619> cap

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:44.710 

really<00:02:30.920> nice<00:02:31.069> rhythm<00:02:31.370> work

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.910 

and<00:02:45.720> let's<00:02:45.900> try<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.140> with<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.379> gain<00:02:46.560> all<00:02:46.799> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
and let's try it with the gain all the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.589 
and let's try it with the gain all the
way<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.430> we'll<00:02:47.610> turn<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.909> fat<00:02:48.090> boost<00:02:48.299> all

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
way up and we'll turn the fat boost all

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.030 
way up and we'll turn the fat boost all
the<00:02:48.720> way<00:02:48.810> up<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.080> well<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.500> we'll<00:02:49.739> dial<00:02:49.920> in

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
the way up as well and we'll dial in

00:02:50.040 --> 00:03:24.949 
the way up as well and we'll dial in
just<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.250> little<00:02:50.430> bit<00:02:50.519> more<00:02:50.640> time

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.710 

and<00:03:25.110> then<00:03:25.680> we'll<00:03:26.160> just<00:03:26.340> try<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.550> game<00:03:26.760> down

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
and then we'll just try the game down

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.290 
and then we'll just try the game down
and<00:03:28.709> we'll<00:03:29.010> just<00:03:29.160> turn<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.459> level<00:03:29.700> up<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:30.000> tiny

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
and we'll just turn the level up a tiny

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:50.300 
and we'll just turn the level up a tiny
bit<00:03:48.140> works<00:03:49.140> almost<00:03:49.380> like<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.650> treble<00:03:50.010> booster

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
bit works almost like a treble booster

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.440 
bit works almost like a treble booster
so<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.640> gives<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:50.910> little<00:03:51.000> bit<00:03:51.150> more<00:03:51.269> top

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
so just gives you a little bit more top

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:30.839 
so just gives you a little bit more top
end

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.909
