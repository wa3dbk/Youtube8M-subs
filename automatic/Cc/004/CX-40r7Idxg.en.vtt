00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
bit and then I just do it I don't really

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.300 
bit and then I just do it I don't really
have<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.750> like<00:05:09.900> sit<00:05:10.169> there<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.590> contemplate

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
have to like sit there and contemplate

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.089 
have to like sit there and contemplate
what<00:05:11.880> I'm<00:05:11.970> doing<00:05:12.240> lap<00:05:12.419> by<00:05:12.599> lap<00:05:12.630> but<00:05:13.409> in<00:05:13.560> Forza<00:05:13.949> -

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
what I'm doing lap by lap but in Forza -

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.950 
what I'm doing lap by lap but in Forza -
in<00:05:14.280> Forza<00:05:14.639> 5<00:05:14.789> I<00:05:14.849> kinda<00:05:15.180> have<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.360> like<00:05:15.479> oh<00:05:15.509> man

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
in Forza 5 I kinda have to like oh man

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.140 
in Forza 5 I kinda have to like oh man
oh<00:05:16.169> no<00:05:16.800> I<00:05:17.099> kind<00:05:17.490> of<00:05:17.550> really<00:05:17.789> have<00:05:17.940> to<00:05:18.030> pay

oh no I kind of really have to pay
attention<00:05:18.389> here<00:05:19.669> for<00:05:20.669> Forza<00:05:21.150> -<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:21.300> think<00:05:21.419> it's

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
attention here for Forza - I think it's

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.240

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
got but again the same thing applies to

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.550 
got but again the same thing applies to
both<00:05:27.570> games<00:05:27.780> anyway<00:05:28.080> this<00:05:28.560> car<00:05:28.860> is<00:05:29.070> a

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
both games anyway this car is a

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.480 
both games anyway this car is a
something<00:05:31.560> that<00:05:31.680> they<00:05:31.770> don't<00:05:31.889> do<00:05:32.099> anymore

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
something that they don't do anymore

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.399 
something that they don't do anymore
which<00:05:32.639> is<00:05:32.759> basically<00:05:32.940> like<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.509> toon<00:05:33.870> car<00:05:34.139> it

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
which is basically like a toon car it

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.490 
which is basically like a toon car it
was<00:05:34.620> real<00:05:34.860> or<00:05:35.310> not<00:05:35.820> but<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.419> was<00:05:36.570> like<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:37.050> tuned

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500
