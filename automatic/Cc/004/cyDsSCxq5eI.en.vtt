00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
corners all the corners are pretty hard

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.660 
corners all the corners are pretty hard
to<00:03:40.760> get<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.570> don't<00:03:41.989> find<00:03:42.440> them<00:03:42.620> as<00:03:42.860> reliable

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
to get to I don't find them as reliable

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.990

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
sometimes but just not as others I just

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.460 
sometimes but just not as others I just
feel<00:03:50.209> like<00:03:50.360> it's<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.690> little<00:03:50.870> bit<00:03:51.140> harder<00:03:51.440> to

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
feel like it's a little bit harder to

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.400 
feel like it's a little bit harder to
get<00:03:51.709> to<00:03:52.150> some<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.330> times<00:03:53.570> if<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.110> like<00:03:54.290> the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
get to some of the times if you like the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.320 
get to some of the times if you like the
corners<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.010> know<00:03:55.250> feel<00:03:55.670> free<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:56.030> use

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
corners and you know feel free to use

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.259 
corners and you know feel free to use
those<00:03:56.600> but<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.290> just<00:03:57.950> feel<00:03:58.130> that<00:03:58.160> my<00:03:58.519> my<00:03:58.970> hands

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.400 
those but I just feel that my my hands
are<00:03:59.390> normally<00:03:59.720> there<00:03:59.930> than<00:04:00.140> normally<00:04:00.380> I

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
are normally there than normally I

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.290 
are normally there than normally I
decide<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:01.100> that's<00:04:01.370> why<00:04:01.580> I<00:04:01.610> like<00:04:01.850> that<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.120> can
