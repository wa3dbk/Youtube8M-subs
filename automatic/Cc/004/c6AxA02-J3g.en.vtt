00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
two-fifty can we break 250 miles an hour

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.949 
two-fifty can we break 250 miles an hour
I<00:03:49.690> think<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:52.030> rains<00:03:52.330> probably<00:03:52.810> not

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
I think so the rains probably not

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.380 
I think so the rains probably not
helping<00:03:53.520> but<00:03:54.520> we<00:03:54.670> sort<00:03:54.880> of<00:03:54.910> just<00:03:55.090> got<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:55.300> go

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
helping but we sort of just got to go

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.660 
helping but we sort of just got to go
with<00:03:55.420> it

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
with it

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.130 
with it
all<00:03:57.670> right<00:03:57.849> so<00:03:58.000> twitch<00:03:58.239> chat<00:03:58.480> watch<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.870> speed

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
I got 253 miles an hour that is insane

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.969 
I got 253 miles an hour that is insane
real<00:05:28.150> quick<00:05:28.360> put<00:05:28.930> on<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.200> rally<00:05:29.410> tires<00:05:29.740> and

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
real quick put on the rally tires and

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.590 
real quick put on the rally tires and
see<00:05:30.100> if<00:05:30.160> we<00:05:30.250> can<00:05:30.370> possibly<00:05:30.700> beat<00:05:31.120> that<00:05:31.270> I<00:05:31.360> don't

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
see if we can possibly beat that I don't

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.440

think<00:05:31.780> we'll<00:05:31.870> be<00:05:31.900> able<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.340> but<00:05:33.340> let's<00:05:34.300> see

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
think we'll be able to but let's see

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.730 
think we'll be able to but let's see
froak<00:05:35.050> froak<00:05:35.740> z<00:05:36.340> froak<00:05:37.180> c<00:05:37.470> donated<00:05:38.470> six

dollars<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.580> rally<00:05:39.850> tires<00:05:40.180> they<00:05:40.390> should<00:05:40.600> be

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
dollars the rally tires they should be

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.270 
dollars the rally tires they should be
able<00:05:40.750> to<00:05:40.840> do<00:05:40.990> offer<00:05:41.169> two<00:05:41.500> right<00:05:41.650> all<00:05:42.010> right<00:05:42.130> so

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
able to do offer two right all right so

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.580 
able to do offer two right all right so
let's<00:05:42.430> just<00:05:42.610> test<00:05:42.789> out<00:05:42.910> these<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.720> rally<00:05:44.229> cars

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
let's just test out these the rally cars

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.570 
let's just test out these the rally cars
I<00:05:46.350> guess<00:05:47.350> they<00:05:47.530> should<00:05:47.680> work<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.979> rally<00:05:48.250> tires

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
I guess they should work the rally tires

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.830 
I guess they should work the rally tires
they<00:05:48.760> should<00:05:48.940> be<00:05:49.060> able<00:05:49.180> to<00:05:49.240> do<00:05:49.330> kind<00:05:49.539> of<00:05:49.720> well

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
they should be able to do kind of well

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.409 
they should be able to do kind of well
off-road<00:05:50.669> but<00:05:51.669> it<00:05:51.760> said<00:05:51.880> it<00:05:51.970> made<00:05:52.090> our<00:05:52.210> grip

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
off-road but it said it made our grip

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.230 
off-road but it said it made our grip
force<00:05:52.630> which<00:05:52.810> is<00:05:52.930> kind

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
force which is kind

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.510 
force which is kind
kind<00:05:53.750> of<00:05:53.780> weird<00:05:53.930> but<00:05:54.110> let's<00:05:54.979> let's<00:05:55.220> see<00:05:55.400> what

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
kind of weird but let's let's see what

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.159 
kind of weird but let's let's see what
happens<00:05:57.430> so<00:05:58.449> 253<00:05:59.449> miles<00:05:59.630> an<00:05:59.810> hour's<00:05:59.990> what<00:06:00.110> we

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
happens so 253 miles an hour's what we
