00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.220
 I'm going to show you how to do this 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.620
 can make nice bracelets with one 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.100
 herringbone pattern where you who herringbone you 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.400
 see those walking around on this video 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.820
 let's see the bracelet at the top of the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:26.900
 corner you will find a link to the video for 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.089
 The bed through to confirm which it 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.270
 you can make this bracelet on the 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.520
 mouthpiece two if you don't have a monster tail 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.550
 you can also call the adjustable 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.430
 and then the rows opposite each other 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.750
 and use 4 dots because we 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.750
 need four pins 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.850
 I am now going to show on the monster two 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.449
 on this and we are going to these four pins 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.449
 use 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.660
 I'm going to format it in three different ones 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:02.329
 colors I start with silver and we go 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.980
 from here bottom to top and 8 make you 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:12.670
 closely you look like this 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.670
 also in silver and 8 you then come on 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:24.380
 and then we try a purple places 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:29.870
 just straight and foam that you do 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:32.750
 not turning around and the other way too 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.490
 a purple one 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.830
 Well then the third is you for that 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:44.840
 reflection you chose which we go on 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:50.270
 hooves underneath in places and others 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.520
 now you have three rubber bands 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.710
 it seems to be above each other 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.930
 very much like a regular herringbone 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.320
 Now goes the the bottom of the oven 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:05.330
 he after the shoot lower over it which 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.610
 the soul group must also be under we 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.020
 let the soul hook over it 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:15.459
 you run your telecom monster and then again 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.459
 also how often 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:26.300
 do you want all rubber bands to 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.180
 down the color that hooked over it 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.480
 have that you are going to set up again 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.040
 so and soul so important you we 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.239
 the same way we are late 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.680
 always first 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.680
 from bottom left to top right 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.709
 and then from bottom right to 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.709
 top left 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.330
 Now we turn and hook you 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.110
 lower 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.110
 over it 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.909
 right here team members pins 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.230
 tell pieces then again on the 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:13.959
 pins 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:23.349
 and then we pick up the purple purple 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:26.310
 put to the bottom role would often 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.310
 be over it 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.840
 slightly down 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.450
 well you keep going until you 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.760
 bracelet comes slicing say here 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.610
 but comes out until it's long enough 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.590
 I'm going to pause the video and me 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:57.400
 come back to you when our bracelet becomes 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:59.560
 our bracelet is now advanced 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.310
 long enough so I'm going to leave you now 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.680
 see how doing makes the end 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.810
 we have two rubber bands everywhere 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.720
 and so we're not going to have a new rubber band 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.519
 but instead we go 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.220
 we will go one of those two rubber bands 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.690
 so in this case I am going to 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.690
 air conditioning function over it 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.620
 on the other hand too 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.570
 Well now you have all the pins 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.190
 put a rubber band then we go from the 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.000
 on the right side the rubber bands to the 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.810
 bring left side by the silver one 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.810
 other side 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:02.500
 so now we have two of them here now 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.250
 rubber bands through the lower silver too 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.250
 the over it 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:18.490
 well the we two silver over and the dunes 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:21.300
 supply crochet hook and that goes and fastens 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.300
 with it's chicken 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.120
 Another chance I have to do is on the S clip 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.020
 then you now have a very nice round here 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.550
 herringbone bracelet 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.830
 you can now go to the other video 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.620
 go to see how you see the bible 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.620
 can make and confirm to this
