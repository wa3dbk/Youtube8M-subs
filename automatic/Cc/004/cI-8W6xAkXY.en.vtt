00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.520
 We are now in the middle of the forest, 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.600
 near Cologne in Germany. 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.280
 I'm waiting here 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.160
 on cars with beautiful rear lights 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.160
 I will follow that. 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.540
 My name is Gerald Doerne. I work for Ford 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.160
 as a Development Engineer 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.160
 for the advanced light assistance technologies department. 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.400
 I follow cars because I have the 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.920
 new light technologies from the Ford Focus. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.760
 When I drive here 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.240
 and following a car, 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.360
 I follow no longer than 5 or 10 minutes. 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.360
 I don't want to scare people. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.920
 We want to make it easier for the driver through it 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.200
 automate switching on and off of the high beam. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.880
 So that he can concentrate on driving. 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.140
 One of the tasks of the system 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.380
 is the detection of rear lights of cars. 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.320
 There are many different types of rear lights 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 and we must be sure 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 that we can detect them all. 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.920
 We have been to different countries throughout Europe, 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.280
 we have identified the most critical places. 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.940
 For example, there are roads in northern Italy where testing is difficult 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 because the reflectors are very bright. 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.300
 I like to ride in the Alps. 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.040
 There are many areas there that you can see 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.920
 and beautiful roads. 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.680
 I love the British drivers 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.660
 because they are very relaxed 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.300
 and very friendly. 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.080
 The French often blink with their high beam. 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.900
 They don't like being blinded. 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.160
 So when we are on the road 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.720
 we follow cars all day. 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.520
 I like that we like the cars 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.900
 try to improve, 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.360
 so that fewer accidents happen.
