what<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> galaxy<00:00:22.140> really<00:00:22.439> were<00:00:22.560> made<00:00:22.830> of

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
what if the galaxy really were made of

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.160 
what if the galaxy really were made of
paper<00:00:23.390> I'm<00:00:24.390> not<00:00:24.570> even<00:00:24.750> sure<00:00:24.779> how<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.109> would

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
paper I'm not even sure how that would

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.439 
paper I'm not even sure how that would
work<00:00:25.400> actually<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.460> kind<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.300> think

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
work actually it kind of is if you think

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.450 
work actually it kind of is if you think
about<00:00:27.480> space-time<00:00:27.990> that's<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.130> flat

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
about space-time that's just a flat

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.330 
about space-time that's just a flat
sheet<00:00:29.820> well<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.840> can't<00:00:31.050> draw<00:00:31.560> pictures<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.189> it

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340

that's that's literally the only
scientific<00:00:35.070> problem<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.969> comparison

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
scientific problem with that comparison

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
scientific problem with that comparison
and<00:00:37.050> such<00:00:37.260> are<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> questions<00:00:38.040> posed<00:00:38.460> by

am<00:01:10.760> that's<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.780> again<00:01:13.110> we're<00:01:13.770> jumping

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
am that's like see again we're jumping

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.730 
am that's like see again we're jumping
all<00:01:14.369> over<00:01:14.400> science<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.540> thing<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
all over science with this thing so the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.980 
all over science with this thing so the
crazy<00:01:16.979> thing<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.369> paper<00:01:17.850> galaxy<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
crazy thing about paper galaxy is that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
crazy thing about paper galaxy is that
there's<00:01:19.619> actually<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.040> story<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.820> guess<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
there's actually a story I guess the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.200 
there's actually a story I guess the
moon<00:01:21.659> catches<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> cold<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.610> think<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
moon catches a cold and I think it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
moon catches a cold and I think it
sneezes<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> crab<00:01:25.409> nebula<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:26.070> something

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
sneezes on the crab nebula or something

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
sneezes on the crab nebula or something
and<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.240> now<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:27.869> acting<00:01:28.320> all

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and so now it's you know it's acting all

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.230 
and so now it's you know it's acting all
bitchy<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> trying<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> swallow<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.060> moon

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
bitchy and trying to swallow the moon

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149 
bitchy and trying to swallow the moon
hole<00:01:30.509> at<00:01:30.960> which<00:01:31.140> point<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.530> sheer<00:01:31.710> force<00:01:31.979> of

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
hole at which point the sheer force of

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.460 
hole at which point the sheer force of
the<00:01:32.250> gravity<00:01:32.280> would<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.970> literally<00:01:33.840> pull<00:01:34.320> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the gravity would like literally pull it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.100 
the gravity would like literally pull it
up<00:01:34.909> look<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.090> don't<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.960> get<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
up look I don't know what you you get to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.770 
up look I don't know what you you get to
collect<00:01:37.530> stars<00:01:37.920> alright<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.090> jump<00:01:39.689> over

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
collect stars alright and jump over

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.819 
collect stars alright and jump over
planets<00:01:40.380> by<00:01:40.560> sneezing

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.289 

so<00:01:45.829> basically<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:46.490> have<00:01:46.609> a<00:01:46.640> few<00:01:46.909> objectives

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
so basically you have a few objectives

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.719 
so basically you have a few objectives
here<00:01:47.719> keep<00:01:48.109> the<00:01:48.320> moon<00:01:48.530> out<00:01:48.799> of<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:48.979> pursuing

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
here keep the moon out of the pursuing

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.120 
here keep the moon out of the pursuing
Crab<00:01:50.030> Nebula<00:01:50.420> collect<00:01:51.140> as<00:01:51.259> many<00:01:51.380> stars<00:01:51.799> as<00:01:51.979> you

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
Crab Nebula collect as many stars as you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.969 
Crab Nebula collect as many stars as you
can<00:01:52.490> follow<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.689> cosmic<00:01:54.079> butterfly<00:01:54.530> your

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
can follow the cosmic butterfly your

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.919 
can follow the cosmic butterfly your
moon<00:01:55.159> orbits<00:01:55.640> whatever<00:01:55.939> planet<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.539> reaches

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
moon orbits whatever planet it reaches

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.169 
moon orbits whatever planet it reaches
automatically<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.979> move<00:01:58.280> by<00:01:58.579> tapping

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
automatically you move by tapping

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.700 
automatically you move by tapping
whatever<00:01:59.479> direction<00:01:59.810> you'd<00:02:00.350> like<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.679> to

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
whatever direction you'd like it to

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.850 
whatever direction you'd like it to
sneeze<00:02:01.069> in<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.759> sends<00:02:02.179> it<00:02:02.270> flying<00:02:02.860> hopefully

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
sneeze in that sends it flying hopefully

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.350 
sneeze in that sends it flying hopefully
toward<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.159> planet<00:02:04.549> there's<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.090> fine<00:02:05.329> line

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
toward a planet there's a fine line

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.959 
toward a planet there's a fine line
between<00:02:05.719> moon<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.590> meteorites<00:02:06.920> but<00:02:07.909> you

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
between moon and meteorites but you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.729 
between moon and meteorites but you
don't<00:02:08.149> want<00:02:08.269> Bruce<00:02:08.479> Willis<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.049> show<00:02:09.289> up<00:02:09.470> so

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
don't want Bruce Willis to show up so

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.100 
don't want Bruce Willis to show up so
the<00:02:10.640> gameplay<00:02:11.060> couldn't<00:02:11.390> be<00:02:11.480> simpler<00:02:11.840> it's

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
the gameplay couldn't be simpler it's

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.650 
the gameplay couldn't be simpler it's
all<00:02:12.230> about<00:02:12.410> good<00:02:12.680> aim<00:02:12.890> building<00:02:13.730> speed<00:02:14.060> going

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
all about good aim building speed going

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.509 
all about good aim building speed going
as<00:02:14.870> far<00:02:15.049> as<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.319> can<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.040> addictive

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
as far as you can but it's addictive

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.729 
as far as you can but it's addictive
because<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.209> game<00:02:17.329> also<00:02:17.569> gives<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:17.959> 100<00:02:18.170> sub

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
because the game also gives you 100 sub

for<00:02:21.290> those<00:02:21.739> are<00:02:21.950> new<00:02:22.099> even<00:02:22.400> more<00:02:22.579> stars<00:02:22.970> which

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
for those are new even more stars which

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.539 
for those are new even more stars which
