 more difficult that's why my wife and I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.229
 additional which are the workshop of 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.330
 impression that is the most recent the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.740
 branding company and school 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.380
 dance 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 dance classes born by the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.509
 I wish I could do it from home and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.250
 they earned money so he could help 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.340

 Bachata is like that

 the sauce is more so clear 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.060

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.700
 nothing happens 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.409
 When I was 13 years old my parents 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.710
 they divorced so I had to face 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.380
 two fears the first one was if my 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.049
 marriage was not going to end the same and the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.080
 second was if I was going to be able to provide for 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.399
 a family I have learned in the 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.670
 Church of Jesus Christ of the Saints of 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.920
 the last days what is faith in Christ 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.799
 so when I was taking the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 decision to marry me at that moment I felt 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.630
 as God assured me that I did not have to 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 worry that if I did what he 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.330
 I said everything was going to turn out well and that's how it 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330
 been 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.489
 I love being a mom and the restless ones 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.489
 they are no matter 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.940
 and my name is Luis Navarro 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.590
 I'm a girlfriend, I 'm an entrepreneur, I'm a mom 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.120
 of my two earthquakes 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.750

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.750
