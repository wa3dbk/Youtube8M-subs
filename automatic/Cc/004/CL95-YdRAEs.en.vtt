00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.799
 gold said 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.199
 is the uncle thought not to speak about the 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:20.070
 sequence of one of the classics 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:25.500
 better free to play than there are 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.760
 the dark idem this rpg that already generated many 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.399
 fans due to their very pvp ability 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.280
 interesting a vampire c humans 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.480
 bringing the slayer sneh the famous 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.040
 English from daea dem to a dark sequence 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.550
 and iron man 2 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.700
 the Korean company only tone entertainment 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.340
 will finally bring the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.989
 classic title battle between the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.829
 readers and vampires do not pairs in 1997 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.199
 this world of giving and in two or 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.670
 time the next year reached 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.570
 because I know it 's being chic 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.320
 understood 200 years ago after the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.130
 thus having in a world plus one 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.729
 modern for the zino player to hear me 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 could miss pv with pvp war 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.020
 who with them continues with them 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.509
 dark and have 1 mechanisms and for sure 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.450
 is definitely what fans of the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.479
 game really wanted was that the dark and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.759
 nor do they have nicer graphics like that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.329
 type java and 3 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.920
 only of course with that pvp thing from 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.259
 give fun 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.270
 if you never played at the time it was a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.549
 I play today may be worth the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.340
 Worth to know and understand the game more 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.130
 It's 1997, so you think it's only 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.430
 because the old one just a little aggravated 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.860
 now with a new system in which there are 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.119
 go to the Tagus River which means that it is 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.119
 the silva piu if the law he is bitten 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.119
 take that hint that narrow - minded 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.220
 understood that he could become a 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.250
 vampire 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.850
 girÃ£o was treated in time with a 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.880
 medicine that will have inside the game 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.830
 that is besides having the pv thinking about the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.320
 lakers and neighborhoods 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.020
 readers can be transformed into 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.750
 campaigns in the middle of the game, ie 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.160
 leoninos players is because it has 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.410
 coast because anytime you 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.990
 You can move to the other side understood 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.630
 this brings a very interesting dynamic 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.900
 well all white pvp permanently 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.910
 game for sure you bpm is one of the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.980
 characteristics that the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.330
 game does not have several more 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.270
 systems that have not been spoken by 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.120
 creator of the game but for sure they 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.360
 are there trying to bring a sequence 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.410
 real is not that fucking time 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.209
 greg noh 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.470
 I understand what they are trying to surround the sequence. 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.650
 which had nothing to do with the game 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.750
 Anderson and I do not think they will. 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.400
 make the same mistake and why people 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.400
 Are you going to think about it? 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.940
 means that we are going to have a team 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.640
 very faithful to his predecessor 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.510
 leaving lots of people but a lot of people 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.600
 same 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.459
 the fan of a very apprehensive to see how it is 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.080
 which will be situation 2 by the 3 knots 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.600
 we can see that the gameplay continues 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.640
 isometric is the devil only with 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.370
 graphics or myths yes or no for the 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.650
 dramatic because some thing that is not 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.180
 fuck 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.580
 so I hope you have tanned 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.480
 just like I used to do in the early afternoon 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.209
 and m2 because it was a great game on 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.250
 season certainly had a lot to do 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.360
 cool 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.820
 unfortunately it 's a pretty game teaches 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.660
 that no laine is that thing that stays 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.750
 kind of the heart and let's see how it is 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.140
 who will be the 2 and if he will win 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.110
 some the American publisher believe 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.280
 go because the game yes this game 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.580
 has a large public 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.110
 sure that on the side of here and with 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.870

 pvp true friend that is 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:40.689

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.360
 Everyone, I'm going to
