00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.120
 nathalie mme auclair started the trail 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.969
 in 2010 first big performance 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.610
 a second place for the Templars in 2011 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.070
 since she accumulates the victories and the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.869
 family home to change decoration 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.720
 I think the library did it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.260
 since then and had to dress it up and that's it 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.510
 been found very simple we did not have 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.189
 need to buy specific objects 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.780
 it stops and 8 actually filled with with 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.300
 that's what I bring back as I go 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.400
 measurement of trips and competitions 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.140
 world champion in 2013 in the country of 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.860
 galls she is about to hand over her 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.020
 title in game 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.290
 towards the maxi reis lake Annecy 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 women and 2015 with the hope of 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.350
 keep his crown 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.930
 I would like afterwards I know that the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.370
 competition will be tough and that the whole 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.140
 world wants this title so we go 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.850
 all go in that spirit 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.850
 compared to what I could do on 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.739
 other competitions I tell myself that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.180
 it's doable 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.259
 after doing it as best as possible 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.999
 but it's a nice trail circuit there from 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.409
 we are really when I 

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.389
 found better in the discipline of 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.310
 trail test is a test that goes 

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:16.200
 well reflected our discipline 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.389
 I think it's a circuit of the coup 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.299
 who goes to have a real europe 

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:23.819
 a true recognition of the title 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.289
 because despite all the high country of 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.560
 galls the fact that it's a circuit in 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.479
 loop 2500 meters of altitude that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.979
 there in fact more than 5000 so there of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.730
 coup I think it will also allow 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.580
 to revalue 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.890
 the world championship trail 86 km 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.200
 the format has almost become course for 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.660
 nathalie mauclair twice victorious 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.880
 170 km of the big meeting raid 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.770
 but the champion knows what he 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 remains to be done rework this 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.630
 feeling of speed because here we go 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.860
 to be on a run 10 12h pretty much I 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.840
 do not know too much I did not do the calculations 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.990
 but I think we're going to be around that 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.720
 and me, so I'm more of 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.160
 formats 24 30 hours so 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.170
 so here's regaining speed 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.210
 recommended it will be my focus 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.390
 priority 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.970
 after - elevation I do not have any 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.870
 continue with the bike enjoy at 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.930
 maximum of the internship the team of France in 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.140
 April to recognize the course 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.390
 and then the gemmi at the beginning of 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.110
 season the ventoux and then a small internship 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.650
 in Morocco 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.330
 so also where there will be a difference in altitude 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.190
 famars nurse cadre a few 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.590
 kilometers from mans nathalie mme auclair 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.750
 has always lived in sarthe where his 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.420
 coast training is difficult 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.320
 comparable to the relief of mont blanc or 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.360
 the Reunion Island 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.400
 it's a rating then did a kilometer 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.810
 when I learn it from one point to another 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.370
 so it's a haircut that I can 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.860
 to do in specific repetition 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.790
 the essential already is to run it is 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.160
 find sensations I want to 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.590
 say that even at the limit the work in 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.620
 climb for me I still arrive at 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.940
 manage it well 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.910
 it's more work on descents 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.590
 which penalizes me and there against 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.680
 no ground at all to train 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.840
 because going down even if I say to myself 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.790
 I do it thoroughly nothing at all to see 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.580
 with a big descent several 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.950
 kilometers with several hundred 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.660
 meters of elevation and it's more where 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.880
 it's difficult for me muscularly 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.190
 difficulties offset by a good 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.160
 muscular composition an iron mind 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.610
 and the pride of representing his country 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.890
 once I donned the team outfit 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.330
 de france was born diaper for more 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.209
 really for me what i'm running too 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.470
 for for France I represent the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.769
 France is also what I am asked 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.060
 to do and I play myself fully the 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.569
 game and I take pleasure in 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.780
 to play this game there and suddenly when the 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.060
 supporters do not necessarily say go 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.730
 nathalie but she is the france wars 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.540
 say all this on my little shoulders 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.069
 what and suddenly it does not like me 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.400
 really gives me a momentum a motivation 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.800
 has something more besides what a more that 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.390
 will be increased tenfold this year to 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.320
 the France team that runs to these 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.320
 global home
