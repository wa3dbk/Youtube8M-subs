00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.319
 Hi there, this is a short video review. 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.500
 our new wind block on 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.500
 gas discharge indicators and n14 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.650
 Let's start with the fact that this unit has 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.789
 small size 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:32.219
 unlike our previous 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:36.239
 Light enough 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.260
 unit here is a remote adapter adapter on 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.680
 12 volts 3 ampere girlfriend afraid here 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680
 this is a nest 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:57.079
 the power indicator lights up turn on 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:08.550
 initial range of 1.2 volts is worth 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:20.280
 multiturn resistor allowing 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:22.250
 do very fine tuning here arisen 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:28.140
 neighbor 3 volts 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 our final ie from this range 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.210
 enough for most work 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.210
 normal machines so there is a toggle switch 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.660
 nutrition 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.380
 resistor toggle switch between 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:51.000
 two channels for two cars and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:55.520
 in the middle of the nest on the pedal right now 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.520
 we will actually connect 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.509
 for a start, I'll show you a bit of functionality 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.050
 that is, check it for protection from 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.050
 short circuit 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:22.239
 let a dozen will now focus on 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:25.120
 multimeter I'll close in time at this time 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:31.750
 readings will be reset to blocks and you 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:35.500
 see the current passed load current 32 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.299
 amps up to 6 volts resets a block then 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.510
 have short circuit protection there is 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.540
 protection of rooms and overheating 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.160
 there is a majority 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:55.330
 powerful wheelbarrows he pulls without problems so 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.930
 now check the reality of the testimony on 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.930
 lamps 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:14.940
 So 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:19.349
 939 3 8 and 9 8 and 9 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.349
 86 87 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:32.260
 87 171 Ie testimony not lie this 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:36.220
 I can safely trust them so now I 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:40.660
 I'll connect one of my cars already 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:48.120
 charged this is one of my powerful ones 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:49.690
 eats loads of the order of 1 1 and 6 amps 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.120
 2060 Hamper 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:57.390
 but this is the moment when you 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:02.250
 directly works that is not so 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.250
 directly when there is a load 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:16.889
 let's give a bigger floor this is 85 giving a cannon 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.889
 load 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:26.610
 will see the testimony subside on one 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.610
 let the tenth one 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.570
 that is, naturally loads 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:00.850
 here as an experiment you can 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:06.760
 connect another more weak so 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:09.700
 say classic car for medium 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.090
 Groups played so you know this circuit 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:17.230
 designed for big buns here nines 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:20.220
 contour is 18 and at the same time you can 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.680
 countering the risks 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:28.169
 so he is so powerful 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:31.150
 here is a classic contour bulldog 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:34.860
 designed for medium group goal then 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:39.150
 there will be a little less in it 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.150
 here the coils are slightly different 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:12.560
 i give load what value jump 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.720
 that's basically ok that's all i barely 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.040
 I give the load and not read 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.040
 squander at all 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:33.289
 that is, what output is this block 

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:35.469
 powerful enough reliable ie he 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:39.830
 stand it 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:43.039
 guaranteed load of 3 amps 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:46.669
 small dimensions i.e. unlike 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:49.149
 our previous unit in it enough 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:52.699
 small and for lack of a transformer 

00:06:49.149 --> 00:07:01.999
 that block was analog this block 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:07:04.629
 pulse that's basically everything is simple and 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:04.629
 succinctly 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:17.040
 yes by the way there is still a LED 

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:22.430
 lights and lamps and the truth now is not 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:28.220
 I can see well I will try to turn off the light but 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:31.220
 most likely this device will not accept 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.220
 color rendition 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:49.440
 In general, such spoken numbers can be seen 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:55.350
 fuzzy but I think the essence you understand that 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:59.150
 the lamps are lit by the sofa 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.150
 all see you soon
