00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
to do is start at the tail of my brow

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.179 
to do is start at the tail of my brow
and<00:01:53.390> I'm<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.600> doing<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.229> short<00:01:55.680> light

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and I'm just doing really short light

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.480 
and I'm just doing really short light
strokes<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.229> arch<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:02.159> there

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
strokes and you want to arch right there

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.100 
strokes and you want to arch right there
and<00:02:03.439> then<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.710> drag<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.100> down<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.899> just

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and then just drag it down you can just

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.109 
and then just drag it down you can just
follow<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.619> natural<00:02:07.860> shape<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.640> your<00:02:08.700> eyebrow

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
follow the natural shape of your eyebrow

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.540 
follow the natural shape of your eyebrow
or<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.989> create<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:11.340> bit

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
or you can create it a little bit

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.210 
or you can create it a little bit
thicker<00:02:11.819> or<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.300> little<00:02:12.629> bit

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
thicker or a little bit

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.880 
thicker or a little bit
fuller<00:02:14.220> than<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:15.150> really<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:16.590> just

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
fuller than it really is and I'm just

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.920 
fuller than it really is and I'm just
pretty<00:02:17.310> much<00:02:17.520> following<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.180> natural<00:02:18.360> shape

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
pretty much following the natural shape

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:31.030 
pretty much following the natural shape
of<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.770> filling<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.340> any<00:02:20.550> sparse<00:02:21.120> areas

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.250 

so<00:02:32.040> as<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.579> begin<00:02:32.939> to<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.360> closer<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.900> closer

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
so as we begin to get closer and closer

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.460 
so as we begin to get closer and closer
to<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.709> front<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.970> your<00:02:36.120> brows<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:37.019> want<00:02:37.290> to

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
to the front of your brows you want to

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.929 
to the front of your brows you want to
make<00:02:37.650> sure<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:37.980> gets<00:02:38.099> lighter<00:02:38.489> because<00:02:38.760> you

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
make sure it gets lighter because you

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.449 
make sure it gets lighter because you
don't<00:02:39.150> want<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.480> as<00:02:39.599> dark<00:02:40.049> earther<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:41.400> I'm

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
don't want to as dark earther so I'm

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.670 
don't want to as dark earther so I'm
taking<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.879> little<00:02:42.060> bit<00:02:42.269> more<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.750> I'm<00:02:43.439> just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
taking a little bit more and I'm just

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.660 
taking a little bit more and I'm just
lightly<00:02:44.220> putting<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.329> right<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.670> just

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
lightly putting it right there and just

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.039 
lightly putting it right there and just
lightly<00:02:48.569> stroking<00:02:49.409> it<00:02:49.680> back<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.280> forth<00:02:51.799> I'm

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
lightly stroking it back and forth I'm

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:04.170 
lightly stroking it back and forth I'm
fixing<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.170> shape<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.099> little<00:02:56.430> bit

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.619 

and<00:03:04.299> just<00:03:05.049> keep<00:03:05.230> blending<00:03:06.000> until<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.299> feel

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
and just keep blending until you feel

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.110 
and just keep blending until you feel
like<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.140> looks<00:03:09.480> as<00:03:10.480> good<00:03:10.750> as<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.230> want<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:12.120> so

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
like it looks as good as you want it so

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.270 
like it looks as good as you want it so
that's<00:03:13.329> pretty<00:03:13.599> much<00:03:13.689> how<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.170> do<00:03:14.349> one<00:03:14.709> brow<00:03:14.950> and

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
that's pretty much how I do one brow and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.849 
that's pretty much how I do one brow and
you<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.640> tell<00:03:15.939> the<00:03:16.719> difference<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.500> makes

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
you can tell the difference it makes

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.780 
you can tell the difference it makes
this<00:03:18.370> one<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.969> all<00:03:19.150> sparse<00:03:19.629> and<00:03:20.049> it<00:03:20.469> I<00:03:21.189> don't

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
this one is all sparse and it I don't

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.910 
this one is all sparse and it I don't
even<00:03:21.879> know<00:03:22.120> what<00:03:22.299> color<00:03:22.480> my<00:03:22.629> natural<00:03:23.560> eyebrows

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
even know what color my natural eyebrows

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.399 
even know what color my natural eyebrows
are<00:03:24.189> there<00:03:24.760> like<00:03:24.969> a<00:03:25.000> really<00:03:25.299> light<00:03:25.689> grayish

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409
