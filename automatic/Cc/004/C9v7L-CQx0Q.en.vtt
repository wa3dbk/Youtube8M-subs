00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.820
 Yes everyone today I should also be hello 8 I bought this this time 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.910
 It is a Condenser Microphone made by Daisuke Technica 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.430
 It towards the model number is at 2035 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.470
 I bought this and I want to open it, I want to open it right now. 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.500
 I think that 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:34.180
 If you can't open it or drop it normally, it will be corn time 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.180
 Well, in the middle 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.750
 It is a warranty card and it is a correct manual. 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 The sound of Audio Technica 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:52.550
 The House of Representatives is also a reference 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:56.510
 It's like the main body below it, and it's like this if you remove it 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.140
 Yes, this is the main part and the one with the porch 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.320
 During a building 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.500
 I say that I'm sorry that the mounting price is included 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.100
 This is a collection, so this is after the main unit 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.270
 It is a conversion screw 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.770
 After all it is the main part yes 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.750
 Body sounds good parentheses It is this kind of feeling 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.480
 Of course is it was written Te at 2035 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:27.990
 I and cat pa dts behind 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:30.170
 There is a rude low cut and this can be true if you can do ad this day 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.170
 of 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:40.990
 The maximum input sound pressure level of the input is 10048db, but it is more than that 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:47.140
 If there is input, the candidate site 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:50.600
 If you go to -10, you're going to get in at -10 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.350
 But if it exceeds it emigrates this in the negative direction 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.280
 Speaking 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:59.409
 It means that it can be used , so right side of you, right? 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.560
 It says low-cut guy 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.330
 Let me blow the wind and money 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.620
 It is a tomato signal 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:12.590
 The noise of the noise 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:14.670
 This low cut is on when you want to cut it because there is a lot of this and is off now 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.270
 Also I'd have 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:23.670
 When it's left, it turns blue and the window blows 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.239
 It would be that you can cut such noise by saying vibration 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.319
 I will 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.180
 Yup 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.160
 I can see the club in here, but here in this guy 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.030
 Takako 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.910
 The guy you see 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.600
 Pick up your voice and turn it into an electrical signal . 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.040
 Wonder if Makore Gakusho comic dialogue of your peers 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.540
 I wonder if it should be normal 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.810
 It's was I guess good in this 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:55.250
 It's Ali and this way but it looks like that 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.020
 After riding on this year's production mark as used by musician gas this recording 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.220
 This I think you will look 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.319
 But here is that 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.430
 It is a microphone stand 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:09.640
 It will be in the form of putting on 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.450
 I feel that well adjusted with this if you do not enter if 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:18.580
 Before there was a microphone if there was a pop guard here but there is also a pop guard 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:22.040
 I have not been able to order for a while, but I have a selfishness though 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:27.090
 Well Kedomo thing Tteyuu Well condenser microphone in 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:32.580
 The previous times om 2 Do not raise the hood but I gained Moma 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:36.660
 I changed to Onma om 3 but this dynamic is this dynamic microphone 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.870
 I'd say what Well Kedomo the cat I say condenser microphone different 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.850
 It is a story to say 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.920
 Well basic 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.570
 Great fight If you put it from here , it 's better if you 're the one here and the one here is better 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.020
 It's like feeling like it 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:59.330
 Well, some little Well I can here also who head handling is not Do Well Rambo 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.120
 It 's okay to handle roughly, but in this case it will respond really 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.450
 Well The 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.989
 This is not so cheap, but it's quite humidity and moisture 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.480
 Really support that Tteyuu But I can say here even if the 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:15.200
 With that drip 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:20.690
 From here solder also I'd do if not careful I kinda do that 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.480
 It is a microphone that can be used even when the live house, karaoke, etc. are noisy. 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.370
 In this case 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:33.010
 Zion rate is quite high in the hospital and the configuration is not so good 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:36.100
 How about picking up my goodness and why not use such things as positive karaoke and money 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:41.500
 I can't do it, so various sounds will come in. 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:47.490
 I Makoitsu guess will be a single-directional and says the spec basis 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:51.490
 Sometimes in or in the case of Koch that roughly But you know that Tteyuu length short 5 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:56.259
 To the east f Urakka I No go this your sister 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:59.440
 It's or there or rather I lever to change the zing directional This is not it yet 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:02.090
 It will be that it is only turnit construction themy 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.040
 In flame Well I say whether I bought this 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.050
 Oh dear 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:14.600
 I it but I get I ne little that a variety of game titles from this 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:17.490
 If I thought I could do it, I would use an ordinary headset if I wanted to do it 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.930
 After all that's a bad sound 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:25.620
 It's already going to fall, so let's try it and buy a condenser microphone after all 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:29.849
 Do you say that you wanted to try is big ? 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.750
 This is also If you have Come a simmer to be pursued how I Deettoato 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:36.460
 There is a point of caution 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:41.529
 I think that you know the story of the person who buys but this microphone is 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.860
 Power supply basic power supply does not turn on 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:47.350
 Microphone cable 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:52.510
 Connect to the usual karaoke 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:57.760
 I of such audio interface and after that Mike Toka three terminals 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.660
 It should be inserted here, but this condenser microphone is phantom power 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.720
 say 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:07.000
 I need a power source and there are various tosses now . 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.830
 But what is the standard 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.480
 Well that fandom electricity came in and this was certainly 11 to 48 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.440
 I think but 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.430
 In in Well can you go if there is between them phantom power 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.660
 What 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.590
 It is this audio interface that is generally attached now, but here too 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:30.140
 I think you have written I think 1 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.860
 I feel it 's not use that it is the case of the use and off if off care like this year by making it on 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.360
 Will be 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:40.340
 But I think that those who die can buy such places for a while. 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.630
 Was that mean there is no term with it fan I've got audio interface that if 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:47.460
 Person 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:51.300
 Well or turn or it Nde separately there is a power supply for power with the fan 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.200
 Well feeling that Tsu or an audio interface with phantom power separately also buy 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.660
 I think to be a 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:59.760
 Ttoma I think the kana Let's compare the sound quality it is here Well this roughly about the same price 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.360
 What's wrong here and here 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.240
 Well the thing here is also not 's Well Crowded also come over to take off corn 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.650
 I think I'm comparing a little 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.650
 I would like to do
