00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.270 
listen that's three chord tones remember
we<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> root<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.780> third<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.100> fifth

we have the root the third and the fifth

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.270 
we have the root the third and the fifth
that's<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.520> major<00:00:57.030> court<00:00:57.649> to<00:00:58.649> construct<00:00:59.160> a

keyboard starting with the root night we
can<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.149> four<00:01:03.930> half<00:01:04.290> steps<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.189> we're<00:01:05.400> using<00:01:05.549> C

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
can up four half steps so we're using C

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.120 
can up four half steps so we're using C
is<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> root<00:01:06.450> note<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.049> example<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:08.040> then

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
is a root note for this example and then

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.590 
is a root note for this example and then
we<00:01:08.220> count<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:09.119> two<00:01:10.080> three<00:01:11.119> four<00:01:12.119> that's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
we count up one two three four that's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
we count up one two three four that's
our<00:01:12.780> major<00:01:13.049> third<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:14.130> from<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:14.369> we

our major third and then from there we

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.880 
our major third and then from there we
can<00:01:14.790> tap<00:01:15.240> another<00:01:15.780> three<00:01:16.380> half<00:01:16.650> steps<00:01:16.939> one<00:01:17.939> two

just<00:01:46.940> creating<00:01:47.210> major<00:01:47.540> chords<00:01:48.050> as<00:01:48.170> I

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
just creating major chords as I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.499 
just creating major chords as I
explained<00:01:48.710> before<00:01:48.880> counting<00:01:49.880> up<00:01:50.030> full<00:01:50.270> half

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
explained before counting up full half

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.600 
explained before counting up full half
steps<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:50.960> then<00:01:51.350> three<00:01:51.740> half<00:01:51.920> steps<00:01:52.070> I'll<00:01:52.430> go

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
steps and then three half steps I'll go

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.300 
steps and then three half steps I'll go
through<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:52.909> quite<00:01:53.149> slowly<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:54.680> we're<00:01:55.220> going

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
through this quite slowly so we're going

through this quite slowly so we're going
to<00:01:55.430> start<00:01:55.610> with<00:01:55.700> C<00:01:55.940> major<00:01:56.119> as<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.869> just<00:01:57.050> played

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
to start with C major as I just played

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.790 
to start with C major as I just played
for<00:01:57.470> you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.560 

now<00:02:00.490> i'm<00:02:00.640> going<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:00.880> start<00:02:01.150> instead<00:02:01.420> of

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
now i'm going to start instead of

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.600 
now i'm going to start instead of

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
here i'm going to start playing with the

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.170 
here i'm going to start playing with the
correct<00:02:05.650> friend<00:02:06.040> going<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.730> I'm<00:02:06.850> going<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.120> use

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
correct friend going so I'm going to use

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.149 
correct friend going so I'm going to use
with<00:02:07.540> my<00:02:07.720> right<00:02:07.900> hand<00:02:07.930> one<00:02:08.830> three<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:09.940> five

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.289 

so<00:02:13.159> let's<00:02:13.340> play<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.519> C<00:02:13.790> major<00:02:13.970> chord<00:02:14.120> now

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
so let's play that C major chord now

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.339 
so let's play that C major chord now
then<00:02:17.299> we're<00:02:17.450> going<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.690> start<00:02:17.900> we're<00:02:18.170> going<00:02:18.260> to

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
then we're going to start we're going to

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.509 
then we're going to start we're going to
do<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.560> same<00:02:18.739> thing<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:19.129> we're<00:02:19.310> going<00:02:19.430> to

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
do the same thing but we're going to

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.300 
do the same thing but we're going to
construct<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.150> major<00:02:20.690> chord<00:02:21.080> starting<00:02:21.409> on<00:02:21.799> C

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
construct a major chord starting on C

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.339 
construct a major chord starting on C
sharp<00:02:22.819> so<00:02:23.120> that's<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.480> next<00:02:23.659> black<00:02:24.140> not

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
sharp so that's the next black not

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.020 
sharp so that's the next black not
that's<00:02:24.799> a<00:02:24.920> black<00:02:25.069> note<00:02:25.280> right<00:02:25.430> next<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.819> see

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
that's a black note right next to see

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.360 
that's a black note right next to see
it's<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:26.930> one<00:02:27.110> here<00:02:27.140> using<00:02:27.799> that<00:02:27.920> as<00:02:28.069> a<00:02:28.099> root

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
it's this one here using that as a root

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.860 
it's this one here using that as a root
note<00:02:28.549> and<00:02:29.000> we're<00:02:29.269> going<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> do<00:02:29.599> the<00:02:29.690> same

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
note and we're going to do the same

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.330 
note and we're going to do the same
thing<00:02:30.140> we're<00:02:30.319> going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.470> count<00:02:30.709> out<00:02:30.890> 4<00:02:31.129> half

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
thing we're going to count out 4 half

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.910 
thing we're going to count out 4 half
steps<00:02:31.370> one<00:02:32.360> two<00:02:33.280> three<00:02:34.280> four<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.500> that's<00:02:36.709> all

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
steps one two three four so that's all

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.770 
steps one two three four so that's all
just<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.579> show<00:02:37.790> clip<00:02:38.120> more<00:02:38.299> clearly<00:02:38.510> that's

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
just the show clip more clearly that's

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.860 
just the show clip more clearly that's
our<00:02:38.959> C<00:02:39.200> sharp<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.709> if<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.459> our<00:02:40.640> major<00:02:40.819> 3rd<00:02:41.180> then

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
our C sharp and if is our major 3rd then

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.100 
our C sharp and if is our major 3rd then
we<00:02:41.989> go<00:02:42.110> up<00:02:42.140> another<00:02:42.500> three<00:02:42.980> times<00:02:43.329> one<00:02:44.329> two

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
we go up another three times one two

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.839 
we go up another three times one two
three<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.220> get<00:02:46.340> our<00:02:46.519> 5th<00:02:47.239> chord<00:02:48.110> tone<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.670> that

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
three to get our 5th chord tone so that

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.270 
three to get our 5th chord tone so that
is<00:02:50.239> our<00:02:50.510> C<00:02:50.690> sharp<00:02:50.930> major<00:02:51.079> we're<00:02:51.980> going<00:02:52.069> to<00:02:52.129> do

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
is our C sharp major we're going to do

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.130 
is our C sharp major we're going to do
the<00:02:52.400> same<00:02:52.579> thing<00:02:52.760> starting<00:02:53.150> on<00:02:53.269> D<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:53.840> does

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
the same thing starting on D this does

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.569 
the same thing starting on D this does
seem<00:02:54.379> very<00:02:54.680> slow<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.190> I'm<00:02:55.280> going<00:02:55.430> to<00:02:55.489> go

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
seem very slow but I'm going to go

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.309 
seem very slow but I'm going to go
through<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.819> quite<00:02:56.000> slowly<00:02:56.269> once<00:02:56.840> we<00:02:57.049> get<00:02:57.200> the

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
through it quite slowly once we get the

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.900 
through it quite slowly once we get the
pattern<00:02:57.620> then<00:02:57.980> we'll<00:02:58.190> be<00:02:58.340> able<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.579> speed<00:02:58.879> up

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
pattern then we'll be able to speed up

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.819 
pattern then we'll be able to speed up
things<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.359> little<00:02:59.480> bit<00:02:59.629> more<00:02:59.810> okay<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:00.680> we're

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
things a little bit more okay so we're

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.030 
things a little bit more okay so we're
going<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.010> start<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.400> D<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.620> knicks<00:03:03.829> note

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
going to start on D it's a knicks note

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.619 
going to start on D it's a knicks note
and<00:03:04.280> in<00:03:04.780> our<00:03:06.099> octave<00:03:07.120> that's<00:03:08.120> our<00:03:08.299> route<00:03:08.480> night

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
and in our octave that's our route night

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.330 
and in our octave that's our route night
we're<00:03:08.750> going<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.930> count<00:03:09.140> out<00:03:09.260> 4<00:03:09.590> half<00:03:09.799> steps<00:03:09.829> to

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
we're going to count out 4 half steps to

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.630 
we're going to count out 4 half steps to
get<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.640> 3rd<00:03:11.180> Corps<00:03:11.510> time<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.959> major<00:03:12.230> third

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
get the 3rd Corps time the major third

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.920 
get the 3rd Corps time the major third
one<00:03:13.640> two<00:03:14.359> three<00:03:15.319> four<00:03:16.329> that's<00:03:17.329> a<00:03:17.450> major<00:03:17.630> third

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
one two three four that's a major third

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.059 
one two three four that's a major third
there<00:03:18.169> so<00:03:18.319> we're<00:03:18.410> just<00:03:18.440> going<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.680> keep<00:03:18.889> those

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
there so we're just going to keep those

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.710 
there so we're just going to keep those
two<00:03:19.310> notes<00:03:19.489> and<00:03:19.819> we're<00:03:20.329> going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.480> go<00:03:20.599> up

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
two notes and we're going to go up

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.460 
two notes and we're going to go up
another<00:03:20.930> three<00:03:21.290> half<00:03:21.500> steps<00:03:21.669> one<00:03:22.669> two<00:03:23.470> three

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
another three half steps one two three

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.860 
another three half steps one two three
so<00:03:25.430> there<00:03:25.639> are<00:03:25.669> three<00:03:25.849> notes<00:03:26.030> there<00:03:26.269> that<00:03:26.630> is

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
so there are three notes there that is

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.909 
so there are three notes there that is
our<00:03:27.500> D<00:03:27.739> major<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:29.000> see<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.269> pattern<00:03:29.419> here

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
our D major you see the pattern here

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.770 
our D major you see the pattern here
each<00:03:30.919> chord<00:03:31.400> looks<00:03:31.910> quite<00:03:32.209> similar<00:03:32.389> and<00:03:32.690> that

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
each chord looks quite similar and that

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.020 
each chord looks quite similar and that
we've<00:03:33.019> got<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.260> same<00:03:33.650> kind<00:03:33.950> of<00:03:34.010> 135<00:03:34.819> for

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
we've got that same kind of 135 for

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.670 
we've got that same kind of 135 for
their<00:03:35.180> fingers<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.690> we're<00:03:36.109> creating<00:03:36.560> the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
their fingers and we're creating the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.140 
their fingers and we're creating the
same<00:03:36.919> interval<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:37.489> these<00:03:37.609> are<00:03:37.760> all<00:03:37.790> major

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
same interval so these are all major

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.990 
same interval so these are all major
courts<00:03:39.190> we're<00:03:40.190> going<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.400> count<00:03:40.579> up<00:03:40.730> another

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
courts we're going to count up another

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.220 
courts we're going to count up another
few<00:03:41.269> and<00:03:41.510> then<00:03:41.630> I'm<00:03:41.750> going<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.930> give<00:03:42.079> you<00:03:42.169> a

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
secret to playing these chords the way

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.690 
secret to playing these chords the way
we<00:03:44.930> are<00:03:44.959> well<00:03:45.859> now<00:03:45.950> we're<00:03:46.099> going<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.280> start<00:03:46.519> on

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
we are well now we're going to start on

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.860 
we are well now we're going to start on
D<00:03:47.120> sharp<00:03:48.669> count<00:03:49.669> out<00:03:49.819> 4<00:03:50.090> half<00:03:50.299> steps<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.720> get

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
D sharp count out 4 half steps to get

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.509 
D sharp count out 4 half steps to get
the<00:03:50.959> major<00:03:51.169> third<00:03:51.530> one<00:03:52.310> two<00:03:53.120> three<00:03:54.049> four<00:03:54.889> let's

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
the major third one two three four let's

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.240 
the major third one two three four let's
out<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:56.389> call<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.410> our<00:03:57.440> first<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.040> third

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
out to call to our first and third

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.949 
out to call to our first and third
quarter<00:03:58.669> net<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.060> then<00:03:59.660> we're<00:03:59.810> going<00:03:59.900> to

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
quarter net and then we're going to

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.410 
quarter net and then we're going to
count<00:04:00.200> up<00:04:00.349> another<00:04:00.620> three<00:04:00.980> one<00:04:01.609> two<00:04:02.530> three

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
count up another three one two three

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.559 
count up another three one two three
so<00:04:05.420> that's<00:04:05.599> our<00:04:05.870> do<00:04:06.110> sharp<00:04:07.360> now<00:04:08.360> we're<00:04:08.480> going

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
so that's our do sharp now we're going

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.839 
so that's our do sharp now we're going
to<00:04:08.630> start<00:04:08.810> from<00:04:08.959> E<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:10.310> might<00:04:10.430> be<00:04:10.550> giving<00:04:10.670> the

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
to start from E you might be giving the

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:11.740 
to start from E you might be giving the
hang<00:04:11.000> of<00:04:11.120> this<00:04:11.209> right<00:04:11.420> now<00:04:11.540> you're<00:04:11.690> probably

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
hang of this right now you're probably

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.510 
hang of this right now you're probably
going<00:04:12.050> to<00:04:12.110> speed<00:04:12.470> right<00:04:12.739> in<00:04:12.860> front<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.160> me<00:04:13.310> if

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
going to speed right in front of me if

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.970 
going to speed right in front of me if
you<00:04:13.819> can<00:04:14.180> then<00:04:14.599> do<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:15.080> we're<00:04:15.650> going<00:04:15.800> to<00:04:15.830> keep

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
you can then do and we're going to keep

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.780 
you can then do and we're going to keep
going<00:04:16.160> slow<00:04:16.430> for<00:04:16.459> now<00:04:16.700> so<00:04:17.359> we<00:04:17.450> start<00:04:17.720> on<00:04:17.870> e

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
going slow for now so we start on e

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.590 
going slow for now so we start on e
counting<00:04:19.790> up<00:04:19.940> four<00:04:20.930> half<00:04:21.109> steps<00:04:21.139> one<00:04:21.889> two

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
counting up four half steps one two

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.040 
counting up four half steps one two
three<00:04:23.600> four<00:04:24.400> so<00:04:25.400> that's<00:04:25.610> our<00:04:25.820> third<00:04:26.450> there<00:04:26.810> and

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
three four so that's our third there and

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.710 
three four so that's our third there and
another<00:04:27.800> three<00:04:28.280> half<00:04:28.520> steps<00:04:28.730> one<00:04:29.690> two<00:04:30.550> three

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
another three half steps one two three

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.340 
another three half steps one two three
so<00:04:32.720> that's<00:04:32.930> our<00:04:33.139> E<00:04:33.290> major<00:04:33.320> chord<00:04:33.680> there<00:04:35.350> so

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
so that's our E major chord there so

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.780 
so that's our E major chord there so
we've<00:04:36.500> done<00:04:36.710> c<00:04:36.979> major<00:04:37.190> C<00:04:37.970> sharp<00:04:38.270> major<00:04:38.450> D<00:04:39.290> major

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
we've done c major C sharp major D major

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.350 
we've done c major C sharp major D major
d<00:04:40.790> sharp<00:04:41.120> motor<00:04:41.419> a<00:04:41.889> major<00:04:42.970> now<00:04:43.970> we're<00:04:44.150> going<00:04:44.240> to

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
d sharp motor a major now we're going to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.620 
d sharp motor a major now we're going to
try<00:04:44.840> if<00:04:45.460> starting<00:04:46.460> on<00:04:46.580> if<00:04:46.760> we're<00:04:47.450> going<00:04:47.570> to

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
try if starting on if we're going to

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:54.250 
try if starting on if we're going to
count<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.990> four<00:04:48.229> half<00:04:48.410> steps<00:04:50.260> 1234<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:53.260> another

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
count a four half steps 1234 and another

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.590 
count a four half steps 1234 and another
three<00:04:54.639> one<00:04:55.639> two<00:04:56.000> three<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:59.240> that's<00:04:59.419> always

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
three one two three so that's always

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.690 
three one two three so that's always
major<00:04:59.930> from<00:05:00.770> here<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:01.160> then<00:05:01.250> I'm<00:05:01.460> going<00:05:01.669> to

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
major from here and then I'm going to

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.460 
major from here and then I'm going to
stop<00:05:01.970> counting<00:05:02.270> each<00:05:02.690> chord<00:05:02.990> because<00:05:03.200> you

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
stop counting each chord because you

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.250 
stop counting each chord because you
know<00:05:03.560> what<00:05:03.680> we<00:05:03.800> can<00:05:03.919> do<00:05:04.750> we<00:05:05.750> can<00:05:05.780> actually

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
know what we can do we can actually

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.990 
know what we can do we can actually
follow<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.680> pattern<00:05:06.860> because<00:05:07.340> our<00:05:07.520> root<00:05:07.790> note

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
follow the pattern because our root note

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.490 
follow the pattern because our root note
is<00:05:08.180> going<00:05:08.479> up<00:05:08.600> one<00:05:08.930> half<00:05:09.200> step<00:05:09.380> each<00:05:09.680> time<00:05:11.500> all

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
is going up one half step each time all

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.260 
is going up one half step each time all
the<00:05:12.860> other<00:05:13.010> notes<00:05:13.280> since<00:05:13.580> we're<00:05:13.789> keeping<00:05:14.150> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
the other notes since we're keeping the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.210 
the other notes since we're keeping the
same<00:05:14.479> structure<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.140> the<00:05:15.260> court<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:16.190> other

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
same structure of the court the other

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.890 
same structure of the court the other
notes<00:05:16.669> are<00:05:16.850> actually<00:05:17.180> going<00:05:17.330> up<00:05:17.539> one<00:05:17.690> half

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
notes are actually going up one half

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.740 
notes are actually going up one half
step<00:05:18.050> at<00:05:18.289> a<00:05:18.320> time<00:05:18.470> I'll<00:05:19.250> play<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:19.940> i'll<00:05:20.120> play

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
step at a time I'll play that i'll play

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.270 
step at a time I'll play that i'll play
the<00:05:20.780> calls<00:05:21.110> we've<00:05:21.260> learnt<00:05:21.440> so<00:05:21.590> far<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:22.039> try

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
the calls we've learnt so far and try

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.909 
the calls we've learnt so far and try
and<00:05:22.370> recognize<00:05:22.610> how<00:05:23.419> each<00:05:23.750> not<00:05:24.110> goes<00:05:24.440> up<00:05:24.650> one

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
and recognize how each not goes up one

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.820 
and recognize how each not goes up one
half<00:05:25.130> step<00:05:27.400> it's<00:05:28.400> our<00:05:28.580> C<00:05:28.789> major<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:30.289> C<00:05:30.530> sharp

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
half step it's our C major and I C sharp

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.820 
half step it's our C major and I C sharp
major<00:05:31.600> that's<00:05:32.600> all<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.930> same<00:05:33.110> notes<00:05:33.320> just

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
major that's all the same notes just

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.469 
major that's all the same notes just
moved<00:05:34.460> up<00:05:34.700> one<00:05:34.729> half<00:05:35.120> step<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:38.240> same

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
moved up one half step and the same

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.140 
moved up one half step and the same
pattern<00:05:38.870> we're<00:05:39.260> just<00:05:39.380> moving<00:05:39.650> up<00:05:39.979> each<00:05:40.520> note<00:05:40.970> a

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
pattern we're just moving up each note a

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.480 
pattern we're just moving up each note a
half<00:05:41.330> step<00:05:41.630> each<00:05:41.870> time<00:05:42.229> so<00:05:43.130> now<00:05:43.250> we're<00:05:43.400> going

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
half step each time so now we're going

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.830 
half step each time so now we're going
to<00:05:43.610> go<00:05:43.700> through<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:43.970> rest<00:05:44.210> of<00:05:44.389> the<00:05:44.479> chords

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
to go through the rest of the chords

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.320 
to go through the rest of the chords
without<00:05:45.470> counting<00:05:46.130> the<00:05:46.250> half<00:05:46.400> steps<00:05:46.729> just

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
without counting the half steps just

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.409 
without counting the half steps just
raising<00:05:47.900> them<00:05:48.669> raising<00:05:49.669> each<00:05:49.789> night<00:05:50.120> to<00:05:50.270> make

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
raising them raising each night to make

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.750 
raising them raising each night to make
the<00:05:50.570> next<00:05:50.810> court<00:05:51.080> so<00:05:51.919> if<00:05:52.010> our<00:05:52.100> root<00:05:52.370> note<00:05:52.550> goes

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
the next court so if our root note goes

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.719 
the next court so if our root note goes
up<00:05:52.940> one<00:05:53.120> half<00:05:53.330> step<00:05:53.479> to<00:05:53.720> F<00:05:53.930> sharp<00:05:54.289> then<00:05:55.280> all<00:05:55.550> our

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
up one half step to F sharp then all our

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.129 
up one half step to F sharp then all our
other<00:05:55.820> notes<00:05:56.120> are<00:05:56.389> going<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.630> go<00:05:56.720> up<00:05:56.750> a<00:05:56.990> half

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
other notes are going to go up a half

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.840 
other notes are going to go up a half
step<00:05:57.200> as<00:05:57.500> well<00:05:57.650> so<00:05:57.860> our<00:05:57.950> a<00:05:58.100> comes<00:05:58.370> up<00:05:58.550> to<00:05:58.639> Asia

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
step as well so our a comes up to Asia

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.580 
step as well so our a comes up to Asia
and<00:05:59.600> I<00:05:59.720> see<00:05:59.960> comes<00:06:00.200> up<00:06:00.350> to<00:06:00.500> see<00:06:00.680> show

that's not if sharp major chord do you

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.080 
that's not if sharp major chord do you
recognize<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.740> pattern<00:06:05.070> we're<00:06:05.790> gonna<00:06:05.880> do

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
recognize the pattern we're gonna do

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.330 
recognize the pattern we're gonna do
this<00:06:06.240> again<00:06:06.300> on<00:06:06.750> G<00:06:07.110> so<00:06:07.440> raising<00:06:07.890> it<00:06:08.130> a<00:06:08.190> half

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
this again on G so raising it a half

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.820 
this again on G so raising it a half
step<00:06:08.540> raising<00:06:09.540> that<00:06:09.660> a<00:06:09.720> half<00:06:09.990> step<00:06:10.200> raising

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
step raising that a half step raising

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.470 
step raising that a half step raising
that<00:06:10.920> a<00:06:10.980> half<00:06:11.160> step<00:06:11.310> as<00:06:11.490> well<00:06:11.640> and<00:06:11.880> then<00:06:12.390> we

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
that a half step as well and then we

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.920 
that a half step as well and then we
have<00:06:12.510> a<00:06:12.630> G<00:06:12.840> major<00:06:14.240> let's<00:06:15.240> try<00:06:15.450> that<00:06:15.600> with<00:06:15.720> do

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
have a G major let's try that with do

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.320 
have a G major let's try that with do
sharp<00:06:16.310> raise<00:06:17.310> them<00:06:17.490> all<00:06:17.730> that's<00:06:18.000> trying<00:06:18.270> to

all on one but go this time raising all
the<00:06:21.420> notes<00:06:21.570> up<00:06:21.780> to<00:06:22.230> G<00:06:22.590> sharp<00:06:22.830> major<00:06:24.860> nice<00:06:25.860> and

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
the notes up to G sharp major nice and

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.890 
the notes up to G sharp major nice and
we'll<00:06:26.610> do<00:06:26.730> that<00:06:26.850> starting<00:06:27.360> on<00:06:27.540> a<00:06:28.310> and<00:06:29.780> then<00:06:30.780> on

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
we'll do that starting on a and then on

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.430 
we'll do that starting on a and then on
b-flat<00:06:31.350> then<00:06:32.660> we're<00:06:33.660> going<00:06:33.750> to<00:06:33.840> try<00:06:34.140> be<00:06:34.740> major

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 
b-flat then we're going to try be major

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.570 
b-flat then we're going to try be major
remember<00:06:37.440> that's<00:06:37.560> raised<00:06:38.040> it<00:06:38.220> keep<00:06:38.370> raising

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
remember that's raised it keep raising

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.570 
remember that's raised it keep raising
up<00:06:38.880> a<00:06:38.910> half<00:06:39.180> step<00:06:39.210> and<00:06:39.660> then<00:06:40.170> we<00:06:40.410> we<00:06:40.800> vaccinated

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
up a half step and then we we vaccinated

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.700 
up a half step and then we we vaccinated
so<00:06:41.790> we've<00:06:42.270> just<00:06:42.300> gone<00:06:42.600> through<00:06:42.660> all<00:06:43.170> the<00:06:43.350> 12

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
so we've just gone through all the 12

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.090 
so we've just gone through all the 12
major<00:06:44.640> chords<00:06:44.820> and<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.300> chromatic<00:06:45.810> scale<00:06:46.100> you

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
major chords and the chromatic scale you

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.770 
major chords and the chromatic scale you
notice<00:06:47.430> that<00:06:47.580> when<00:06:47.730> when<00:06:48.090> you<00:06:48.210> play<00:06:48.390> a<00:06:48.420> major

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
notice that when when you play a major

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.740 
notice that when when you play a major
chord<00:06:48.930> it<00:06:49.590> has<00:06:49.800> a<00:06:50.010> certain<00:06:50.430> feeling<00:06:51.210> till<00:06:51.600> it

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
chord it has a certain feeling till it

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.820 
chord it has a certain feeling till it
if<00:06:52.260> I<00:06:52.410> play<00:06:52.620> a<00:06:52.650> major<00:06:52.890> chord<00:06:54.170> it<00:06:55.170> sounds<00:06:55.620> quite

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
if I play a major chord it sounds quite

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.580 
if I play a major chord it sounds quite
nice<00:06:56.190> sounds<00:06:56.910> a<00:06:56.940> little<00:06:57.210> bit<00:06:57.270> happy<00:06:57.750> so<00:06:58.410> when

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
nice sounds a little bit happy so when

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.110 
nice sounds a little bit happy so when
your<00:06:58.740> preps<00:06:58.950> in<00:06:59.100> your<00:06:59.280> major<00:06:59.400> chords<00:06:59.790> really

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
your preps in your major chords really

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.820 
your preps in your major chords really
linger<00:07:00.450> on<00:07:00.690> that<00:07:00.840> feeling<00:07:01.230> because<00:07:01.380> once<00:07:01.740> we

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
linger on that feeling because once we

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.340 
linger on that feeling because once we
start<00:07:02.220> the<00:07:02.400> minor<00:07:02.820> chords<00:07:03.300> we<00:07:03.750> start<00:07:04.050> putting

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
start the minor chords we start putting

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.110 
start the minor chords we start putting
them<00:07:04.500> into<00:07:04.680> the<00:07:04.830> mix<00:07:05.040> you'll<00:07:05.490> notice<00:07:05.790> the

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
them into the mix you'll notice the

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.270 
them into the mix you'll notice the
change<00:07:06.570> and<00:07:06.990> how<00:07:07.230> they<00:07:07.410> sound<00:07:07.770> and<00:07:08.010> how<00:07:08.130> they

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 
change and how they sound and how they

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.600 
change and how they sound and how they
feel<00:07:08.700> when<00:07:08.730> you<00:07:09.090> play<00:07:09.300> them<00:07:09.530> ok<00:07:10.530> so<00:07:10.860> practice

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
feel when you play them ok so practice

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.280 
feel when you play them ok so practice
those<00:07:11.790> major<00:07:12.030> chords<00:07:12.450> and<00:07:12.630> then<00:07:13.020> you'll<00:07:13.170> be

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
those major chords and then you'll be

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
those major chords and then you'll be
ready<00:07:13.470> to<00:07:13.530> move<00:07:13.860> on<00:07:14.100> to<00:07:14.460> minor<00:07:14.790> chords
