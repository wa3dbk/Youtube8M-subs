place in my heart and I think there's a
difference<00:01:21.960> between<00:01:22.050> cooking<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:22.620> dish<00:01:22.800> and

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
difference between cooking the dish and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.000 
difference between cooking the dish and
understanding<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.510> dish<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.440> I<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.890> I
