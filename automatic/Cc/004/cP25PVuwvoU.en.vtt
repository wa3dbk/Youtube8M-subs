these<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.300> guess<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.739> opinion<00:01:01.949> though

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
these out I guess in my opinion though

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
these out I guess in my opinion though
they<00:01:02.340> kind<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> look<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.989> offspring<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
they kind of look like offspring and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.469 
they kind of look like offspring and
this<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> mommy<00:01:05.129> plane<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.700> those<00:01:06.330> are

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this be the mommy plane and those are

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.780 
this be the mommy plane and those are
its<00:01:06.600> babies<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.320> that's<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.860> me<00:01:08.070> while<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
its babies but that's just me while this

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670 
its babies but that's just me while this
alt<00:01:09.030> mode<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.360> ok<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> don't<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.439> any<00:01:10.590> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
alt mode is ok I don't know if any of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.020 
alt mode is ok I don't know if any of
these<00:01:10.799> complaints<00:01:11.189> can<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.549> justified

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
these complaints can be justified

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
these complaints can be justified
because<00:01:12.270> hatch<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.840> supposed<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.409> an<00:01:13.530> SUV

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
because hatch it's supposed to be an SUV

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.640 
because hatch it's supposed to be an SUV
and<00:01:14.100> not<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> jet<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.200> mind<00:01:16.229> you

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and not a jet so with that in mind you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.870 
and not a jet so with that in mind you
can<00:01:16.770> probably<00:01:16.950> ignore<00:01:17.159> everything<00:01:17.490> i<00:01:17.640> said

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
can probably ignore everything i said

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.789 
can probably ignore everything i said
thus<00:01:18.090> far<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.720> move<00:01:18.869> into<00:01:18.960> transformation

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
thus far as we move into transformation

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.620 
thus far as we move into transformation
because<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.640> essentially<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> small

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
because this is essentially a small

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.719 
because this is essentially a small
scale<00:01:21.930> class<00:01:22.200> figure<00:01:22.580> transformation<00:01:23.580> isn't

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
scale class figure transformation isn't

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.910 
scale class figure transformation isn't
very<00:01:24.000> complicated<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.409> fact<00:01:25.470> it's

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
very complicated at all in fact it's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.100 
very complicated at all in fact it's
super<00:01:26.310> intuitive<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.970> very<00:01:27.420> simple<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
super intuitive and very simple and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.990 
super intuitive and very simple and
again<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.220> those<00:01:29.340> transformers<00:01:29.850> where

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
again one of those transformers where

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.280 
again one of those transformers where
you<00:01:30.090> will<00:01:30.270> ditch<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.750> instructions

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
you will ditch the instructions

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.080 
you will ditch the instructions
immediately<00:01:31.920> out<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.159> packaging<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:33.060> all

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
lastly at the tip so again that's all is

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.349 
lastly at the tip so again that's all is
possibility<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.849> nothing<00:02:38.849> too<00:02:39.030> spectacular

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
possibility not nothing too spectacular

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.530 
possibility not nothing too spectacular
but<00:02:39.989> it's<00:02:40.400> it's<00:02:41.400> definitely<00:02:41.939> good<00:02:42.299> for<00:02:42.329> a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
but it's it's definitely good for a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
figure of this size also it's worth

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.300 
figure of this size also it's worth
noting<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.390> these<00:02:45.720> weapons<00:02:46.290> are<00:02:46.470> definitely
