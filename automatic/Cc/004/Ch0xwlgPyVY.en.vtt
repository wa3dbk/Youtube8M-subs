00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
that and also the blue light is from the

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.020 
that and also the blue light is from the
new<00:05:19.680> heatsink<00:05:20.190> that<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:20.370> had<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.640> install

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
new heatsink that I had to install

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.250 
new heatsink that I had to install
because<00:05:21.479> obviously<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:22.080> CPU<00:05:23.810> went<00:05:24.810> haywire

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
because obviously the CPU went haywire

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.620 
because obviously the CPU went haywire
one<00:05:25.560> night<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.010> then<00:05:26.160> I<00:05:26.460> realized<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.450> reason

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
one night and then I realized the reason

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.420 
one night and then I realized the reason
and<00:05:28.229> that<00:05:28.380> was<00:05:28.470> because<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.830> heatsink<00:05:29.280> got

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
and that was because the heatsink got

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.010 
and that was because the heatsink got
loose<00:05:29.610> is<00:05:29.790> basically<00:05:30.120> broken<00:05:30.419> somehow<00:05:30.870> I

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020

don't really know how it happened but

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.040 
don't really know how it happened but
maybe<00:05:32.790> it<00:05:32.910> was<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.120> spider<00:05:33.390> that<00:05:33.570> lives<00:05:33.630> in<00:05:33.960> my

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
maybe it was the spider that lives in my
