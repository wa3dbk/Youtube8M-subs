00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.109
 quick 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.509
 to help you understand what 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.289
 bell if you can not manage to lose 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.030
 fat mass 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.110
 if you have trouble if you have 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.390
 the impression maybe to have everything 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.460
 tried i guarantee you that ben at least 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.740
 one of these two tips will help you 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.210
 progress further and understand 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.680
 especially why does not it work why 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.870
 you can not get to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.460
 result and why ben maybe that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.660
 your results they stagnate maybe that 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 your fat loss she 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.840
 stagnant does that ben voila you get 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.340
 not enough muscle mass 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.380
 while you would like to gain a little 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.510
 more and all that that explains 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.010
 and it is not inevitable if for 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.660
 you do not work and in this video 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.979
 I will really give you both 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.210
 tips that really are not stuff 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.040
 who come from space but who 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.290
 really help you progress because 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.730
 that it is by his advice there that you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 can you explain why that 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.540
 works why it does not work 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.760
 we start right away with the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 first reason that makes you 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.110
 will never be able to get 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.909
 results this first reason she is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.820
 very simple is that simply 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.070
 your diet is not at all 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.950
 suited to your purpose and is not 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.480
 everything suited to you I explain to you when 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.520
 we want to start changing his body 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.870
 we want to transform his losing height 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.650
 of the fat mass we want to win 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.150
 in muscle mass 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.310
 we are often tempted to go on 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.690
 websites and we see plans 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.850
 which are unfortunately 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.800
 designed for those who wrote them it's 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.570
 to tell others and if we follow the plan 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.770
 food of others and well we go 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 follow a food plan that is not 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.680
 at all adapted to us because the other 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.060
 it may be tougher it is 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.710
 perhaps heavier and perhaps more 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.420
 physical activity that you he has 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.500
 maybe not the same goals no 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.640
 more in terms of earnings 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.350
 muscle and mass loss 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.270
 greasy so it's extremely 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.400
 important not to follow to be 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.930
 others because it worked for them and 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.920
 because they put a video on 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.899
 youtube in which are 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.560
 transformed into three months it's not 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.290
 like that it works 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.300
 everyone is different and everyone has 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.410
 different food needs and I 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.300
 you are guaranteed that if you do 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.440
 really work to measure at least 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.150
 for a week me that's what I 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.980
 do very regularly I tell people 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.630
 Well, there are no results then 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.730
 give me your friend to taez and it's your 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.320
 thing trick your goal and you do not me 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.550
 on the whole week on a notebook of 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.209
 draft you are marking on 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.100
 the whole week 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.900
 everything you have eaten and the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.640
 quantities of what you are going to eat and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.000
 thanks to that you'll know what 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.680
 Bell 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.360
 either it's a calorie problem or 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.560
 you eat too many calories or that you 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.670
 eat too many bad calories 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.350
 that in poor titles that 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.570
 make you fat who are rich in 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.640
 sugar or that makes you hungry etc etc 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.050
 either it's a problem at the level of 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.180
 carbohydrates you eat too much carbohydrate 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.390
 you secrete too much insulin and you 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.370
 just lose it either 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.110
 take fat either ne 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.370
 not allow your body to access 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.989
 your stored fat 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.670
 which means that you may be 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.890
 to have the impression of stagnating 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.930
 just then here is the trick that 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.740
 is extremely important it's about you 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.660
 do the first times 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.610
 a diet plan that you master in 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.860
 terms of quantity and quality as 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.570
 that you can play on some leverage 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.250
 you will be able to reduce carbohydrates 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.470
 increase carbohydrates decrease the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.820
 proteins etc etc and that allows us to 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.230
 find like that after a few 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.060
 weeks to find the food plan 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.320
 who corresponds to you and who you 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.330
 brings results because like that 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.610
 as as you can measure you 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.530
 will be able to know what will which 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.940
 do not go and if you do not measure anything 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.380
 everything even when especially when one is 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.540
 beginner if you measure nothing at all 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.430
 you no explanation and you 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.870
 will spend more time of the time of 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.370
 time to you frustrated and not understand 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.710
 why does not it work so I you 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.720
 guaranteed that 80% of your lack of 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.280
 result will be explained by 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.870
 your diet plan after there is sport 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.680
 of course he welcomed the lifestyle 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.380
 your way of life 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.450
 but 80% of your results will be able to 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.310
 to be explained by a problem at the level of 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.990
 diet so have a diet plan 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.610
 if you want help and have 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.170
 a diet plan that is that is done in 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.490
 five minutes and that will allow you to 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.900
 create fat edge menus 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.910
 quickly and reach your goal 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.470
 so quicker do not hesitate to 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.850
 download my creative program 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.050
 personalized menus that will help you to 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.720
 build fat burner menus 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.580
 in five small minutes a day thanks to 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.700
 my little software and all the advice 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.440
 that go with of course 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.500
 then we move on to the second step 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.210
 is perhaps a step that may be 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.100
 bother you at first but who really 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.020
 effective is a step that will you 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.340
 help protect yourself from yourself by 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.940
 done because there when we want 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.130
 undertake changes 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.470
 food is that we have always 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.670
 the impression that one gives one's maximum and 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.380
 we do what it takes to change 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.060
 his physical appearance one does what he 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.220
 need to diet and we have 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.360
 well followed his diet plan and that's when 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.450
 that when we start and I have 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.790
 found that for several months 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.140
 we are very very far from having everything 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.160
 tried one is very very very far 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.540
 to have done his best 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.400
 we have the impression of having made 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.780
 maximum but we did a little bit 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.740
 maximum compared to others what 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.370
 they do what they do shit 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.040
 quite simply 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.690
 whereas if we 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.160
 we take time to look at what we 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.240
 did well what did not do well 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.680
 gets to understand that eventually we 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.390
 is not that good and there is 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.950
 lots of little things to improve for 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.120
 it what you will do is that 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.070
 you will solve the problem 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.320
 of honesty towards you even because 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.940
 you are dishonest to yourself and 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.470
 I was dishonest to myself 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.550
 and the human being is in general 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.800
 dishonest to himself 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.510
 it's perfectly normal because the 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.160
 human brain it's still kb for 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.030
 look for the easy way in 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.010
 all situations 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.660
 because ben is the most 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.840
 direct is the one that gratifies the 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.460
 more except that the problem is that if 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.780
 we reason like that we are always in 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.860
 to say that we did the maximum 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.970
 we did our best and we did 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.010
 never a kick in the ass for us 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.750
 to say and to the ribs did little to your maximum 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.560
 we will have to move and what I 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.630
 asks you to do in your 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.320
 diet it's in your program 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.450
 sports etc. 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.220
 you can do the same thing it's 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.640
 all week for two weeks 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.140
 for three weeks you will note 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.850
 the number of meals you did each 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.070
 day so meal a meal dresses to 3 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.240
 4/5 pts you do that for monday tuesday 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.740
 Wednesday and until Sunday as you 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.990
 want and on the period as much as 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.250
 you want to do the test 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.200
 and every time you have 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.000
 followed your diet plan you put a 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.890
 little green guy every time you 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.450
 have made a small gap that goes a little 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.740
 little outside of diet you put a 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.060
 orange guy and every time you 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.600
 have to make a big gap ie 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.530
 alcohol booze watered pizza evening 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.720
 mcdo etc 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.830
