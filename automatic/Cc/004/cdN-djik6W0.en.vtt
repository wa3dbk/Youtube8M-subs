00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.730
 nice guys here and pistard talking to you 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.830
 is in this video I want to talk to you about 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.689
 jetpack you are in many a 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.670
 unfortunately ask me guys 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.199
 I still haven't found it 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.940
 the other day I ran into 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.220
 this leads into the desert boys 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.250
 really very particular 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.960
 if you see if you shoot us a rocket launcher 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.690
 the bullet does not hit the door but 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.850
 the crossbar instead if you hit on the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.340
 rock explodes very very particular 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.200
 this thing guys right now 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.760
 went to inform on the internet and many 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.210
 they say the jetpack is in there 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.460
 that the door is something dynamic 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.230
 we can say that it can be opened 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.570
 I will accept, however, I am not yet 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.250
 you see here also with the rifle 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.050
 if you shoot, stick to the rock, don't 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.420
 succeeded instead if you go against here 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.289
 you always succeed is very much 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.570
 particular 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.250
 so now I'll show you this 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.740
 machine guys who then at the end of the video 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.390
 in fact I will put you a clip like 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.440
 modify this machine and there is why 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.800
 this one at the third car 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.750
 amazing to change by switching to 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.369
 jetpack girl just this door here 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.830
 I also went at night then you 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.630
 I'll put a clip 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.610
 even there where I went at night with 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.970
 the flashlight to see inside a slot 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.619
 however, nothing is seen and no boys 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.140
 unfortunately the mystery of the jetpack e 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.599
 still unresolved maybe it will be found 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.280
 only online here do you see where this 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.569
 port to sandy shore 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.539
 he told me that many clues 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.280
 they bring online but they are not 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.709
 still sure so where i am a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.700
 moment more focusing on the online a 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:47.950
 go up a bit of level and so on then 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.170
 the door to that submarine boys 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.209
 that you told me to launch rockets 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.979
 etc. it is almost impossible to da 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.390
 hit her because the rockets don't come to 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.380
 with depth and marry first 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.360
 etc 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.429
 so I'll put you another video in between 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.429
 I know when to explain a method to you 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.500
 maybe where you can get to 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.729
 hatch that I guys have trouble a 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:13.000
 do not manage to finish then 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.640
 I will ask for your help and now I think 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.720
 that there will be the night video 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.760
 girls have been a long time too 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.800
 with the torch to see if I could make a 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.230
 moment to see some detail but 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.480
 there was nothing to do here 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.210
 see with michael and the torch is there 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.850
 this slit guys that if you look 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.950
 very carefully go there also go 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.920
 you maybe see better on the screen 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.920
 of the tv and you see there is not inside 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.000
 no object that can hit the light 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.650
 however, or something really weird is 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.410
 much more strange indeed this door 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.750
 that doesn't take bullets anyway 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.740
 guys I think that for this thing of the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.150
 jetpack is everything i would leave now 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.220
 precisely to the clip of the machine 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.880
 transformable as many are 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.010
 curious 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.470
 I tell you right away that this machine is 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.260
 very very difficult to find at least 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.140
 I have made an absurd effort you see it is 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.240
 a jeep has very nice quiet too 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.070
 why on the roof lights and the 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.420
 mirrors in front of the boy's face 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.490
 really particular then among the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.580
 very small side drains very much 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.950
 beautiful and no boys then I wanted 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.040
 also say that I will be at games this week 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.680
 week 26 and Saturday boys then 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.680

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.610
 come to games week then I don't know now 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.500
