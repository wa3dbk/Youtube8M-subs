00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.450
 as a shot 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.380
 Welcome to this new video and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.090
 good occasion this time I bring you 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.610
 gameplay revolution to speak one 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.590
 again more about what it is to be a 4 and 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.240
 is that good a skin came out where we 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.000
 they showed what it was 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.000
 guyton the death of youtube good of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.860
 Youzhny and apart avoided in products ex 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.050
 USSR and well they showed us part of 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.780
 his musset part of what was what 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.129
 it seems to be your stress or youtube and also 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.039
 Well, it confirms the character 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.100
 playable thing that we already knew really 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:50.010
 but they also show us two screenshots 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.019
 and good included what is then let's say 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 which is going to be the sample of the character not 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.710
 the sample of deaths of the club and that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.359
 Well that's what we normally see 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.159
 the character selection is 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.019
 normally the position that you see the 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.300
 time to choose then show us what 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.550
 what is this script and they show us two 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.550
 more than good because it includes the fight 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.130
 where sound mode appears suh and naruto 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.630
 program against what is then our 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.760
 partner 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 death then not good people we go to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.170
 proceed to what is the scan these are 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.720
 different scan 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.670
 they are of a single page in this case they are 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.040
 two good with some messages or 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.960
 details a little important for what 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.610
 it's the character and well do not show 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.560
 what is the type of attacks that will 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 be driving that good for those who 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.020
 they follow the anime or the mango they already saw it 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.619
 and handles what is then a few spheres of 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.049
 chacra xi as natural energy or something 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.240
 as well as Naruto but well, this is 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.590
 Energy is a little different not because 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.130
 Well, they show us a bit of what 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.950
 What is it 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.539
 death setsuv and also show us what 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.060
 which is the power that will be occupying 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.909
 in the matter of ninjutsu show us 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.830
 a bit of the boom that will use what 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.140
 what is this habit of rain habit of 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.310
 ridiculous habit as you want to call it and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.509
 well, it also shows us a little 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.479
 of the phrases that you are going to be mentioning 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.100
 the character is probably the mode 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.929
 wake up liberating aljub and 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.489
 completely something still a little bit like that 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.530
 what is the death we are are 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.080
 revolution but perfected what is 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.819
 the issue not here is what it is 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.930
 the image of the character as they 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.940
 I mentioned is usually what is 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.860
 used to present it in what is the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.900
 character selection and what they are 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.860
 these two writings that well it is 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.470
 as 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.990
 rather it is not how is the voice faith that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.850
 is going to have those that and naruto against 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.740
 what it is or beat or not the truth is that it 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.510
 looks quite intense it looks with enough 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.670
 striking effects that good is what 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.040
 many people expected what is storm 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.410
 4 not that he leads used to what is the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.200
 annexation in that sense of what are the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.250
 particles and well then the 60 fps is 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.410
 Well, it's something that's already 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.930
 confirmed or been only missing see 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.870
 that we have our game at 60 fps in 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.370
 1080 so that we are all happy and that 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.590
 good confirm that they eliminated what is 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.820
 the whole not then good people then 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.030
 that's the information with respect 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.920
 strong 4 that there is to date the truth is 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.270
 Well, it probably took me a while 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.280
 little in taking the videos but good 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.739
 Many times it's worth it because they come out 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.390
 new things and managed to say it 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.700
 that to title in a single video there 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.290
 So, good people, this has been 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.239
 all do not forget to leave your like should not 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.680
 share it with your friends and do not forget 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.320
 leave here in the comments that you 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.000
 it seemed what the small sample is not 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.860
 because they did not really show anything in the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.480
 question of the murcia however 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.670
 they showed what is these chips 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.170
 They showed what the audi is and well 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.170
 apart from the style that they will handle 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.000
 these two characters 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.220
 and I think many expected it, I say 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.319
 it's not my case but maybe winnow 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.360
 a few games with what is this 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.040
 Habit set course probably if it goes 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.750
 Let's go to use all the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.849
 characters because then we complain about 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.680
 that there is no then we are going to give it use 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.720
 to all the characters in the most 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.100
 we can then good people then they 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.600
 commissioned that in the comments that leave 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.920
 what do you think and good 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.480
 done here I say goodbye see you the 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.480
 next and it's worth
