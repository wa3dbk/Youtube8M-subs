 very well known in the United States know that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.500
 you can find the procedure 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.660
 complain about American chad but I 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.329
 mens i do not care what 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.950
 and frankly I decided to you 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.989
 present this recipe because for me this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.690
 that it's just a pure delight then 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.489
 look at the recipe you will need 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.329
 noodles that are in the salad bowl 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.110
 curry ketchup with salt and pepper 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.750
 obviously 2 e of which 1 beat a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.879
 minced beef a toxin is cheddar and 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.370
 a little salad the first step 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.770
 is relatively simple since you 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.850
 go take the noodles and add 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.930
 1.9 and there you go also a salt 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.020
 and pepper 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.780
 in order to give enough your noodles that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.180
 will make bread actually burger and 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.450
 after putting the work you mix 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.360
 well 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.430
 then no need to take mussels 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.170
 particular you take two bowls they 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.380
 are about the size of a bread 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.380
 bourgue hours and you're going to put some 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.549
 film paper then you will put some 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.880
 noodles in the bowls once it's done 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.100
 you will cover and close your 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.680
 film paper 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.740
 of course both bowls and then to 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.549
 using an object like for example the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.500
 salt are you going to have and the noodles and 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.780
 once you have and we will put them at 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.810
 freezer for ten or so 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.030
 minutes in my hair you put a little 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.369
 of oil and then you will do 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.520

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.830
 bowl delicately and you will leave 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.170
