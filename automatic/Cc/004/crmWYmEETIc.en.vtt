00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.980 
a pictorial documentation of my 61 to 72
hybrid<00:00:25.220> in<00:00:25.730> this<00:00:25.939> picture<00:00:26.300> here<00:00:26.480> is<00:00:26.510> just<00:00:26.869> the

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
hybrid in this picture here is just the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.970 
hybrid in this picture here is just the
two<00:00:27.200> top<00:00:28.040> ends<00:00:28.430> and<00:00:28.550> two<00:00:28.670> pistons<00:00:29.830> pretty<00:00:30.830> much

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
two top ends and two pistons pretty much

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.810 
two top ends and two pistons pretty much
what<00:00:31.160> I<00:00:31.190> started<00:00:31.610> with<00:00:31.789> in<00:00:33.699> that<00:00:34.699> picture<00:00:35.559> was

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
what I started with in that picture was

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.020 
what I started with in that picture was
where<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.850> had<00:00:38.150> put<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.489> 272<00:00:40.489> cylinder<00:00:41.000> on<00:00:43.030> and

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
where I had put the 272 cylinder on and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.610 
where I had put the 272 cylinder on and
I<00:00:44.120> had<00:00:44.269> cleaned<00:00:44.570> up<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.870> exhaust<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.530> I

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
I had cleaned up the exhaust and I

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.020 
I had cleaned up the exhaust and I
cleaned<00:00:45.860> up<00:00:45.979> the<00:00:46.100> transfers<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:46.909> that's

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
cleaned up the transfers but that's

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.840 
cleaned up the transfers but that's
pretty<00:00:47.210> much<00:00:47.330> not<00:00:47.870> important<00:00:48.379> here<00:00:48.729> what<00:00:49.729> is

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
pretty much not important here what is

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.740 
pretty much not important here what is
important<00:00:50.420> is<00:00:50.600> you<00:00:51.050> have<00:00:51.080> to<00:00:51.409> use<00:00:52.159> the<00:00:53.000> 272

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
important is you have to use the 272

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.500 
important is you have to use the 272
manifold<00:00:54.409> the<00:00:55.010> plastic<00:00:55.519> intake<00:00:55.790> manifold<00:00:56.299> and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
manifold the plastic intake manifold and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.630 
manifold the plastic intake manifold and
the<00:00:56.720> carburetor<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.379> that's<00:00:58.339> what's<00:00:58.549> shown

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
the carburetor and that's what's shown

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.289 
the carburetor and that's what's shown
in<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.030> picture<00:00:59.420> right<00:00:59.449> here<00:00:59.629> I<00:01:00.580> also<00:01:01.580> put

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
in this picture right here I also put

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.450 
in this picture right here I also put
that<00:01:02.420> cylinder<00:01:02.809> on<00:01:03.019> with<00:01:05.320> 1194<00:01:06.320> that's<00:01:07.310> the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
that cylinder on with 1194 that's the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.820 
that cylinder on with 1194 that's the
three<00:01:07.670> bond<00:01:07.909> product<00:01:08.450> 1194<00:01:09.260> there's<00:01:09.710> a

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
three bond product 1194 there's a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.469 
three bond product 1194 there's a
picture<00:01:10.190> of<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.430> two<00:01:10.610> manifolds<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.360> they

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
picture of the two manifolds and they

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.670 
picture of the two manifolds and they
are<00:01:11.600> obviously<00:01:11.960> different<00:01:12.909> in<00:01:13.909> addition<00:01:14.360> to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
are obviously different in addition to

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.520 
are obviously different in addition to
assembling<00:01:15.680> this<00:01:15.890> with<00:01:16.400> 1194<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.510> did<00:01:18.500> a

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
assembling this with 1194 I did a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.789 
assembling this with 1194 I did a
muffler<00:01:18.920> mod<00:01:19.159> it's<00:01:19.579> really<00:01:19.969> easy<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.359> do<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:21.350> had

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
muffler mod it's really easy to do I had

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.580 
muffler mod it's really easy to do I had
to<00:01:21.920> do<00:01:22.039> one<00:01:22.369> thing<00:01:22.729> I<00:01:22.969> had<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.240> build<00:01:25.329> spacers

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
to do one thing I had to build spacers

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.740 
to do one thing I had to build spacers
so<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:27.770> when<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:27.920> used<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.969> different<00:01:29.179> screws

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
so that when I used the different screws

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.649 
so that when I used the different screws
from<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.829> 272<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:31.909> wouldn't<00:01:32.210> crush<00:01:32.450> the

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
from the 272 it wouldn't crush the

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.169 
from the 272 it wouldn't crush the
muffler<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:36.340> yet<00:01:37.340> again<00:01:37.579> I'm<00:01:37.700> showing<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
muffler and yet again I'm showing the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.240 
muffler and yet again I'm showing the
farmer<00:01:38.840> Jones<00:01:39.079> build<00:01:39.469> which<00:01:39.649> is<00:01:39.799> what<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:40.219> call

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
farmer Jones build which is what I call

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.359 
farmer Jones build which is what I call
my<00:01:40.490> three<00:01:41.299> bundle<00:01:41.719> of<00:01:41.780> 94<00:01:42.229> build<00:01:42.469> bumped<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
my three bundle of 94 build bumped the

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.080 
my three bundle of 94 build bumped the
compression<00:01:43.850> 20<00:01:43.969> pounds<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.539> all<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.780> does

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
compression 20 pounds is all it does

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.639 
compression 20 pounds is all it does
this<00:01:47.090> was<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.450> first<00:01:47.719> iteration<00:01:48.109> where<00:01:48.619> I

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
this was the first iteration where I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.590 
this was the first iteration where I
tried<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:49.130> blend<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.640> 272<00:01:51.429> air<00:01:52.429> horn<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.450> air

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
tried to blend a 272 air horn to the air

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.830 
tried to blend a 272 air horn to the air
filter<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:55.340> had<00:01:55.609> to<00:01:55.729> chop<00:01:55.969> up<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.359> white

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
filter and I had to chop up the white

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.080 
filter and I had to chop up the white
cover<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.319> make<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.560> fit<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:57.770> top<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.399> 272

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
cover to make it fit on top of the 272

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.399 
cover to make it fit on top of the 272
cylinder<00:01:59.659> and<00:02:00.819> it<00:02:01.819> didn't<00:02:02.090> work<00:02:02.119> out<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:02.869> what

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
cylinder and it didn't work out so what

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.139 
cylinder and it didn't work out so what
I<00:02:03.439> did<00:02:03.679> was<00:02:03.859> I<00:02:04.009> went<00:02:04.130> back<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.640> used<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
I did was I went back and used the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.499 
I did was I went back and used the
aluminum<00:02:06.069> 61<00:02:07.069> air<00:02:07.249> horn<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.670> then<00:02:07.939> used<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.330> die

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
aluminum 61 air horn and then used a die

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.840 
aluminum 61 air horn and then used a die
grinder<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:09.140> really<00:02:10.100> hug<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.490> out<00:02:10.610> and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
grinder to really hug it out and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.610 
grinder to really hug it out and
actually<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.569> has<00:02:11.630> more<00:02:11.870> cross-sectional

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
actually it has more cross-sectional

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.750 
actually it has more cross-sectional
area<00:02:12.830> than<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.069> stock<00:02:13.420> 272<00:02:15.340> after<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.370> slapped

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
area than the stock 272 after I slapped

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.460 
area than the stock 272 after I slapped
it<00:02:16.910> all<00:02:17.060> together<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.450> realized<00:02:17.960> that<00:02:18.230> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
it all together I realized that the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.180 
it all together I realized that the
white<00:02:19.340> cover<00:02:19.580> interfered<00:02:20.240> for<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.420> 272<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
white cover interfered for the 272 the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.380 
white cover interfered for the 272 the
cylinder<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.269> I<00:02:23.599> used<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.709> die<00:02:25.670> grinder<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:26.180> cut

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
cylinder so I used a die grinder to cut

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.320 
cylinder so I used a die grinder to cut
out<00:02:26.510> some<00:02:26.540> hole

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
out some hole

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.990 
out some hole
and<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:28.140> found<00:02:28.620> out<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.920> needs<00:02:29.070> more<00:02:29.310> air<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:29.940> I

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
and I found out it needs more air so I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.150 
and I found out it needs more air so I
did<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.480> well<00:02:30.680> well<00:02:31.680> here's<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.920> picture

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
did that as well well here's a picture

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.740 
did that as well well here's a picture
