actually<00:01:17.009> now<00:01:17.220> there's<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> few<00:01:18.270> cool<00:01:18.479> things

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
actually now there's a few cool things

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
actually now there's a few cool things
about<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.740> streak<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> way<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.820> it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
about this streak and the way that it

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.929 
about this streak and the way that it
works<00:01:21.180> he<00:01:21.750> only<00:01:21.990> has<00:01:22.110> two<00:01:22.380> pistols<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
works he only has two pistols and so the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.600 
works he only has two pistols and so the
range<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> very<00:01:24.600> very<00:01:24.869> limited<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.619> when<00:01:26.369> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
range is very very limited but when you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.969 
range is very very limited but when you
kill<00:01:26.970> an<00:01:27.270> enemy<00:01:27.479> it'll<00:01:28.049> actually<00:01:28.170> spawn<00:01:28.710> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
yourself and two other guys running

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
yourself and two other guys running
around<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.490> map<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.000> lunatics<00:01:42.600> with

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
around the map like lunatics with

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.899 
around the map like lunatics with
pistols<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.860> taking<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.340> absolutely

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
pistols just taking out absolutely

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.149 
pistols just taking out absolutely
everyone<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> load<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:45.990> fun<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.710> top

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
everyone and it's a load of fun on top

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.410 
everyone and it's a load of fun on top
of<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.310> you'll<00:01:47.490> notice<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.210> see

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
of that you'll notice that you can see

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
of that you'll notice that you can see
red<00:01:48.750> glows<00:01:49.140> around<00:01:49.170> everyone<00:01:49.890> even<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.310> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
red glows around everyone even if it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
red glows around everyone even if it
behind<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> wall<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.240> that's<00:01:51.659> basically<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
behind the wall and that's basically the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
behind the wall and that's basically the
equivalent<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> oracle<00:01:53.640> mode<00:01:53.820> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
equivalent of like the oracle mode and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
equivalent of like the oracle mode and
you<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.540> oracle<00:01:54.899> mode<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.950> this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
you get the oracle mode for this

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
you get the oracle mode for this
character<00:01:56.399> which<00:01:57.060> allows<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.509> see<00:01:57.869> where

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
character which allows you to see where

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.050 
character which allows you to see where
the<00:01:58.350> enemies<00:01:58.619> are<00:01:58.649> at<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.460> very<00:01:59.790> very

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the enemies are at and it's very very

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
the enemies are at and it's very very
powerful<00:02:00.299> indeed<00:02:00.750> knows<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> little<00:02:01.200> bit<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.469> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
powerful indeed knows a little bit of a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.719 
powerful indeed knows a little bit of a
cut<00:02:01.710> here<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.100> because<00:02:02.189> people<00:02:02.280> wanted<00:02:02.670> to

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
cut here just because people wanted to

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.069 
cut here just because people wanted to
see<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.060> miry<00:02:03.240> actually<00:02:03.540> look<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.750> up

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
see what the miry actually look like up

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.749 
see what the miry actually look like up
close<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.469> personal<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.310> apart<00:02:05.549> from<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
close and personal but apart from that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.540 
close and personal but apart from that
is<00:02:06.000> literally<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.689> full<00:02:07.110> gameplay<00:02:07.500> my<00:02:08.280> squad

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
is literally a full gameplay my squad

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.160 
is literally a full gameplay my squad
members<00:02:08.879> also<00:02:09.060> go<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.509> tear<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.929> shout<00:02:10.140> out

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
members also go on a tear so shout out

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.880 
members also go on a tear so shout out
to<00:02:10.530> them<00:02:10.679> spawning<00:02:11.160> in

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
to them spawning in

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.370 
to them spawning in
actually<00:02:12.190> causing<00:02:12.790> destruction<00:02:13.210> but<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.290> are

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
actually causing destruction but you are

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.050 
actually causing destruction but you are
limited<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.770> can<00:02:15.010> only<00:02:15.160> have<00:02:15.370> two<00:02:15.400> extra<00:02:15.819> ones

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
limited you can only have two extra ones

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.190 
limited you can only have two extra ones
of<00:02:16.209> those<00:02:16.330> on<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.569> map<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:16.930> can't<00:02:17.110> have

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
of those on the map so you can't have

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.080 
of those on the map so you can't have
like<00:02:17.290> 100<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:17.890> them<00:02:18.040> running<00:02:18.550> around<00:02:18.700> at<00:02:19.000> the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
like 100 of them running around at the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.940 
like 100 of them running around at the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
same time it's not going to be like that

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.190 
same time it's not going to be like that
not<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.280> crazy<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:22.930> top<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.140> that

walls are going to be doing a

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.680 
walls are going to be doing a
walk-around<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.940> map<00:02:25.120> after<00:02:25.600> the

at the end we did a sniping freefall and
I<00:02:33.700> thought<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.150> guys<00:02:34.300> would<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> series

I thought you guys would like the series
sort<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.470> messing<00:02:35.800> around<00:02:35.890> with<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.250> sniper<00:02:36.430> a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
sort of messing around with a sniper a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.370 
sort of messing around with a sniper a
little<00:02:36.910> bit<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.450> stay<00:02:37.660> tuned<00:02:37.959> all<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.260> way<00:02:38.320> to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
little bit so stay tuned all the way to

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.720

want<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.230> say<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.739> one<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.040> first

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
want to say this is one of the first

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.620 
want to say this is one of the first
times<00:02:45.550> that<00:02:45.640> actually<00:02:45.790> played<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.360> map<00:02:46.600> so

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
times that actually played this map so

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.290 
times that actually played this map so
it<00:02:47.350> was<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> lot<00:02:47.739> of<00:02:47.860> sort<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.100> just<00:02:48.340> playing<00:02:49.060> it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
it was a lot of sort of just playing it

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.180 
it was a lot of sort of just playing it
as<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.510> saw<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.170> trying<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.500> work<00:02:50.739> out<00:02:50.950> which

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
as I saw it and trying to work out which

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.740 
as I saw it and trying to work out which
areas<00:02:51.580> seem<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.790> be<00:02:51.850> good<00:02:52.000> areas<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.360> take<00:02:52.510> down

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
areas seem to be good areas to take down

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.390 
areas seem to be good areas to take down
which<00:02:52.930> s<00:02:53.110> didn't<00:02:53.440> seem<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.680> be<00:02:53.739> too<00:02:53.920> good<00:02:53.950> I

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
which s didn't seem to be too good I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.220 
which s didn't seem to be too good I
tried<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.000> avoid<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.450> buildings<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.050> staying

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230

tried to avoid the buildings and staying
in<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.440> buildings<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:56.890> tried<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.430> sneaky

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.509 
in the buildings I tried to be sneaky
and<00:02:58.000> stick<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.420> edges<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.810> map<00:02:58.989> and

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
and stick to the edges of the map and

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.710 
and stick to the edges of the map and
because<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.550> lot<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.820> people<00:03:01.030> tend<00:03:01.269> to<00:03:01.420> look

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
because a lot of people tend to look

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.600 
because a lot of people tend to look
towards<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.350> center<00:03:02.709> of<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.800> map<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.160> if

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
towards the center of the map and if

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.130 
towards the center of the map and if
you're<00:03:03.790> then<00:03:04.090> sort<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.360> behind<00:03:04.690> them<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.019> the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
you're then sort of behind them and the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.479 
you're then sort of behind them and the
edges<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.709> can<00:03:05.830> sort<00:03:05.950> of<00:03:06.040> take<00:03:06.190> them<00:03:06.340> out

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
edges and you can sort of take them out

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.890 
edges and you can sort of take them out
secretly<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.120> need<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.420> they<00:03:07.630> don't<00:03:07.750> know

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
secretly you need it they don't know

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.600

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
review of this map I'd say it sort of a

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.890 
review of this map I'd say it sort of a
medium<00:03:41.590> size<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.280> works<00:03:42.489> well<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.150> if<00:03:43.840> you

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
medium size it works well and if you

within<00:03:59.440> my<00:03:59.560> video<00:03:59.799> yesterday<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.579> actually

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
within my video yesterday and actually

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.030 
within my video yesterday and actually
found<00:04:01.269> myself<00:04:01.450> playing<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.959> DLC<00:04:02.470> playlist<00:04:02.920> a

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
found myself playing the DLC playlist a

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.590 
found myself playing the DLC playlist a
lot<00:04:03.220> more<00:04:03.519> than<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.820> standard<00:04:04.239> playlist

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
lot more than the standard playlist

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.060 
lot more than the standard playlist
sometimes<00:04:04.959> I'm<00:04:05.110> Call<00:04:05.260> of<00:04:05.290> Duty<00:04:05.650> goes<00:04:05.860> which

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
sometimes I'm Call of Duty goes which

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.470 
sometimes I'm Call of Duty goes which
often<00:04:06.430> doesn't<00:04:06.459> happen<00:04:06.670> in<00:04:07.090> some<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.360> Call

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
often doesn't happen in some of the Call

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.840 
often doesn't happen in some of the Call
of<00:04:07.510> Duty's<00:04:07.900> sometimes<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:09.070> DLC<00:04:09.459> maps<00:04:09.640> can<00:04:09.790> be

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
of Duty's sometimes the DLC maps can be

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.580 
of Duty's sometimes the DLC maps can be
kind<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.060> weak<00:04:10.299> but<00:04:10.570> I<00:04:10.630> think<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.109> design<00:04:11.410> of

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
kind of weak but I think the design of

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.039 
kind of weak but I think the design of
them<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:12.459> been<00:04:12.640> fantastic<00:04:13.359> in<00:04:13.450> my<00:04:13.600> opinion

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
them have been fantastic in my opinion

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.750 
them have been fantastic in my opinion
I've<00:04:14.440> seen<00:04:14.680> some<00:04:14.890> people<00:04:15.010> sort<00:04:15.370> of<00:04:15.400> complained

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
I've seen some people sort of complained

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.039 
I've seen some people sort of complained
they<00:04:15.940> don't<00:04:16.120> we<00:04:16.239> have<00:04:16.419> too<00:04:16.600> much<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:16.780> a<00:04:16.870> Call<00:04:17.019> of

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
they don't we have too much of a Call of

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.690

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:46.029 
the mini-map could be in the top right

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:47.580 
the mini-map could be in the top right
constantly<00:04:46.689> so<00:04:46.840> hope<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:46.990> gives<00:04:47.199> you<00:04:47.319> a<00:04:47.409> good

idea<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:48.270> started<00:04:49.270> in<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.479> top<00:04:49.659> right<00:04:49.870> that

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
idea I started in the top right that

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.659 
idea I started in the top right that
mini-map<00:04:50.409> and<00:04:50.620> I'm<00:04:50.919> working<00:04:51.189> my<00:04:51.520> way<00:04:51.550> around

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
mini-map and I'm working my way around

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.149 
mini-map and I'm working my way around
the<00:04:52.060> outside<00:04:52.270> edge<00:04:52.930> so<00:04:53.259> if<00:04:53.560> you<00:04:53.650> follow<00:04:53.949> your

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:54.159 
the outside edge so if you follow your

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.709 
the outside edge so if you follow your
around<00:04:54.550> then<00:04:54.759> you<00:04:54.819> can<00:04:54.939> get<00:04:55.029> a<00:04:55.060> good<00:04:55.240> idea<00:04:55.300> of

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719 
around then you can get a good idea of

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.089 
around then you can get a good idea of
how<00:04:55.779> the<00:04:55.900> map<00:04:56.139> looks<00:04:56.409> and<00:04:56.620> how<00:04:56.710> its<00:04:56.860> sort<00:04:57.039> of

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
how the map looks and how its sort of

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.379 
how the map looks and how its sort of
