00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
inside because I made it in a way the

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.920 
inside because I made it in a way the
spines<00:02:35.800> just<00:02:36.190> stick<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.760> there<00:02:37.000> without

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
spines just stick in there without

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.990 
spines just stick in there without
grabbing<00:02:38.470> onto<00:02:38.770> anything<00:02:39.100> they<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.370> fall<00:02:39.820> in

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
grabbing onto anything they just fall in

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.750 
grabbing onto anything they just fall in
there<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.210> I<00:02:41.010> can't<00:02:42.010> even<00:02:42.220> come<00:02:42.370> out<00:02:42.490> you<00:02:42.670> see

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
