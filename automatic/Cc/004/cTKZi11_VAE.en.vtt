00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.920 
base I just either spray sealer or I use
glossy<00:03:18.820> accent<00:03:19.510> accents<00:03:20.410> on<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.750> seal<00:03:22.750> it

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
glossy accent accents on it to seal it

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.570 
glossy accent accents on it to seal it
off<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.620> doesn't<00:03:23.650> come<00:03:24.040> off<00:03:24.070> on<00:03:24.459> everything

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
off so it doesn't come off on everything

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.190 
off so it doesn't come off on everything
now<00:03:27.580> what<00:03:28.270> I<00:03:28.300> do<00:03:28.450> just<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.560> add<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:30.100> little<00:03:30.130> bit

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
now what I do just to add a little bit

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.449 
now what I do just to add a little bit
more<00:03:32.200> as<00:03:32.500> i<00:03:32.860> take<00:03:33.400> my<00:03:33.730> glimmer<00:03:34.090> myth<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:35.459> it

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
more as i take my glimmer myth and it

more as i take my glimmer myth and it
kind<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:37.470> puddles<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:41.160> shaken<00:03:42.160> up<00:03:42.280> my<00:03:42.310> glimmer

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
kind of puddles and shaken up my glimmer

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.240 
kind of puddles and shaken up my glimmer
mist<00:03:42.940> here<00:03:43.270> it<00:03:43.870> kind<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.110> puddles<00:03:44.500> on<00:03:44.650> here<00:03:44.920> so

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
you kind of want to hit it with your

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.600 
you kind of want to hit it with your
heat<00:03:49.030> gun<00:03:49.060> right<00:03:49.570> away<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:51.100> don't<00:03:51.370> want

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
heat gun right away and you don't want

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.030 
heat gun right away and you don't want
to<00:03:51.730> be<00:03:51.880> real<00:03:52.150> heavy<00:03:52.510> with<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.080> spray<00:03:53.590> either

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
to be real heavy with the spray either

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.490 
to be real heavy with the spray either
you<00:03:54.459> want<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.730> be<00:03:54.850> real<00:03:55.120> light<00:03:55.420> because<00:03:55.750> it'll

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
you want to be real light because it'll

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.060 
you want to be real light because it'll
run<00:03:56.890> if<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.580> don't<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.120> it'll<00:03:58.330> take<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:59.070> rub

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
run if you don't and it'll take the rub

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.270 
run if you don't and it'll take the rub
the<00:04:00.700> metallic<00:04:01.269> rubs<00:04:01.570> with<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.769> just

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
the metallic rubs with it so just

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.990 
the metallic rubs with it so just
lightly<00:04:03.640> give<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.540> quick<00:04:04.959> spritz<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.100> then

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
lightly give it a quick spritz and then

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.030 
lightly give it a quick spritz and then
heat<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:07.360> with<00:04:07.600> your<00:04:07.780> heat<00:04:07.989> barn

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.849 

and<00:04:15.549> it<00:04:15.760> does<00:04:15.969> take<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.239> little<00:04:16.690> bit<00:04:17.019> longer<00:04:17.350> for

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
and it does take a little bit longer for

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.980 
and it does take a little bit longer for
the<00:04:18.489> glimmer<00:04:18.820> myth<00:04:19.090> sassette<00:04:19.959> because<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.739> the

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:21.990 
the glimmer myth sassette because of the

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:30.220 
the glimmer myth sassette because of the
metallic<00:04:22.990> rubs<00:04:23.259> are<00:04:23.500> like<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.680> cream

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.620 

so<00:04:30.740> just<00:04:31.040> don't<00:04:31.430> keep<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.790> in<00:04:31.880> one<00:04:32.060> spot<00:04:32.240> though

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
so just don't keep it in one spot though

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.390 
so just don't keep it in one spot though
because<00:04:32.870> then<00:04:33.230> you'll<00:04:33.380> reheat<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.010> multi

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
because then you'll reheat the multi

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.450 
because then you'll reheat the multi
medium<00:04:34.820> ops<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.450> he'll<00:04:35.570> start<00:04:35.870> bubbling<00:04:36.460> and

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
medium ops and he'll start bubbling and

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.790 
medium ops and he'll start bubbling and
you<00:04:37.580> don't<00:04:37.730> want<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:37.910> do<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.590> then

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
you don't want to do that so and then

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.350 
you don't want to do that so and then
I'm<00:04:39.980> going<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.340> take<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.580> little<00:04:40.820> bit<00:04:41.060> of<00:04:41.120> the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
I'm going to take a little bit of the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.560 
I'm going to take a little bit of the
black<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:43.010> was<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.490> walnut<00:04:43.880> gold<00:04:44.240> that<00:04:44.510> I

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
black that was the walnut gold that I

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.110 
black that was the walnut gold that I
sprayed<00:04:45.020> on<00:04:45.200> there<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.760> now<00:04:46.760> I'm<00:04:46.850> going<00:04:47.030> to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
sprayed on there and now I'm going to

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.950 
sprayed on there and now I'm going to
spray<00:04:47.570> just<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:48.080> little<00:04:48.740> bit<00:04:48.860> of<00:04:49.010> black<00:04:49.960> because

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
spray just a little bit of black because

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.130 
spray just a little bit of black because
the<00:04:51.080> black<00:04:51.320> has<00:04:51.710> like<00:04:51.980> a<00:04:52.010> really<00:04:52.310> cool<00:04:53.140> like

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
the black has like a really cool like

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:13.629 
the black has like a really cool like
gold<00:04:54.830> color<00:04:55.760> in<00:04:56.090> it<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.570> it's

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.739 

okay<00:05:15.110> so<00:05:16.110> here<00:05:16.740> is<00:05:16.949> our<00:05:17.400> finished<00:05:17.759> product<00:05:18.539> and

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:18.749 
okay so here is our finished product and

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:20.540 
okay so here is our finished product and
I<00:05:18.840> don't<00:05:19.020> know<00:05:19.110> if<00:05:19.199> you<00:05:19.289> can<00:05:19.409> see<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.860> shine<00:05:20.249> on

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
I don't know if you can see the shine on

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.800 
I don't know if you can see the shine on
them<00:05:20.729> as<00:05:20.999> having<00:05:21.150> cadet<00:05:21.599> closer<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:24.210> it<00:05:24.569> does

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
them as having cadet closer and it does

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.689 
them as having cadet closer and it does
it<00:05:25.050> looks<00:05:25.319> like<00:05:25.560> metal<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.219> let<00:05:26.400> me<00:05:26.490> tell<00:05:26.520> you

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
it looks like metal and let me tell you

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.239 
it looks like metal and let me tell you
something<00:05:27.300> you<00:05:27.930> can<00:05:28.110> do<00:05:28.229> this<00:05:28.379> two<00:05:28.590> frames<00:05:28.979> you

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:29.249 
something you can do this two frames you

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:31.999 
something you can do this two frames you
can<00:05:29.279> cut<00:05:29.610> them<00:05:29.699> out<00:05:29.849> of<00:05:29.909> cereal<00:05:30.479> boxes<00:05:30.960> and<00:05:31.319> do

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
can cut them out of cereal boxes and do

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.600 
can cut them out of cereal boxes and do
this<00:05:32.189> to<00:05:32.249> you<00:05:33.029> know<00:05:33.150> die-cut<00:05:33.900> frames<00:05:34.259> and<00:05:34.800> just

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
this to you know die-cut frames and just

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.499 
this to you know die-cut frames and just
about<00:05:35.819> anything<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.900> can<00:05:37.590> do<00:05:37.770> this<00:05:37.979> too<00:05:38.610> um<00:05:38.939> I

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
about anything you can do this too um I

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.170 
about anything you can do this too um I
really<00:05:40.020> love<00:05:40.409> this<00:05:40.590> technique<00:05:41.039> because<00:05:41.520> the

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
really love this technique because the

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.570 
really love this technique because the
metal<00:05:42.419> accents<00:05:42.960> are<00:05:43.080> so<00:05:43.469> expensive<00:05:44.099> to

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
metal accents are so expensive to

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.510 
metal accents are so expensive to
purchase<00:05:44.939> well<00:05:45.810> where<00:05:46.439> I<00:05:46.469> live<00:05:46.830> it<00:05:47.069> they're

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
purchase well where I live it they're

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.640 
purchase well where I live it they're
really<00:05:48.060> really<00:05:48.210> expensive<00:05:48.659> and<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:51.169> find<00:05:52.169> other

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
really really expensive and I find other

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.550 
really really expensive and I find other
ways<00:05:53.099> of<00:05:53.460> creating<00:05:54.389> a<00:05:54.810> metal<00:05:55.110> look<00:05:55.349> without

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
ways of creating a metal look without

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.909 
ways of creating a metal look without
having<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.550> spend<00:05:57.259> five<00:05:58.259> dollars<00:05:58.710> on<00:05:58.889> the

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
having to spend five dollars on the

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.050 
having to spend five dollars on the
little<00:05:59.189> package<00:05:59.580> of<00:05:59.729> metal<00:06:01.610> stuff<00:06:02.610> like<00:06:02.819> this

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
little package of metal stuff like this

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:10.790 
little package of metal stuff like this
you<00:06:03.449> know<00:06:04.069> so<00:06:07.400> that<00:06:08.400> is<00:06:08.699> that<00:06:08.969> technique<00:06:09.800> it

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
you know so that is that technique it

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.800 
you know so that is that technique it
works<00:06:11.099> really<00:06:11.310> well<00:06:11.430> and<00:06:11.729> it<00:06:11.849> does<00:06:12.029> truly<00:06:12.779> I

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
works really well and it does truly I

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.480 
works really well and it does truly I
mean<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.139> camera<00:06:13.439> doesn't<00:06:13.650> do<00:06:13.830> it<00:06:13.949> justice<00:06:13.979> it

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
mean the camera doesn't do it justice it

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.079 
mean the camera doesn't do it justice it
truly<00:06:14.849> looks<00:06:14.999> like<00:06:15.689> metal<00:06:16.129> like<00:06:17.129> old<00:06:17.430> metal

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
truly looks like metal like old metal

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:23.209 
truly looks like metal like old metal
and<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:18.779> more<00:06:19.699> you<00:06:20.699> use<00:06:21.469> like<00:06:22.469> the<00:06:22.830> different

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
and the more you use like the different

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.249 
and the more you use like the different
color<00:06:23.430> rubs<00:06:23.759> and<00:06:24.000> the<00:06:24.029> more<00:06:24.449> glimmer<00:06:24.870> mist<00:06:25.080> you

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 
color rubs and the more glimmer mist you

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.950 
color rubs and the more glimmer mist you
put<00:06:25.469> on<00:06:25.589> the<00:06:25.740> older<00:06:26.189> the<00:06:26.460> metal<00:06:26.759> looks<00:06:27.000> and<00:06:27.779> you

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
put on the older the metal looks and you

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.550 
put on the older the metal looks and you
can<00:06:28.139> actually<00:06:29.089> make<00:06:30.089> it<00:06:30.240> look<00:06:30.270> so<00:06:30.449> old<00:06:31.050> and

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
can actually make it look so old and

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.969 
can actually make it look so old and
rusty<00:06:32.479> I'm<00:06:33.479> going<00:06:33.779> to<00:06:33.839> be<00:06:33.960> doing<00:06:34.080> another<00:06:34.680> one

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
rusty I'm going to be doing another one

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:36.829 
rusty I'm going to be doing another one
like<00:06:35.159> this<00:06:35.339> except<00:06:35.819> I'm<00:06:35.969> going<00:06:36.180> to<00:06:36.240> do<00:06:36.419> it<00:06:36.569> with

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:36.839 
like this except I'm going to do it with

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:41.749 
like this except I'm going to do it with
it's<00:06:37.259> going<00:06:37.529> to<00:06:37.560> look<00:06:37.740> like<00:06:38.629> metal<00:06:39.629> that<00:06:40.759> paint

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
it's going to look like metal that paint

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.939 
it's going to look like metal that paint
like<00:06:42.300> chipped<00:06:42.689> off<00:06:42.870> of<00:06:43.110> so<00:06:43.289> you<00:06:43.349> have<00:06:43.620> like<00:06:43.740> the

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:43.949 
like chipped off of so you have like the

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:48.469 
like chipped off of so you have like the
rust<00:06:44.689> behind<00:06:45.689> it<00:06:46.819> I'm<00:06:47.819> going<00:06:48.060> to<00:06:48.149> be<00:06:48.270> playing

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
rust behind it I'm going to be playing

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.329 
rust behind it I'm going to be playing
with<00:06:48.719> that<00:06:49.020> later<00:06:49.469> on<00:06:49.680> today<00:06:49.979> so<00:06:50.039> i'll

00:06:50.329 --> 00:06:50.339 
with that later on today so i'll

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.490 
with that later on today so i'll
probably<00:06:50.580> post<00:06:50.849> another<00:06:51.210> video<00:06:51.509> of<00:06:52.229> this

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
probably post another video of this

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.679 
probably post another video of this
technique<00:06:53.270> doing<00:06:54.270> it<00:06:54.449> with<00:06:54.629> paint<00:06:55.020> so<00:06:56.689> check

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689 
technique doing it with paint so check

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:01.639 
technique doing it with paint so check
back<00:06:57.949> thanks<00:06:58.949> for<00:06:59.099> watching
