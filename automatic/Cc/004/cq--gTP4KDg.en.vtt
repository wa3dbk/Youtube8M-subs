00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hey people i'm just trying mine 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.730
 So to do a high school diploma more or less 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.020
 and the closer my statements indented 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.309
 the more you concentrate 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.019
 somehow to school and to the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.849
 I teach but I think the younger one 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.830
 is the more likely sweatband from 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.379
 teach and you think about this 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.240
 and that and about everything except 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.740
 about the teaching material for that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 I once collected a few thoughts 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.920
 the students think so normally 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.820
 if you just need more things 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.260
 absolutely write me in the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.730
 comments and if by the idea 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:37.469
 you like what you can do 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:40.309
 and now have fun with the video only 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.309
 five minutes late 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.899
 I'm so tired 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.750

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.750

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.810
