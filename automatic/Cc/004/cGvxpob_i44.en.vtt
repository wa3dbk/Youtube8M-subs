it's<00:02:38.150> not<00:02:38.270> just<00:02:38.660> crazy<00:02:39.290> lines<00:02:39.650> everywhere<00:02:40.070> you

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
it's not just crazy lines everywhere you

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.920 
it's not just crazy lines everywhere you
can<00:02:40.820> see<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:41.150> really<00:02:41.330> starting<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.720> take

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
can see it's really starting to take

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.020 
can see it's really starting to take
more<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.260> cat<00:02:42.500> shape<00:02:42.830> what<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.490> did<00:02:43.760> was<00:02:43.940> I

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
more of a cat shape what I did was I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.090 
more of a cat shape what I did was I
just<00:02:44.090> took<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.570> same<00:02:44.840> brush<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.650> one<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:45.980> we

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
just took the same brush the one that we

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.520 
just took the same brush the one that we
used<00:02:46.310> with<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.580> dark<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.270> I<00:02:47.900> went<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.470> I

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
used with the dark and I went and I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.530 
used with the dark and I went and I
started<00:02:48.770> blending<00:02:49.160> everything<00:02:49.280> back<00:02:49.970> first

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
started blending everything back first

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.540 
started blending everything back first
and<00:02:50.870> then<00:02:51.320> where<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.800> a<00:02:51.830> harsh<00:02:52.190> line

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
and then where you have a harsh line

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.670 
and then where you have a harsh line
you're<00:02:53.240> going<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:53.720> take<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:54.050> little

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
you're going to just take that little

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.540 
you're going to just take that little
tip<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.430> brush<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.410> gently<00:02:57.410> blend<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.400> in

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
tip of the brush and gently blend it in

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.850 
tip of the brush and gently blend it in
to<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.209> light<00:02:59.420> line<00:02:59.660> we<00:03:00.290> want<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.830> just

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
to the light line we want it to just

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.210 
to the light line we want it to just
fade<00:03:01.489> into<00:03:01.760> as<00:03:02.180> opposed<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.870> really<00:03:03.110> being<00:03:03.739> one

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
fade into as opposed to really being one

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.210 
fade into as opposed to really being one
color<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.730> one<00:03:04.790> color<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:05.480> we're<00:03:06.470> going<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.739> go

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
color and one color so we're going to go

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.280 
color and one color so we're going to go
over<00:03:07.520> these<00:03:07.730> lines<00:03:08.090> here<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.870> we're<00:03:08.989> gonna<00:03:09.050> do

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
over these lines here and we're gonna do

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.630 
over these lines here and we're gonna do
that<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.470> little<00:03:09.680> bit<00:03:09.800> differently<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:10.489> now

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
that a little bit differently so now

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.580 
that a little bit differently so now
with<00:03:10.820> these<00:03:11.060> lines<00:03:11.390> what<00:03:11.600> we're<00:03:11.690> gonna<00:03:11.810> do<00:03:12.080> we

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
with these lines what we're gonna do we

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.260 
with these lines what we're gonna do we
don't<00:03:12.709> want<00:03:12.980> them<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.250> be<00:03:13.340> blended<00:03:13.730> inward<00:03:14.120> you

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
don't want them to be blended inward you

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.080 
don't want them to be blended inward you
want<00:03:14.480> these<00:03:14.810> lines<00:03:15.140> for<00:03:15.530> our<00:03:15.620> muzzle<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.700> be<00:03:16.880> a

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
want these lines for our muzzle to be a

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.540 
want these lines for our muzzle to be a
focal<00:03:17.600> point<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.110> this<00:03:18.440> part<00:03:18.800> of<00:03:18.920> our<00:03:19.040> muzzle

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
focal point so this part of our muzzle

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.430 
focal point so this part of our muzzle
is<00:03:19.670> going<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:19.970> really<00:03:20.150> stand<00:03:20.540> out<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:20.959> was

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
is going to really stand out that was

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.990 
is going to really stand out that was
the<00:03:21.530> whole<00:03:21.709> purpose<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.310> doing<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.700> lighter

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
the whole purpose of doing a lighter

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.720 
the whole purpose of doing a lighter
concealer<00:03:23.510> in<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.959> area<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:25.160> darker<00:03:25.580> one

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
concealer in that area and a darker one

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.670 
concealer in that area and a darker one
is<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.060> rim<00:03:26.300> because<00:03:26.959> we<00:03:27.110> want<00:03:27.320> it<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.530> give

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
is the rim because we want it to give

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.590 
is the rim because we want it to give
that<00:03:27.830> 3d<00:03:28.310> illusion<00:03:28.549> like<00:03:28.760> we're<00:03:29.030> really<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.299> cat

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
that 3d illusion like we're really a cat

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.630 
that 3d illusion like we're really a cat
so<00:03:30.200> we're<00:03:30.350> just<00:03:30.380> going<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.709> lightly<00:03:31.070> blend

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
so we're just going to lightly blend

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.420 
so we're just going to lightly blend
those<00:03:31.880> lines<00:03:32.269> outwards<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.620> tiny<00:03:34.010> tiny

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
those lines outwards just a tiny tiny

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.270 
those lines outwards just a tiny tiny
bit<00:03:34.610> again<00:03:35.390> take<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.110> feathered<00:03:36.680> edge<00:03:36.950> of

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
bit again take that feathered edge of

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.310 
bit again take that feathered edge of
your<00:03:37.760> blending<00:03:38.420> brush<00:03:38.450> or<00:03:38.870> whatever<00:03:38.930> brush

and lightly start blending those edge

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.110 
and lightly start blending those edge
lines<00:03:46.489> out<00:03:48.220> just<00:03:49.220> like<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.519> see<00:03:50.000> the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
lines out just like that see the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.750 
lines out just like that see the
difference<00:03:50.450> from<00:03:50.540> here<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.959> here<00:03:51.549> we<00:03:52.549> want

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
difference from here to here we want

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.280 
difference from here to here we want
just<00:03:52.910> a<00:03:52.970> little<00:03:53.000> bit<00:03:53.390> of<00:03:53.510> depth<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.989> little<00:03:54.200> bit

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
just a little bit of depth a little bit

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.240 
just a little bit of depth a little bit
of<00:03:54.410> shadow<00:03:56.320> so<00:03:57.320> go<00:03:57.440> ahead<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.829> do<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.010> same

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
of shadow so go ahead and do the same

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.400 
of shadow so go ahead and do the same
thing<00:03:58.579> on<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.880> other<00:03:58.910> side<00:03:59.180> so<00:03:59.959> once<00:04:00.170> you<00:04:00.290> have

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
thing on the other side so once you have

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.800 
thing on the other side so once you have
your<00:04:00.560> blending<00:04:01.070> done<00:04:01.280> let's<00:04:01.940> go<00:04:02.180> ahead<00:04:02.299> for

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
your blending done let's go ahead for

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.080 
your blending done let's go ahead for
our<00:04:02.959> next<00:04:03.200> step<00:04:03.410> by<00:04:04.070> the<00:04:04.130> way<00:04:04.310> leave<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:04.850> line

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
our next step by the way leave this line

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.670 
our next step by the way leave this line
completely<00:04:05.570> alone<00:04:06.019> for<00:04:06.320> now

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680
