00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
super Pershing is quite slow but it does

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.930 
super Pershing is quite slow but it does
get<00:00:48.930> preferential<00:00:49.289> matchmaking<00:00:49.590> which<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.520> lot

of the other actually all the new
premium<00:00:53.760> vehicles<00:00:54.360> don't<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.399> i'm<00:00:56.399> not

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
premium vehicles don't get and i'm not

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.080 
premium vehicles don't get and i'm not
sure<00:00:57.050> if<00:00:58.050> they're<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.649> changing<00:00:59.160> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
sure if they're going to be changing the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.750 
sure if they're going to be changing the
old<00:01:00.359> ones<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.680> full<00:01:01.949> matchmaking<00:01:02.399> but<00:01:02.670> if

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
old ones to have full matchmaking but if

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.429 
old ones to have full matchmaking but if
they<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.629> super<00:01:03.780> Pershing<00:01:04.049> would

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
they do the super Pershing would

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.719 
they do the super Pershing would
definitely<00:01:05.250> suffer<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.210> lot<00:01:06.860> unless<00:01:07.860> they<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
definitely suffer a lot unless they the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.670 
definitely suffer a lot unless they the
buff<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> cannon<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.630> least

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.620 

but<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.460> far<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.970> still<00:01:15.180> professional

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
but so far it's still professional

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
but so far it's still professional
matchmaking<00:01:16.050> is<00:01:16.320> still<00:01:16.500> got<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> same<00:01:16.890> cannon

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
matchmaking is still got the same cannon

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.060 
matchmaking is still got the same cannon
there<00:01:18.300> was<00:01:18.480> some<00:01:18.690> fiddling<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.440> frontal

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
there was some fiddling with the frontal

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.660 
there was some fiddling with the frontal
armor<00:01:20.750> but<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.380> still<00:01:22.770> seems<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.190> be<00:01:23.430> working

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
armor but it still seems to be working

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.020 
armor but it still seems to be working
as<00:01:24.030> intended<00:01:30.710> now<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:31.770> choosing<00:01:32.160> not<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.760> fire

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
as intended now I'm choosing not to fire

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.900 
as intended now I'm choosing not to fire
any<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> these<00:01:34.050> shots<00:01:34.229> even<00:01:34.560> though<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:35.820> know

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
any of these shots even though you know

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.609 
any of these shots even though you know
they're<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.270> exactly<00:01:36.420> great<00:01:37.050> shots<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.410> take

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
they're not exactly great shots to take

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.040 
they're not exactly great shots to take
but<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.890> wouldn't<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.340> fired<00:01:38.520> them<00:01:38.960> even<00:01:39.960> if

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
but I wouldn't have fired them even if

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.350 
but I wouldn't have fired them even if
they<00:01:40.170> were<00:01:40.229> good<00:01:40.530> shots<00:01:40.770> because<00:01:41.119> I'm<00:01:42.119> totally

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
they were good shots because I'm totally

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
they were good shots because I'm totally
exposed<00:01:42.900> on<00:01:43.080> this<00:01:43.229> hill<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.010> I<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> blast

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
exposed on this hill and I think a blast

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.190 
exposed on this hill and I think a blast
by<00:01:44.820> artillery<00:01:45.150> I<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.600> get<00:01:45.720> blasted<00:01:45.899> by

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
by artillery I can get blasted by

by artillery I can get blasted by

from the Traverse speed of this is

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.280 
from the Traverse speed of this is
refreshing<00:03:46.879> but<00:03:47.879> it<00:03:48.000> looks<00:03:48.180> like<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.540> k<00:03:48.840> 25

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
refreshing but it looks like that k 25

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.710 
refreshing but it looks like that k 25
is<00:03:50.250> he<00:03:50.430> I'm<00:03:50.640> gonna<00:03:50.790> keep<00:03:50.939> a<00:03:51.000> close<00:03:51.239> eye<00:03:51.390> on<00:03:51.420> him

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
t150 isn't exactly going to do too much

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.360 
t150 isn't exactly going to do too much
damage<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.389> me<00:04:09.690> compared<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.409> KT<00:04:10.680> front<00:04:11.159> so

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
damage to me compared to the KT front so

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.199 
damage to me compared to the KT front so
let's<00:04:11.549> take<00:04:11.760> out<00:04:11.940> as<00:04:12.980> many<00:04:13.980> guns<00:04:14.250> as<00:04:14.579> I<00:04:14.700> can<00:04:15.000> as

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
let's take out as many guns as I can as

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.270 
let's take out as many guns as I can as
fast<00:04:15.389> as<00:04:15.599> possible<00:04:15.659> here<00:04:16.260> comes<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.560> tiger<00:04:16.919> 12

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
fast as possible here comes a tiger 12

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:26.430 
fast as possible here comes a tiger 12
the<00:04:17.370> rest<00:04:17.579> he<00:04:17.760> was<00:04:17.940> wrong<00:04:18.859> come<00:04:19.859> on

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.560 

okay<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:27.830> there<00:04:28.190> we<00:04:28.310> go<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:28.699> also<00:04:29.449> I<00:04:29.479> should

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
okay and there we go and also I should

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.390 
okay and there we go and also I should
mention<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.259> kv-5<00:04:30.620> was<00:04:30.889> taken<00:04:31.220> up<00:04:31.370> by

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
mention that the kv-5 was taken up by

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.840 
mention that the kv-5 was taken up by
the<00:04:31.550> is<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:33.009> probably<00:04:34.009> an<00:04:34.340> artillery<00:04:34.820> shell

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
the is and probably an artillery shell

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:42.939 
the is and probably an artillery shell
as<00:04:35.210> well<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:36.020> way<00:04:41.169> which<00:04:42.169> was<00:04:42.350> very<00:04:42.500> lucky

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
as well the way which was very lucky

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.340 
as well the way which was very lucky
because<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.669> didn't<00:04:44.660> exactly<00:04:44.870> have<00:04:45.110> too<00:04:45.229> many

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
because I didn't exactly have too many

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.170 
because I didn't exactly have too many
places<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:45.830> escape<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:49.000> not<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.030> lot<00:04:50.120> of

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
places to escape to and not a lot of

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.520 
places to escape to and not a lot of
health<00:04:50.419> left<00:04:50.720> either<00:04:52.539> but<00:04:53.539> our<00:04:53.720> artillery<00:04:54.259> is

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
health left either but our artillery is

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:03.820 
health left either but our artillery is
doing<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.830> spectacular<00:04:55.669> job<00:04:55.699> so<00:04:56.180> far

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.640 

wait<00:05:04.830> for<00:05:05.870> what's<00:05:06.870> my<00:05:06.990> heavy<00:05:07.139> tanks<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.500> catch

up<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:07.949> i'm<00:05:08.190> going<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.400> start<00:05:08.550> barreling<00:05:09.150> down

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
up and i'm going to start barreling down

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.040 
up and i'm going to start barreling down
that<00:05:09.750> hill<00:05:09.960> it<00:05:10.199> and<00:05:10.949> as<00:05:11.460> fast<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.449> speed<00:05:12.750> as<00:05:12.900> I

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
that hill it and as fast of a speed as I

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.150 
that hill it and as fast of a speed as I
can<00:05:13.229> manage<00:05:13.740> in<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:13.979> super<00:05:14.310> Pershing<00:05:16.160> at

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
can manage in the super Pershing at

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.050 
can manage in the super Pershing at
least<00:05:17.370> it's<00:05:17.550> downhill

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.950 

here<00:05:25.780> we<00:05:26.050> go<00:05:26.730> no<00:05:27.730> tank<00:05:28.120> destroyers<00:05:28.510> left<00:05:28.780> on

here we go no tank destroyers left on
the<00:05:29.050> enemy<00:05:29.320> team<00:05:29.530> so<00:05:29.860> shouldn't<00:05:30.490> be<00:05:30.550> too<00:05:30.790> many

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730
