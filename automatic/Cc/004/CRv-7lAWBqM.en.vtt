order to solve that problem I can have

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.949 
order to solve that problem I can have
multiple<00:02:47.890> desktops<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.880> Linux<00:02:49.150> system<00:02:49.180> so

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
multiple desktops in a Linux system so

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.110 
multiple desktops in a Linux system so
if<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:50.319> want<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.680> switch<00:02:50.920> between<00:02:51.130> desktops<00:02:51.880> I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
if I want to switch between desktops I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.690 
if I want to switch between desktops I
can<00:02:52.540> simply<00:02:52.959> switch<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.680> them<00:02:53.860> with<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.250> simple

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
can simply switch to them with a simple

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.819 
can simply switch to them with a simple
keystroke<00:02:55.299> so<00:02:55.989> let's<00:02:56.200> move<00:02:56.410> some<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.680> these

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
keystroke so let's move some of these

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.740 
keystroke so let's move some of these
windows<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.430> different<00:02:57.790> spaces<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.599> will

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
windows to different spaces that will

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.080 
windows to different spaces that will
help<00:02:58.989> me<00:02:59.170> out<00:02:59.349> in<00:02:59.680> keeping<00:03:00.130> organized<00:03:00.760> and
