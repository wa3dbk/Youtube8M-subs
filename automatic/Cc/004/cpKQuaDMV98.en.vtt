for the other next step we're gonna
insert<00:00:31.109> our<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.679> bit<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.730> way<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.910> get<00:00:33.090> hot

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
insert our little bit the way to get hot

insert our little bit the way to get hot
glue<00:00:33.510> cleanly<00:00:34.140> into<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> hole<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
glue cleanly into a hole like this is to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.000 
glue cleanly into a hole like this is to
use<00:00:35.610> something<00:00:36.090> else<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.350> our<00:00:37.590> glue<00:00:37.829> on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
use something else so we get our glue on

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.319 
use something else so we get our glue on
here<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.579> stick<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> hole

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
here and we stick this in the hole

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.819 
here and we stick this in the hole
instead<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> trying<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> stick<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
instead of trying to stick that in the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.279 
instead of trying to stick that in the
hole<00:00:41.030> alright<00:00:42.030> here's<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:44.870> I<00:00:45.870> still

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
hole alright here's this one and I still

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.950 
hole alright here's this one and I still
make<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> mess<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.610> here's<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:49.850> and

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
make a mess and here's this one and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.290 
make a mess and here's this one and
that's<00:00:51.960> beautiful<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:53.340> before<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:54.030> cools

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that's beautiful and now before it cools

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.720 
that's beautiful and now before it cools
down<00:00:55.370> shove<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.640> thing<00:00:56.940> through<00:00:58.340> there<00:00:59.340> we

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
down shove this thing through there we

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.470 
down shove this thing through there we
go

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
go

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270

so now I have my tube in there and I can
stick<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.579> nozzle<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> squeeze<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.769> some

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
stick my nozzle in and squeeze in some

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.210 
stick my nozzle in and squeeze in some
hot<00:01:05.280> glue<00:01:06.470> it's<00:01:07.470> good<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.920> something

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
hot glue it's good to have something

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.910 
hot glue it's good to have something
handy<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.330> get<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> excess<00:01:10.200> hot<00:01:10.470> glue<00:01:10.710> off

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
handy to get all the excess hot glue off

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.950 
handy to get all the excess hot glue off
clearly<00:01:11.580> when<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.420> by<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.720> way

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
clearly when you do this by the way

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.810 
clearly when you do this by the way
you're<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.830> making<00:01:13.979> kind<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.580> mess

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
you're gonna be making kind of a mess

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.950 
you're gonna be making kind of a mess
and<00:01:15.060> you're<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.540> touch<00:01:15.750> up<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and you're gonna have to touch up the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.780 
and you're gonna have to touch up the
plane<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.770> gonna<00:01:16.920> pass<00:01:17.130> some<00:01:17.340> wire<00:01:17.549> through

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
plane I'm gonna pass some wire through

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.520 
plane I'm gonna pass some wire through
there<00:01:17.909> right<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:18.330> while<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.320> glue<00:01:19.500> is

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
there right now while the glue is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:28.990 
there right now while the glue is
liquidy<00:01:25.340> then<00:01:26.720> we<00:01:27.720> should<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.110> there

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
liquidy then we should be in there

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.370 
liquidy then we should be in there
around<00:01:30.000> your<00:01:30.210> rod<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.590> rub<00:01:32.009> off<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.220> hot<00:01:32.640> glue

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
around your rod and rub off the hot glue

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
around your rod and rub off the hot glue
all<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:35.369> I've<00:01:35.520> got<00:01:35.700> my<00:01:35.820> plastic<00:01:36.030> tube

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
all right now I've got my plastic tube

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.969 
all right now I've got my plastic tube
in<00:01:36.630> I've<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.170> hot<00:01:37.320> glued<00:01:37.560> at<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.740> end

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
in I've got it hot glued at the end

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.370 
in I've got it hot glued at the end
which<00:01:38.280> makes<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> whole<00:01:39.060> lot<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.600> solid

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
which makes it a whole lot more solid

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.410 
which makes it a whole lot more solid
this<00:01:40.560> does<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:40.950> move<00:01:41.220> around<00:01:41.369> any<00:01:41.790> more<00:01:42.090> right

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
this does not move around any more right

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.679 
this does not move around any more right
and<00:01:43.229> I'm<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.829> drill<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> hole<00:01:44.880> where<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and I'm going to drill a hole where the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.740 
and I'm going to drill a hole where the
wire<00:01:45.869> comes<00:01:45.899> through<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.860> each<00:01:47.189> piece<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.570> it's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
wire comes through on each piece so it's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.319 
wire comes through on each piece so it's
going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.229> right<00:01:49.770> there<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:52.790> have<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> slice

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
going to go right there I have to slice

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.010 
going to go right there I have to slice
this<00:01:54.630> down<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.619> level<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.020> foam

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
this down to be level with the foam

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.270 
this down to be level with the foam
around<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:59.369> so<00:02:00.030> I'm<00:02:00.360> careful<00:02:01.350> about<00:02:01.439> my<00:02:01.799> angle

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
around it so I'm careful about my angle

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.270 
around it so I'm careful about my angle
and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.090> come<00:02:03.329> back<00:02:03.540> from<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> other<00:02:04.110> side

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and then I come back from the other side

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.750 
and then I come back from the other side
at<00:02:06.090> my<00:02:06.240> 5/64<00:02:07.230> bit<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:10.640> way<00:02:11.640> you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
at my 5/64 bit and my little way you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.120 
at my 5/64 bit and my little way you
know<00:02:11.880> off<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> burrs<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:13.170> also<00:02:13.620> want<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.890> sand

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
know off the burrs I also want to sand

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.120 
know off the burrs I also want to sand
the<00:02:14.220> inside<00:02:14.340> side<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.880> these<00:02:15.000> giving<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:19.130> in

robbery just cut a piece off so that we
can<00:02:57.959> line<00:02:58.380> up<00:02:58.410> our<00:02:58.709> plates<00:02:58.980> when<00:02:59.220> we<00:02:59.340> glue<00:02:59.489> them

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
can line up our plates when we glue them

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.030 
can line up our plates when we glue them
on<00:03:01.100> you<00:03:02.100> pass<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.550> wire<00:03:02.700> through<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.000> plate

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
on you pass the wire through the plate

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.850 
on you pass the wire through the plate
we<00:03:05.040> put<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> plate<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.750> plane<00:03:06.959> put<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
we put the plate on the plane put the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.039 
we put the plate on the plane put the
plate<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.250> plane<00:03:08.430> put<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.330> plate<00:03:09.570> on<00:03:09.870> the

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
plate on the plane put the plate on the

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.100 
plate on the plane put the plate on the
plane<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.560> we<00:03:10.920> trace<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.810> we<00:03:12.900> can

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
plane and we trace it so that we can

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.310 
plane and we trace it so that we can
remove<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.769> paint<00:03:14.150> where<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.299> plate<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.959> and

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
remove the paint where the plate is and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.009 
remove the paint where the plate is and
then<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.950> glue<00:03:17.130> will<00:03:17.549> be<00:03:17.700> sticking<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
then the glue will be sticking to the

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.280 
then the glue will be sticking to the
styrofoam<00:03:19.920> instead<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.000> paint<00:03:21.299> as<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:22.200> all

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
styrofoam instead of the paint as we all

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.259 
styrofoam instead of the paint as we all
know<00:03:22.500> when<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.860> glue<00:03:23.040> stuff<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.370> paint<00:03:23.580> the

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
know when you glue stuff to paint the

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.750 
know when you glue stuff to paint the
paint<00:03:24.510> comes<00:03:24.720> off<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.989> plane<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:26.459> stuff

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
paint comes off the plane and the stuff

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.620 
paint comes off the plane and the stuff
you<00:03:26.940> glue<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.360> comes<00:03:27.870> off<00:03:28.080> with<00:03:28.470> it
