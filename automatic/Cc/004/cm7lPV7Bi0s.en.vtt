get my stealth chopper and I decided to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.080 
get my stealth chopper and I decided to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
go with the stealth chopper because it's

that<00:01:33.060> that's<00:01:33.270> still<00:01:33.600> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.439> i<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that that's still kind of what i like to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.429 
that that's still kind of what i like to
call<00:01:34.770> unobtainium<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.900> people<00:01:37.229> just

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
call unobtainium for on some people just

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.260 
call unobtainium for on some people just
because<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> very<00:01:38.700> difficult<00:01:38.909> kill

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
because it is a very difficult kill

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.899 
because it is a very difficult kill

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
streak to get for the average player and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
streak to get for the average player and
that<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> am<00:01:42.600> bar<00:01:43.409> none<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.799> an<00:01:43.950> average

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
call of duty player but here is the key

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.060 
call of duty player but here is the key
to<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:48.450> getting<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.470> killstreaks

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
to actually getting to your killstreaks

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.069 
to actually getting to your killstreaks
you<00:01:50.579> need<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> learn<00:01:50.909> how<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.149> stack<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:51.720> kill

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you need to learn how to stack your kill

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.240 
you need to learn how to stack your kill
streaks<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.439> what<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> mean<00:01:52.770> by<00:01:52.829> stacking

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
streaks and what I mean by stacking

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.649 
streaks and what I mean by stacking
killstreaks<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.299> what

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
killstreaks is you have to know what

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.469 
killstreaks is you have to know what
works<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.649> get<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.860> points<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.790> add<00:01:56.939> towards

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
works to get you points to add towards

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
works to get you points to add towards
your<00:01:57.600> next<00:01:57.719> kill<00:01:58.020> streak<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.500> there's<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.250> lot

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
your next kill streak now there's a lot

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580 
your next kill streak now there's a lot
of<00:01:59.549> ways<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.450> number<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.350> I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
of ways to do that number one is I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.069 
of ways to do that number one is I
always<00:02:01.979> run<00:02:02.250> UAV<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> UAV<00:02:03.689> gives<00:02:03.930> me

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
always run UAV because the UAV gives me

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.630 
always run UAV because the UAV gives me
about<00:02:04.229> ten<00:02:04.530> points<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:04.920> every<00:02:05.130> single<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.610> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
about ten points for every single one of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.580 
about ten points for every single one of
my<00:02:05.729> team<00:02:06.060> members<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.600> killed<00:02:06.899> now<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
my team members that's killed now the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.650 
my team members that's killed now the
reason<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> UAV<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> good<00:02:08.940> one<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.360> is

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
reason the UAV is a good one to have is

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.650 
reason the UAV is a good one to have is
because<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:11.489> gives<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.849> those<00:02:11.970> points<00:02:12.420> every

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
because it gives you those points every

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.530 
because it gives you those points every
time<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.840> kill

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
time a kill

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.869 
time a kill
but<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.930> only<00:02:14.170> way<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.769> I've<00:02:15.250> really<00:02:15.549> found

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
but the only way that I've really found

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.270 
but the only way that I've really found
that<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.180> works<00:02:16.439> extremely<00:02:17.439> well<00:02:17.739> as<00:02:18.069> if

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
that it works extremely well as if

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.709 
that it works extremely well as if
you're<00:02:18.400> playing<00:02:18.700> with<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.879> team<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.209> people<00:02:19.359> you

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
you're playing with a team of people you

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.300 
you're playing with a team of people you
know<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.709> reason<00:02:20.859> that<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.129> is<00:02:21.159> because

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
know and the reason that is is because

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.920 
know and the reason that is is because
if<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:21.819> play<00:02:22.030> with<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.239> team<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.540> people<00:02:22.629> you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
if you play with the team of people you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.869 
if you play with the team of people you
know<00:02:23.200> more<00:02:23.859> than<00:02:24.010> likely<00:02:24.219> they're<00:02:24.579> going<00:02:24.760> to

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
know more than likely they're going to

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.970 
know more than likely they're going to
be<00:02:24.969> getting<00:02:25.209> more<00:02:25.390> kills<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.379> actual

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
be getting more kills and a actual

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.309 
be getting more kills and a actual
better<00:02:27.219> team<00:02:27.640> score<00:02:28.150> per<00:02:28.359> minute<00:02:28.689> then<00:02:29.170> you

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
better team score per minute then you

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.390 
better team score per minute then you
would<00:02:29.530> be<00:02:29.560> if<00:02:29.769> you're<00:02:29.920> playing<00:02:30.129> by<00:02:30.280> yourself

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
would be if you're playing by yourself

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.759 
would be if you're playing by yourself
with<00:02:30.849> people<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.239> don't<00:02:31.390> know<00:02:31.769> because

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
with people that you don't know because

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.470 
with people that you don't know because
of<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.099> UAV<00:02:33.700> points<00:02:34.120> can<00:02:34.239> actually

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
of that the UAV points can actually

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.690 
of that the UAV points can actually
stack<00:02:34.780> up<00:02:34.959> quite<00:02:35.290> quickly<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.370> that's<00:02:36.549> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
stack up quite quickly so that's the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.160 
stack up quite quickly so that's the
first<00:02:36.939> one<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.329> want<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.840> run<00:02:38.019> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
first one that you want to run the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.569 
first one that you want to run the
second<00:02:38.590> one<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.829> you<00:02:38.980> want<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.159> run<00:02:39.400> is

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
second one that you want to run is

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.330 
second one that you want to run is
either<00:02:40.060> going<00:02:40.299> to<00:02:40.359> be<00:02:40.450> your<00:02:40.629> counter<00:02:41.109> UAV

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
either going to be your counter UAV

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.709 
either going to be your counter UAV
which<00:02:42.340> does<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.730> exact<00:02:43.030> same<00:02:43.060> thing<00:02:43.480> as<00:02:43.599> you

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
which does the exact same thing as you

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.319 
which does the exact same thing as you
avi<00:02:44.019> gets<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.409> points<00:02:44.650> or<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.819> want<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.060> run

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
avi gets you points or you want to run

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.479 
avi gets you points or you want to run
your<00:02:46.359> care<00:02:46.840> package<00:02:47.109> because<00:02:47.889> the<00:02:48.280> care

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
your care package because the care

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.490 
your care package because the care
package<00:02:48.909> casts<00:02:49.209> things<00:02:49.569> in<00:02:49.689> it<00:02:49.720> like<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.930> sentry

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
package casts things in it like a sentry

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.440 
package casts things in it like a sentry

gun a guardian another UAV an AGR you
know<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.659> can<00:02:55.780> have<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.139> lightning<00:02:56.650> strike<00:02:56.859> and

know it can have a lightning strike and

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.199 
know it can have a lightning strike and
it<00:02:57.159> can<00:02:57.280> have<00:02:57.400> all<00:02:57.579> these<00:02:57.700> things<00:02:57.939> you<00:02:58.150> either

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
strike up to the next kill streak which

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.009 
strike up to the next kill streak which
would<00:03:23.769> be<00:03:23.859> like<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.040> sentry<00:03:24.459> gun<00:03:24.669> AGR<00:03:25.299> or<00:03:25.510> even

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
would be like a sentry gun AGR or even

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.619 
would be like a sentry gun AGR or even
your<00:03:26.109> stealth<00:03:26.500> chopper<00:03:26.949> is<00:03:27.099> like<00:03:27.790> 300<00:03:28.479> points

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
your stealth chopper is like 300 points

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.319 
your stealth chopper is like 300 points
and<00:03:28.810> that's<00:03:28.930> only<00:03:29.109> three<00:03:29.470> kills<00:03:29.799> so<00:03:30.519> it's<00:03:31.090> not

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
and that's only three kills so it's not

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.869 
and that's only three kills so it's not
really<00:03:31.659> that<00:03:31.780> difficult<00:03:32.079> so<00:03:32.500> my<00:03:33.489> suggestion

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
really that difficult so my suggestion

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.449 
really that difficult so my suggestion
is<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.120> run<00:03:34.419> a<00:03:34.449> UAV<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:35.229> counter<00:03:35.680> UAV<00:03:35.829> and<00:03:36.129> then

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
is to run a UAV a counter UAV and then

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.740 
is to run a UAV a counter UAV and then
you're<00:03:36.579> bigger<00:03:36.790> package<00:03:37.090> whether<00:03:37.449> that's<00:03:37.659> a

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
you're bigger package whether that's a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.189 
you're bigger package whether that's a
stealth<00:03:38.019> chopper<00:03:38.500> or<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:39.299> AGR<00:03:40.299> or<00:03:40.569> a<00:03:40.599> sentry<00:03:41.019> gun

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
stealth chopper or a AGR or a sentry gun

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.409 
stealth chopper or a AGR or a sentry gun
or<00:03:41.379> whatever<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.829> is<00:03:41.889> you<00:03:42.040> want<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.310> get<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.729> use

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
or whatever it is you want to get to use

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.319 
or whatever it is you want to get to use
those<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:44.049> counter<00:03:44.709> UAV<00:03:44.919> our<00:03:45.549> UAV<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.060> counter

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
those to counter UAV our UAV and counter

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.599 
those to counter UAV our UAV and counter
UAV<00:03:46.479> first<00:03:47.139> and<00:03:47.409> that<00:03:47.709> allows<00:03:47.949> your<00:03:48.159> points<00:03:48.459> to

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
UAV first and that allows your points to

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.610 
UAV first and that allows your points to
stack<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.209> not<00:03:49.329> only<00:03:49.389> that<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:49.659> be<00:03:50.409> sure<00:03:50.440> to

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
stack and not only that but be sure to

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.990 
stack and not only that but be sure to
collect<00:03:50.829> your<00:03:51.040> tags<00:03:51.340> because<00:03:51.579> every<00:03:51.819> time<00:03:51.849> you

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
collect your tags because every time you

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000 
collect your tags because every time you
collect<00:03:52.239> that<00:03:52.510> tag<00:03:52.840> you're<00:03:53.379> getting<00:03:53.650> points

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
collect that tag you're getting points

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.170 
collect that tag you're getting points
for<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.280> you're<00:03:54.549> getting<00:03:54.639> points<00:03:55.000> for<00:03:55.120> your

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
for that you're getting points for your

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.539 
for that you're getting points for your
kills<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:55.780> then<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.260> tags<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:57.099> can<00:03:57.220> see<00:03:57.340> here

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
kills and then the tags you can see here

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.740 
kills and then the tags you can see here
I<00:03:57.579> kind<00:03:57.909> of<00:03:57.939> got<00:03:58.090> into<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.299> little<00:03:58.449> bit<00:03:58.599> of<00:03:58.629> a

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
I kind of got into a little bit of a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.240 
I kind of got into a little bit of a
spawn<00:03:59.049> trap<00:03:59.349> there<00:03:59.530> with<00:03:59.650> these<00:03:59.769> people<00:04:00.099> work

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
spawn trap there with these people work

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.240 
spawn trap there with these people work
and<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:01.419> worked<00:04:01.629> out<00:04:01.780> for<00:04:02.049> me<00:04:02.109> but<00:04:02.889> and<00:04:03.159> you're

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
and it worked out for me but and you're

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.949 
and it worked out for me but and you're
going<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.430> see<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:03.639> same<00:04:04.090> exact<00:04:04.479> corridor

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
going to see that same exact corridor

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.719 
going to see that same exact corridor
here<00:04:05.139> on<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.379> map<00:04:05.530> grind<00:04:05.979> is<00:04:06.220> where<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.430> get<00:04:06.549> my

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
here on the map grind is where I get my

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.159 
here on the map grind is where I get my
stealth<00:04:07.120> chopper<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.569> little<00:04:07.810> bit<00:04:07.930> in<00:04:08.049> this

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
stealth chopper a little bit in this

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.719 
stealth chopper a little bit in this
later<00:04:08.709> on<00:04:08.859> in<00:04:08.949> this<00:04:09.010> video<00:04:09.159> because<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.579> can

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
later on in this video because I can

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:14.520 
later on in this video because I can
tell<00:04:09.939> that<00:04:09.970> they're<00:04:10.269> more<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.989> noob<00:04:13.530> not

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
tell that they're more of a noob not

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.620 
tell that they're more of a noob not
clan<00:04:14.919> but<00:04:15.159> just<00:04:15.340> but<00:04:15.669> more<00:04:15.939> of<00:04:16.060> more<00:04:16.389> new

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
clan but just but more of more new

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.149 
clan but just but more of more new
players<00:04:17.049> so<00:04:17.259> they<00:04:17.380> don't<00:04:17.530> understand<00:04:17.949> they

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
players so they don't understand they

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:19.499 
players so they don't understand they
shouldn't<00:04:18.430> just<00:04:18.579> conglomerate<00:04:19.150> together

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
shouldn't just conglomerate together

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.909 
shouldn't just conglomerate together
because<00:04:20.109> if<00:04:20.199> you<00:04:20.259> can<00:04:20.409> collaborate<00:04:20.739> together

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
because if you can collaborate together

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.500 
because if you can collaborate together
more<00:04:21.280> likely<00:04:21.669> you're<00:04:21.820> all<00:04:22.000> going<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.389> get

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
more likely you're all going to get

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.760 
more likely you're all going to get
killed<00:04:22.719> and<00:04:22.900> they<00:04:22.990> don't<00:04:23.080> really<00:04:23.289> understand

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
killed and they don't really understand

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.160 
killed and they don't really understand
that<00:04:23.950> again<00:04:24.820> another<00:04:25.060> good<00:04:25.300> reason<00:04:25.419> to

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
that again another good reason to

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.400 
that again another good reason to
play<00:04:26.470> with<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.650> team<00:04:26.920> but<00:04:27.190> yeah<00:04:27.910> definitely<00:04:28.750> UAV

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
play with a team but yeah definitely UAV

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.530 
play with a team but yeah definitely UAV
counter<00:04:29.860> UAV<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.400> then<00:04:30.670> your<00:04:30.790> big<00:04:30.940> streak<00:04:31.330> and

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
counter UAV and then your big streak and

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.480 
counter UAV and then your big streak and
then<00:04:31.870> collect<00:04:32.530> your<00:04:32.620> tags<00:04:32.950> when<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.250> kill

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
then collect your tags when you kill

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.370 
then collect your tags when you kill
someone<00:04:33.760> if<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.180> can<00:04:34.450> if<00:04:34.630> you're<00:04:34.720> if<00:04:35.230> you're

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
someone if you can if you're if you're

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.870 
someone if you can if you're if you're
like<00:04:35.650> hitting<00:04:35.920> them<00:04:36.010> across<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.400> map<00:04:36.580> don't

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
like hitting them across the map don't

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.740 
like hitting them across the map don't
worry<00:04:37.030> about<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.270> like<00:04:37.360> one<00:04:37.540> of<00:04:37.570> your

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
worry about it like one of your

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.240 
worry about it like one of your
teammates<00:04:38.080> that<00:04:38.320> is<00:04:38.440> rushing<00:04:38.860> around<00:04:38.950> get

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
teammates that is rushing around get

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.890 
teammates that is rushing around get
that<00:04:39.400> tag<00:04:39.640> because<00:04:39.820> you<00:04:40.300> still<00:04:40.510> get<00:04:40.630> points

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
that tag because you still get points

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.540 
that tag because you still get points
for<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.080> too<00:04:41.320> just<00:04:41.500> not<00:04:41.650> not<00:04:41.980> as<00:04:42.100> many<00:04:42.250> points

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
for that too just not not as many points

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.410 
for that too just not not as many points
but<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:43.420> trust<00:04:44.050> me<00:04:44.260> within<00:04:44.670> 15<00:04:45.670> to<00:04:45.700> 20<00:04:46.120> kills

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
but you trust me within 15 to 20 kills

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.180 
but you trust me within 15 to 20 kills
which<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:46.990> not<00:04:47.290> that<00:04:47.470> difficult<00:04:47.740> for<00:04:48.130> an

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
which is not that difficult for an

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
average player to get if you're
