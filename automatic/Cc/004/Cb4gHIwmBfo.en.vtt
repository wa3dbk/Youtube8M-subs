 in order to absorb fat after 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.770
 roasted eggplant and so proceed to at 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.379
 which is peeled and cut here 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.520
 such thick plastics should not

 exceed 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.850
 half a centimeter and definitely need them

 salt and leave for a couple of minutes for 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.729
 so that the eggplant went out to the sea 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.520
 remove seed pods and cut into 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.869

 about two tablespoons of mayonnaise 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:33.090
 we squeezed the eggplants through the garlic press 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.540
 roasting eggplant is a must 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.540
 put on a paper towel to 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.399
 absorbed excess oil since excess 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.460
 oils can ruin the taste of our entire 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.890

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.150
 way we lay out in a platter with grated 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.410
 Parmesan and we will need it 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.079

 Italy and I like it very much 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.990

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.590
 from eggplant which is called teschin 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.590
 tongue 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.920
 but because of the presence of parmesan and 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.040
 basil this dish becomes a hundred 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.620
 percent Italian it is served as 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.700
