bolts on the bottom I got two oats so
far<00:00:17.600> I'm<00:00:18.600> using<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:20.600> with<00:00:21.600> an<00:00:21.750> extension<00:00:22.369> and

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
far I'm using this with an extension and

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.890 
far I'm using this with an extension and
I<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.980> go<00:00:26.130> in<00:00:26.340> through<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> bottom<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
I have to go in through the bottom and I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.050 
I have to go in through the bottom and I
just<00:00:27.930> got<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.470> little<00:00:28.740> tiny<00:00:29.130> space<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.910> work

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
just got that little tiny space to work

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.790 
just got that little tiny space to work
with<00:00:30.710> but<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:32.669> coming<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:33.090> tonight<00:00:33.649> hell<00:00:34.649> or

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
with but it's coming out tonight hell or

00:00:34.800 --> 00:01:22.059 
with but it's coming out tonight hell or
high<00:00:35.010> water<00:00:46.430> almost<00:00:47.430> there

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:59.550 

well<00:01:23.069> it's<00:01:23.189> loose<00:01:35.509> with<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> old

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:08.330 

the<00:02:00.520> new<00:02:00.670> one<00:02:00.910> has<00:02:01.150> a<00:02:01.180> smaller<00:02:02.970> spindle<00:02:03.970> pulley

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.160 

so<00:02:09.340> it's<00:02:09.460> gonna<00:02:09.610> spin<00:02:09.940> faster<00:02:10.420> that's<00:02:10.990> where

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
so it's gonna spin faster that's where

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.790 
so it's gonna spin faster that's where
you<00:02:11.260> get<00:02:11.380> your<00:02:12.990> higher<00:02:13.990> output<00:02:14.260> at<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.620> lower

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
you get your higher output at a lower

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:31.759 
you get your higher output at a lower
rpm

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.179 

what

watch this is my way all right
I'm<00:03:20.560> tightening<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:23.650> positive<00:03:24.280> down

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.710 

I'm<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.530> alternator<00:03:30.040> now<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.419> the<00:03:34.599> new

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
I'm the alternator now this is the new

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.009 
I'm the alternator now this is the new
one<00:03:35.639> you<00:03:36.639> know<00:03:36.729> if<00:03:36.879> you<00:03:36.970> can<00:03:37.180> see<00:03:37.449> because<00:03:37.900> I

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
have my box and stuff in the trunk I

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.589 
have my box and stuff in the trunk I
don't<00:03:41.769> feel<00:03:42.099> like<00:03:42.280> spending<00:03:42.579> all<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.970> time<00:03:43.000> to

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
don't feel like spending all the time to

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.569 
don't feel like spending all the time to
get<00:03:43.780> into<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.440> batteries<00:03:44.919> to<00:03:45.129> unhook<00:03:45.400> my

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
get into the batteries to unhook my

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.050 
get into the batteries to unhook my
batteries<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.620> this<00:03:47.889> is<00:03:48.159> still<00:03:48.430> positively

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
batteries so this is still positively

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.259 
batteries so this is still positively
charged<00:03:50.099> so<00:03:51.099> I<00:03:51.430> took<00:03:51.489> some<00:03:52.060> black<00:03:52.840> tape<00:03:53.260> and

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
charged so I took some black tape and

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.729 
charged so I took some black tape and
wrapped<00:03:55.269> it<00:03:55.479> around<00:03:55.540> all<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.169> tools<00:03:56.440> that<00:03:56.560> I'm

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
wrapped it around all the tools that I'm

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.250 
wrapped it around all the tools that I'm
using<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:57.190> are<00:03:57.310> gonna<00:03:57.400> be<00:03:57.609> touching<00:03:58.260> this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
using that are gonna be touching this

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.589 
using that are gonna be touching this
positive<00:03:59.949> lead<00:04:01.199> I<00:04:03.060> thought<00:04:04.060> I'd<00:04:04.180> be<00:04:04.329> able<00:04:04.419> to

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
positive lead I thought I'd be able to

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.890 
positive lead I thought I'd be able to
do<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:04.959> before<00:04:05.379> but<00:04:05.940> it's<00:04:06.940> gonna<00:04:07.180> touch<00:04:07.510> and

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
do it before but it's gonna touch and

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.229 
do it before but it's gonna touch and
it's<00:04:08.079> gonna<00:04:08.290> spark<00:04:08.709> if<00:04:08.979> you<00:04:09.519> choose<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.819> do<00:04:10.120> it

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
it's gonna spark if you choose to do it

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.150 
it's gonna spark if you choose to do it
this<00:04:10.389> way<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:12.010> this<00:04:12.849> is<00:04:13.000> what<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.180> got<00:04:13.419> so<00:04:13.449> far

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.670 

all<00:04:17.730> right<00:04:17.940> she's<00:04:18.690> in<00:04:19.070> new<00:04:20.070> alternator<00:04:20.520> is<00:04:20.790> in

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
all right she's in new alternator is in

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.010 
all right she's in new alternator is in
everything<00:04:22.680> sucked<00:04:23.070> up<00:04:23.480> took<00:04:24.480> me<00:04:24.630> about<00:04:24.780> two

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
everything sucked up took me about two

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.010 
everything sucked up took me about two
hours<00:04:26.120> but<00:04:27.120> if<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.330> had<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.510> do<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.750> again<00:04:27.840> I

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
hours but if I had to do it again I

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.270 
hours but if I had to do it again I
could<00:04:28.260> probably<00:04:28.410> do<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:28.770> an<00:04:28.860> hour<00:04:28.920> because

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
could probably do it in an hour because

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.740 
could probably do it in an hour because
they<00:04:29.490> know<00:04:29.580> how<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:29.730> do<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.090> no<00:04:32.150> yeah<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.570> wasn't

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
they know how to do it no yeah so wasn't

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.030 
they know how to do it no yeah so wasn't
too<00:04:33.990> bad<00:04:34.200> I<00:04:34.860> just<00:04:35.190> needed<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.640> few<00:04:35.820> tools
