all<00:00:01.890> right<00:00:02.070> what<00:00:02.250> we<00:00:02.370> found<00:00:02.610> was<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.689> cabling

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
all right what we found was the cabling

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.410 
all right what we found was the cabling
system<00:00:04.620> is<00:00:05.549> broken<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:07.490> the<00:00:08.490> way<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.940> which<00:00:09.150> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
system is broken and the way in which to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.810 
system is broken and the way in which to
repair<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.429> we<00:00:11.429> went<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.000> got<00:00:12.349> cast

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
repair it is we went and got cast

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.010 
repair it is we went and got cast
eyebolts<00:00:16.279> larger-diameter<00:00:17.690> because<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.840> had

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
eyebolts larger-diameter because we had

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.910 
eyebolts larger-diameter because we had
one<00:00:19.230> snap<00:00:19.619> off<00:00:20.720> which<00:00:21.720> completely<00:00:22.320> broke<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
one snap off which completely broke the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.279 
one snap off which completely broke the
cable<00:00:23.130> that's<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:28.740> we've<00:00:29.480> drilled<00:00:30.480> now<00:00:30.779> we

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
cable that's so so we've drilled now we

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.549 
cable that's so so we've drilled now we
got<00:00:31.439> larger<00:00:31.830> ones<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.940> need<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.510> length<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
got larger ones we need the length and a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.830 
got larger ones we need the length and a
lock<00:00:34.739> washer<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.030> able<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> adjust<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
lock washer to be able to adjust the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.729 
lock washer to be able to adjust the
tension<00:00:37.190> when<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.280> put<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.700> back<00:00:38.850> together

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
tension when we put it all back together

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.410 
tension when we put it all back together
now<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> other<00:00:41.160> thing<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.730> you're<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
now the other thing is you're going to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.490 
now the other thing is you're going to
need<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.840> know<00:00:42.989> how<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.649> system<00:00:43.920> works<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
need to know how this system works and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.060 
need to know how this system works and
these<00:00:46.500> tubes<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.450> are<00:00:48.710> on<00:00:49.710> all

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
these tubes that you see here are on all

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.170 
these tubes that you see here are on all
four<00:00:50.730> posts<00:00:52.039> okay<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:54.440> you'll<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:56.030> over<00:00:57.030> here

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
four posts okay and you'll see over here

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.160 
four posts okay and you'll see over here
a<00:00:57.449> better<00:00:57.890> view<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.629> that<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:02.250> cables

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
a better view of it that the cables

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.090 
a better view of it that the cables
themselves<00:01:06.350> come<00:01:07.350> over

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
themselves come over

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:19.320 
themselves come over
and<00:01:09.700> they<00:01:10.450> have<00:01:10.720> a<00:01:17.520> hard<00:01:18.520> time<00:01:18.610> getting<00:01:18.910> us<00:01:19.120> off

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
and they have a hard time getting us off

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.260 
and they have a hard time getting us off
you'll<00:01:20.050> see<00:01:20.260> it<00:01:20.380> has<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.890> swedge<00:01:21.370> end<00:01:21.820> on<00:01:22.060> it

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
you'll see it has a swedge end on it

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.609 
you'll see it has a swedge end on it
inside<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:23.290> little<00:01:23.500> square<00:01:23.860> box<00:01:24.300> okay<00:01:25.619> then

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
inside this little square box okay then

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.800 
inside this little square box okay then
that<00:01:26.830> square<00:01:27.190> box<00:01:27.750> actually<00:01:28.920> slides<00:01:30.810> inside

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
that square box actually slides inside

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:44.010 
that square box actually slides inside
this<00:01:32.110> tube<00:01:41.640> will<00:01:42.640> keep<00:01:42.850> sliding<00:01:43.300> it<00:01:43.390> down<00:01:43.420> and

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
this tube will keep sliding it down and

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.290 
this tube will keep sliding it down and
then<00:01:44.710> what<00:01:44.860> occurs<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:46.990> large<00:01:47.259> spring

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
then what occurs is this large spring

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.710 
then what occurs is this large spring
it's<00:01:49.300> not<00:01:49.509> it's<00:01:50.229> just<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.740> flexible<00:01:51.280> item<00:01:51.720> it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
it's not it's just a flexible item it

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.820 
it's not it's just a flexible item it
slides<00:01:53.050> up<00:01:53.350> inside<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.630> lifting<00:01:56.350> columns

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
slides up inside the lifting columns

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.100 
slides up inside the lifting columns
themselves<00:01:58.110> okay<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:02.640> once<00:02:03.640> you've

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
themselves okay and then once you've

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.210 
themselves okay and then once you've
threaded<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.380> all<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.619> way<00:02:05.710> up<00:02:05.860> into<00:02:06.100> the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
threaded it all the way up into the

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.070 
threaded it all the way up into the
column<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:08.250> what<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.369> does<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.090> pushes<00:02:10.420> on

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
column so what it does is it pushes on

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.890 
column so what it does is it pushes on
the<00:02:11.830> column<00:02:14.519> with<00:02:15.519> this<00:02:15.790> piece<00:02:16.290> riding<00:02:17.290> inside

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the column with this piece riding inside

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.310 
the column with this piece riding inside
like<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:21.519> cable<00:02:21.970> will<00:02:22.180> come<00:02:22.900> all<00:02:23.200> the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
like that the cable will come all the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.009 
like that the cable will come all the
way<00:02:23.410> down<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> end<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.690> then<00:02:25.690> as<00:02:25.840> you

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
way down to the end and then as you

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.229 
way down to the end and then as you
crank<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:27.310> cable<00:02:27.730> will<00:02:27.910> push<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:29.320> rod<00:02:30.239> flex

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
crank the cable will push this rod flex

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.210 
crank the cable will push this rod flex
rod<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:32.130> pushing<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.880> column<00:02:34.329> up<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:36.100> that's

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
rod up pushing the column up so that's

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.240 
rod up pushing the column up so that's
how<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.489> assembly<00:02:36.850> actually<00:02:37.390> works<00:02:37.660> now<00:02:38.250> we

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
how the assembly actually works now we

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.870 
how the assembly actually works now we
just<00:02:39.579> need<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:40.000> proceed<00:02:41.010> by<00:02:42.010> reassembling

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
just need to proceed by reassembling

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.930 
just need to proceed by reassembling
everything<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.260> again<00:02:47.500> our<00:02:47.650> next<00:02:47.980> segment<00:02:48.730> is

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
everything so again our next segment is

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.390 
everything so again our next segment is
to<00:02:49.269> rebuild<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.290> then<00:02:51.130> we're<00:02:51.250> going<00:02:51.340> to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
to rebuild this and then we're going to

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.270 
to rebuild this and then we're going to
swedge<00:02:51.790> all<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.510> cables<00:02:52.959> onto<00:02:53.410> our<00:02:54.130> new

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
swedge all the cables onto our new

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.350 
swedge all the cables onto our new
eyelets<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:55.320> then<00:02:56.320> we're<00:02:56.470> going<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.620> grease

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
eyelets and then we're going to grease

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.229 
eyelets and then we're going to grease
all<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.420> our<00:02:58.799> Springs<00:02:59.799> which<00:03:00.489> are<00:03:00.670> pushing<00:03:00.940> up

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
all of our Springs which are pushing up

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.870 
all of our Springs which are pushing up
on<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.810> columns<00:03:02.200> themselves<00:03:02.769> make<00:03:03.640> sure<00:03:03.790> that

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
on the columns themselves make sure that

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.390 
on the columns themselves make sure that
they<00:03:04.060> slide<00:03:04.329> real<00:03:04.720> nice<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.140> easy<00:03:05.400> we're

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
they slide real nice and easy we're

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.630 
they slide real nice and easy we're
going<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.579> lube<00:03:07.030> all<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.570> our<00:03:07.780> pulleys<00:03:08.739> which

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
going to lube all of our pulleys which

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.080 
going to lube all of our pulleys which
you<00:03:09.790> see<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.090> pulleys<00:03:10.450> in<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.660> corner

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
you see the pulleys in the corner

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.780 
you see the pulleys in the corner
and<00:03:13.970> after<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.800> we<00:03:16.800> should<00:03:16.860> have<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> working

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
and after that we should have a working

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.839 
and after that we should have a working
unit<00:03:18.120> again<00:03:18.360> all<00:03:19.020> and<00:03:19.470> make<00:03:19.770> sure<00:03:20.010> we<00:03:20.489> had<00:03:20.700> an

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
unit again all and make sure we had an
