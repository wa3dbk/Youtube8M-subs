and hello this is mr. cognito here and
I'm<00:00:07.529> going<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.770> be<00:00:07.950> showing<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.370> guys<00:00:08.429> a

I'm going to be showing you guys a

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.850 
I'm going to be showing you guys a
special<00:00:09.210> siren<00:00:10.139> bill<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.590> i<00:00:10.620> have

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
special siren bill that i have

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
special siren bill that i have
custom-made<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.840> some<00:00:13.139> very<00:00:13.799> high<00:00:14.130> damaging

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
custom-made it's some very high damaging

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.570 
custom-made it's some very high damaging
dps<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.929> it's<00:00:16.770> very<00:00:16.980> good<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.250> co-op

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
dps and it's very good in co-op

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.960 
dps and it's very good in co-op
situations<00:00:18.240> as<00:00:18.480> well<00:00:18.830> so<00:00:19.830> we're<00:00:20.699> gonna<00:00:20.789> go

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
situations as well so we're gonna go

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.269 
situations as well so we're gonna go
left<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.330> right<00:00:21.359> first<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.830> motions

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
left to right first we have the motions

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.509 
left to right first we have the motions
skill<00:00:23.609> tree<00:00:23.789> I've<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:25.019> don't<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.160> motion

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
skill tree I've I don't think the motion

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.670 
skill tree I've I don't think the motion
skill<00:00:26.699> tree<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.090> useful<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.750> only<00:00:28.289> skill

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
skill tree is that useful the only skill

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.099 
skill tree is that useful the only skill
in<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.189> motion<00:00:30.150> skill<00:00:30.359> tree<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:31.019> is

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
in the motion skill tree that I think is

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.770 
in the motion skill tree that I think is
very<00:00:31.470> useful<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.250> definitely<00:00:33.120> subsequence

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
very useful is definitely subsequence

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.549 
very useful is definitely subsequence
what<00:00:34.680> subsequence<00:00:35.370> does<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.260> phase

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
what subsequence does is a if you phase

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.310 
what subsequence does is a if you phase
on<00:00:37.739> someone<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.370> then<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.910> kill<00:00:39.180> them<00:00:39.360> then

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
on someone and then you kill them then

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.660 
on someone and then you kill them then
it<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.309> Sikhs<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.360> another<00:00:42.629> target<00:00:43.670> like

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it can a Sikhs have another target like

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.029 
it can a Sikhs have another target like
by<00:00:44.969> chance<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.260> level<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
by chance but if you level it all the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.860 
by chance but if you level it all the
way<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.340> it's<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.539> hundred<00:00:48.780> percent

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
way up it's a it's a hundred percent

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.020 
way up it's a it's a hundred percent
chance<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.160> kill<00:00:50.340> someone<00:00:50.550> with<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
chance so if you kill someone with it it

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.959 
chance so if you kill someone with it it
phase<00:00:51.390> locks<00:00:51.600> another<00:00:51.870> guy<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.829> overall<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
phase locks another guy but overall the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.510 
phase locks another guy but overall the
skills<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.660> cataclysm<00:00:55.289> treat<00:00:55.500> much<00:00:56.129> more

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
skills and the cataclysm treat much more

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.720 
skills and the cataclysm treat much more
much<00:00:57.420> more<00:00:57.570> useful<00:00:57.750> compared<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.680> compared<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
much more useful compared to compared to

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
much more useful compared to compared to
the<00:00:59.850> subsequence<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.870> getting<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.260> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the subsequence just getting to this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
the subsequence just getting to this
because<00:01:02.100> these<00:01:02.280> skills<00:01:02.609> aren't<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.000> good

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
because these skills aren't that good

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.770 
because these skills aren't that good
maybe<00:01:04.049> some<00:01:04.439> suspension<00:01:05.420> but<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.510> wouldn't

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
maybe some suspension but I wouldn't

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.500 
maybe some suspension but I wouldn't
waste<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:06.990> skill<00:01:07.229> points<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.680> getting<00:01:08.310> there

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
waste my skill points on getting there

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
waste my skill points on getting there
so<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.229> got<00:01:10.530> word<00:01:10.830> improves

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
so first of all we got word improves

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.710 
so first of all we got word improves
your<00:01:11.460> shield<00:01:11.760> capacity<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.420> shields

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
your shield capacity and shields

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.740 
your shield capacity and shields
recharge<00:01:13.170> delay<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.939> this<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.030> pretty<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
recharge delay and this is pretty you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.410 
recharge delay and this is pretty you
know<00:01:15.780> pretty<00:01:16.170> basic<00:01:16.920> skill<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.729> know<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
know pretty basic skill you know you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.490 
know pretty basic skill you know you
might<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.200> at<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> beginning

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
might want to get this at the beginning

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
might want to get this at the beginning
and<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.610> soon<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.939> hit<00:01:21.090> 31<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.780> might

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and then as soon as you hit 31 you might

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.760 
and then as soon as you hit 31 you might
want<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.290> order<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.860> Cataclysm<00:01:23.490> tree<00:01:24.350> just<00:01:25.350> do

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
want to order the Cataclysm tree just do

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.950 
want to order the Cataclysm tree just do
do<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> all<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> way<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> 31<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.810> can

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
do it all the way because the 31 you can

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080 
do it all the way because the 31 you can
get<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> ruin<00:01:28.409> skill<00:01:28.680> which<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.460> extremely

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
get the ruin skill which is extremely

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
get the ruin skill which is extremely
useful<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.930> I'll<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.259> later<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
useful but I'll get to that later in the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.340 
useful but I'll get to that later in the
Harmony<00:01:33.000> tree<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> sweet<00:01:34.320> release

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
Harmony tree we have the sweet release

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.910 
Harmony tree we have the sweet release
skill<00:01:35.450> what<00:01:36.450> sweet<00:01:36.689> release<00:01:36.930> does<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> if

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
skill what sweet release does is that if

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.380 
skill what sweet release does is that if
you<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.100> someone<00:01:38.490> phase<00:01:38.759> locked<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.240> you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
you have someone phase locked and you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
you have someone phase locked and you
kill<00:01:39.600> them<00:01:39.750> these<00:01:40.590> life<00:01:41.009> warps<00:01:41.340> come<00:01:41.549> out<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
kill them these life warps come out and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.190 
kill them these life warps come out and
they<00:01:42.240> heal<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> online<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.299> if<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.630> level<00:01:46.049> it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
they heal you online and if you level it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.990 
they heal you online and if you level it
up<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.920> level<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> skill<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.490> all<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> way

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
up if you level to skill up all the way

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.830 
up if you level to skill up all the way
then<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:49.470> create<00:01:50.100> five<00:01:50.520> life<00:01:50.880> works<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.509> each

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
then you create five life works and each

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.450 
then you create five life works and each
light<00:01:52.140> board<00:01:52.380> restores<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> fifteen

light board restores up to fifteen

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.639 
light board restores up to fifteen
