00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
sony claims is that allows it to be a

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.710 
sony claims is that allows it to be a
much<00:00:27.220> much<00:00:27.400> faster<00:00:27.699> camera<00:00:28.300> than<00:00:28.480> even<00:00:28.689> some

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
much much faster camera than even some

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.710 
much much faster camera than even some
digital<00:00:29.289> SLRs<00:00:29.800> can<00:00:29.980> be<00:00:30.100> now<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.060> to<00:00:31.300> that<00:00:31.420> point

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
digital SLRs can be now to to that point

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.430 
digital SLRs can be now to to that point
the<00:00:32.320> a77<00:00:33.010> can<00:00:33.670> perform<00:00:33.970> 12<00:00:34.269> frames<00:00:34.750> per<00:00:35.080> second

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
the a77 can perform 12 frames per second

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.229 
the a77 can perform 12 frames per second
and<00:00:35.620> that<00:00:36.129> becomes<00:00:36.370> even<00:00:36.640> more<00:00:36.670> remarkable

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
and that becomes even more remarkable

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
when you think that those those shots

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.860 
when you think that those those shots
are<00:00:39.040> twenty<00:00:39.339> four<00:00:39.550> point<00:00:39.790> three<00:00:39.870> megapixels

again<00:01:03.400> because<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:03.970> that<00:01:04.030> SLT<00:01:04.570> technology<00:01:05.260> it

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
again because of that SLT technology it

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.050 
again because of that SLT technology it
kind<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:05.979> gives<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:06.220> camera<00:01:06.549> an<00:01:06.670> edge<00:01:06.760> a<00:01:06.790> bit

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
kind of gives this camera an edge a bit

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.690 
kind of gives this camera an edge a bit
on<00:01:07.210> digital<00:01:08.079> SLRs<00:01:08.619> which<00:01:09.009> can<00:01:09.280> struggle<00:01:09.640> a

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
on digital SLRs which can struggle a

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.099 
on digital SLRs which can struggle a
little<00:01:09.820> bit<00:01:10.030> on<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.270> also<00:01:10.539> focus<00:01:10.930> when

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
field of view as well so you'll get a

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.020 
field of view as well so you'll get a
little<00:02:02.590> bit<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.859> cropping<00:02:03.100> with<00:02:03.429> most<00:02:03.639> digital

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
SLR certainly at consumer levels so you

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.070 
SLR certainly at consumer levels so you
miss<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.369> edges<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.060> frame<00:02:07.299> not<00:02:07.840> going<00:02:08.020> to

miss the edges of the frame not going to

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.870 
miss the edges of the frame not going to
happen<00:02:08.229> with<00:02:08.500> no<00:02:08.649> electronic<00:02:09.069> viewfinder<00:02:09.610> and

happen with no electronic viewfinder and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.889 
happen with no electronic viewfinder and
I'm<00:02:10.030> pretty<00:02:10.179> impressed<00:02:10.509> by<00:02:10.660> what<00:02:10.780> I'm<00:02:10.869> seeing

interesting<00:03:05.470> with<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.220> 77<00:03:07.030> as<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.300> shows

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
interesting with the a 77 as it shows

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.420 
interesting with the a 77 as it shows
how<00:03:07.780> much<00:03:07.960> faith<00:03:08.290> Sony<00:03:08.680> have<00:03:08.890> got<00:03:09.070> in<00:03:09.250> their

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
how much faith Sony have got in their

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.790 
how much faith Sony have got in their
new<00:03:09.550> SLT<00:03:10.120> technology<00:03:10.780> because<00:03:11.260> this<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:11.620> now

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
new SLT technology because this is now

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.220 
new SLT technology because this is now
their<00:03:12.040> top-of-the-line<00:03:12.460> consumer<00:03:13.210> camera<00:03:13.600> so

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
their top-of-the-line consumer camera so

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.020 
their top-of-the-line consumer camera so
any<00:03:14.800> higher<00:03:15.130> than<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:15.700> you've<00:03:15.790> got<00:03:15.910> to

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
any higher than this and you've got to

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.700 
any higher than this and you've got to
go<00:03:16.150> for<00:03:16.390> their<00:03:16.480> full-frame<00:03:16.930> model<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:17.650> it

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
go for their full-frame model so it

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.350 
go for their full-frame model so it
really<00:03:17.950> shows<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.490> Sony<00:03:18.730> has<00:03:18.910> got<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.060> great

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
really shows that Sony has got a great

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.570 
really shows that Sony has got a great
deal<00:03:19.630> of<00:03:19.780> faith<00:03:19.960> in<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.500> SLT<00:03:20.800> technology

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
deal of faith in the SLT technology

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.190 
deal of faith in the SLT technology
which<00:03:21.730> they're<00:03:21.910> pushing<00:03:22.180> very<00:03:22.210> hard<00:03:22.480> there's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
which they're pushing very hard there's

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.990 
which they're pushing very hard there's
a<00:03:23.290> price<00:03:23.500> point<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.860> go<00:03:23.950> with<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.340> course<00:03:24.490> so

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
a price point to go with it of course so

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.610 
a price point to go with it of course so
1,100<00:03:25.600> pounds<00:03:25.720> just<00:03:26.020> for<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.230> camera<00:03:26.500> body

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
1,100 pounds just for the camera body

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.290 
1,100 pounds just for the camera body
that<00:03:27.160> puts<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.550> roughly<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.000> par<00:03:28.270> with

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
that puts it roughly on a par with

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.990 
that puts it roughly on a par with
something<00:03:28.750> like<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:28.990> canon<00:03:29.290> 7d<00:03:29.680> or<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.730> Nikon

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
something like the canon 7d or the Nikon

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.300 
something like the canon 7d or the Nikon
d300<00:03:31.450> s<00:03:31.900> although<00:03:32.530> this<00:03:32.710> can<00:03:32.860> actually<00:03:33.010> do<00:03:33.280> a

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
d300 s although this can actually do a

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.890 
d300 s although this can actually do a
superior<00:03:33.820> framerate<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.450> either<00:03:34.600> of<00:03:34.810> those

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
superior framerate to either of those

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.390 
superior framerate to either of those
cameras<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:35.800> certainly<00:03:35.980> something<00:03:36.160> to

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
cameras so it's certainly something to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.910 
cameras so it's certainly something to
consider<00:03:36.550> if<00:03:36.940> you're<00:03:37.060> after<00:03:37.240> speed<00:03:37.770> for<00:03:38.770> much

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
consider if you're after speed for much
