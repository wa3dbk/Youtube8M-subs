00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
this is lesson 27 which is heights of

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.440 
this is lesson 27 which is heights of
tide<00:00:12.810> what<00:00:13.740> I'm<00:00:13.800> going<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:13.980> show<00:00:14.220> you<00:00:14.420> how<00:00:15.420> to

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
tide what I'm going to show you how to

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.250 
tide what I'm going to show you how to
do<00:00:15.720> is<00:00:15.990> use<00:00:16.290> your<00:00:16.529> tidal<00:00:17.220> curve<00:00:17.460> once<00:00:18.450> you<00:00:18.660> can

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
do is use your tidal curve once you can

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.080 
do is use your tidal curve once you can
use<00:00:19.650> your<00:00:19.830> title<00:00:20.040> curve<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.760> take<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
use your title curve you can take the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.120 
use your title curve you can take the
data<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.990> then<00:00:22.110> we'll<00:00:22.199> go<00:00:22.289> look<00:00:22.320> how<00:00:22.680> how<00:00:23.010> it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
data and then we'll go look how how it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.779 
data and then we'll go look how how it
applies<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:24.000> how<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.830> relates<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.010> chart<00:00:26.550> dates

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
applies to how it relates to chart dates

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.090 
applies to how it relates to chart dates
room<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.930> will<00:00:28.170> actually<00:00:28.350> look<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
room and it will actually look at a

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.799 
room and it will actually look at a
couple<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.520> practical<00:00:30.300> examples<00:00:32.629> so<00:00:33.629> what<00:00:33.780> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
couple of practical examples so what I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.330 
couple of practical examples so what I
want<00:00:34.019> to<00:00:34.080> do<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.379> work<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.769> the<00:00:34.830> height<00:00:35.129> of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
want to do is work out the height of

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.569 
want to do is work out the height of
tide<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.940> outside<00:00:36.360> yep<00:00:36.930> which<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.579> North

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
tide just outside yep which is a North

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.290 
tide just outside yep which is a North
France

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
France

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.510 
France
so<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.290> need<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.920> first<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.399> all

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
so what I need to do is first of all

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.130 
so what I need to do is first of all
find<00:00:41.970> today's<00:00:42.450> date<00:00:42.840> which<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.130> February<00:00:45.140> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
find today's date which is February the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.900 
find today's date which is February the
20th<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.870> found<00:00:48.870> February<00:00:49.410> working<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
20th so found February working down and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.610 
20th so found February working down and
then<00:00:51.540> we've<00:00:51.690> got<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.170> xx<00:00:52.980> there<00:00:54.530> well<00:00:55.530> I've

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
then we've got the xx there well I've

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.590 
then we've got the xx there well I've
got<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> where<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.239> find<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
got this is where you find the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.240 
got this is where you find the
information<00:00:57.690> I've<00:00:58.320> drawn<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
information I've drawn this up on the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
information I've drawn this up on the
board<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:01.020> bit

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
board so you can see it a little bit

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
board so you can see it a little bit
easier<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:04.129> here<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.399> where<00:01:05.700> we've<00:01:06.210> got<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
easier so here we go where we've got the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.650 
easier so here we go where we've got the
twenty<00:01:07.680> year<00:01:07.800> means<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.399> 20th<00:01:08.940> of<00:01:09.090> February

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
twenty year means the 20th of February

twenty year means the 20th of February
and<00:01:10.319> then<00:01:10.470> we've<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.740> today's<00:01:11.130> day<00:01:11.580> which<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:12.199 --> 00:01:12.209 
and then we've got today's day which is

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:16.010 
and then we've got today's day which is
Tuesday<00:01:13.130> what<00:01:14.130> we've<00:01:14.310> got<00:01:14.429> down<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.330> x

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
Tuesday what we've got down here are x

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.520 
Tuesday what we've got down here are x
and<00:01:16.560> these<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.399> Ooty<00:01:17.940> remember<00:01:18.539> so<00:01:19.050> if<00:01:19.410> you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and these are in Ooty remember so if you

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.919 
and these are in Ooty remember so if you
need<00:01:19.679> to<00:01:19.800> apply<00:01:20.039> daylight<00:01:20.849> saving<00:01:21.330> time<00:01:21.360> or

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
need to apply daylight saving time or

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.870 
need to apply daylight saving time or
you<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.289> your<00:01:22.380> french<00:01:22.679> conversion<00:01:23.459> you<00:01:23.700> need

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you and your french conversion you need

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.660 
you and your french conversion you need
to<00:01:24.090> work<00:01:24.300> apply<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.020> doesn't<00:01:25.380> necessary<00:01:25.860> for

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
to work apply that doesn't necessary for

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.469 
to work apply that doesn't necessary for
the<00:01:26.759> actual<00:01:27.330> time<00:01:28.069> but<00:01:29.069> so<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.420> means

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the actual time but so what this means

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.639 
the actual time but so what this means
is<00:01:30.959> that<00:01:31.789> 0<00:01:32.789> 125<00:01:34.280> there<00:01:35.280> will<00:01:35.429> be<00:01:35.459> nine<00:01:36.240> point

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
is that 0 125 there will be nine point

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.930 
is that 0 125 there will be nine point
six<00:01:37.649> meters<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.700> water<00:01:38.910> above<00:01:39.539> char<00:01:40.080> patron<00:01:40.940> so

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
six meters of water above char patron so

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.900 
six meters of water above char patron so
that<00:01:42.090> will<00:01:42.179> be<00:01:42.270> hag<00:01:42.599> water<00:01:43.160> then<00:01:44.160> it's<00:01:44.399> zero

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
that will be hag water then it's zero

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.690 
that will be hag water then it's zero
eight<00:01:45.300> twenty<00:01:45.840> seven<00:01:46.200> there<00:01:46.860> will<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:46.979> zero

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
eight twenty seven there will be zero

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.359 
eight twenty seven there will be zero
point<00:01:48.239> five<00:01:48.660> meters<00:01:49.440> of<00:01:49.560> water<00:01:49.709> set<00:01:50.069> the<00:01:50.160> butch

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
point five meters of water set the butch

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.469 
point five meters of water set the butch
add<00:01:50.640> beta<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.720> will<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.989> your<00:01:52.200> low-water

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
add beta that will be your low-water

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.770 
add beta that will be your low-water
pans<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.319> down<00:01:55.739> here<00:01:56.479> we're<00:01:57.479> actually

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
pans so on down here we're actually

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
pans so on down here we're actually
going<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.229> sailing<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.950> morning<00:01:59.580> so

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
going to be sailing in the morning so

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.490 
going to be sailing in the morning so
we're<00:02:00.239> going<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> take<00:02:00.720> these<00:02:01.080> times<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:05.330> and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
we're going to take these times here and

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.330 
we're going to take these times here and
these<00:02:07.500> are<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.739> ones<00:02:07.950> we're<00:02:08.130> going<00:02:08.280> to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
these are the ones we're going to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.839 
these are the ones we're going to
actually<00:02:08.429> pop<00:02:08.970> plot<00:02:09.270> onto<00:02:09.690> our<00:02:10.760> until<00:02:11.760> our

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
actually pop plot onto our until our

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.959 
actually pop plot onto our until our
tidal<00:02:12.629> curve<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.620> we've<00:02:13.769> got<00:02:13.890> our<00:02:14.040> low<00:02:14.670> water

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 
tidal curve so we've got our low water

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.290 
tidal curve so we've got our low water
fight<00:02:15.659> we've<00:02:16.530> got<00:02:16.680> our<00:02:16.799> high<00:02:17.189> water<00:02:17.519> high

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
fight we've got our high water high

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.199 
fight we've got our high water high
we've<00:02:18.959> got<00:02:19.110> these<00:02:19.260> two<00:02:19.590> times<00:02:19.920> as<00:02:20.190> well<00:02:20.400> these

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
we've got these two times as well these

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.630 
we've got these two times as well these
are<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.510> important<00:02:22.050> ones<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:23.550> we

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
are the important ones that we that we

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.540 
are the important ones that we that we
need<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.970> use

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
need to use

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.089 
need to use
so<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.819> our<00:02:26.970> tidal<00:02:27.390> curve<00:02:27.780> for<00:02:28.819> Dieppe

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
so this is our tidal curve for Dieppe

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.010 
so this is our tidal curve for Dieppe
so<00:02:32.099> I<00:02:32.130> needs<00:02:32.550> dues<00:02:32.760> plus<00:02:33.120> out<00:02:33.330> them<00:02:33.540> figures

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
so I needs dues plus out them figures

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.589 
so I needs dues plus out them figures
that<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.650> mentioned<00:02:35.250> before<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.330> first

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
that I mentioned before and the first

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.660 
that I mentioned before and the first
one<00:02:36.870> was<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.260> low-water<00:02:37.830> mark<00:02:38.069> which<00:02:38.640> was<00:02:39.410> 0.5

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
one was the low-water mark which was 0.5

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
one was the low-water mark which was 0.5
so<00:02:41.670> looking<00:02:42.000> down<00:02:42.209> on<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.630> scale<00:02:43.019> this<00:02:43.410> is

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
so looking down on this scale this is

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.839 
so looking down on this scale this is
the<00:02:43.709> land<00:02:43.920> where<00:02:44.099> we<00:02:44.130> need<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.370> put<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
the land where we need to put the the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.540 
the land where we need to put the the
low-water<00:02:45.480> mark<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.380> don't<00:02:47.340> know<00:02:47.400> if<00:02:47.459> you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
low-water mark on I don't know if you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.990 
low-water mark on I don't know if you
can<00:02:47.670> just<00:02:47.970> see<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:49.500> here<00:02:49.790> I've<00:02:50.790> actually

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
can just see just here I've actually

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.210 
can just see just here I've actually
plotted<00:02:51.600> on<00:02:52.190> 0.5<00:02:53.780> then<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.019> high<00:02:55.200> water<00:02:55.560> was

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
plotted on 0.5 then the high water was

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.320 
plotted on 0.5 then the high water was
nine<00:02:56.880> point<00:02:57.450> seven<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.549> comes<00:02:59.880> up<00:03:00.150> onto

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
nine point seven so that comes up onto

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.220 
nine point seven so that comes up onto
this<00:03:00.630> line<00:03:00.930> at<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> top<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.799> air<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
this line at the top of the air of the

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.470 
this line at the top of the air of the
the<00:03:04.230> graph<00:03:04.530> here<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.069> that's<00:03:05.760> nine<00:03:06.120> point

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the graph here and that's nine point

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.270 
the graph here and that's nine point
seven<00:03:06.750> I've<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.290> plotted<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.830> there<00:03:08.040> and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
seven I've just plotted on there and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.270 
seven I've just plotted on there and
then<00:03:08.970> what<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.209> do<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.720> take<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.560> straight<00:03:10.860> edge<00:03:11.130> on

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
then what I do I take a straight edge on

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.610 
then what I do I take a straight edge on
the<00:03:11.430> Portland<00:03:11.849> plotter<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:13.019> draw<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> line

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
the Portland plotter and I draw a line

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.440 
the Portland plotter and I draw a line
between<00:03:14.069> them<00:03:14.580> two<00:03:14.790> lines<00:03:17.030> then<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.180> next

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
between them two lines then the next

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.089 
between them two lines then the next
thing<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.630> need<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.840> do<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.080> liter<00:03:19.319> plotting<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
thing I need to do a liter plotting the

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.530 
thing I need to do a liter plotting the
times<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:22.200> particular<00:03:22.620> one<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.540> working

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
times and this particular one is working

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.120 
times and this particular one is working
off<00:03:25.370> high<00:03:26.370> water<00:03:27.109> so<00:03:28.109> that<00:03:29.269> figure<00:03:30.269> there

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
off high water so that figure there

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.610 
off high water so that figure there
13:40<00:03:32.130> was<00:03:32.670> our<00:03:32.820> high<00:03:33.239> war<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> time<00:03:34.019> and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
13:40 was our high war of the time and

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.420 
13:40 was our high war of the time and
then<00:03:35.430> what<00:03:35.609> I've<00:03:35.730> done<00:03:35.940> for<00:03:36.209> each<00:03:36.750> hour<00:03:37.430> for

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
then what I've done for each hour for

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.490 
then what I've done for each hour for
the<00:03:38.519> hours<00:03:38.819> plus<00:03:39.150> I've<00:03:39.420> had<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.780> an<00:03:39.870> hour<00:03:40.079> on<00:03:40.319> so

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
the hours plus I've had it an hour on so

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.380 
the hours plus I've had it an hour on so
each<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.250> color<00:03:41.459> kept<00:03:41.700> going<00:03:42.000> right<00:03:42.269> up

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
each one and a color kept going right up

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.030 
each one and a color kept going right up
to<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.870> plus<00:03:43.290> six<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.420> then<00:03:45.420> there's<00:03:46.410> -<00:03:46.859> as

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
to this plus six and then there's - as

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.470 
to this plus six and then there's - as
well<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.880> hours<00:03:48.120> before<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.350> 13<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.579> 12<00:03:50.819> 11

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
well so the hours before so 13 and 12 11

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.300 
well so the hours before so 13 and 12 11
10<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:52.500> on<00:03:54.290> then<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.440> next<00:03:55.769> thing<00:03:55.980> well

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
10 and so on then the next thing well

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.759 
10 and so on then the next thing well
then<00:03:56.579> once<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.239> once<00:03:57.569> I've<00:03:57.720> done<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:57.930> I'm

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
then once that once I've done that I'm

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.129 
then once that once I've done that I'm
ready<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.100> go<00:03:59.400> really<00:03:59.690> so<00:04:00.690> there's<00:04:00.870> two<00:04:01.109> ways

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
ready to go really so there's two ways

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.699 
ready to go really so there's two ways
you<00:04:01.470> could<00:04:01.620> use<00:04:01.650> this<00:04:02.329> this<00:04:03.329> information<00:04:03.709> what

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
you could use this this information what

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.059 
you could use this this information what
I<00:04:04.769> can<00:04:04.920> do<00:04:05.389> assuming<00:04:06.389> that<00:04:06.420> house<00:04:06.840> at<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.799> port

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
I can do assuming that house at the port

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.680 
I can do assuming that house at the port
and<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.459> want<00:04:08.639> to<00:04:08.700> know<00:04:08.790> how<00:04:09.030> much<00:04:09.209> water's

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
and I want to know how much water's

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.349 
and I want to know how much water's
above<00:04:10.230> chart<00:04:10.560> they<00:04:10.739> trim<00:04:11.100> at<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:13.459> 1442<00:04:14.459> which

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
above chart they trim at the 1442 which

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.710 
above chart they trim at the 1442 which
is<00:04:15.889> just<00:04:16.889> here<00:04:17.100> what<00:04:18.000> they<00:04:18.180> are<00:04:18.269> into<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
is just here what they are into the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.409 
is just here what they are into the
graph<00:04:18.989> from<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:19.680> side<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.340> draw<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.359> straight

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
graph from this side I draw a straight

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.080 
graph from this side I draw a straight
line<00:04:21.930> right<00:04:22.260> up<00:04:24.289> to<00:04:25.289> this<00:04:25.470> point<00:04:25.770> here<00:04:26.010> I'm<00:04:26.880> lit

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
line right up to this point here I'm lit

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.480 
line right up to this point here I'm lit
on<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.419> curve<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.289> then<00:04:28.680> again<00:04:29.039> keeping

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
on the curve and then again keeping

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.770 
on the curve and then again keeping
everything<00:04:29.729> parallel<00:04:30.390> I'm<00:04:30.990> going<00:04:31.169> to<00:04:31.229> bring

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
everything parallel I'm going to bring

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.130 
everything parallel I'm going to bring
so<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:34.170> land<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.710> drew<00:04:35.070> earlier<00:04:35.310> on<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:36.140> then

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
so the land I drew earlier on and then

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.640 
so the land I drew earlier on and then
take<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.470> up<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.980> this<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:39.720> it's<00:04:40.020> my<00:04:40.110> workings

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
take it up to this and it's my workings

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.100 
take it up to this and it's my workings
out<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:41.040> that's<00:04:41.160> eight<00:04:41.550> point<00:04:42.000> six<00:04:42.540> meters

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
out that that's eight point six meters

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.240 
out that that's eight point six meters
of<00:04:43.410> water<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:44.520> what<00:04:44.700> that's<00:04:44.820> telling<00:04:44.970> me<00:04:45.330> at

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
of water so what that's telling me at

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
of water so what that's telling me at
fourteen<00:04:47.250> forty<00:04:48.210> two<00:04:48.450> duty<00:04:49.140> time<00:04:50.270> there's

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
fourteen forty two duty time there's

across to that line on the Charter then

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.240 
across to that line on the Charter then
bringing<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.350> down<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:30.470> then<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.500> can<00:05:31.710> read<00:05:32.040> off

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
bringing it down and then I can read off

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.580 
bringing it down and then I can read off

spring tides and the hatched line is if
you're<00:05:54.930> on<00:05:54.960> neat<00:05:55.530> tides<00:05:55.890> so<00:05:56.850> depending

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
you're on neat tides so depending

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.800 
you're on neat tides so depending

that's<00:06:00.810> where<00:06:01.050> you<00:06:01.140> draw<00:06:01.320> your<00:06:01.470> line<00:06:01.650> so<00:06:01.920> it's

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
that's where you draw your line so it's

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.890 
that's where you draw your line so it's
not<00:06:02.580> a<00:06:02.640> massive<00:06:02.970> difference<00:06:03.150> on<00:06:03.540> the<00:06:03.720> apps
