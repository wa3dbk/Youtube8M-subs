00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.779
 They knew me more than I thought 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.520
 because I did not expect to be known 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 as many as I have uploaded are the videos 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.660

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.550

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.840
 s of the nuclear without while I've 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.850
 since I left the song in 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.330
 the laptop did not remember the name and 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.460
 nothing could not leave you that as 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.720
 you will have seen already we have new intro

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.390
 Yes that to me that I liked a lot 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.460
 I leave you in the description the kid that 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.580
 I've done it in case you need something 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.650
 you know well I'll try to continue 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.840
 with the world time that I still had 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.729
 record a few episodes since I 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.740
 leave a few preparations because I 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.140
 I went to that all weekend but 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.780
 good to be try everything you have 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.910
 said well in the videos as they are the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.590
 unsheathed to do if all that 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.380
 comment melo also in this video 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.060
 because I remember everything that I 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.090
 you said but well try to try 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.390
 everything I can 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.780
 and the game as you see the c4 I think 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.219
 I have not said it cuts me sometimes and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.399
 I have to start recording again 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.920
 but well that to burst the fours me 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.489
 You have asked him enough if he 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.810
 you have to press twice the square or 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:22.349
 the x in the xbox to blow up the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.360
 c4 without using the detonator and without pasting the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.950
 second c4 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.510
 well here you see the one that was messing 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.150
 I was leaving the entire team 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.069
 who had respawn it is best to enter 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.170
 for this part 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.730
 and go around there because 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.310
 they usually appear when we put them in 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.579
 this part usually appear on top of it 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.530
 but on the other hand they already carry 15 of 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.389
 streak almost if I do not get to throw the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.280
 dogs and the swarm well maybe 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:51.299
 I would have got more streak but good 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.150
 Now you will see that I already had the swarm of 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.180
 turns resolved 3 or 4 shots and I put a 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.400
 fran sauce to a meter that was amazing 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.739
 already has a good run and with 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.159
 swarm can come out with the gun not 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.630
 I could get in the short distances 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.910
 as 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.270
 if it were with a rifle for example but 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.430
 well still pretty pretty pretty the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.790
 streak with the 34 the lyÃ³ as always to the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.930
 take 2 c4 because that's what 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.690
 picking up and we do not stop strips of 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.180
 four good the theme is to get them out of 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.069
 in here because if they get in here 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.980
 inside is where is fucked so that 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.840
 kill streaks but good the truth that 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.390
 with the dogs when the dogs are 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.370
 everything because they got in and in all the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.500
 houses they saw was getting in but 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:46.540
 good still I followed them get us out a little 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:49.660
 and killed quite a low turbo to 24 and 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.790
 again the two of them did not give me a 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.620
 turbo low now and now it gives me back 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.340
 a curious low of these four does not 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.880
 I know what happened that lightning or something good already 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.620
 had the second kiss I was wearing it already 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.930
 a few casualties but hey he was 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.720
 ending with the second round being a 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.569
 little so advanced by the hunter and we're going 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.260
 earning quite the first good me 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.910
 I took 71 casualties because it was with a gun 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.220
 what happens that the first round was that 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.570
 that killed me a couple of times in nothing 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.970
 of the ub sad 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.360
 I hope you liked it until the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.360
 next 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.870
 we have completed exam but I came back
