00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:11.380
 Now this time is the video of the 24th sister vs Final Fantasy 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:14.890
 This time we will continue to do tower events 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:18.100
 Because I have fallen 74 now 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:21.810
 The 75th layer as predicted 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.810
 I will fight the big eyes 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:30.110
 The deck I'm using right now looks like this 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.750
 I will always focus on 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:37.900
 It has not been written for a long time since the last one 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 I 'm dead at least once so far 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.710
 There is no problem with this 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:52.129
 If you haven't seen the previous video , please take a look if you like 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:57.920
 Let's continue to challenge in this time that 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:00.640
 Since the battle on the way was also put forward by fast forward, if it is good, I see it until the end 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.640
 Please take 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.720
 Well then 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.720
 To go 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.430
 Well this time 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.250
 This in power 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.000
 Baume It is fine array 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:24.820
 It is disturbing 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.810
 There are times when this two big bomes come out once in a while 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.150
 Please be careful really at such time 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.520
 I hope this explodes 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.350
 I will die 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.500
 Surely break take you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.400
 I have to prepare 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.400
 It is quite tight 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.770
 Say Well this 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.259
 Ne 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.259
 I want to see torrent I can beat it 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.320
 Well I am quite that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.700
 Support but I have put a face and Berserk of card 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.700
 I use it too and say 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:19.580
 Berserk it Is that a certain cow force I'll be a little decrease, but at all 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.580
 I can not reduce that much 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.690
 I will use it more and more 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.140
 The element itself 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.890
 Absorb 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:47.730
 Please proceed while resisting that kind of attack 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.160
 Then the damage is suppressed quite like this 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.250
 that 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.450
 The enemy who can not resist is also quick 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.450
 Let's take a break and beat it 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.360
 I liked crispy always in such a feeling 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:15.440
 It is not that there is no water attribute off now own the in me now of the deck 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.850
 The element of water 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.740
 Well I'm absorbing more and more 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.740
 Let's prevent water 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.610
 There is no problem at all if you can do this fist 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:56.700
 Even if there is no weakness attribute of that enemy when there is a coffee Sutopa measures 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:59.480
 A considerable amount of firepower comes out like this More than 10,000 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:04.569
 Hello everyone 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.569
 Please try if you think this is inefficient 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.700
 Cat does not always put water of weakness at a stretch, but I hate it 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.790
 this 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.790
 I'm using that fur measure 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.210
 Please come and see this 15,000 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.330
 This flower and no problem at all 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.210
 Clear and proceed to the next big mega 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.980
 It is normal speed by returning speed from ho 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.850
 I can go 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.850
 Well omega of you But that reasonable, please take break 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.480
 I will win if I take a break 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.480
 Without 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.580
 Now break gauge 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.580
 that 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.420
 It looks like a little dark red 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:30.980
 Well this is the face of this deck and 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:34.009
 The reason for putting the Versac is 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:40.119
 Well I'm fired up but this 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:40.119
 It will be quite effective even in the last Omega match this 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.340
 So you can use it here 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:59.140
 The total number will increase the defense of your opponent 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.140
 You can beat it with a loose teapot and nearly 50,000 damage 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:10.020
 I do not know what it will be like in the future, but I'm thinking of going with this deck for a while 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.020
 is 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:18.020
 I killed 75 bodies with this 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:20.160
 Probably the border within that 500 e is 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.400
 90 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.400
 High 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:30.990
 I think it will be around 95 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:34.400
 So please do your best as well. Next time is about 100 times 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.400
 It's a sometimes videos 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:43.270
 Please do your best as you can get over the revival ticket so let 's see in the next video 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.270
