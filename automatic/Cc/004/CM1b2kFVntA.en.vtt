a couple of uh shapes so uh being at the
E<00:01:30.250> has<00:01:31.250> more<00:01:31.550> shape<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.119> itself<00:01:32.479> allows<00:01:33.170> me

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
E has more shape to it itself allows me

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.250 
E has more shape to it itself allows me
to<00:01:33.619> do<00:01:33.770> more<00:01:33.979> creative<00:01:34.460> things<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:35.140> making<00:01:36.140> it

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
to do more creative things to making it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.560 
to do more creative things to making it
a<00:01:36.350> wild<00:01:36.619> style<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.550> I<00:01:37.580> kind<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:37.970> leaned<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.420> out

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
a wild style so I kind of leaned it out

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.810 
a wild style so I kind of leaned it out
almost<00:01:39.170> creating<00:01:39.590> like<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.770> backwards<00:01:40.369> three

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
almost creating like a backwards three

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.660 
almost creating like a backwards three
really<00:01:41.570> helps<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.900> lot<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.500> kind<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.800> get

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
really helps a lot to to kind of get

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.060 
really helps a lot to to kind of get
your<00:01:43.850> little<00:01:44.000> coloring<00:01:44.450> pattern<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.200> your

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
your little coloring pattern on your

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.090 
your little coloring pattern on your
hand<00:01:46.369> movements<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:47.060> strokes<00:01:47.590> down<00:01:48.590> quickly

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
hand movements and strokes down quickly

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.550 
hand movements and strokes down quickly
so<00:01:49.630> that<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:50.840> get<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.110> hang<00:01:51.259> of<00:01:51.380> not

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
so that you get the hang of not

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.290 
so that you get the hang of not

it give it more of a new shape we'll do
the<00:02:15.800> 3d<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.580> little<00:02:16.850> differently<00:02:17.239> before<00:02:18.049> we

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the 3d a little differently before we

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.110 
the 3d a little differently before we
get<00:02:18.230> into<00:02:18.500> our<00:02:18.530> black<00:02:18.860> outline<00:02:19.370> we're<00:02:20.030> gonna

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
get into our black outline we're gonna

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.660 
get into our black outline we're gonna
actually<00:02:20.330> take<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> color<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.320> build<00:02:21.980> our<00:02:22.220> 3d

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
actually take a color and build our 3d

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.160 
actually take a color and build our 3d
up<00:02:22.820> around<00:02:23.860> come<00:02:24.860> back<00:02:25.040> afterwards<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
up around come back afterwards and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.140 
up around come back afterwards and
outline<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.799> in<00:02:27.920> black<00:02:28.130> doing<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.850> couple

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
outline it in black doing a couple

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.210 
outline it in black doing a couple
little<00:02:29.269> fades<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.930> piece<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.620> then

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
little fades in the piece and then

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.430 
little fades in the piece and then
basically<00:02:31.670> almost<00:02:32.299> in<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.690> same<00:02:32.930> motion<00:02:33.170> of

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
basically almost in the same motion of

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.840 
basically almost in the same motion of
leaning<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.799> can<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.160> kind<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.430> whipping<00:02:34.760> it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
leaning the can to kind of whipping it

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.490 
leaning the can to kind of whipping it
down<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> little<00:02:35.600> width<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.110> little<00:02:36.140> width

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
down so a little width a little width

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.310 
down so a little width a little width

purple<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.870> some<00:02:51.079> outline<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:51.980> we're<00:02:52.160> not

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
purple it's to some outline so we're not

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.640 
purple it's to some outline so we're not
gonna<00:02:52.459> do<00:02:52.880> any<00:02:53.090> outline<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.630> black<00:02:53.660> that's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
gonna do any outline in black that's

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.289 
gonna do any outline in black that's
gonna<00:02:54.829> lead<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.280> 3d<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:55.910> we're<00:02:56.030> just<00:02:56.060> gonna

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
gonna lead to the 3d so we're just gonna

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.120 
gonna lead to the 3d so we're just gonna
divide<00:02:56.720> it<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:57.019> half<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.530> come<00:02:57.980> back

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
divide it in half and then come back

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.150 
divide it in half and then come back
around<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.700> move<00:02:59.090> back<00:02:59.299> up<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.720> the<00:03:00.160> inner

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
around it move back up to the inner

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.559 
around it move back up to the inner
outline<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:03.170> outer<00:03:03.380> outlines<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.160> piece

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
outline the outer outlines of the piece

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.690 
outline the outer outlines of the piece
and<00:03:05.959> if<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.290> were<00:03:06.439> doing<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.310> whole<00:03:07.340> piece

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
and if you were doing the whole piece

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.449 
and if you were doing the whole piece
then<00:03:08.000> this<00:03:08.150> outer<00:03:08.390> outline<00:03:08.890> would<00:03:09.890> not<00:03:10.129> go<00:03:10.310> in

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
then this outer outline would not go in

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.190 
then this outer outline would not go in
between<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.849> letters<00:03:11.090> but<00:03:11.390> outer<00:03:11.810> outline

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
between the letters but outer outline

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.809 
between the letters but outer outline
around<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.799> whole<00:03:12.980> piece<00:03:13.220> itself<00:03:13.700> oh<00:03:15.819> there's

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
around the whole piece itself oh there's

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.739 
around the whole piece itself oh there's
a<00:03:16.909> graffiti<00:03:17.180> wall<00:03:17.569> style<00:03:18.079> letter<00:03:18.500> e
