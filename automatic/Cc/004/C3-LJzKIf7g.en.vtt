out<00:00:46.770> from<00:00:46.980> underneath<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.539> like<00:00:48.539> i<00:00:48.629> said<00:00:48.690> it's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
out from underneath you like i said it's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.720 
out from underneath you like i said it's
a<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.379> good<00:00:49.469> board<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.829> beginners<00:00:50.399> but

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
a really good board for beginners but

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.490 
a really good board for beginners but
once<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.539> start<00:00:51.780> doing<00:00:51.870> tricks<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.350> stuff

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
once you start doing tricks and stuff

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.119 
once you start doing tricks and stuff
i'm<00:00:52.739> suggesting<00:00:53.280> um<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.440> grip<00:00:55.590> tape<00:00:55.770> itself

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
i'm suggesting um the grip tape itself

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.299 
i'm suggesting um the grip tape itself
is<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.300> classic<00:00:57.629> black<00:00:57.660> grip<00:00:58.199> tape<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
is the your classic black grip tape and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.080 
is the your classic black grip tape and
then<00:00:59.670> let's<00:00:59.910> move<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.420> back<00:01:02.090> design

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
then let's move on to the back design

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
then let's move on to the back design
your<00:01:03.120> classic<00:01:03.930> riverside<00:01:06.049> design<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.430> go<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
your classic riverside design and go to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.550 
your classic riverside design and go to
the<00:01:08.610> wheels<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> wheels<00:01:09.600> are<00:01:09.930> 75

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the wheels I so the wheels are 75

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.359 
the wheels I so the wheels are 75
millimeters<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.210> 78<00:01:12.840> days<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.920> cool

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
millimeters they are 78 days and a cool

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.590 
millimeters they are 78 days and a cool
feature<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.850> found<00:01:15.060> about<00:01:15.240> them<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
feature that I found about them is that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.999 
feature that I found about them is that
their<00:01:15.930> glow<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.380> dark<00:01:16.619> which<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.890> thought

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
was pretty cool the only thing is that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.890 
was pretty cool the only thing is that
they<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.369> pretty<00:01:20.670> glossy<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> feel<00:01:21.720> like
