00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Well, here you need to take it out again 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.910
 to the speech and as well we know then 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.820
 we have a lot of information left and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.700
 put in our stops in this 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.769
 especially to take out programs and programs 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
 others and this next information has 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.910
 to see that today 9 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.260
 September the ntv announced that in 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.640
 Calla Mayo I'm going to this art analyze 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.439
 an evening series called picks or 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.070
 a drama as you want to call him 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.360
 the drama is based on a manga of 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.450
 same name there haragi naco that 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:46.860
 was made by eye sleeves in the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.379
 magazine sees your comic since 2008 and the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.250
 that called to interpret a 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.250
 high school student 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.920
 that he has to face the past 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.750
 which has not very good 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.580
 well 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.540
 what else can we talk about this one 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.540
 seriously 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:19.420
 to know this to a partner who 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.960
 which came out in that time is going to 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.710
 have a love story between them 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.220
 two how is a soho obviously 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.150
 This is going to be about romance and it's also going to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.540
 contain elements of suspense that therefore 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.090
 I think it's a little bit good that they also go 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.920
 putting together this kind of genres 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.750
 and then they are going to see this past 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.679
 together or we will see more or less how 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.399
 wave is three years ago this guy 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:57.700
 did in the akuma little thing series for 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.920
 fugitive and then he said that he wants 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.990
 make a role that people can 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.020
 connect with this kind of thing and then 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.010
 your ex-girlfriend will interpret it in this 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.090
 series that its your trump card and you have planned 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.370
 this series come out in japan on 6th 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.819
 October because I think she misses us 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.489
 a lot and later I think that the 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.830
 let's see subtitled English I think 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.280
 which is a good opportunity to go 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.670
 starting to look for more information 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.400
 this manga and where you can read it though 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.290
 be in English and we can continue 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.519
 bringing more information about it 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.519
