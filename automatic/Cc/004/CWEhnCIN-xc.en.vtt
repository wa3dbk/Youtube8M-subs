let's<00:00:05.850> say<00:00:06.000> you're<00:00:06.150> on<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.270> open<00:00:06.690> highway<00:00:07.080> and

let's say you're on the open highway and
you<00:00:07.589> want<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.950> set<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.250> consistent<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.210> safe

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480

towards set and then releasing it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.020 
towards set and then releasing it
immediately<00:01:52.320> will<00:01:52.799> decrease<00:01:53.280> vehicle<00:01:53.759> speed

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
immediately will decrease vehicle speed

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.719 
immediately will decrease vehicle speed
