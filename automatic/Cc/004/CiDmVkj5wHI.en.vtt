00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.649 
do that so give it time give them
patience<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.820> I'm<00:02:00.090> sure<00:02:00.299> we<00:02:00.450> will<00:02:00.509> be

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
patience and I'm sure we will be

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.450 
patience and I'm sure we will be
rewarded<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.259> we've<00:02:01.439> always<00:02:01.619> been<00:02:01.920> rewarded

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
rewarded like we've always been rewarded

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.030 
rewarded like we've always been rewarded
with<00:02:03.299> these<00:02:03.540> great<00:02:03.840> updates<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.710> they've<00:02:04.920> been

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
with these great updates so they've been

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.940 
with these great updates so they've been
giving<00:02:05.280> us<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.670> anyways<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:07.170> texture<00:02:07.740> pack

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
giving us but anyways the texture pack

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.840 
giving us but anyways the texture pack
on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> plus<00:02:08.819> plastic<00:02:09.239> texture<00:02:09.840> pack

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
on the plus plastic texture pack

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.440 
on the plus plastic texture pack
is<00:02:12.010> presumably<00:02:13.010> going<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.330> one<00:02:15.290> dollar<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
is presumably going to be one dollar the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.270 
is presumably going to be one dollar the
reason<00:02:17.720> why<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:17.990> have<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.860> some<00:02:19.010> proof

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
reason why I have that have some proof

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.340 
reason why I have that have some proof
and<00:02:19.520> evidence<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:20.000> back<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.270> up<00:02:20.420> as<00:02:20.690> well<00:02:20.750> is

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and evidence to back that up as well is

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.530 
and evidence to back that up as well is
because<00:02:21.860> on<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> other<00:02:22.460> console<00:02:23.060> version<00:02:23.420> of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
because on the other console version of

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.840 
because on the other console version of
Minecraft<00:02:23.990> it<00:02:24.560> was<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> dollar<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.370> 360

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
Minecraft it was a dollar on the 360

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.720 
Minecraft it was a dollar on the 360
version<00:02:25.930> they<00:02:26.930> priced<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.710> same<00:02:27.740> exact

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
version they priced the same exact

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.420 
version they priced the same exact
texture<00:02:29.120> pack<00:02:29.300> with<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.600> same<00:02:29.900> exact<00:02:30.470> file

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
texture pack with the same exact file

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.140 
texture pack with the same exact file
seems<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:32.210> memory<00:02:32.540> took<00:02:32.750> up<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.860> one<00:02:34.520> dollar

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
seems like memory took up for one dollar

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.610 
seems like memory took up for one dollar
um<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:36.740> basically<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:38.720> won't<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:39.050> any<00:02:39.290> more

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
um so basically it won't be any more

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.890 
um so basically it won't be any more
expensive<00:02:40.400> than<00:02:40.820> one<00:02:41.060> dollar<00:02:41.300> if<00:02:41.570> that's<00:02:41.750> your

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
expensive than one dollar if that's your

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.950 
expensive than one dollar if that's your
question<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:43.160> could<00:02:43.730> be<00:02:44.000> free<00:02:44.330> maybe<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:44.930> like

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
question it could be free maybe in like

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.430 
question it could be free maybe in like
future<00:02:46.210> dates<00:02:47.210> however<00:02:47.630> at<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:47.930> point<00:02:48.260> it's

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
future dates however at this point it's

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.590 
future dates however at this point it's
going<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.620> be<00:02:48.680> costing<00:02:49.070> us<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> dollar<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:50.180> make

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
going to be costing us a dollar so make

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.720 
going to be costing us a dollar so make

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
that not everything is going to be a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.280 
that not everything is going to be a
dollar<00:03:22.610> i<00:03:22.730> know<00:03:22.910> i<00:03:23.240> guess<00:03:23.690> my<00:03:23.810> people<00:03:24.020> like<00:03:24.140> oh

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
and texture packs that were a little

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.650 
and texture packs that were a little
more<00:03:35.420> expensive<00:03:36.110> than<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.550> normal<00:03:37.850> dollar

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
more expensive than the normal dollar
