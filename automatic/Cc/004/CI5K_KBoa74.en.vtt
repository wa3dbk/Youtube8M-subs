00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.740 

two<00:00:17.400> years<00:00:17.640> ago<00:00:17.699> we're<00:00:18.150> looking<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:18.599> ways<00:00:18.689> to

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
two years ago we're looking for ways to

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.529 
two years ago we're looking for ways to
boost<00:00:19.140> efficiency<00:00:20.269> especially<00:00:21.269> when<00:00:21.390> we're

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
boost efficiency especially when we're

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.900 
boost efficiency especially when we're
working<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.930> taller<00:00:22.199> buildings<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:23.400> decided

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
working on taller buildings we decided

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.479 
working on taller buildings we decided
invest<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.419> the<00:00:24.480> latest<00:00:24.599> technology<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.220> we

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:26.489 
invest in the latest technology and we

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.450 
invest in the latest technology and we
added<00:00:26.669> two<00:00:27.599> drones<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.500> our<00:00:29.009> commercial<00:00:29.579> fleet

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
added two drones to our commercial fleet

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.740 
added two drones to our commercial fleet
what<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.579> found<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.089> that<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.360> were<00:00:33.449> able<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
what we found is that we were able to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.649 
what we found is that we were able to
boost<00:00:33.989> our<00:00:34.199> efficiency<00:00:35.120> more<00:00:36.120> than<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.480> could

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:36.659 
boost our efficiency more than we could

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:39.140 
boost our efficiency more than we could
ever<00:00:36.690> imagine<00:00:37.550> by<00:00:38.550> making<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.970> move<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
ever imagine by making the move to

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.549 
ever imagine by making the move to
drones<00:00:39.570> we've<00:00:39.839> been<00:00:40.019> able<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.320> eliminate

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
drones we've been able to eliminate

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:51.200 
drones we've been able to eliminate
ladders<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.610> scaffolding

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.229

we<00:01:02.100> don't<00:01:02.310> set<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.550> scaffolding<00:01:03.150> ladders

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
we don't set up scaffolding ladders

we don't set up scaffolding ladders
where<00:01:03.810> it<00:01:03.900> will<00:01:04.050> deploy<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.440> minutes<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.390> we

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
where it will deploy a minutes and we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.910 
where it will deploy a minutes and we
can<00:01:06.540> clean<00:01:06.780> off<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.470> quickly

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.340 

so<00:01:12.610> we<00:01:12.700> started<00:01:13.060> using<00:01:13.210> Haiti<00:01:13.600> PayPal's<00:01:14.140> to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
so we started using Haiti PayPal's to

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.620 
so we started using Haiti PayPal's to
feed<00:01:14.560> paid<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:15.070> our<00:01:15.100> droves<00:01:15.490> since<00:01:16.330> they're<00:01:16.479> so

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
feed paid to our droves since they're so

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.080 
feed paid to our droves since they're so
feature-rich<00:01:17.430> especially<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.550> magnets<00:01:18.970> that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
feature-rich especially the magnets that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.969 
feature-rich especially the magnets that
hold<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.330> paint<00:01:19.540> brushes<00:01:19.810> allows<00:01:20.560> us<00:01:20.830> to

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
hold the paint brushes allows us to

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:29.690 
hold the paint brushes allows us to
change<00:01:21.220> colors<00:01:21.790> change<00:01:22.659> brushes<00:01:23.110> mid-flight

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.910

we<00:01:32.640> used<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.940> handy<00:01:33.180> paint<00:01:33.420> tray<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:33.900> it's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
we used a handy paint tray because it's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.660 
we used a handy paint tray because it's
wide<00:01:34.560> enough<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.950> deep<00:01:35.100> enough<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.400> our

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
wide enough and deep enough for our

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.150 
wide enough and deep enough for our
