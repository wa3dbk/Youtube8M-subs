00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to really work on the outside of the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.230 
to really work on the outside of the
knee<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.750> opening<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.350> those<00:01:04.589> hip<00:01:04.860> flexors

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
knee really opening up those hip flexors

the<00:01:06.240> IT<00:01:06.479> band<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.340> to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the IT band really because we want to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.469 
the IT band really because we want to
balance<00:01:08.790> knee<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:10.530> knee<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.130> bowed<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.180> words

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
balance knee this knee is bowed in words

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.510 
balance knee this knee is bowed in words
so<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.020> would<00:01:13.170> tell<00:01:13.350> me<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.010> growing

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
so that would tell me that the growing

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.859 
so that would tell me that the growing
muscles<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> ad<00:01:15.450> ad<00:01:15.990> doctors<00:01:16.740> need<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.280> be

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
muscles in the ad ad doctors need to be

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.420 
muscles in the ad ad doctors need to be
balanced<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.990> strengthen<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.040> notice

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
balanced in strengthen and you notice

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.850 
balanced in strengthen and you notice
you<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.820> inside<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.689> outside<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.590> femur

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you have inside and outside of the femur

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.580 
you have inside and outside of the femur
here<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.270> both<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.509> those<00:01:24.750> muscles<00:01:25.229> need<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.470> be

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
here so both of those muscles need to be

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.730 
here so both of those muscles need to be
balanced<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.540> classic<00:01:27.900> no

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
balanced and this is just a classic no

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.160 
balanced and this is just a classic no
known<00:01:29.009> we've<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.360> never<00:01:30.540> want<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> lock

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
known we've really never want to lock

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.170 
known we've really never want to lock
out<00:01:31.409> knees<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.579> lock<00:01:32.790> your<00:01:33.000> knee

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
out knees because if you lock your knee

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.249 
out knees because if you lock your knee
it<00:01:33.540> adds<00:01:33.950> stress<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.729> joint<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.299> our<00:01:36.960> goal

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it adds stress to the joint and our goal

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.310 
it adds stress to the joint and our goal
is<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.610> put<00:01:38.820> stress<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> join<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.900> all<00:01:40.079> is

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
is not to put stress and join it all is

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.370 
is not to put stress and join it all is
to<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.130> work<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.880> joint<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> not

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
to have to work with the joint and not

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.289 
to have to work with the joint and not
against<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.860> let's<00:01:47.100> look<00:01:47.340> deeper<00:01:47.670> into<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
against it so let's look deeper into the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.969 
against it so let's look deeper into the
quadriceps<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> quadriceps<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> see

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
quadriceps so the quadriceps if you see

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.050 
quadriceps so the quadriceps if you see
they<00:01:53.970> attached<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> hip

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
they attached to the hip

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.480 
they attached to the hip
and<00:01:56.329> then<00:01:56.750> they<00:01:56.899> come<00:01:56.930> down<00:01:57.470> in<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.159> attached

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
and then they come down in the attached

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.569 
and then they come down in the attached
below<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.329> knee<00:01:59.799> okay<00:02:00.799> so<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.340> have<00:02:01.520> a

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
below the knee okay so you have a

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.700 
below the knee okay so you have a
below-the-knee<00:02:02.360> attachment<00:02:03.259> it's<00:02:03.380> called

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
below-the-knee attachment it's called

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.520 
below-the-knee attachment it's called
none<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.420> goodness<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.570> having<00:02:05.899> a<00:02:05.960> brain<00:02:06.229> for

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
none and goodness and having a brain for

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.559 
none and goodness and having a brain for
it<00:02:06.619> here<00:02:07.390> patellar<00:02:09.789> tuberosity<00:02:10.789> so<00:02:11.239> the

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
it here patellar tuberosity so the

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.650 
it here patellar tuberosity so the
patella<00:02:12.459> attaches<00:02:13.459> below<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.209> knee<00:02:14.360> all<00:02:14.630> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
patella attaches below the knee all the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.610 
patella attaches below the knee all the
rest<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.319> quads<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:16.160> merge<00:02:16.940> into<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.840> so

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
rest of the quads all merge into that so

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.759 
rest of the quads all merge into that so
again<00:02:19.010> if<00:02:19.250> your<00:02:19.670> quadriceps<00:02:20.420> are<00:02:20.599> tight<00:02:20.900> it's

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
again if your quadriceps are tight it's

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.880 
again if your quadriceps are tight it's
going<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.099> create<00:02:22.940> extra<00:02:23.690> pressure<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.500> this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
going to create extra pressure on this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.160 
going to create extra pressure on this
joint<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:26.060> need<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.420> make<00:02:26.599> sure<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.019> get

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
joint you need to make sure that you get

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.680 
joint you need to make sure that you get
those<00:02:27.380> open<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:28.819> that<00:02:29.060> way<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:29.360> will

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
those open and and that way you will

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.509 
those open and and that way you will
avoid<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:31.239> tension<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.500> comes<00:02:33.500> from<00:02:33.799> from

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
avoid the tension that comes from from

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.820 
avoid the tension that comes from from
really<00:02:34.910> having<00:02:35.450> thai<00:02:35.660> quadriceps<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.530> really

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
really having thai quadriceps you really

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.100 
really having thai quadriceps you really
want<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.069> begin<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.670> open<00:02:37.910> up<00:02:38.269> your<00:02:38.299> quadriceps

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
want to begin to open up your quadriceps

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.229 
want to begin to open up your quadriceps
and<00:02:39.350> I'll<00:02:39.830> do<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.040> video<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.489> talks<00:02:41.000> about

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
and I'll do a video that talks about

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.490 
and I'll do a video that talks about
what's<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.140> best<00:02:42.170> way<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.620> do<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:44.019> one<00:02:45.019> way

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
what's the best way to do that one way

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.770 
what's the best way to do that one way
one<00:02:46.190> thing<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.519> understand<00:02:47.060> when<00:02:47.299> opening<00:02:47.630> up

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
one thing to understand when opening up

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.570 
one thing to understand when opening up
the<00:02:47.900> quadriceps<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.650> where<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.160> muscles

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
the quadriceps is where the muscles

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.780 
the quadriceps is where the muscles
attached<00:02:49.910> on<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.209> femur<00:02:51.040> okay<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.099> just<00:02:52.459> look

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
attached on the femur okay so just look

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.059 
attached on the femur okay so just look
at<00:02:52.910> those<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.230> need<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.530> stretch<00:02:54.860> your

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
at those so you need to stretch your

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.880 
at those so you need to stretch your
muscles<00:02:55.250> according<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.239> how<00:02:57.140> they<00:02:57.410> attach<00:02:57.860> to

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
muscles according to how they attach to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.280 
muscles according to how they attach to
the<00:02:58.400> femur<00:02:58.900> and<00:03:01.209> finally<00:03:02.209> let's<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:02.930> look<00:03:03.109> at

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
the femur and finally let's just look at

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.490 
the femur and finally let's just look at
squats<00:03:03.709> for<00:03:03.980> example<00:03:05.109> anytime<00:03:06.109> that<00:03:06.140> you

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
squats for example anytime that you

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.630 
squats for example anytime that you
squat<00:03:07.660> okay<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.720> got<00:03:08.989> weight<00:03:09.290> bearing<00:03:09.709> on

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
squat okay you got weight bearing on

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.710 
squat okay you got weight bearing on
your<00:03:10.910> on<00:03:11.209> your<00:03:11.269> spine<00:03:11.810> which<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.620> pushing<00:03:13.069> down

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
your on your spine which is pushing down

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.470 
your on your spine which is pushing down
okay<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.950> weight<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.700> going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.209> create

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
okay and that weight is going to create

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.080 
okay and that weight is going to create
a<00:03:17.600> dish<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.410> know<00:03:18.440> serious<00:03:19.160> stress<00:03:19.640> on<00:03:19.940> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
a dish you know serious stress on the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.059 
a dish you know serious stress on the
quadrille<00:03:20.569> quadriceps<00:03:21.319> coming<00:03:21.739> over<00:03:21.980> the

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
quadrille quadriceps coming over the

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.069 
quadrille quadriceps coming over the
knee<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:23.269> it's<00:03:23.540> it's<00:03:23.840> not<00:03:24.079> a<00:03:24.109> bad<00:03:24.639> lift<00:03:26.079> being

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
knee so it's it's not a bad lift being

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.479 
knee so it's it's not a bad lift being
that<00:03:27.260> it's<00:03:27.319> going<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.739> help<00:03:27.859> strengthen<00:03:28.190> your

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
that it's going to help strengthen your

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.520 
that it's going to help strengthen your
gluteals<00:03:28.940> or<00:03:29.209> quadriceps<00:03:29.810> your<00:03:29.989> hamstrings

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
gluteals or quadriceps your hamstrings

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.229 
gluteals or quadriceps your hamstrings
the<00:03:31.010> key<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:32.209> avoiding<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:33.410> pain<00:03:33.769> that<00:03:34.489> could

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
the key to avoiding the pain that could

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.420 
the key to avoiding the pain that could
potentially<00:03:35.389> come<00:03:36.290> from<00:03:36.590> doing<00:03:36.859> this<00:03:36.980> lift<00:03:37.280> is

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
potentially come from doing this lift is

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.460 
potentially come from doing this lift is
to<00:03:37.850> be<00:03:38.000> able<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.239> stretch<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.840> open<00:03:39.170> up<00:03:39.260> those

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
to be able to stretch and open up those

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.750 
to be able to stretch and open up those
quadriceps<00:03:40.569> okay<00:03:41.569> so<00:03:42.170> I<00:03:42.500> really<00:03:43.160> let's<00:03:43.370> review

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
quadriceps okay so I really let's review

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.120 
quadriceps okay so I really let's review
briefly<00:03:44.239> we<00:03:44.870> talked<00:03:45.109> about<00:03:45.260> opening<00:03:45.859> up<00:03:45.950> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
briefly we talked about opening up the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.580 
briefly we talked about opening up the
hamstrings<00:03:46.870> because<00:03:47.870> they<00:03:48.049> attached<00:03:48.319> below

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
hamstrings because they attached below

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.729 
hamstrings because they attached below
the<00:03:48.829> knee<00:03:49.040> now<00:03:49.609> we're<00:03:49.910> focusing<00:03:50.420> in<00:03:50.630> on<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
the knee now we're focusing in on the

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.890 
the knee now we're focusing in on the
quadriceps<00:03:52.459> because<00:03:53.000> they<00:03:53.180> also<00:03:53.420> attached

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
quadriceps because they also attached

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.470 
quadriceps because they also attached
below<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.739> name<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.609> next<00:03:55.819> video<00:03:56.180> I'll

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
below the name so the next video I'll

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.449 
below the name so the next video I'll
talk<00:03:56.510> briefly<00:03:57.049> about<00:03:57.290> what's<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.250> most

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
talk briefly about what's the most

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.860 
talk briefly about what's the most
effective<00:03:58.940> way<00:03:59.480> to<00:04:00.819> stretch<00:04:01.989> your<00:04:02.989> quadriceps

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
effective way to stretch your quadriceps

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.390 
effective way to stretch your quadriceps
these<00:04:05.870> are<00:04:06.049> the<00:04:06.140> three<00:04:06.379> phases<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.890> squads<00:04:09.400> all

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
these are the three phases of squads all

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.979 
these are the three phases of squads all
right<00:04:10.609> so<00:04:10.760> this<00:04:10.879> is<00:04:11.000> coach<00:04:11.209> Selby<00:04:11.629> check<00:04:11.840> it

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
right so this is coach Selby check it

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.440 
right so this is coach Selby check it
out<00:04:12.140> make<00:04:12.859> sure<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.459> really<00:04:13.790> get<00:04:14.299> in

because<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.310> really<00:04:19.519> important<00:04:20.530> in<00:04:21.759> order

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
because it's really important in order

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.979 
because it's really important in order
to<00:04:22.910> avoid<00:04:23.210> knee<00:04:23.509> pain<00:04:23.979> later
