00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 hello my pretty syringe we 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.820
 maybe already seen in the intro 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.250
 my hair first of all really 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:43.890
 bad my story of mine horne 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:48.020
 tell and my hair is blond 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.860
 and so good texture card is you 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.450
 very smooth I'm pretty straight hair 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.370
 to have because you do everything with it 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.580
 can 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.780
 And yes, I've never been to the barber 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.850
 Maybe some people do not believe me 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.690
 I really care about cutting 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.090
 mine actually always have myself 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.680
 I also had a kind of stages 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.710
 I meant that cut 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.930
 relatively well done 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:24.540
 and yes, 78 weeks or 79 weeks ago 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.009
 I keep my hair pretty short 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.290
 they were then cut off 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.229
 about as short as I can 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.569
 try to show a picture or you 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.119
 just look at my instagram account 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:39.590
 there is also a picture of me with short 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.940
 hair and yes now they are just again 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.220
 so grown relatively long and pretty 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.810
 So fast my hair 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.280
 I do not know if that's really the case 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.039
 it's grown fast if that's up to you 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.009
 also growing as fast but with the 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.039
 products that I have used now 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.569
 I'm pretty good at running and then 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.890
 I'll just take you with me and show you 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.830
 you like me my hair 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.509
 what is for products take and 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.180
 maybe there is something for you too 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:16.219
 here and yes if I like this video 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:21.010
 In the book in any case and I would 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:21.010
 now say we can directly times 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.799
 Of course, first you have to get the hair 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.139
 to wash 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:32.750
 my camera has failed she has me 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.980
 Everything with you, that's why you mean mine 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.469
 hair is pregnant now 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:43.900
 I do not have to wonder so before 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:47.769
 so nation without shampoo not because of that 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.889
 I use of potters deep cleansing 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.310
 shampoo it is really good because it is the 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.680
 Hair completely clean makes it all 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.500
 Residue game out and find it 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.750
 really good only the problem is with the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.389
 Foam is not somehow shining 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.799
 really closer you can handle it 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.739
 you did not unleash the shampoo 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:17.209
 Every industry take it because it's the hair 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.010
 can dry out with or is it 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.110
 pretty aggressive looking for when 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.570
 all 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.450
 rest of track go out because of that 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.210
 should one so once I take in 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.060
 month or once two months can 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.800
 when all the residue is left out 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.560
 then I use of fruit meant 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:41.130
 spray and cracks that my skin and 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.630
 dome the 1 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.000
 on the packaging it says that 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.830
 but should play immediately immediately 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.340
 I usually always wanted from seconds 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:56.410
 for the sake of effective so I stink 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.459
 then always better in any case 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.459
 it's the hair 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.220
 so now I am with my women 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.390
 wash dry so I bring that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.730
 water out like a unicorn and out 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.329
 one begins to warm up for something at 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.220
 dried with an oil of cool 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.440
 the deep structure 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.320
 But you have to be careful that you only have it 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.550
 in the length and tips do not enter 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.390
 because the hair is done 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.660
 become 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.160
 therefore only in the length and that makes 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:44.930
 The Horner again nice and supple 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:48.430
 and are small then I use coke 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.680
 bugs of which one more 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.410
 fingertips amount the sz 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:06.380
 and while doing that again before 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:09.000
 my pension out there at one 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.410
 keep temperature to the set that 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.850
 equal to the main-peak no 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:19.340
 and that should make the way so should 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:26.030
 the tips to kind of sealing the leak 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:28.740
 the basin with spikes and javi sz 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.009
 I dome with my behind with the 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.340
 so never go against the mark 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.840
 splits up lackangelware and yes arises 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.150
 just do not sprout it that way 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:46.080
 healthy and then upside down or Finnish 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.120
 upside down, and my scalp four to 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.270
 for five minutes that holds the copper 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.449
 is perfused and thus grow or 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.259
 again 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.259
 extra 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.530
 When I did that, I go 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.490
 not available again either and tom 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.410
 my neck 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.949
 the red line that is a scratch of 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:33.639
 my cat so now more after chemically 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:35.319
 front so decide sensor with one 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.410
 kamm is maybe not quite like that 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:43.770
 practically so with me it works fine because 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:45.699
 I have a plate this chance but 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.770
 if humans it may be one 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.569
 the Maltese help a little bit 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.279
 normal person 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.189
 when a body of a woman and liked 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:58.550
 I've already seen the fresh 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:07:02.529
 with cam at the bottom of anm tips because 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.529
 then fail less weeks 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:13.139
 a chemical go you see I have 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.139
 my face almost 70 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.400
 so you can drive properly now 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.340
 combed 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:34.630
 and now you see my hair the her 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.870
 look dried and what length you 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:40.090
 Everything has been cut down smoothly 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:43.300
 turn it finally also admitted only 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:46.360
 cut and yes that's just that 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.449
 result my name faro china both 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:52.139
 relapse and looks again on a 

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:52.139
 channel over
