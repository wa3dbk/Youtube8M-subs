I<00:01:23.470> think<00:01:24.070> Janelle's<00:01:24.460> technique<00:01:24.940> is<00:01:25.150> the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
I think Janelle's technique is the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.050 
I think Janelle's technique is the
strongest<00:01:26.110> of<00:01:26.350> any<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.190> girl<00:01:27.400> finalists
