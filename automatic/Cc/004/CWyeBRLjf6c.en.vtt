at each other in the press room when I

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.700 
at each other in the press room when I
went<00:00:55.970> for<00:00:56.150> the<00:00:56.239> simplification<00:00:57.019> on<00:00:57.559> the

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
went for the simplification on the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.209 
went for the simplification on the
queenside<00:00:57.949> I<00:00:59.379> first<00:01:00.379> idea<00:01:00.680> was<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:00.860> play<00:01:01.010> green

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219

sea<00:01:01.430> for<00:01:02.079> instead<00:01:03.079> of<00:01:03.260> registry<00:01:04.300> and<00:01:05.300> I<00:01:05.449> think

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
sea for instead of registry and I think

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.359 
sea for instead of registry and I think
this<00:01:05.810> is<00:01:05.869> maybe<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.380> only<00:01:07.009> interesting

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
this is maybe the only interesting

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.910 
this is maybe the only interesting
moment<00:01:07.670> but<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.690> I<00:01:08.810> not<00:01:08.990> associate<00:01:09.619> with

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
moment but and I not associate with

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
almost disappears so after that I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.670 
almost disappears so after that I
decided<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.190> try<00:01:19.310> Bishop<00:01:19.700> x3<00:01:20.149> but<00:01:20.420> then<00:01:20.680> we

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
decided to try Bishop x3 but then we

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.740 
decided to try Bishop x3 but then we

missed six beams we locate through I

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
today for the official website had seen

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.340 
today for the official website had seen
an<00:01:38.900> improvement<00:01:39.020> for<00:01:39.530> Anand<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:41.150> was<00:01:41.360> if<00:01:41.810> white

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
an improvement for Anand it was if white

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.490 
an improvement for Anand it was if white
plays<00:01:42.670> Quincy<00:01:43.670> for<00:01:43.880> instead<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.299> Bishop<00:01:44.780> g7<00:01:44.990> I

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
plays Quincy for instead of Bishop g7 I

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.010 
plays Quincy for instead of Bishop g7 I
think<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.579> was<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.850> point<00:01:47.180> where<00:01:47.450> white

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
think that was the point where white

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.080 
think that was the point where white
could<00:01:48.430> maintain<00:01:49.430> his<00:01:50.119> pressure<00:01:52.090> obviously

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
could maintain his pressure obviously

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.780 
could maintain his pressure obviously
black<00:01:53.509> is<00:01:53.720> able<00:01:54.110> to<00:01:54.290> defend<00:01:54.650> but<00:01:55.009> maybe<00:01:55.520> he

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
black is able to defend but maybe he

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.899 
black is able to defend but maybe he
would<00:01:55.939> have<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.680> defend<00:01:57.680> quite<00:01:58.100> passively<00:01:58.790> and

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
would have to defend quite passively and

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.050 
would have to defend quite passively and
for<00:01:59.450> quite<00:02:00.200> some<00:02:00.530> time<00:02:00.560> I'm<00:02:01.399> not<00:02:01.579> sure<00:02:01.640> maybe

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
for quite some time I'm not sure maybe

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.230 
for quite some time I'm not sure maybe
black<00:02:02.630> can<00:02:03.040> actually<00:02:04.040> make<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.280> draw<00:02:04.759> easily

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
black can actually make a draw easily
