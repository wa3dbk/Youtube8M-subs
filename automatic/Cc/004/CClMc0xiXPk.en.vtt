more<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.500> comes<00:00:16.859> with<00:00:17.010> double<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> RAM<00:00:17.520> in

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
more and comes with double the RAM in

more and comes with double the RAM in
internal<00:00:18.180> storage<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.770> video<00:00:20.010> let's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
internal storage so in this video let's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.220 
internal storage so in this video let's
take<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.550> look<00:00:20.670> at<00:00:20.760> what's<00:00:21.000> new<00:00:21.210> with<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> a6000

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
take a look at what's new with the a6000

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.009 
take a look at what's new with the a6000
plus<00:00:22.439> da<00:00:23.070> 6000<00:00:23.670> plus<00:00:23.880> looks<00:00:24.269> identical<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
plus da 6000 plus looks identical to the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.740 
plus da 6000 plus looks identical to the
original<00:00:25.220> a6000<00:00:26.250> barring<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.269> changes<00:00:27.660> I

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
original a6000 barring the two changes I

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.960 
original a6000 barring the two changes I
mentioned<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.740> rest<00:00:28.949> remains<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.550> same<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
mentioned the rest remains the same and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.640 
mentioned the rest remains the same and
hence<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.480> reason<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.929> videos<00:00:31.320> gonna<00:00:31.560> be

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
hence the reason this videos gonna be

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.450 
hence the reason this videos gonna be
real<00:00:31.920> short

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
real short

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.729 
real short
basically<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.570> performance<00:00:34.079> improves<00:00:34.500> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
basically the performance improves and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.170 
basically the performance improves and
the<00:00:34.829> change<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.219> reflected<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> synthetic

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the change is reflected in the synthetic

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.900 
the change is reflected in the synthetic
benchmarks<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.829> CPU<00:00:38.129> based<00:00:38.340> benchmarks

like<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.149> bench<00:00:39.390> 3<00:00:39.629> tho<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> rest<00:00:40.559> that

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
like a bench 3 tho but on the rest that

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.709 
like a bench 3 tho but on the rest that
take<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> extra<00:00:41.399> ROM<00:00:41.610> into<00:00:41.879> account<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
take the extra ROM into account the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.410 
take the extra ROM into account the
scores<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.290> higher<00:00:43.440> than<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> a6000<00:00:44.730> so

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
scores are higher than on the a6000 so

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.510 
scores are higher than on the a6000 so
to<00:00:45.510> give<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.660> guys<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> refresher<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.770> a6000
