00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
stand out especially nowadays like

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.220 
stand out especially nowadays like
there's<00:03:11.430> four<00:03:11.700> million<00:03:12.239> guys<00:03:12.510> doing<00:03:12.810> realism

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
there's four million guys doing realism

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.949 
there's four million guys doing realism
so<00:03:13.830> it's<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.910> got<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.239> do<00:03:15.360> something<00:03:15.870> a

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
so it's like you got to do something a

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.750 
so it's like you got to do something a
little<00:03:15.989> bit<00:03:16.320> different<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:17.070> example<00:03:17.190> there's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
little bit different for example there's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.630 
little bit different for example there's
a<00:03:17.850> Krusty<00:03:18.239> dog<00:03:18.420> was<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.950> two-dimensional<00:03:19.950> piece

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
a Krusty dog was a two-dimensional piece

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.130 
a Krusty dog was a two-dimensional piece
but<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.060> was<00:03:21.330> able<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.660> make<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.930> more

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
but I was able to make it more

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.420 
but I was able to make it more
three-dimensional<00:03:22.800> just<00:03:23.070> because<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.370> the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
three-dimensional just because of the

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.500 
three-dimensional just because of the
knowledge<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.820> I've<00:03:24.030> gained<00:03:24.209> throughout
