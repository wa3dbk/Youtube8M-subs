00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.560
 because no precaution 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.390
 I already come before the matches 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.390
 always a little because there is a small 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.390
 annoyance but we can not say what 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.060
 pass 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.230
 it was a complicated match good as 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.230
 all the matches of the Americans 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.529
 perhaps deconcentrations did not happen 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.420
 invoice that we allow we do not leave 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.580
 flip scattered but beyond that 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.020
 we did not lose is that he does not look with much 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.620
 respect now what happens 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 yes 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.620
 it was a Peruvian team with a lot 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.329
 delivery not with much self-esteem 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.300
 and I think they do not see success different 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.610
 field if we are united and then 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.440
 if the union enough union in this group 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.380
 that's what stood out the most in our 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.320
 group the key is to believe in one 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.140
 same and have much faith in your internet 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.270
 stage if they follow their relatives 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.520
 I have been told that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.659
 but I take a lot of peace because 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.909
 we are just starting the first 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.770
 party are Americans I have three left 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.719
 games to play and lots 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.719
 tranquility internet the view 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.020
 Well the first thing that would be different 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.360
 he lives from inside and see what's outside 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.820
 it feels feels different is not another 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.550
 truth and not the rest quiet but 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.970
 major mistakes corrected 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.950
 first outing I had but did not have 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.990
 to leave because he also came with everyone 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.030
 and companions a little far 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.860
 yes good in edition editions in 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.869
 thousandths of a second they take a 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.300
 instantly make the decision I'm not going to 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.550
 come out and well now I was saying goodbye to me 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.619
 it helped a lot I'll get to the second 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.550
 ball 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.550
 90 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.550
