00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:17.619
 go to France thirsty hours today with a splint we talk about 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:18.230
 football 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.640
 but table football you are the new evil pawn of France of 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 baby foot 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.900
 but it's been a while since I had the chance to win the championships of 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.310
 france table football 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.340
 so that's how it's called at a table football and so could 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.840
 it happened on the 12th 13th - so it was also 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.820
 so I won the proof of painted drawings 10 8% 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.720
 in men in a corner it is he who makes the kingdom south africa is dead 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.870
 was quiet then how become champion of France football 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.720
 of table 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.040
 but we become champion of France table football and that many 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.760
 a lot of workout like in any sport against 19 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.930
 although we unfortunately do not have the gratitude do porter 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.450
 currently 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.510
 let's say it takes a lot of training 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.120
 but a lot of playing time so for having done a lot of tournaments 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.510
 escaped he plays with a different table and so that when we want 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.570
 progress on the international scene inquiry it's all a circuit 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.130
 international a bit like we were united know that the system atp 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.580
 so we have a table tournaments tornado jumped table neither 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.740
 et cetera and therefore knowing that in my opinion beat the american on a toro rosso 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.170
 it's not easy to do because it can not have you on it 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.170
 exactly that's true guys we know and all year long 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.909
 the point on the breakthrough hours of training cashed a fall 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.150
 it's really a lot of training hours because you 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.479
 bamba party 10 football 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.560
 it's something of really very little time that it takes 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.740
 a lot of skill agility studies per year 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.210
 a lot of dexterity and it's really very technical 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.890
 so it really takes a lot of training hours to get 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.650
 can achieve things differently in a perfect way as a footballer 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.770
