00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.259
 and there folks of the mercosul linux rs only that 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.050
 converts the flame to 2 and until finally 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:17.060
 came the update for him, right? 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:22.320
 moranga the number one here is seeing the 667 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:25.010
 was the pilot another number right and was 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.349
 for 667 you 're giving me the one that's 66 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.240
 8.0 was even a person who told me 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.030
 huh 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.090
 two people stepped on the first 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.860
 the second one is not even that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:47.039
 6 680 kHz 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:50.760
 jm ecf state 30 megas is who cleared 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.739
 age and the blog is not ready 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.260
 still please wait 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.690
 according to him he speaks and we will update in 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 the update is always very quiet 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.339
 a lot so have to talk is going 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.700
 fast because it's 30 mega just right 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.700
 staff generally do not have much to 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.229
 is also quickly curl is provided 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 It's time to start now. 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.770
 he 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.200
 the version 1 5 point that is the newell's 7 already 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.420
 has a beta available to you 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:39.890
 install on the right device 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.890
 we used there updating 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.090
 very simple but took this update 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.160
 delayed 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.930
 usually the update was such that she 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.890
 was around 15 days that I 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.010
 I think it lasted more than 15 days, right? 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.010
 I just wanted to do it after 11 just one 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.270
 observation and after that when I 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.729
 I got the cell phone 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.920
 He was with one I go I'm going to talk 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:12.260
 This is for you to remember about it. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:16.280
 of the monumental staff a little bit 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.680
 when I bought yours there and it arrived 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.350
 you used the volume is that 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:28.239
 more and less sometimes he failed to 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.239
 increase and decrease the name 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.030
 I walked here a little bit 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.150
 it does not seem to have major changes 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.580
 They did not tell me that either. 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:53.250
 no right to that which is only a bug 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.040
 small and so only changed 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.500
 the last numbers of the version age 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.250
 Let's restart wealth or not it will 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.250
 manage right 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.270
 ninety-Pauline looks like 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.400
 I do not want to leave right here, do not you? 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:36.019
 Let's go the package so we're seeing there 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.019
 Let's go, shall we? 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.280
 takes a little bit even his boot 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.750
 it's not the fastest he is 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.919
 really a little more time consuming in 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.919
 other appliances 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.250
 Come on, let's go. 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.370
 It was a bit more for now, my block. 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.560
 on the hand means you have not prepared yet 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.520
 there is no completed system load 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.520
 operational 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.160
 the Paraguayan has a tent here and 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:33.510
 this progression should be the last one there 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:35.460
 that if it is indeed the update of it only 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.450
 when you get on the street the new version 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.400
 How far alone did he live and 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.960
 tests I've seen it saves more 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.960
 Battery is faster 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.400
 have in a demonstration video there that 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:57.360
 they there they do demonstration 2006 in 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.230
 miu miu ratio at 7 in speed and 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.230
 battery saving 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.920
 it in here 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:22.599
 Half is personal Let's just wait for more 

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:29.639
 A little bit and see is to see they are delayed 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:29.639
 here we go 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.830
 It was a bit lacking here, now it seems 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.830
 which is faster 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:02.870
 to end up practically over in such a way 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.980
 see if I can not remember now if he comes back 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.510
 for the operating system will be 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.470
 restarted smooth or I'm here 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.580
 wait 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:18.610
 That's what I wanted to tell you. 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.610
 before he was not right here 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:30.430
 beauty has all touched the 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.430
 minimum right 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.319
 if I find anything different with 

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:39.319
 I'm sure I'll make a video but the version 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:52.339
 here it is already at the last nÃ© 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:55.159
 to six points 6,867 personnel then that is 

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.729
 very quiet very smooth without problem 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:57.439
 some 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:59.389
 if you like it be still much 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:01.809
 important pro channel thank you so much more 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.809
