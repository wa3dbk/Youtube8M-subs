00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.210
 very good ladies hello grains health 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.570
 educational I bring you a gameplay of 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.400
 call of duty world at war and well then 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.080
 I will comment a little about whites 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.589
 2 not since it has shown us a lot 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.090
 things pictures while I narrated this 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.640
 supposedly the soil will come out in 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.260
 a few hours the trailer for 26 of 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.330
 September this video I do not know what will be 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.250
 hung up but let's talk a little bit about 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.040
 placo 2 there is not everything we have 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.830
 learned from the ancients with those of 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.949
 I have practically everything of everything from 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.859
 the backups from the arms balance 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.320
 the 16 and many others in this queue of 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:40.390
 negative saying that not that white 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.190
 everything is going to be a mess that this 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.980
 the other but we have to think 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.149
 seriously I think that white 2 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.969
 I was fine looking for more information 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.359
 there seems to be the call of duty is 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.219
 the one that has invested the most there a lot 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.749
 money practically out there is it 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.329
 says it's going to be the best color and tyc 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:04.659
 maybe yes maybe we do not do not yet know 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.369
 but they are opinions of people who have 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.270
 played this debut color and they have made him 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.130
 an analysis 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.500
 and he has put his blogs not already commented 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.229
 you know that this white 2 is going to be the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.950
 Best yuty eye eye color is what they say 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.259
 the analysts 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.270
 they did to this I share the opinion 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.479
 what these people say and to see the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.000
 good opinion one thing 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.060
 disappointing that happened as of warfare 3 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.800
 it was the damn spawn respawn I think to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.580
 they all did and I play it for the damn 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.620
 backing that you kill someone and good 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.479
 it always comes out appears in front of the 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.850
 person an enemy person and it kills you or 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.610
 vice versa not totals behind someone or 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.040
 someone leaves gratin sympathetically and he 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.500
 Answer infinity ward is a garbage is 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.880
 a crap we do not know that there is 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.260
 do for this you have to give a chance to 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.780
 people to crash not practically 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.720
 as the last chance are not throwing him 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.850
 so much shit to black ops remember that 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.190
 the people of trier have a good 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.470
 writer who is campaigning that 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.570
 be one of the batman writers of the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.300
 last movie we have a great team 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.550
 or a special team for everything that is 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.250
 zombie mode something that everyone 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.260
 wait, not me too, but 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.150
 basically that's something new and good 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.040
 Well, what we all most expect is that 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.230
 there are no problems of the alien 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.020
 practically nothing that everything works 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.660
 ok for both playstation3 and 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.220
 I will show zetas because a lot of people say 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.799
 it is not the comment that every boy 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.450
 Then he tells me why you burn to xbox 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.970
 because here we pay online 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.790
 obviously our white connection 2 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.769
 it's going to be much better but the people 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.530
 destroy yesterday you think too 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.489
 a little bit is that if I have a 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.819
 Playstation 3 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.010
 Obviously it is the visual that is free and if 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.930
 your people of trailers are selling a 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.319
 game for playstation 3 also 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.200
 you should put the same emphasis and the 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.590
 same love and the same desire to his game 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.140
 whether that the online game request 3 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.049
 you do not pay and it's free you should do what 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.890
 yes or no, it 's like that I come 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.380
 I'm going to sell I do not know candy to a 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.239
 neighborhood of millionaires and every time 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.000
 a millionaire bought me candy jure 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.290
 luther the shoes and obviously if I 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.390
 I'm going to sell candies are neighborhoods 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.890
 poor and the poor instead of you those 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.049
 grasses I read nothing this seems to me a 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.280
 barbasada is something like that to put a 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.500
 example so that you understand what it is 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.140
 basically if you're going to sell something you have 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.430
 that be for both equal not this is my 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.170
 point of view and I think a lot of people 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.230
 he will also share that with him to 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.609
 all but the people already promised the beat 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.150
 will heart promised he was not going to 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.950
 see nothing 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.540
 we hope you remember that they look in ways 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.400
 zombies mode is going to be 4 4 against 4 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.950
 remember that in high rounds when 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.360
 you play 4 inclusive when you play as 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.430
 for example and in my case when I played 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.500
 with gringos friends here in the black ops 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.540
 lace black ops in your glasses the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.359
 zombie mode us with good connection 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.459
 at level 30 if we get a little 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.799
 level 30 images of level 40 and 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.319
 upset the left and we were 4 with very 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.510
 good connection let's hope that the people of 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.909
 Trier actually makes up for that lake that 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.430
 do not make us not take the hair that 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.980
 practically true is what all 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.470
 we want 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.010
 what about the weapons that according to the other 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.240
 Well, you will have to wait 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.150
 will have to wait for it sometimes to 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.790
 eat in a previous video there is no need to 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.889
 be talking bad about white 2 and 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.710
 we have not played and not even not 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.310
 listen say take the time to read 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.169
 analysis of people or better said 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.820
 people who say such a weapon is good 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.470
 is the map is good if it has not been 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.229
 played I ask you what sorcerers wait in 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.330
 a moment or at least if someone is going to 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.770
 comment are a map see that a 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.380
 gameplay that person that this game in 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.449
 that map given his point of view saying 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.150
 this is good and the bad thing is there 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.310
 not that it is correct but it will be necessary 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.410
 wait 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.120
 something else and there is no need to 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.120
 get discouraged no no no no no no 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.070
 be super ecstatic or excited about 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.290
 Suddenly speaking everything is going to be crap 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.610
 who knows or can suddenly be better 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.980
 with the best politician I did not say it to 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.090
 start this example will have to wait for my 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.980
 dear friend but what about the 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.730
 rays you with the light gusts of 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.340
 candle and mud 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.300
 I already know that a lot of death streak I 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.480
 I ask people who are fond 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.020
 of color and so on you would like to see many 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.270
 streaks 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.220
 well I know what sport I do not like 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.540
 there is so much death streak so much I want 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.630
 strike I think suddenly with 459 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.580
 with five death streak would be very 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.639
 well and what 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.620
 with high gusts to get us a fashion 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.860
 not only induces the camping by 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.229
 example in my case when there were episodes 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:56.979
 when he pulled the harrier or leicester sack 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:58.599
 and it 's because there are several types of champion 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.150
 or practically the shameless person who 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:05.639
 stay the corner and like a piece of 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.639
 seated there 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.259
 but that is more tactical but it is not 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.169
 tactical play is tactical country is the 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:20.409
 that kills 12 and goes and runs to the 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:23.110
 place is this safe and looks for your enemy 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.580
 is a tactical camp for example is not 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.710
 this disgusting campero that all 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.110
 we know not the one that is there in a skin 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.599
 you wait for eyes or here some apples 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.150
 for nothing else this is the campero 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:36.069
 what can happen to the white 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.830
 forest that is obviously what it is that 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.840
 will see mistakes and I said it is not going 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.219
 to see the backup is obviously going to be 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.020
 there as totally safe and they will 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:44.729
 obviously repair the people of trier what 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.889
 sweep for 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:49.229
 in which we are going to see hopefully not 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.909
 There is luck for nothing I hope to be able 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.759
 play with people from Latin America or 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:54.930
 European or Asian or from Africa of Mars 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.360
 pain 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.300
 I do not care it can be playing very well 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.680
 but I think I want to go crazy 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.050
 messes that others expect from dishes 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.720
 The is the multiplayer mode or the mode 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.340
 zombies 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.729
 who suffer from zombie mode you 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.650
 disappoints 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:13.449
 just stop playing the multiplayer mode 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.190
 let's leave or suddenly you're going to 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:17.470
 dedicate yourself to the multiplayer cube and do not 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.380
 you are going to give ball to the zombies 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.330
 it's a good question yes or no good but 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.170
 we will have to wait for everything rightly 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.970
 26 put the trailer and I repeat this 

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.820
 simple gesture that achieved on day 25 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:32.680
 when he told you the 25th but to know 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.740
 the impressions people do not because to 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.390
 that we are white two new maps for 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.340
 zombies we have seen two in the images 

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.590
 but we will see that it unites others not 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.110
 new weapons for zombies that weapons 

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.400
 we will see we do not know what weapon will be the classroom 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.950
 I really liked the talk 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.750
 he turned babies into kickers 

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.830
 we will not see was happy it was 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.200
 an improved queen a wander waffles 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.540
 and now I say it's going to look like 

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.490
 I believe
