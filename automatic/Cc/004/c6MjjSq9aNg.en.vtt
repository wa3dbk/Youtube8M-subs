00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.410
 let's do today is couscous with payment 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.070

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.940
 The following couscous ingredients came 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.120

 red pepper chive something a 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.320
 tomato roughly this size is from 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.960
 bigger so split in half 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.670
 half onion and about 300 grams of turkey 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.449
 Well, we can start with the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.449
 preparation of the recipe 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 Y 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.780
 The first thing we are going to do before 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.689
 nothing is to take the turkey and we're going to 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.270
 cut into small strips more or less than 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.009
 this size 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.060
 now we will take the chive and what 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.469
 we will apply in very small pieces 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.780
 once it has carried the chive 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.460
 what we have done is to make the turkey zealous and 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.770
 a plant I forgot to say it among the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.659
 ingredients we are going to include the juice of 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.049
 a lemon that we are going to take it for 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.869
 on top of this we will move it 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.380
 everything very well and we will let it marinate 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.909
 for about 20 minutes 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.590
 while we allow the payment to macerate what 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.420
 let's go doing is cutting the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.489
 vegetables and let's start by the middle 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.489
 onion that we are going to cut into slices 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.479
 now that we have cut the average 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.450
 onion what we are going to do is cut 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.040
 the average pepper so we will catch and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.930
 we are going to start it in very thin sheets 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.880
 the red pepper we will make the same 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.220
 operation that with the green we will take it 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.460
 we'll cut it in half and what 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.500

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.540

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.730
 we have left to marinate for 20 minutes 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.440
 and we will leave it until it is done and 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.360
 once done we will remove it 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.130
 while the patient the turkey what 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.200
 we have done is to take in a container and 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.180
 throw approximately 100 grams of 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.800
 couscous which is roughly equivalent 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.110
 for three people and what are we going to 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.670

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.220
 of water and we 're going to heat it up 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.050
 boil in the microwave once served 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.630

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.630
 stop a stream of olive oil 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.360

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.670
 very very well 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.340
 and now that everything is well mixed what 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.450
 let's throw in the couscous and we're going to 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.340

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.990
 now that it is already good is the payment what 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.990
 let's do this 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.390
 and put it aside on a plate 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.400
 once the turkey is removed what we are going to 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.920
 do now in the same pan is to throw 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.650
 the onion that we have cut before together 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.180
 with feelings while the cold 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.480

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.129
 now it is to cut the tomato in cubes 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.120
 now that we see that the vegetables are already 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.120
 is listening what we 're going 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.959
 the vegetable now that we already have almost 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.620

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.840
 straight and now the tomato that we have chopped 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.000
 and we are going to reduce everything until 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.920
 let's see that there is a kind of tantita 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.840
 which it is what we observe now 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.060
 I have thrown the tomato and the chicken what yes 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.680

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.920
 let's add salt and it's a bit 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.610
 Pepper 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.380
 to the taste of each one 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.850
 now as long as you finish doing the 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.680
 vegetable with the turkey what we are going to do 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.750
 is to take the couscous that we have 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.859
 thrown before the water and we're going to 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.900
 shelling with the help of a fork 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.789
 once they have been doing the 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.580
 vegetable we see how he has placed a 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:31.280
 kind of caldillo you see this this is the 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.020
 sauce that we want the couscous to absorb 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.360
 so that what we are going to do now is 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.090
 remove this from the fire and we're going to 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.580
 mix everything now we will make the payment 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.759
 with the vegetable inside the bowl where 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.979
 we have put the couscous there goes perfect 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.740
 little by little he sees how he is falling too 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.389
 what is the aida salsita that is going to 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.770
 absorb the couscous right now and it's going to 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.409
 catch all the flavor 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.039
 Now the only thing that remains is to catch 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.599
 and mix everything very well once 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.319
