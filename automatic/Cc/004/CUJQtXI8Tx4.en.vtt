00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
pretty cool actually watch me do this

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.600 
pretty cool actually watch me do this
with<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.440> touch<00:02:14.620> pads<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:15.100> can<00:02:15.250> kind<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.430> see

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
with the touch pads they can kind of see

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.960 
with the touch pads they can kind of see
out<00:02:15.730> works<00:02:16.690> together<00:02:17.580> I'm<00:02:18.580> not<00:02:18.670> sure<00:02:18.760> if

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
out works together I'm not sure if

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.310 
out works together I'm not sure if
you're<00:02:19.090> supposed<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.510> get<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.750> Ducks<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.140> think

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
you're supposed to get the Ducks I think

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.280 
you're supposed to get the Ducks I think
those<00:02:20.500> are<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.920> objective<00:02:21.930> hopefully<00:02:25.290> this

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
those are the objective hopefully this

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.100 
those are the objective hopefully this
is<00:02:26.440> really<00:02:26.709> bad<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:28.360> case<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.750> can't<00:02:28.990> tell

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
is really bad in case you can't tell

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.810 
is really bad in case you can't tell
because<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:30.250> OE<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.270> not<00:02:31.600> designed<00:02:32.050> for<00:02:32.820> touch

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
because the OE is not designed for touch

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.180 
because the OE is not designed for touch
screen<00:02:33.880> games<00:02:34.570> which<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.320> what<00:02:35.470> most<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:36.070> the
