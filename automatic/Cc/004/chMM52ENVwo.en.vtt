00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.190
 new technique sloth video 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.290
 I still have the windows here 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.710
 extension to gigaset elements 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.389
 Starterset here the window sensor and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.280
 we'll just unpack that 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.310
 install it and add it to the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.430
 other devices called the part 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.920
 itself window on or tilted windows 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.470
 So tell you the condition of a window 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.869
 same function in the end will also 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.720
 already d'or but with the additional feature 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.730
 The thing is allegedly also tilted 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.380
 I'm glad that's true 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.760
 gigaset elements on the way 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.300
 a look battery powered blah blah 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.790
 bla bla bla 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.190
 that's inside gigaset elements window 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.110
 Window sensor and the battery that is 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.430
 very nice then we call the whole 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:53.760
 once and look in and we 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:58.370
 get our instructions very easy 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.770
 start guarantee explanation 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.149
 installation instructions but that is 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.090
 again the same high construction 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:12.960
 like the door sensor okay okay okay 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.790
 and then let's have a look 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 The main part was also the battery 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.250
 must go in and once the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:28.350
 holding device so we make a tinker 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.520
 Round and that is not as if 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.340
 I would have done that before 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.799
 at least with the door sensor first the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.729
 Battery purely once so look around the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.820
 should hold 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.009
 then shut up monkey dead now 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.090
 of course the question why is the thing 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.649
 now that's the back there are the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.070
 lettering above 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.360
 then that would be the front so writing around 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.640
 very nice 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.710
 The device is already directly attached to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.049
 flashing and of course looking for now 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.610
 the base station but we want 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.560
 Of course, first thing to the door 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.270
 attach we have to look here 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.680
 insert the battery 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.899
 adhesive strips in the middle of the back 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.260
 from window and then at window 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.470
 establish 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.060
 and now you should note your new window 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.620
 You can also sign up for it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.629
 and place it elsewhere what I here 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.400
 unfortunately not see how is where I pack 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.450
 I have the best to the window 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.239
 or at the door 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.640
 but how did you get stuck? 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.599
 Strikes twice so I can do them 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.950
 one more time to place later 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.540
 Then I grab now time is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.280
 of course interesting glue again 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.840
 I that under the sensor I stick that 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 the sensor probably should 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.310
 actually no role at all 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.040
 I'll just pack the thing with me now 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.629
 here on the back, next, tell us 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.879
 the instruction we should the window 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.549
 sensor near the base station 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.230
 and then grab the app in there 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.120
 you can also see the system overview 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.549
 already add the point we make 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.409
 but directly choose a sensor camera 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.269
 all others are now the camera 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.609
 that does not look like all the others 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.190
 sensors but pressed at the same time 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.959
 the pairing button on base figure and 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.510
 a maximum of one meter away from the sensor 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.299
 until the LED on the sensor stops flashing 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.419
 hmm well then we press now 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.329
 both buttons that would be up here then 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:25.870
 and at the base station 321 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.190
 Simultaneously press the sensor 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.879
 no longer blinking that was now 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.079
 continuously if that has been enough 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.940
 I'm very excited 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:39.400
 No, the flashing still continues 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.139
 Let's press base stations again and 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.540
 sensor also maybe kenia both 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.160
 first so the pairing mode like us 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.410
 For example, from bluetooth know so 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.780
 Now both are blinking wildly back and forth 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:56.049
 the base station is no longer and the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:59.440
 window sensor also does not think himself free 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.400
 Let's go back there as well 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.079
 nothing so push both buttons again 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.019
 we just hold down that can 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.510
 not at all to be as hard as it 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.069
 go both in the search mode and me 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.599
 still keep the buttons pressed 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.250
 now it looks good 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.440
 Add successful to the trick 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.370
 you have to come first where do you bring 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.710
 the window 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:30.300
 three simple outside a balcony like that 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.520
 finished now we stick the thing on 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.460
 the balcony door then I just pull the 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.570
 foil on the back and glue the 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:44.370
 now just here at the door 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:46.350
 so holds sits breathes under the scent of 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.530
 sensor now sticks to the balcony door we 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.840
 please continue to open this now 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.520
 window to wake up the sensor new 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.510
 I would have the camera over otherwise 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.280
 must set door is open, let 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:05.220
 Guess the window is closing now 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:07.520
 again is window to the window is 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.980
 to press 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.900
 of course, I am interested in the 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.670
 most of the option with the tilt 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.040
 yes I have it now on the balcony door 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.900
 packed and not at the window because that 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.090
 on the balcony for me now more meaning 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.640
 makes you great in the window 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.310
 sensor most successfully set 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.310
 the window sensor opened the window 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.580
 window is open next the 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.500
 stops working 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.910
 that's it but interested now 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.460
 me, of course, I 'll just become easy 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.230
 times the window tilt very very cool 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.450
 and we now see in the survey that 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.520
 window is tilted that works 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.530
 So so the window sensor detects 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.990
 not just on but too tilted 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.910
 that was the decor a bit hakelig 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.380
 to press the buttons and with the 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.220
 that you have the device in the vicinity 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.690
 Of course I have to do that now 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.670
 right at the beginning again very different 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.230
 made of the feeling but it 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.850
 works and I'm happy now 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.520
 on it in the next few weeks that 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.270
 complete set continues to be extensive 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.250
 test 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.110
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.110
 and bye video bye
