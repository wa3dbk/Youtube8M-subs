00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.700
 Hello and welcome to the labeling Joy today I do 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.120
 I like my active return flights 

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.019
 and 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.689
 The operation is a lot of fun when traveling to Basel 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:17.239
 At this point we can tell you something you might already have 

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:20.579
 After cooking Wuppertal I would be very happy, of course 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.789
 now he is gone 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.240
 I have prepared something so well and so I have the here 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.249
 Children pre-cooked in hot water 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.310
 Of course, then she does not need to go on 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.330
 we give 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.120
 something Bogdahn 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.080
 such as 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.850
 Basta and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.970
 a bit queasy 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.600
 and screens scary of course always check that for a week 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.480
 right, it's your job 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.740
 expand a small group 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.260
 there is the schedule for the press 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.460
 and that's why this time and the little one on Bochum was patz 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.530
 last, it has a bit here 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.609
 to publish the last leg to Le grand-bornand this time 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.380
 APA a thriller then as we actually already at 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.960
 have in the past night 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.619
 then comes 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.619
 unusual 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 and our water moved 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.290
 alarmingly last 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.540
 7 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 in this regard 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.450
 This is how a large number of people come to work 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.819
 is 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.979
 that also influence the recovered dead should go there too 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.099
 I have my center of life here 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.140
 and I'm done so far 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.579
 Vanitas, of course, dance-loving 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.109
 deliver 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.569
 and on layers 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.569
 by saying 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.719
 Marien 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.679
 Rheine 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:27.679
 only so could 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.269
 yes so the pace was right up 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.269
 Released in March and so we knew 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.079
 and it goes into the oven 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.950
 Menden an hour is then left untreated 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.599
 I definitely want to wait a little more serenity available after that 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.959
 and then
