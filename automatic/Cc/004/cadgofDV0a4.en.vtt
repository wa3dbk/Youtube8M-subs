okay it's pretty average for this this
price<00:04:26.630> range<00:04:26.870> now<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.740> thing<00:04:27.949> that<00:04:28.160> I<00:04:28.220> did

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
price range now this thing that I did

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.969 
price range now this thing that I did
not<00:04:28.940> like<00:04:29.270> about<00:04:29.300> both<00:04:29.840> of<00:04:29.900> these<00:04:30.199> is<00:04:30.530> the

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
not like about both of these is the

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.310 
not like about both of these is the
resolution<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:32.330> resolution<00:04:32.870> on<00:04:32.930> these<00:04:33.110> are

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
resolution the resolution on these are

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.860

1280<00:04:33.770> by<00:04:33.949> 800<00:04:34.190> for<00:04:34.699> each<00:04:34.880> of<00:04:35.090> them<00:04:35.240> so<00:04:35.690> the

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
1280 by 800 for each of them so the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.480 
1280 by 800 for each of them so the
larger<00:04:36.199> 10<00:04:36.380> inch<00:04:36.530> version<00:04:36.860> you<00:04:37.010> don't<00:04:37.220> get<00:04:37.430> a

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
larger 10 inch version you don't get a

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.250 
larger 10 inch version you don't get a
better<00:04:37.789> resolution<00:04:38.150> on<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.720> it's<00:04:38.870> very<00:04:39.050> low

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
better resolution on it it's very low

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.620 
better resolution on it it's very low
res<00:04:39.500> very<00:04:40.010> low<00:04:40.400> res<00:04:40.639> they're<00:04:40.880> both<00:04:41.000> IPS<00:04:41.479> screen

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
res very low res they're both IPS screen

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.360 
res very low res they're both IPS screen

the same amount of battery very
difference<00:05:34.789> is<00:05:34.940> just<00:05:34.970> for<00:05:35.449> the<00:05:35.570> differences

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
difference is just for the differences

could get around 10 hours 10 to 12 if

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.060 
could get around 10 hours 10 to 12 if
you're<00:05:44.930> doing<00:05:45.199> really<00:05:45.440> really<00:05:45.830> heavy<00:05:45.979> duty

you're doing really really heavy duty
stuff<00:05:46.490> on<00:05:46.669> it<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:47.419> that's<00:05:47.630> a<00:05:47.720> definite<00:05:48.080> plus

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
stuff on it so that's a definite plus

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.980 
stuff on it so that's a definite plus
for<00:05:48.530> me<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:48.889> very<00:05:49.400> clear<00:05:49.760> very<00:05:50.120> loud<00:05:50.419> sound<00:05:50.810> I

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
for me and very clear very loud sound I

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.779 
for me and very clear very loud sound I

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
really like the front-facing speakers on

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.439 
really like the front-facing speakers on
the<00:05:53.300> con<00:05:53.510> side<00:05:53.539> low<00:05:54.409> screen<00:05:54.830> resolution

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
the con side low screen resolution

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.420 
the con side low screen resolution
definitely<00:05:56.449> a<00:05:56.479> huge<00:05:56.900> con<00:05:57.169> and<00:05:57.470> I<00:05:57.830> also<00:05:57.979> noticed

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.980 
definitely a huge con and I also noticed
something<00:05:58.610> strange<00:05:59.150> about<00:05:59.330> this<00:05:59.720> whenever

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
something strange about this whenever

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.500 
something strange about this whenever
you<00:06:00.169> press<00:06:00.919> this<00:06:01.099> down<00:06:01.340> or<00:06:01.610> bring<00:06:01.760> it<00:06:01.880> back<00:06:02.030> up

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
little bit of LCD phase-shifting so you

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.820 
little bit of LCD phase-shifting so you
can<00:06:07.760> see<00:06:08.000> a<00:06:08.030> pressure<00:06:08.510> difference<00:06:09.020> whenever

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.010 
to 229 and in fact some cases less for

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.130 
to 229 and in fact some cases less for
the<00:07:10.070> Nexus<00:07:10.460> 7<00:07:10.610> so<00:07:10.850> it's<00:07:10.970> more<00:07:11.150> expensive<00:07:11.330> yes

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:16.910

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.450 
I think it's a good battery really cool

these<00:07:23.630> a<00:07:23.690> don't<00:07:23.990> buy<00:07:24.110> yeah<00:07:24.350> I<00:07:24.590> have<00:07:24.800> to<00:07:24.920> think

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.130 
these a don't buy yeah I have to think

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.910

if<00:07:25.940> they<00:07:26.030> could<00:07:26.180> only<00:07:26.360> get<00:07:26.780> a<00:07:26.990> little<00:07:27.410> bit<00:07:27.560> less

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:27.920 
if they could only get a little bit less

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.740 
if they could only get a little bit less
expensive<00:07:28.370> or<00:07:28.520> a<00:07:28.550> better<00:07:28.820> screen<00:07:29.240> it<00:07:29.540> seems

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
expensive or a better screen it seems

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.020 
expensive or a better screen it seems
like<00:07:29.870> the<00:07:29.990> screen<00:07:30.710> real<00:07:31.190> disadvantage<00:07:31.850> there

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.030 
like the screen real disadvantage there

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.670 
like the screen real disadvantage there
that<00:07:32.210> would<00:07:32.330> definitely<00:07:32.510> say<00:07:32.960> Shannon<00:07:33.470> Morse

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 
that would definitely say Shannon Morse

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.880 
that would definitely say Shannon Morse
