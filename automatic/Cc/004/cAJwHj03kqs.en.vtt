 outer 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.140
 3 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:17.800
 It's the most rewarding moment I've ever had with four beautiful days together for a year . 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:22.830
 Uh fact that SNSD is the most any operating a wide range of activities in Unity 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:29.080
 I do not think it's a team. There are a lot of people and there are many Jeju too. 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:35.379
 Inde number of teams that do the work for activities in the area during the nine people we dare 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:41.650
 Is there a special reason why I decided to make a three minute submission 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:46.900
 Each member of the group was acting. 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:50.949
 Uh, the three of us want to be more focused on music. 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.129
 This was a three to one album 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:01:00.040
 It means that you can not smoke . 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:04.239
 Yeah. I got it too . Yeah. 3 2m. But now once again. 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:08.740
 I wanted to work on this new musical attempt . 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:14.590
 It is still a bit sad to know that we are a member of the umbrella. 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.850
 If the degree that I wish I had better state now named after the character in front now tiseo 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.090
 I did. 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:27.820
 If there's one more thing in there , add the preceding letter. 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:32.939
 I'm not going to recreate anyway, West Lake 4 because the three of us are singing now 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:38.350
 I think dancing will be great if my sister breaks now. 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:43.659
 And in the mean uh Nene is just something to be figured according to the music 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:47.710
 I say leave no amount of duck with another member during a dance in his hand, yet also very 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.249
 Because of the great reputation of the razor, it is true that our fans are naturally 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.479
 I do not know. I do not know . 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:57.850
 Anyone who is an elderly person or something like this is going to be a little difficult 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.630
 I thought I came up with the development 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 There is a way that SNSD members are remembering some 30,000,000 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.910
 I've heard of it. Oh. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.840
 No fans. The bird has been developed. 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.530
 If we use this method, our seniors will be able to put the name of Girls' Generation member in 3 seconds. 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.670
 There is 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.340
 First, the members started to pronounce u got 2 and 4 people Yoona glass 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.470
 There are four members who end in English. 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:29.550
 The sunshine sun swan and the member in English name explained sunny 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.090
 Jessica Tiffany If you remember this, our elders 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.120
 Ketty, and then, uh, you know exactly who it is. 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.230
 That's talking about broken weave 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.230
 I need more than I thought. 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.370
 Four. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.300
 I 'm suggesting you guys stop by. 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.970
 I believe that any genre will show you the best charm. 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.920
 I'd like you to feel 9 like a heart. 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.209
 The real you baby step sound. 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.209
 I will attend with applause.
