here's<00:00:01.469> another<00:00:01.620> lymph<00:00:02.100> node<00:00:02.370> on<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.700> top<00:00:03.629> is

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
here's another lymph node on the top is

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.829 
here's another lymph node on the top is
our<00:00:04.350> lymph<00:00:04.650> node<00:00:04.980> with<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.839> pathologic

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
our lymph node with the pathologic

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.009 
our lymph node with the pathologic
process<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:08.010> be<00:00:08.189> discussed<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
process to be discussed and on the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.410 
process to be discussed and on the
bottom<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> normal<00:00:11.160> lymph<00:00:11.400> node<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.179> let's

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
bottom is a normal lymph node so let's

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.810 
bottom is a normal lymph node so let's
go<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.929> bottom<00:00:13.380> normal<00:00:13.980> lymph<00:00:14.250> node<00:00:14.519> first

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
go to the bottom normal lymph node first

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.460 
go to the bottom normal lymph node first
once<00:00:15.690> again<00:00:16.049> notice<00:00:16.980> there's<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.490> capsule

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
once again notice there's a capsule

once again notice there's a capsule
there's<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.560> sub<00:00:20.130> capsule<00:00:20.850> Ursinus<00:00:21.270> there's<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
there's a sub capsule Ursinus there's a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.650 
there's a sub capsule Ursinus there's a

follicular hyperplasia of a lymph node

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.560 
follicular hyperplasia of a lymph node
in<00:01:31.390> which<00:01:31.899> you<00:01:32.140> get<00:01:32.380> both<00:01:32.890> an<00:01:33.189> increase<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:34.000> the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
in which you get both an increase in the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.100 
in which you get both an increase in the

down here into the medullary area as

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.770 
down here into the medullary area as
well<00:01:50.289> most<00:01:51.039> of<00:01:51.310> this<00:01:51.459> lymph<00:01:51.729> nodes<00:01:52.030> consists

well most of this lymph nodes consists

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.820 
well most of this lymph nodes consists
of<00:01:52.899> follicles<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.940> this<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.299> follicular

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
of follicles so this is a follicular

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.249 
of follicles so this is a follicular
hyperplasia<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:58.119> one<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.720> two<00:01:58.959> ways

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
hyperplasia this is one of the two ways

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.100 
hyperplasia this is one of the two ways
the<00:01:59.649> two<00:01:59.860> common<00:02:00.340> ways<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.939> lymph<00:02:01.780> nodes

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
the two common ways that lymph nodes

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.559 
the two common ways that lymph nodes
react<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:04.380> inflammatory<00:02:05.380> changes<00:02:06.240> by<00:02:07.240> showing

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
react to inflammatory changes by showing

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.810 
react to inflammatory changes by showing
an<00:02:07.780> increase<00:02:08.019> in<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.679> number<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.789> size

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
an increase in the number and the size

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.210 
an increase in the number and the size
and<00:02:10.859> distribution<00:02:11.859> of<00:02:11.980> their<00:02:12.989> follicles

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and distribution of their follicles

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.239 
and distribution of their follicles
thank<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.400> very<00:02:15.880> much
