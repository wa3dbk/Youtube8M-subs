00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 not always easy to eat 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.370
 protein to children meat or fish 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.930
 I found something I detail the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.280
 food in small cubes and I get them 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.110
 queue on much more skewers 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.880
 fun to eat them but so that 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.920
 tasty kebabs one has to think about 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.130
 to marinate them and today these 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.130
 skewers of salmon and sesame 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.230
 so for 4 people 4 good eaters 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.390
 I planned 400 g of tone and 400 grams 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.099
 of salmon to make your kebabs successful on 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.539
 essential principle is to cut 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.970
 pieces of equal size so that the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.740
 cooking is homogeneous and there for 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.820
 good fish obviously we can 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.170
 put on the branches is pretty much 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.860
 what we want what we have especially in the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.120
 fridge 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.010
 I chose small tomatoes 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.079
 cherries that are about the size 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.370
 of mediate weight jump and then I 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.719
 will put a little bit of art because 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.980
 that the bacon goes very well with the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.520
 salmon and with the tone also 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.070
 in general 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.010
 so we go for the skewers we go 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.500
 put a piece of tuna me I pic 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.430
 first with a very sharp peak 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.860
 and then 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.320
 I put my skewer in order not to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.379
 explode my fish to keep her beautiful 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.609
 texture or at the first breach is it 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.559
 will he be hungry this one 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.439
 now I'm going to prepare my five 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.450
 other kebabs and then I'm going to them 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.729
 brush with a marinade makes two 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.090
 follow me 3 tablespoons of oil 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.979
 olive 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.100
 I will add a little bit of 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.409
 lime juice a good spoonful to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.610
 coffee and I'll put a spoon to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.320
 soy sauce soup so that's for 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.810
 our navy us just about everything and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.350
 now i will pass my bro cats 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.150
 spread in marinade and all that but that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.829
 goes marine and one to two hours 3 hours 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.360
 maximum but no more obviously offered 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.100
 good before I start cooking 2 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.579
 may skewer I have two steps left to 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.590
 assume 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.360
 first I did not want to lead in the bud 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.350
 this lady is the second step and well 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.909
 this is simply smash 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.930
 preheat the grill of your oven to 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.040
 less than 15 minutes up front if 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.840
 must be very hot for 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.220
 ensure the success of these kebabs and 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.470
 cook them 5 minutes thinking about 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.630
 return them from time to time and that's it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.610
 for the last one and put yourself at your 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.990
 because it does not wait and for the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.340
 proportions I count of branch and by 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.240
 person for adults and a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.240
 only for the little ones
