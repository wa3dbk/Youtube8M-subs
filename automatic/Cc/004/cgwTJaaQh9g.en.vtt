00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
conference it's pretty tough it's a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.860 
conference it's pretty tough it's a
complex<00:01:03.620> offense<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.250> lot<00:01:05.150> of<00:01:05.180> formations<00:01:05.750> of

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
complex offense a lot of formations of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.630 
complex offense a lot of formations of
the<00:01:05.990> key<00:01:06.290> is<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.740> learn<00:01:07.159> your<00:01:07.340> formation

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
the key is to learn your formation

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.180 
the key is to learn your formation

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
because once you do that then everything

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.400 
because once you do that then everything
else<00:01:10.280> gets<00:01:10.820> easy<00:01:11.030> but<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.630> formations<00:01:12.140> are<00:01:12.260> so

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
else gets easy but the formations are so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.870 
else gets easy but the formations are so

think a lot of it is really just then
the<00:03:39.310> mental<00:03:39.639> side<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.030> football<00:03:40.239> just

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
the mental side of the football just

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
not only my position but the front are

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.890 
not only my position but the front are
the<00:03:45.220> front<00:03:45.459> guys<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:46.000> what<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.510> Rye<00:03:46.629> receives

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
the front guys and what the Rye receives

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.619 
the front guys and what the Rye receives
are<00:03:47.049> doing<00:03:47.379> and<00:03:47.590> then<00:03:48.459> just<00:03:48.940> understanding

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
are doing and then just understanding

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.330 
are doing and then just understanding
what<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.079> defense<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.530> doing<00:03:50.680> as<00:03:50.889> well<00:03:51.040> you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
what the defense is doing as well you

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.800 
what the defense is doing as well you
know<00:03:51.489> just<00:03:51.669> that's<00:03:51.970> what<00:03:52.180> game<00:03:52.329> plan<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.660> comes

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
know just that's what game plan it comes

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.229 
know just that's what game plan it comes
in<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.049> all<00:03:53.139> that<00:03:53.319> so<00:03:53.560> just<00:03:54.190> think<00:03:54.459> being<00:03:55.150> a

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
in and all that so just think being a

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.280 
in and all that so just think being a
student<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.900> game<00:03:55.930> there's<00:03:56.319> no<00:03:56.410> no

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
reputation have you noticed a difference

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.960 
reputation have you noticed a difference
in<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.560> balance<00:04:01.920> compared<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.820> old

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
in the balance compared to the the old

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.760 
in the balance compared to the the old
schemes<00:04:03.300> or<00:04:03.450> anything<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.230> think

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
schemes or anything like that I think

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.930 
schemes or anything like that I think
people<00:04:05.160> know<00:04:05.220> people<00:04:05.460> think<00:04:05.550> it's<00:04:05.730> going<00:04:05.850> to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
people know people think it's going to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.910 
people know people think it's going to
be<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> pass-heavy<00:04:06.450> pass<00:04:06.690> every<00:04:06.960> team<00:04:07.200> in<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.530> it

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
be a pass-heavy pass every team in it it

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.680 
be a pass-heavy pass every team in it it
really<00:04:08.010> hasn't<00:04:08.280> been<00:04:08.520> like<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:09.330> spring

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
really hasn't been like that this spring

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.300 
really hasn't been like that this spring
you<00:04:09.780> know<00:04:09.900> we've<00:04:10.050> been<00:04:10.080> pretty<00:04:10.770> balanced<00:04:11.250> as

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
you know we've been pretty balanced as

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.310 
you know we've been pretty balanced as
far<00:04:11.520> as<00:04:11.640> running<00:04:11.820> past<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:12.840> think<00:04:13.230> he's

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
far as running past and I think he's

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.290 
far as running past and I think he's
done<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.500> great<00:04:13.650> job<00:04:13.770> with<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.190> because<00:04:14.910> you

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
done a great job with that because you

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.460 
done a great job with that because you
know<00:04:15.420> obviously<00:04:15.600> has<00:04:15.960> a<00:04:15.990> running<00:04:16.260> back<00:04:16.380> you

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
know obviously has a running back you

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.450 
know obviously has a running back you
don't<00:04:16.560> want<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.800> be<00:04:16.920> passed<00:04:17.160> passed<00:04:17.310> passed

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:17.460 
don't want to be passed passed passed

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.540 
don't want to be passed passed passed
and<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.330> think<00:04:19.290> like<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:20.100> said<00:04:20.280> he's<00:04:20.400> done<00:04:20.520> a

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.550 
and I think like I said he's done a

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.979 
and I think like I said he's done a
great<00:04:20.700> job<00:04:20.790> with<00:04:21.030> just<00:04:21.360> the<00:04:21.420> balance<00:04:21.780> went

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
great job with just the balance went

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.720 
great job with just the balance went
past<00:04:22.260> when<00:04:22.470> we<00:04:22.530> need<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.860> he's<00:04:23.460> all<00:04:23.610> about

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
past when we need to he's all about

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.190 
past when we need to he's all about
situational<00:04:24.390> football<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:24.930> that's<00:04:25.050> what<00:04:25.170> I

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
situational football and that's what I

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.510 
situational football and that's what I
love<00:04:25.410> about<00:04:25.440> him<00:04:25.770> because<00:04:26.070> everything<00:04:26.430> is

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
love about him because everything is

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.670

you<00:04:39.720> know<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> lot<00:04:40.080> of<00:04:40.490> crossing<00:04:41.490> routes<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.850> the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
you know a lot of crossing routes to the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.790 
you know a lot of crossing routes to the
back<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.210> screen<00:04:42.750> is<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.290> bag<00:04:43.470> different

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
back and screen is to the bag different

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.410

type of screens and stuff that'll

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.300 
type of screens and stuff that'll
probably<00:04:48.170> make<00:04:49.170> up<00:04:49.290> for<00:04:49.530> some<00:04:49.680> some<00:04:49.980> carries

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
probably make up for some some carries

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.630 
probably make up for some some carries
loss<00:04:50.520> but<00:04:51.180> uh<00:04:51.560> like<00:04:52.560> I<00:04:52.650> said<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:53.310> still<00:04:53.400> been

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
loss but uh like I said it's still been

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.220 
loss but uh like I said it's still been
