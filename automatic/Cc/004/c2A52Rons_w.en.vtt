00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 and so the second step we performed tied 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.420
 sixty two rows of garter stitch 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.179
 now we need to go to the third step 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.519
 i.e. close 8 loops but do not complete 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.789
 knitting a number of what we need for this 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:30.029
 make we need to note 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:36.690
 9 loops so we think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.989
 and in this place I insert another thread 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.989
 colors 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.360
 another color pulling it out 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.970
 thus tying the thread on the knitting needle 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:10.120
 then we have this thread 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:16.300
 remove this way tied a thread 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:19.390
 tied up now on why will we be on top 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:28.320
 knit 2 loops together purl 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:32.580
 loop so needles knitting needle we introduce 2 loops 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.580
 thread capture 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:46.640
 and draw the resulting loop 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.640
 return back to this knitting needle 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:02:00.799
 now do the same two loops 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.799
 grab the working thread pull out and 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.680
 get the loop back here 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.400
 two loops grab the thread pull out 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:23.120
 we get this back 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.120
 working thread comes back from above 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.130
 two loops knit purl 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.480
 pull the thread from the top 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.920
 noose 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:03:04.170
 back dress is better not on top again 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.170
 2 loops together knit purl 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:23.010
 Skye loops return the needle is 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:23.010
 fishing now not on top 2 purl 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:37.380
 wrong side 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:44.170
 so the resulting brother put on 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:53.070
 some business is very and the top is less 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:53.070
 and less than five leagues there are 2 purl 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.180
 have the stove returned 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.020
 and last time 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.860
 So 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:32.930
 didn't return so step number three from us 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.930
 did a tick put on
