00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.250
 and well hello to everyone here and 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.990
 the team x with the eu the gamer 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.760
 so you many of you 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.300
 were waiting for him impatiently 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.800
 here is the second tutorial trick shots 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.300
 so in this one we're going all 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.279
 first started by responding to 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.739
 questions that were asked in the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.300
 comments from the old video whose 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.040
 pilots 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.270
 then we will show you 2,3 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.120
 trick shots that you can achieve 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.809
 following the tricks so to give their 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.640
 first responders and so we 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:50.700
 let's start with the first question that 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:54.010
 was asked by mister razer bac 66 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.940
 this question was actually sticking 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.379
 it's the thing I do not feel 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.390
 that he does not have enough time to go out 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.270
 his shares to his texts alone his 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.449
 knives etc then simply be you 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.800
 do not hurt is so can use 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.390
 very uncomfortable when you want to play 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.450
 take out grenades from the paras and 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.140
 company or you're not going well enough 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.200
 quickly and there is a question 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.899
 drive and the second question 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.880
 is put to us by the gamer gain that 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.560
 ask us more explanatory tutorial 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.179
 that's what we're going to do right after 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.060
 because it was the first episode 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.950
 would not have everything explained organized and 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.890
 talk about the thing there is nothing to say about 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.709
 the thing that goes by luck all 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.270
 simply here we are at the third and 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:37.300
 last question that was asked by 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.940
 noisy a member of the team xbox players 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.250
 and publishers big cuckoo to you noisy 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.720
 hello that tells us then that question 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.560
 it's how you do to move forward 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.170
 in all was reversed 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.729
 so if in advance and you want to say 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.170
 move the hammock we do not move in 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.000
 hand to push to pour her this 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.500
 shoe 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.830
 if if you mean for example when we 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.119
 jump from the plane in fact it's 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.319
 just something that comes to 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.319
 driving force 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.140
 he I will first start with you 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.670
 show but klein strict shot clean cm 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.069
 class have for my desire to show 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.110
 of brilliance I will introduce but 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.120
 now it can vary from the player to 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.680
 did it was the ultimate etc so next to 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.890
 me you 're going on these classes that 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.180
 centex to the flat spills 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.950
 here we could see there will always be 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.580
 an electric charge will still be but 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.350
 rest here otherwise can watch from 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.700
 you even what ensures a class but 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.980
 stuff principle to greece is to 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.890
 comfortable light weights - conditions 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.209
 extreme conditions for me person and 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.400
 the electric charge that is in 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:48.230
 each class and that's my 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:50.030
 little class and so to explain the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.370
 first type toilets this other cat 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.530
 quite simple to knit like montreal 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.780
 we call it a reflex trick shots 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.840
 so this is patrick shot very simple and 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.690
 very fast to perform then he will you 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.250
 will need to have a secondary weapon 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.070
 whatever the secondary a sniper 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.560
 a centex or a part a well malaise 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.519
 sure then to start you go 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400
 take your secondary weapon 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.560
 you're going to jump so do 3,6 do 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.079
 how you want to go 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.150
 supports on triangle at the same time a 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.950
 time you see that the cut arrives you 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.519
 press the button to exit the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.540
 centex where the part to remember you on this 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.980
 triangle and you will turn 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.060
 directly on your sniper it does not you 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.060
 remains more than framing the enemy 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.270
 but audi in the then here I'm going to you 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.980
 present a little shock trip that 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.080
 is actually doing a little 3 6 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.750
 to tag the halves and was going 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.950
 kill him with his sniper 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.860
 here we'll say it's a 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.900
 concatenation not too complicated you 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.810
 must keep your hands normally on 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.790
 the manade gire you do at 3.6 you 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.010
 aim for you pull the half at the same 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.480
 time you jump and when you 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.850
 are in the air the you go to 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.070
 more to pour and you take out a charge 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.870
 electric or centex or bosses and 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.700
 of course once you will be managing 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.740
 the trick shots you can do 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.810
 tags and so make your 3.6 with your 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.810
 in the air so like here 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.280
 break 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.979
 and for this last trig fleet we 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.800
 let's show you to 37 years old does it 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.370
 makes illusion to shoot twice with a 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.650
 sniper 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.409
 in fact you will need to equip 2 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.729
 9 o'clock as usual two males is 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:49.680
 a centex or after once parra 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.169
 that you will have your sniper 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.330
 you will launch into the air draw 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.720
 with this first sniper at the same time 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.520
 you press triangle then a 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.039
 tenth of a second after you press 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.870
 on your hand to or on your grenade that 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.759
 depends what you took you 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.349
 remember once on triangle for them 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.569
 that to tidy up the text scene and you 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.440
 will have your second sniper in vain you 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.440
 just have to shoot 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.140
 yo yo yo everyone we find ourselves 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.690
 for the end of this little tutorial that 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.200
 was brief but intense 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.580
 so we wanted to thank everyone who 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.190
