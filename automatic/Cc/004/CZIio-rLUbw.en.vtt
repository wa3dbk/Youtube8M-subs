00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.809
 hello people i would have the hello and 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.549
 welcome to another 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.539
 FIFA Ultimate Team Player 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.490
 As you can see , this is franck today 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.880
 ribery the second best left 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 midfielder to Ronaldo 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.980
 equated with this hazard 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.420
 year, let's just start in the middle of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.750
 the review at his pace 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.010
 980 tempo is really damn fast 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.690
 was really very, very quickly 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.149
 Feeling a bit faster than 89 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 maybe even 91 92 it definitely 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.960
 comparable to reus my opinion 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.420
 even as fast as tempo 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.190
 and they really do not care 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.390
 the start is better than the sprint 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.000
 speed you know the drill at 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.379
 Ribery he leaves the first five meters 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.870
 like schmitten's cat and then he lets 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.190
 maybe catch up a bit 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.410
 but once he's gone then he is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.219
 really gone 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.160
 we come to his shot his 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.049
 fitness shots were good he met 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.659
 sometimes, it's outside 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.119
 he does not like his long protection vista the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.140
 patch and so on finishing 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.210
 really for a nice winner was 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.189
 really good but more so 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.479
 preparer with his 85 fits that 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.710
 was really first class inside 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.130
 of the sixteen you pop yours 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.310
 Most things are pure but 78 shot 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.079
 not here now 86 about reus is already 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.140
 pretty good, but it's nothing 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.850
 but we come to his outstanding 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.460
 outstanding instead of his 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.979
 dribbling people of the type a 92 dribbling 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.140
 that 's incredible 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.670
 ball acceptance are to soon processing 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.009
 been the absolute hammer 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.520
 highly recommended as left tuning 43 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.700
 21 In any case, the ball sticks to it 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.590
 really on foot also he has come 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.600
 now it's really five now 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.060
 star skills perfect for killer people 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.789
 with ribery it is such a fun 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.280
 ask because he enters through this 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.110
 he just does a skill and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.370
 just pull over 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.520
 a defender of the world has a chance 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.740
 then to get the moreover has the 4 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.380
 star feeble foot what a lot 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.200
 is good and for steep passes is as 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.820
 ribery super good if you are 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.380
 somebody out of the room needs 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.170
 Now just run forward and 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.510
 through the thing somehow between the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.890
 post brings 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.950
 Let's get to his matching game 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.430
 third best instead of 85 long as short 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.410
 Passes are always perfect on the man 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.690
 flanks also arrived well and that is 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.000
 also point as well as ribery clearly 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.640
 we would recommend to his 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.320
 Physi his headball game unfortunately he is 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.640
 not very strong though 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.630
 you do not need too much 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.810
 a lot to help his strength was what where 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.920
 you would say that's okay 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.750
 ribéry like when he comes to the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.150
 defender is over then he is not 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.800
 easy to push away you know what I mean 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.290
 So my ribéry can be synonymous in real 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.300
 very well prevail if you ever 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.830
 right in front of the defender side walker 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.380
 or so he really has 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.570
 difficulties but when he is over 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.000
 then he has the arm out and is 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.610
 really over that is really awesome 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.680
 His upgrades are at home medium 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.620
 and people that's the best left 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.989
 midfielder in the Bundesliga can 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.030
 I assure you even better than mine 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.830
 Final rating is 9.4 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.920
 and the price performance ratio 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.040
 9.1 it costs at the moment I only take 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.690
 250,000 on xbox and 270 on the ps3 the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.690
 it was from me people I'm out
