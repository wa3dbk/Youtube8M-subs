my<00:00:02.190> atolls<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.790> my<00:00:03.000> favorite<00:00:03.600> product<00:00:04.020> what

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
my atolls is my favorite product what

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.190 
my atolls is my favorite product what
I'd<00:00:04.740> like<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:04.980> do<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.460> review<00:00:06.029> what<00:00:06.569> makes<00:00:06.810> this

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
I'd like to do is review what makes this

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.900 
I'd like to do is review what makes this
product<00:00:07.529> different<00:00:07.709> from<00:00:08.340> anything<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:08.700> you

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
product different from anything that you

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.030 
product different from anything that you
may<00:00:09.120> have<00:00:09.210> seen<00:00:09.509> how<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.200> was<00:00:10.349> designed<00:00:10.799> and

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
may have seen how it was designed and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.329 
may have seen how it was designed and
the<00:00:11.610> research<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.299> support<00:00:12.509> its<00:00:12.900> benefits<00:00:13.440> by

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
the research to support its benefits by

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:15.860 
the research to support its benefits by
atolls<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.879> different<00:00:15.360> product<00:00:15.660> because

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
atolls is a different product because

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.230 
atolls is a different product because
it's<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.170> tube<00:00:16.470> product<00:00:16.890> system<00:00:17.100> there<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.210> a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
it's a tube product system there is a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.810 
it's a tube product system there is a
capsule<00:00:18.750> called<00:00:19.140> bio<00:00:19.410> toon<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.130> there's<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
capsule called bio toon and there's a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.179 
capsule called bio toon and there's a
drink<00:00:21.060> mix<00:00:21.300> code<00:00:21.660> biocharge<00:00:22.380> they<00:00:23.070> have

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
drink mix code biocharge they have

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.609 
drink mix code biocharge they have
complementary<00:00:23.970> actions<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:25.050> together<00:00:25.230> they

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
complementary actions but together they

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.460 
complementary actions but together they
provide<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> powerful<00:00:26.699> tandem<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.689> benefits<00:00:28.199> so

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
provide a powerful tandem of benefits so

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880 
provide a powerful tandem of benefits so
let's<00:00:29.369> focus<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.880> bio<00:00:30.090> tune<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:31.349> actually<00:00:31.859> a

can be corrupted the hardware is

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.920 
can be corrupted the hardware is
unchanged<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.580> use<00:01:17.760> those<00:01:18.450> genetic

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
mismanaged that is the aging process we

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.460 
mismanaged that is the aging process we

have the same resources we had when we

have the same resources we had when we
were<00:01:28.620> young<00:01:29.010> but<00:01:29.760> sadly<00:01:30.090> things<00:01:30.540> don't<00:01:30.870> work

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
were young but sadly things don't work

like they used to bhaiyya tuned is meant

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.040 
like they used to bhaiyya tuned is meant
to<00:01:34.440> restore<00:01:34.830> balance<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.580> how<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.210> use<00:01:36.690> those

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
to restore balance to how we use those

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.610 
to restore balance to how we use those
genetic<00:01:37.590> resources<00:01:38.370> and<00:01:38.720> they<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.140> by
