00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
little Ridge right here you want to cut

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.850 
little Ridge right here you want to cut
it<00:00:51.300> just<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.809> side<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.680> does

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
it just on this side of it what it does

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.889 
it just on this side of it what it does
is<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> releases<00:00:53.579> chemicals<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.539> gives<00:00:54.750> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
is it releases chemicals and gives that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.020 
is it releases chemicals and gives that
nice<00:00:55.050> round<00:00:55.469> call<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> look<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> tree

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
nice round call and look to the tree

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.490 
nice round call and look to the tree
when<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> cut<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.660> properly<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.350> see

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
when you cut it properly as you can see

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.410 
when you cut it properly as you can see
with<00:00:58.649> our<00:00:58.680> cut<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.850> cut<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
with our cut here we just cut this to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.810 
with our cut here we just cut this to
the<00:01:00.539> branch<00:01:00.930> bark<00:01:01.199> Ridge<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
the branch bark Ridge you see the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.219 
the branch bark Ridge you see the
difference<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.180> makes<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.780> tree<00:01:06.229> and

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
difference that makes on the tree and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.070 
difference that makes on the tree and
the<00:01:07.770> whole<00:01:07.920> tree<00:01:08.189> will<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.460> shot<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.820> this

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
the whole tree will be shot to this

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.660 
the whole tree will be shot to this
uniformity<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.290> where<00:01:10.500> cuts<00:01:11.070> cutting<00:01:11.400> back<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
uniformity on where cuts cutting back to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.880 
uniformity on where cuts cutting back to
laterals<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.750> time<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.229> smaller<00:01:13.560> cuts

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
laterals this time we have smaller cuts

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
laterals this time we have smaller cuts
and<00:01:14.070> these<00:01:14.189> cuts<00:01:14.490> help<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> define<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.900> work

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and these cuts help to define the work

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
and these cuts help to define the work
that<00:01:16.259> you've<00:01:16.409> been<00:01:16.560> doing<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.790> big

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that you've been doing because the big

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.390 
that you've been doing because the big
cuts<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.509> fine<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> small<00:01:19.770> ones<00:01:19.979> per<00:01:20.189> to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
cuts are fine but the small ones per to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.240 
cuts are fine but the small ones per to
protrude<00:01:21.060> too<00:01:21.240> much<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.100> whole

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
protrude too much then it's just a whole

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.249 
protrude too much then it's just a whole
look<00:01:23.400> good<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.150> Johnny<00:01:24.479> once<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.930> show<00:01:25.140> them

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
look good so Johnny once you show them

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.450 
look good so Johnny once you show them
how<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.740> cut<00:01:25.890> these<00:01:26.009> two<00:01:26.220> small

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
how we're going to cut these two small

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:35.070 
how we're going to cut these two small
moves<00:01:26.640> back<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.119> subtle<00:01:27.330> cut<00:01:27.600> right<00:01:27.780> here

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.700 

and<00:01:36.080> then<00:01:36.170> cut<00:01:36.350> this<00:01:36.470> one<00:01:36.620> right<00:01:36.740> here<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:41.710> so

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
and then cut this one right here and so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.220 
and then cut this one right here and so
we<00:01:43.430> cut<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.670> lint<00:01:44.000> without<00:01:44.570> cutting<00:01:44.900> this

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
we cut the lint without cutting this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.170 
we cut the lint without cutting this
because<00:01:45.530> if<00:01:45.650> this<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:46.040> gone<00:01:46.250> that's<00:01:46.910> what<00:01:47.060> you

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
because if this is gone that's what you

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.210 
because if this is gone that's what you
would<00:01:47.300> have<00:01:47.500> now<00:01:48.500> you've<00:01:48.740> got<00:01:48.890> something<00:01:49.190> to

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
would have now you've got something to

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.860 
would have now you've got something to
fill<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.490> gap<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:49.880> but<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.540> taking<00:01:50.810> the

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
fill the gap in but you taking the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.840 
fill the gap in but you taking the
length<00:01:51.020> out<00:01:51.230> buddy<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:51.890> section<00:01:52.310> right<00:01:52.430> here

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
length out buddy this section right here

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.120 
length out buddy this section right here
you<00:01:53.360> have<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.540> gap<00:01:53.870> between<00:01:54.140> these<00:01:54.530> two<00:01:54.770> sets<00:01:55.010> of

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
you have a gap between these two sets of

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.010 
you have a gap between these two sets of
limbs<00:01:55.400> so<00:01:56.120> don't<00:01:56.330> cut<00:01:56.540> anything<00:01:56.750> on<00:01:56.960> the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
limbs so don't cut anything on the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.020 
limbs so don't cut anything on the
backside<00:01:57.500> here<00:01:57.530> cut<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.490> line<00:01:58.700> right<00:01:58.970> here

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
backside here cut this line right here

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.300 
backside here cut this line right here
to<00:01:59.480> match<00:01:59.660> up<00:01:59.900> to<00:01:59.930> there<00:02:00.230> and<00:02:00.920> then<00:02:01.040> cut<00:02:01.190> the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
to match up to there and then cut the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.250 
to match up to there and then cut the
top<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.850> when<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.150> cut<00:02:02.390> those<00:02:02.570> two<00:02:02.960> sides

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
top and when you cut those two sides

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.320 
top and when you cut those two sides
right<00:02:03.500> there<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:04.400> gap<00:02:04.580> will<00:02:04.790> naturally<00:02:04.940> in<00:02:05.270> a

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
right there that gap will naturally in a

right there that gap will naturally in a
moment<00:02:05.660> we're<00:02:05.780> going<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:05.930> reach<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> top<00:02:06.410> of
