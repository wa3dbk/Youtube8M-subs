00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.230
 good for all guys this is the face of 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.439
 paola today I'm here with a new video 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.119
 su clash of france is a video a little 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.189
 especially as I had said he 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.470
 protected videos that did not fit 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.360
 in the series I'm doing because 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.040
 highly then it becomes a bit boring and 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.619
 maybe you have made some videos so a 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.330
 particular 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:37.330
 this video is quite strange because 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.360
 refers to a kind of I don't know 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.520
 not even if it's a glitch or how to define 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.630
 an easter egg according to me the term 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.120
 best I found on su clash of 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.430
 grass or better I read the site 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.770
 official of the super selvi will put if 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.030
 we hit the link in the description and there 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.350
 you can find all the information 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.260
 needed 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.239
 from here I took the inspiration here for 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.230
 make this video then date 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.120
 also look at the official forum 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.280
 of the super s however as you will have seen 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.700
 I don't know why and when 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.010
 where there is how it is I know but I don't know why 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.650
 both this particular easter egg if 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.570
 go anyway on the site there are all 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.010
 those who write the comment 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.010
 I think there are 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.890
 for this reason you write to me 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.140
 in the comments because this is this 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 kind of this weird stuff is that 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 I don't even know how to define it 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.020
 what is it because half an hour I tell you 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.150
 you turn around the time you owe 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.450
 going to the village had to go 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.370
 on the change but this will test the here 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.130
 little hand which arrow on the right side 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.230
 left lacks etc. war base 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.060
 take any war base e 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.060
 make changes available 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.980
 wait wait naturally 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.740
 here and remove everything remove everything 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.600
 now I have bluestack and I struggle 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.310
 however filthy you have to zoom up 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.330
 but what they said yes to me on the sea in 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.870
 high 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.020
 and I can only see this here 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.420
 honestly I see there was a kind of 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.160
 I show here I will try to insert 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.700
 some images where I show you 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.520
 a little maybe the method zoom stuff of 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.780
 kind now I do n't know how I'm committed 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.200
 however, get along well some kind of 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.910
 I show you this but I don't know if it is known 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.290
 true because on the forum 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.720
 this was not considered the easter 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.450
 egg liberiste bears the fact that if you 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.890
 incorrect below and here it is already difficult 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.080
 we are already struggling to see it 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.260
 let alone you must 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.440
 try anyway I repeat you zoom 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.040
 in the top top top 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.500
 currently as you go down to 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.989
 these squares here as diagonals 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.480
 must be scrutinizing the faces of 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.670
 monsters but I see one for example the 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.650
 first looks like a kind of dragon the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.580
 second, it looks like a monster with one eye 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.830
 only to sad face the third seems a 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.070
 other kind of exhibits are in I know what it is 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.750
 here is or I have hallucinations 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.910
 but if they wrote it also on the site 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.370
 there will be a reason, however, above all 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.959
 when the piece is here in the part 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.049
 high 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.730
 you see faces anyway 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.019
 which are also quite nice and 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.760
 details 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.710
 and you see this for the whole 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.650
 length of 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:44.190
 from the diagonal here is naturally done 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.780
 a lot of effort to see them all though 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.070
 they are only in the central zone if ad 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.060
 example tried to observe those 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.500
 lateral 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.530
 now I repeat you do it on yours 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.210
 device because already I struggle I 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.920
 to see it I don't know if it will come in the video 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.660
 fine point for problems of di 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.480
 graphics like that anyway 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.190
 only in the central area is it full 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.120
 of these mostriciattoli also going down 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.970
 lower 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.150
 I continue to see them then or they are a bit 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.670
 still drugged I don't know what of 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.650
 nautique in mind goes well a new term 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.980
 of the boy who still above all here 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.540
 in the lower part I see a kind of 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:27.330
 bat I don't know what a that is 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:30.430
 I will try to put precisely the various 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.010
 step that maybe some piece where 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.710
 I show you the well-defined shape better 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:40.600
 however I repeat to you the 24th time 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.090
 also take a look yourself at 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.330
 your flash of clans why 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.800
 naturally you would do less effort and then 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.920
 I think you can also see on the phone 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.050
 better since the resolution 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.700
 cell phone is better than that of 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.300
 computer and since just that 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:02.230
 expands pixels while on mobile 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.530
 they are however a limited number of dp 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.320
 i'm look like they are and therefore you should 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.600
 see it much better than me anyway 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.730
 I show you here was this 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.810
 I wanted to show you I hope the video will 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.470
 both liked it because it is a bit 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.660
 particular one shows however one 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.740
 a kind of novelty here maybe not 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.260
 knew 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.920
 give me the explanation in the comments 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.840
 maybe in the next grown up I'll read it 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.590
 even the nicest ones 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:36.020
 here is not writing themes that are and maybe 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:40.680
 from the crap of women and half with 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.150
 parts from the wind that's why you should 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.760
 be proper to the mentally ill 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.110
 don't even shoot me but give me yours 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.180
 interpretation of themes even if it is 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.920
 managed to see it, however, I repeat 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.590
 the procedure goes on the basis of war 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.500
 eliminate everything zoomed up here 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:02.460
 slowly go down observing the 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.220
 central band of the hints of squares 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.470
 here and you should see these faces 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.820
 all given everything to do and I hope the 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.510
 video you enjoyed and see you at 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.510
 next hello
