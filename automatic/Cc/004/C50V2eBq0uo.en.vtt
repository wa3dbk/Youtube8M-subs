00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.960
 Dip 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.620
 but now she knows the case again and today for you 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.169
 from the animals 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.169
 When DDR is never a few poles of more fought income offenders of the 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.230
 even 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.320
 commented 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.679
 yes, I would know that 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.489
 one he has Mink and Jane Eyre makes Kurd videos and I would be at the 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.109
 I looked at a lot of people 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.010
 who the link from him 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.610
 never describe it and then we could look at it all the time 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.260
 I am happy if we are friends then we are all quite whole 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.210
 very warmly 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.150
 and 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.610
 Watzke he showed with Arcor 4 70 euros with rapid-fire weapons 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.750
 Wieandts give is buys 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.180
 Red Irish 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.640
 and it shows as before 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.040
 will certainly have noticed 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.440
 This game is everyone's self-reliant 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.550
 and "We have doubts Vancouver 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.550
 under Detlef SchÃ¼tz for once remains 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.490
 The next door is still waiting from Wildbad with Gerd 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.520
 since then, the view of this still there 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.200
 the dog owners on Overweight 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.060
 well then I come to today's topic 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.800
 Halver a picture is how easy it is great and I just want to go that way 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.760
 leave a little over it 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.540
 while there should be 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.080
 around the topic 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.810
 ac for Organ Chen or Kempten 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.340
 do not hold back 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.150
 at Nicolas Schmied s 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.060
 to get 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.980
 yes, never something like that 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.500
 and i have to tell you i was earlier 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.110
 one she rules in ANF at the beginning of mw2 even a small one 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.830
 fighter 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.620
 and what is Hanekamp's name rightly did I realize that I was fighting 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.210
 always his dr 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.170
 or for a short time his short phase because I simply swam then 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.020
 I just try to restrain myself and opponents too 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.560
 make Anneke sweat come 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.530
 Well, the whole thing was so on August the Preston meanwhile wears mine 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.639
 we we came together 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.289
 So this law is related to it 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:14.570
 and yes it was just that I got my face 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.180
 but in the time I magathed my chest my opponents were more that many 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.799
 Points ahead 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.579
 in fact it can not be but then came 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.509
 to this one point after dapd possible i enjoy i dont want the 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.629
 Fight title 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.879
 I'm waiting for my next album, I can not really 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.679
 Bad Lobenstein is now being promoted 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:37.729
 and therefore 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.689
 I'm just trying at the moment or what is currently springing up one since 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:42.470
 very long 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.280
 to make the choice and then reach out to reach it 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.649
 in addition, in the normal case should 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.489
 r but what is already normal that Mr with the topic, I am also the same 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.479
 We're going to do it 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.479
 simply Krone seems so important to me slowly 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.549
 "I do not know I can not play an important role in those 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.549
 I dont come 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.629
 very slow, so lazy 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:09.499
 Bochum 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:13.419
 maybe always happy if I have the small speed advantage 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.460
 Thieves to the others 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.790
 but real speed advantage is not 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.399
 because you could only track her longer 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.569
 as the others 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.049
 Exactly and to these there are points I would like to go through there too 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.489
 would recommend to the heart 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.090
 because hackers and marathons are they can always have loved place 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.249
 yes from 3 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.269
 Favorites there are times like this 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.999
 for a lot of sensation 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.999
 and now the two just always purposefully stages 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:45.529
 the different 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.349
 March so I was easy on her 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.390
 around 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.390
 and as I said if now the time has come if now 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.200
 Year binding agreement in vain what then I'll just like to be totally 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.229
 I would like to do that 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.229
 then you just have to have the madness 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.730
 Like eels, I have seen it like stress tests 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.209
 maneuverable 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.780
 Short of artistry when I'm just before the start of the round or other 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.780
 and then I just go find Lehmann 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.639
 we are already moments where I think 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.129
 where I think I am now 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.129
 because I would take care 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.650
 yes and marathon 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.810
 From now on enough raving about it does not always like to grab Nora from a spurt 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.510
 more an expired very happy with 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.879
 Aachen 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.879
 and very sexy because I hear fast 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.690
 Baake more in inspection Hacker I can also give short examples 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.860
 last at Kant or he goes 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.960
 Kindle saw cancer 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.240
 we will see 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.389
 that is that you 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.550
 because it was worthwhile 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.509
 and now we're already at the end I've got very well known here 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:57.010
 become 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.460
 at first only people to work
