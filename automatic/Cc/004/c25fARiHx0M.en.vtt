00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.519
 military 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.830
 of stretching in visiting Peru there 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:11.110
 a state finding out and there is a process 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.460
 of repowering aircraft that 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.990
 they are fundamental not some wars 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.559
 contemporary ie the planes 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.559
 of war 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.710
 I understand that in chiclayo they are 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.610
 repowering 2029 even rising from 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.430
 level 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.590
 of last generation called smt 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.750
 according to what they say 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.890
 this is so he knows that what is 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.730
 doing exactly in those terms 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:39.670
 clear after good within the plan 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.670
 cloud from the time of the wagner minister 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:51.760
 the repowering of the 29 of 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:54.640
 the mirage and the 25 I am 25 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.990
 that also installed 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:04.960
 then this and after several 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.960
 several struggles let's say this stop having it 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.470
 the necessary economy is that you have 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.900
 achieved and affirm the contracts for 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.410
 start the repowering of airplanes my 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 29 and recently the contract was signed 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.990
 the m2 thousand then what are they going to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.500
 say with other repowering aircraft 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:30.550
 and put them on a much better level 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.890
 I can not give the details of him 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.170
 of the most talking with the radars is 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.940
 they will improve the shooting systems 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.500
 etcetera etcetera 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.590
 to be able to be 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.660
 dissuasive because after all the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.750
 politics has been that Peru has in 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:54.040
 this moment is deterrence is not this 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.750
 it is not the attack not then this with 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.180
 this we would give is being 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.250
 dissuasive and it is also very important 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.540
 have a complete defense system 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.030
 aerial 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.820
 where the radars can give the alarm 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.190
 early to the 1,029 so they can 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.170
 go out to intercept any vector 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.310
 enemy that can enter the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.950
 territory 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.740
 that is programmed so that that system 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.420
 of radars if the system is programmed 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.840
 so that the radars system in a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.840
 defense system of it also up 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.920
 aerial with missiles and so on etc. that 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.270
 is under study if we assume that the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.130
 next year everything is fine 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.810
 brutal to that because I was watching 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.280
 I should do a little research 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:45.470
 on the internet and there are Chilean pages of the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.390
 website that points out that when he 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.720
 29 and has repowered and become 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.100
 this older version mt I do not know what that 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.100
 is going to turn into a fighter-bomber 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.470
 according to them that is a plane superior to 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.950
 f 16 that they have that has a radar 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.470
 of greater reach has a capacity of 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.709
 Missile shot also run more 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.750
 missile kilometers so is this and then 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.730
 they say that when the peru finishes its 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.670
 repowering will be again in 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:22.870
 a superior position or not 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.900
 the plane can be equated but 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.170
 we do not repowering it is not 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.510
 for all planes it is unique not 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.120
 repower if what you want to say 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.930
 repowering by sections by sections 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.060
 That's right, but you have to think that 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.340
 they have bought this 10 planes 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.080
 then 18 and then 18 more 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.580
 they have one they say that is 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.890
 precisely to counteract the 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.160
 superiority of the 1,029 re-empowered 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.510
 in those you say that they are justifying their 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.330
 purchases 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.640
 besides, chile is getting a lot 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.670
 money 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.750
 in everything that is electronic warfare 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.500
 and in all that is this 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.930
 the plane godmother finally recharges in the 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.450
 air with a series of topics that we 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.730
 we do not have it we had them but that 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.130
 now we do not have them now once 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.540
 we reinforce this there without a doubt 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.750
 us at least one capacity 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.750
 dissuasive 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.889
 the issue is to be able to maintain those 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.229
 operatives and those planes because 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.150
 we buy acquired or re-powered and 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.009
 after we can not we do not have 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.949
 budget to improve here is going to have 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:36.070
 two problems first have the pilots 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.289
 prepared because they prepare a pilot 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.620
 the parts that cost like three million 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:44.770
 and a half dollars this also requires a 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.680
 time a pilot starts flying from 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.750
 cadet but start in a cessna plane and 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.669
 there you go through different steps 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.690
 until you reach the highest planes 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:59.139
 level that is 29 and the mirage 2000 but 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.990
 to get to that one this one needs 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.490
 experience one can not start to fly 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.949
 an airplane that without the experience 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.000
 necessary because then it becomes 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.000
 what to return you 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.820
 so that's a serious problem 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.100
 and the problem of the pilots and the 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.110
 problem and the maintenance problem 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.110
 but for that there has to be this the 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.490
 politics is the armed force and has 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.930
 than to be political this action because not 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.370
 they can be government policies 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.880
 right good has already won us the 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.880
 time regrets
