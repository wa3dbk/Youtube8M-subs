 m to my left the road connecting the road without looking after that it ends 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.400
 at the time it's not because I still have to train on radios 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 Colombians for not putting my part of the supporters of 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.210
 the look of the real value of the back 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.560
 so here in 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589
 you see you put 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:14.439

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.020
 the late show of the cane by hand

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.989
 and if you put that in the hot ashes and it creates not against 4 5% 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.889
 and you had to consume 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.839
 all these crimes and david mandel these are tiny little pieces and then 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:39.500
 when a little 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.269
 to a little dish like that you put people 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.269
 and on it you pour the broth 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.849
 and you do not eat too much the sergeant who will have shown by the act of a kamikaze 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.159
 you see in 14th rank on the climate with the pestle that is there since 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.669
 long time 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:58.180
 you crush everything that is in there and you have there 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.409
 this little form of mashed potato like that made of vegetable meat 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.400
 Adequate aromatics but I remind you that the Athenian cook has nothing to 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.929
 see with the kitchen and the sea 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:13.269

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.149
 you only have a few of the others 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:28.970
 without that it reminds me of memories 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.529

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.730

 in an ideal world of arrival okay I asked for more rigor 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.439
 in the first days of ball is in the hands of the patient 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.259
 the vigilantes when you are a student in paris if you live on 3 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.639
 December of 12 square meters 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.219
 overnight you find yourself in a palace of several thousand 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.920
 square meters 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.659
 this case differences when we vacuum 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.470
 tough test these three months 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.729
 Originally it is necessary to say also that to live in this country which is the reason 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.839
 and who stopped my love for this year's weight 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.749
 another question but it would be nice to treat someone who asks me who 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:34.979
 sent us by but the Empress sculptures wins well 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.599
 I have people who would like to know how it is people who want 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.599
 become to do this job later he wonders if 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.089
 special 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:44.180
 bruno alves 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.520
 more familiarly black book mancini 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.139
 it's leading in five in your book you tell that at the 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.450
 ceremony of your wedding moment you said yes 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.469
 you do not imagine as michel reminded 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.499
 the magnitude of what it would mean 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.759
 and on the other hand it was a bit difficult to say no at that time 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.990
 it's going very badly 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.790
 harder in the world on the wedding day 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.470
 his deputy a commander 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.470
 already at that time as in the movie alexander I did not want to disappoint 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:12.930
 and finally we reviewed the images of your coronation 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.620
 October 26, 67 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.039
 it's obviously very impressive and it had to be for you 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:19.669
 in crowning summer of taste 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.669
 the king gave the feeling that he crowned all the women of iran 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.680
 something great 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.620
 but beyond this symbol there is a question that we can not help but 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.220
 to pose 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.629
 seeing the images 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.629
 since the crown will hold despite the bun 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.509
 did you miss the crown obtained from the signals that 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:40.270
 it was me who said it to the afp 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.270
 we refuse the Senate 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.310
 Madame de Fontenay's mother and councilors that day 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.080

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.310
 here to thank infinitely finer than many had long on 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.340
 diseases and good humor it is a very beautiful book with their implementation 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.129
 in use 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:01.340
 this is jacques charby market 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.199
 albin michel 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.189
 we often think 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.020
 alida 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.119
 poleaxe 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:07.419
 in your bed tells you that you go you can more valuable 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:10.129
 also having 50 years with leafs 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.490
 the preface of patrick neilz before change taxes there is a show 

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:16.139

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:17.110
 keystone ten years 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.480
 and then that obviously 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.879
 no one left great memories the pictures 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:22.550
 john-michel t he says 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.969
 here are the problems 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:28.259
 and now we're going back here on mission as the power was based 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:29.959
 applaud the leisure home
