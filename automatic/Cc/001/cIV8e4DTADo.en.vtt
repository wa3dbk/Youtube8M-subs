00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.400
 Sumater tigers are on the verge of extinction. 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.400
 There are only about 400 left in nature ... 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.200
 ... and these wetland forests are essential to their survival. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.600
 Asia Pulp &amp; Paper (APP) wants to become the world leader in paper and cellulose. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.400
 APP paper can be found in everyday products from companies such as Xerox, National Geographic and Walmart. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.200
 The quest for Greenpeace shows ... 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.000
 ... that APP devastates wetland forests that are home to many animals including the Sumatran tiger ... 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.600
 ... but it also destroys protected ramin trees (Gonystylus spp.). 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.600
 Indonesia mining and processing ramin has been banned ten years ago. 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.400
 The tree came under international protection ... 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.200
 ... under the same UN convention that controls ivory trade. 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.000
 APP says there are no illegally felled trees in their timber supplies. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.600
 But our year-round secret search ... 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 ... revealed that the illegally felled ramin tree trunks ... 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.600
 They are part of a mix of tropical trees that engulf APP's global paper empire. 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.800
 This APP pulp plant is already the largest in Indonesia and is growing rapidly. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.200
 Hundreds of thousands of tropical tree trunks are waiting to be processed. 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
 Much of this strain comes from the wetland forest ... 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.600
 ... and it is not at all difficult to find ramin trees that have been felled illegally. 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.400
 We can identify a number of ramin strains ... 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.600
 ... which often lie just a short distance away. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.800
 These strains are up to a meter in diameter. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.200
 A distinctive blue mold sometimes grows on wood. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600
 And the bark contains long fragile fibers. 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.600
 Dozens of samples were collected from these strains. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.400
 They were put into security envelopes and sealed. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.000
 An internationally renowned expert has confirmed that it is indeed a ramin. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.600
 APP paper ends up in everyday products worldwide 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.800
 ... from copy paper and paper tissues ... 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.600
 ... to funny books ... 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.800
 ... and electrical and food packaging. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.200
 Because of APP's illegal practice, Sumater tigers are now even closer to extinction.
