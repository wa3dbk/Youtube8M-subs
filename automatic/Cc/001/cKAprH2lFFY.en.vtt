00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.049
 monthey is set a strawberry train 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.939
 here is a strawberry tree and its 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:25.099
 key the strawberries three sizes of 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.609
 spacer rings one locking nut 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:34.399
 and a shim pocket 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.399
 five hundredths to 1 mm thick 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.770
 mounting for tenons this montage will us 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.890
 allow to finish the width of a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.530
 barrel it will be necessary to 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.340
 make the adjustment of a dimension between 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.770
 strawberries put up the tree in the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.640
 adapted support 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.710
 put the key then the rings 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.049
 to position the first 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.409
 strawberries compared to a rating of 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.409
 settings 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.440
 at 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.960
 attention to the mounting direction of the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.960
 strawberry 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.250
 set up the bins chosen for 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.250
 to make the coast between strawberries 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.410
 using a shim check 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.410
 quarters 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:39.540
 let's go out the strawberry let's change the stacking 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.540
 rings 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:26.640
 complete the mounting of the spacers and 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.640
 of the ring of the eyeglass pad 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.300
 be careful the ring height must 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.310
 allow immobilization of the stack 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.310
 for that, let's add a ring 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.640
 block fangs 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.870
 the mini of the hold must return 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.890
 the maxi no 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.010
 groove mounting 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.820
 it will be necessary to realize the 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.300
 setting the outer coast of 2 france 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.300
 3 sizes 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.219
 attention to positioning the foot to 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.219
 slide on the teeth 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.189
 as paul previous editing we will refine 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:33.769
 setting with setting wedges 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:36.949
 adapted care and cleanliness to achieve 

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:40.909
 Proper stacking care and cleanliness 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:43.489
 are essential the use of calais 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.469
 heels for this setting is forbidden the 

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:49.039
 strawberry teeth scratching the surface 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:51.769
 shifts for this it must use a 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:54.849
 setting wedge or bench of 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:54.849
 presets the tool
