00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.810
 So you probably do not have me 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.130
 So I can now understand 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.849
 few examples call from new ones 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.550
 testament where things contradict each other 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.469
 It's not you, it's just wrong 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.240
 and you have to see that too 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.210
 example of Judas after he got the money 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 he has received this in one place 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.150
 thrown out and hanged in the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.320
 another job is a two parts 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.460
 shattered and for example what do I have 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 yes still the coward tree where Jesus over 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
 he has cursed it 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.760
 a position immediately suspected at the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.730
 others do not work until the next day 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.940
 For example, I have one at customs 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.590
 appoints jesus younger once occupation of the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 matthaus and in the other story 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.780
 he calls the baby there have some 1 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.030
 Everybody is called to the history 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.129
 daughter of yavuz 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.809
 there was once said the r means mine 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.210
 daughter is sick in a job says 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.210
 he 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.420
 Well, well, that's a lot of mistakes 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.290
 and of course if you have the new one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.299
 testament looks natural 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.490
 say it can be said that can be 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.710
 and so on and so forth but you think 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.840
 must be the big one in context times 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.390
 consider everything so it 's natural 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.009
 also some things where I also still 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.110
 So one or two questions ask 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.159
 I am here now that which all 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.329
 I can answer questions now 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.310
 try as much as possible 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.840
 but I always think so, too 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 i have and i am i can explain 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.170
 i am god rich will be forever 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.869
 So I have enough time then 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.400
 to ask complex questions and it means 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.570
 Also replace all questions 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.259
 can not answer itself 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.140
 answer 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.880
 And there are questions there for the people 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.740
 So far, the goods deal with it 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.020
 Of course, knowing everything is natural 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.450
 but i think some things 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.909
 just did not want to spend too much time on it 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.430
 focus but thinker fit important 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.640
 and if the almost trifle report 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.369
 He informative the few inconsistencies but 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.930
 I guess God will be fine then 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.300
 do not explain everything what people do not 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.009
 An explanation for this is an explanation 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.660
 a flitzer maybe not today 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.349
 But that will happen in the future 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.349
 fall still closed
