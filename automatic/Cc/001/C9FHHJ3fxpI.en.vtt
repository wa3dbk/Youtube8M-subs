washroom I go into the room where
everything<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.070> set<00:00:14.280> up<00:00:14.839> okay<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.500> here<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
everything is set up okay so here is the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.660 
everything is set up okay so here is the
Lilliput<00:00:18.180> field<00:00:18.510> monitor<00:00:19.220> and<00:00:20.220> i<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
Lilliput field monitor and i have it

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.859 
Lilliput field monitor and i have it
hooked<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.359> Canon<00:00:21.840> XH<00:00:22.050> a1<00:00:22.830> S<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
hooked up to the Canon XH a1 S so the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.080 
hooked up to the Canon XH a1 S so the
idea<00:00:24.990> was<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> take<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.830> I'm<00:00:26.760> sick<00:00:27.060> of

have my Canon XH sorry my canon hv20
which<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.149> battery's<00:00:48.450> about<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> die<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.260> we

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
which the battery's about to die so we

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.990 
which the battery's about to die so we
should<00:00:49.559> look<00:00:49.680> at<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.950> quick<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.850> that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
should look at that quick I have that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
should look at that quick I have that
plugged<00:00:51.300> into<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> back<00:00:51.800> through<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> hdmi

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
plugged into the back through the hdmi

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.569 
plugged into the back through the hdmi
let's<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.120> quickly<00:00:54.300> ship<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.559> hdmi<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
let's just quickly ship this to hdmi I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.950 
let's just quickly ship this to hdmi I
just<00:00:57.059> hit<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> button<00:00:57.360> right<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.930> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
just hit a button right there and that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.189 
just hit a button right there and that
will<00:00:58.739> shift<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> canon<00:00:59.550> hv20<00:01:00.510> before<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
will shift to the canon hv20 before the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.130 
will shift to the canon hv20 before the
battery<00:01:01.350> runs<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:02.420> it<00:01:03.420> takes<00:01:03.629> about<00:01:03.780> like

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
battery runs out it takes about like

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.800 
battery runs out it takes about like
seven<00:01:04.530> seconds<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.519> load<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.360> really

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
seven seconds to load up it's really

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.840 
seven seconds to load up it's really
crisp<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.510> hdmi<00:01:09.510> plugged<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.850> really

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
crisp with the hdmi plugged in I really

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.810 
crisp with the hdmi plugged in I really
wish<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.060> Canon<00:01:12.780> XH<00:01:12.990> a1<00:01:13.320> S<00:01:13.650> had<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> hdmi<00:01:14.640> out

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
wish my Canon XH a1 S had the hdmi out

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
wish my Canon XH a1 S had the hdmi out
but<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.150> doesn't<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.659> let's<00:01:16.590> switch<00:01:16.799> back<00:01:16.830> over

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
but it doesn't so let's switch back over

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.679 
but it doesn't so let's switch back over
to<00:01:18.890> component<00:01:22.820> yeah<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.150> said<00:01:24.330> seven

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to component yeah like I said seven

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.880 
to component yeah like I said seven
seconds<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.759> then<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.799> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
seconds and then we can you know you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.670 
seconds and then we can you know you
it's<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> big<00:01:30.150> monitor<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it's just like a big monitor up there it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.859 
it's just like a big monitor up there it
seems<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> little<00:01:32.189> blurrier<00:01:32.790> than<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.479> hdmi

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
seems a little blurrier than the hdmi

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
seems a little blurrier than the hdmi
but<00:01:34.079> that's<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.500> expected<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:35.130> it's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
but that's to be expected because it's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.270 
but that's to be expected because it's
not<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.780> high-def<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:38.130> right

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
not you know high-def out all right

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.319 
not you know high-def out all right
let's<00:01:38.460> look<00:01:38.549> at<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> back<00:01:38.939> I'll<00:01:39.180> show<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
