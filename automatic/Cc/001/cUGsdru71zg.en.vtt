00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Well Piet hear the third game of yours 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.859
 your championship 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.050
 your fantastic initiative on this 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.300
 karting circuit pottendijk 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.269
 told you to turn the Today 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.039
 this is this is my game 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.410
 you enjoyed it yourself participation 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.070
 in the machines in 100cc 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.650
 the yellow event was also super it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 is nice this is the people respond 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.880
 goods as I want and yes I have 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.940
 the net in you gets nothing but praise about it 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.460
 concept about the games on say the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.960
 tires all together 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.719
 so what does that girl is feeling 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.059
 you still had it right 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.890
 yes of course you start this differently 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.629
 not on reboot so the sit the sit 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.760
 When not know rights and have thus 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.530
 it is the risk of what you do 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.129
 although I was convinced that this was 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.180
 The way is to get to go karting again 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.890
 to make it healthy 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 yes, because karting is on time 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.680
 of course quite unhealthy the games quite 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.020
 what matters are money is about politics 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.260
 you name it all together yes there 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.570
 also your portion of that got it 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.090
 to do with safety 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.600
 yes right now i have i have this afternoon 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.820
 I just saw a message from van 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.490
 mini lock boom am in of the dog and that 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.159
 he has been here with me for a number of weeks 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.470
 and there we talked about the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.270
 circuit situation because for us 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.490
 events from the button line 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.189
 we were at that time we were busy 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.070
 part of the circuit and too 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.000
 widen over the 9 meter width 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.510
 out 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.170
 with the result that hacking into it 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.590
 at home and a space 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.960
 end up with mister sleeping or because 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.400
 tires for example we are 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.259
 heart and work have been with 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.619
 finally decided to the 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.840
 remove the fence so that I have too 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.970
 no tires need to lie because it 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.360
 fencing how not to be protected 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.390
 and now it appears that my is lobo would 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.790
 here end of next month next week 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.510
 oversee your situation 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.910
 now it appears that there have been others here 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.190
 are those who have not imagined the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.350
 situation have viewed say tested 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.760
 and who are not satisfied with the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.730
 situation 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.950
 yes the safety is for them on this 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.519
 moment in the proceedings 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.470
 little strange this event a lot of water 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.650
 the delusion aqua planning with people 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.590
 throw the runway from two to three 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.060
 meters across the space that we finer 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.610
 find 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.739
 nothing to hand his own actually 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.030
 Two things you say she walks 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.820
 actually a bit ahead of the music 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.220
 because we actually had this before the end 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.019
 an appointment for my week yes 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.519
 this week is the appointment that are at 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.470
 to see if I work on the 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.709
 would rather have that right and that chance 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.600
 on yearling no not yet had is you 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.400
 personally informed because the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.109
 decides what has now been taken and what is right 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.410
 communicated by chrono karting on the 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:14.540
 on facebook that's the competition that 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.150
 was planned here for next weekend 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.130
 move is but after a different quina 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.959
 Bergen you are personally informed 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.380
 made that decision even only thing 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.010
 e-mail I have is from Mr. Spock 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.000
 and that came today I have that 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.400
 I have that e-mail when you get tonight 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.019
 seen for ever and no but around one 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.280
 five o'clock is when we arrived 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.540
 ok but there are two things 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.190
 they actually have the chance of that 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.950
 given that they are ahead of the music 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.049
 but you also say from our in it 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.550
 circuit is safe here 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.340
 First of all that is point correct 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.920
 In response to this, I went to Sir 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.050
 Finally, the question asked what is 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.390
 the well unsafe and this circuit like the 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.460
 current situation and you have the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.520
 current situation sometimes can 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.530
 because you have not been here 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.990
 Mr. Slotboom, he only has one thing 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.110
 done me written it is to 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.970
 who is safe and we don't know much 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.460
 you first of all it is 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.390
 she asked bye as a gentleman tree here 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.030
 would come 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.040
 that can see the situation that is 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.870
 I think a very important situation is me 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.370
 have a certain opinion of safety 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.680
 he has a certain opinion of 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.950
 security and we probably had it there 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.020
 arrived what I have here 100 meters 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.790
 stand fencing and subscribe for lock nicely 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.720
 find that fence six meters away 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.090
 had to 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.410
 I had put fence there and yes 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.670
 if you also in the short term 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.570
 there can be no problem at all 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.820
 the fence states but you say well 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.190
 tires for a railing that I find only recently 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.690
 really unsafe as long as they are right 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.720
 riders 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.240
 in animal bands on their right end 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.820
 then you immediately effect a helicopter 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.470
 and the cat is flying all over the 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.960
 we don't drive it either way 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.060
 dangerous and what you finally get 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.130
 I did that by direct way 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.860
 to pick that up to the 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.450
 ditch would have liked to move more 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.530
 spouts created well we have it 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.030
 seen today 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.340
 aqua planning on the straight with 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.310
 fast kart kart concept cars 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.900
 that arise that direction, and which are 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.669
 actually saved now by that extra 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.690
 space because otherwise they were full and full 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.540
 hacker go 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.840
 yes this is the way you like it 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.669
 see how very unfortunate unfortunate that it is not 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.870
 seems to be negotiable 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.300
 how much to the solution for this 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.400
 conflict or large nouja 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.710
 I'm going Mr. Lockboom I'm going 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.210
 of what he is today 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.310
 has taken place I'm going from first 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.280
 Jokes, I inform him that he is 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.259
 has not become aware of himself 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.090
 say that someone is walking here 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.009
 you see this, the situation on 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.780
 who in my opinion have no knowledge of it 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.500
 business has me mister brands 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.180
 yes you see it here he had a chance 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.870
 his life to be present tonight 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.750
 to be 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.470
 how it really is yes well i'm going there 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.449
 write a letter about and and 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:12.379
 with the announcement that one is in lock boom 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:15.360
 for they position for his time 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:16.229
 ahead of the music yes yes because the 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.860
 30th 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:23.669
 is the moment yes and yes all things 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.050
 those that are totally incorrect 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.120
 so for you all kart 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.919
 organizers are welcome here 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.449
 it's safe here and if it isn't 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:31.069
 you are willing to find something safe there 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.020
 to put on 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.610
 be safe and if one is from 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.240
 believes that a fence must come 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.919
 stand 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.719
 it says there and their events 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.659
 states just neck what's wrong with it 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.520
 the fence has, say, fourteen years 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.110
 done six meters away from 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.729
 circuit well they want a fence there 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.500
 at six meters from circuit 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.509
 do they have a 6 meter fence or a fence 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.919
 key clearly clearly a very difficult one 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:58.319
 clearly only the cat is in it 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.610
 the method of the system has me 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:01.680
 the possibility that given 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.740
 I think the answer is wrong 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:09.050
 I think they want to get rid of Piet 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.759
 van piet as a circuit is just a luxury 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.270
 We go our own way you will just 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.639
 target 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.719
 I'm just going ahead yes we are going ours 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.520
 events 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:19.379
 putting on some nice fat maybe now 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.969
 good to be that there is no circuit like that 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:25.289
 invested a lot in recent years 

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:26.969
 if you know you have something there in the 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:28.770
 future is going to happen 

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:35.389
 You have my big plan to be the interests 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:35.389
 very big we are very close to that 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:42.080
 how but we say that are very short 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.080
 not for an international itself
