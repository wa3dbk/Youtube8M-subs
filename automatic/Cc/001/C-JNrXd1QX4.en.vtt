many strips of fabric you'll need to cut

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180 
many strips of fabric you'll need to cut
for<00:00:11.880> your<00:00:11.969> binding<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:13.139> part<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.099> video

is on how to join all of those strips

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.560 
is on how to join all of those strips
that<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.970> recently<00:00:18.270> cut<00:00:19.580> the<00:00:20.580> first<00:00:20.850> thing<00:00:21.480> I

that you recently cut the first thing I
want<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.779> point<00:00:21.840> out<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.199> when<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:23.100> join<00:00:23.400> two

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
want to point out is when you join two

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.330 
want to point out is when you join two
pieces<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.510> fabric<00:00:24.660> together<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.189> know

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
pieces of fabric together we do know

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.910 
pieces of fabric together we do know
that<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.609> goes<00:00:26.789> wrong<00:00:27.420> right<00:00:28.109> sides<00:00:28.380> together

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that it goes wrong right sides together

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
that it goes wrong right sides together
and<00:00:29.340> most<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> time<00:00:30.599> when<00:00:30.929> we're<00:00:31.140> quilting

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and most of the time when we're quilting

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.530 
and most of the time when we're quilting
or<00:00:31.769> making<00:00:32.009> our<00:00:32.279> pieces<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.850> tend<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.360> be

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
or making our pieces we tend to be

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.020 
or making our pieces we tend to be
making<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> straight<00:00:34.710> seam<00:00:34.980> across<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.880> edge

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
making a straight seam across the edge

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.660 
making a straight seam across the edge
of<00:00:36.059> our<00:00:36.420> fabric<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.110> binding<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.100> prefer<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
of our fabric in binding I prefer to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.850 
of our fabric in binding I prefer to
make<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.000> diagonal<00:00:39.270> seam<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.140> find<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> little

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
make a diagonal seam I find it a little

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.459 
make a diagonal seam I find it a little
stronger<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.960> little<00:00:43.230> less

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
stronger and it's a little less

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.090 
stronger and it's a little less
noticeable<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.760> quilt<00:00:45.890> when<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
noticeable on your quilt when you do a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.400 
noticeable on your quilt when you do a
diagonal<00:00:47.489> seen<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.360> think<00:00:48.870> about<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> quilt

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
diagonal seen the think about the quilt

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.959 
diagonal seen the think about the quilt
top<00:00:49.620> when<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:49.950> finished<00:00:50.129> well<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.670> gets<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
top when it's finished well it gets a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
top when it's finished well it gets a
lot<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.149> folding<00:00:51.660> creases<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.350> things<00:00:52.770> like

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
lot of folding creases and things like

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:53.959 
lot of folding creases and things like
that<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.340> you're<00:00:53.489> putting<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> lot<00:00:53.820> of

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that and when you're putting a lot of

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.549 
that and when you're putting a lot of
stress<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.449> those<00:00:54.600> seams<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> outer<00:00:55.410> edge

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
stress on those seams on the outer edge

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.619 
stress on those seams on the outer edge
of<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.890> quilt<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.030> straight<00:00:57.329> seams

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
of that quilt if you do straight seams

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
of that quilt if you do straight seams
on<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:57.960> binding<00:00:58.350> those<00:00:58.770> are<00:00:58.949> probably<00:00:59.160> going

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
on your binding those are probably going

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.420 
on your binding those are probably going
to<00:00:59.550> give<00:00:59.730> way<00:01:00.000> first<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> diagonal<00:01:01.920> seam

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
to give way first so do a diagonal seam

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.870 
to give way first so do a diagonal seam
less<00:01:02.820> stress<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.390> its<00:01:04.049> hides<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.489> binding

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
less stress and its hides in the binding

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240 
less stress and its hides in the binding
much<00:01:06.030> easier<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.500> order<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> do<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
much easier so in order to do that you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.620 
much easier so in order to do that you
need<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.700> lay<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:08.970> first<00:01:09.180> piece<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.479> fabric

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
need to lay your first piece of fabric

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.010 
need to lay your first piece of fabric
down<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.500> side<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:12.420> lay<00:01:12.570> your<00:01:12.689> second

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
down right side up you lay your second

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.340 
down right side up you lay your second
piece<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.320> fabric<00:01:13.470> down<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.280> create<00:01:14.610> a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
piece of fabric down to create a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.830 
piece of fabric down to create a
45-degree<00:01:16.350> angle<00:01:16.820> if<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:18.270> laying<00:01:18.689> your

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
45-degree angle if you're laying your

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
45-degree angle if you're laying your
fabric<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> direction<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.580> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
fabric in the direction that I have it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.690 
fabric in the direction that I have it
right<00:01:21.060> now<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:22.200> need<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.520> your

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
right now you need to know that your

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.460 
right now you need to know that your
diagonal<00:01:24.000> seam<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> run<00:01:24.900> from<00:01:25.140> left

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
diagonal seam is going to run from left

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.969 
diagonal seam is going to run from left
to<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.119> facing<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.840> left<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
to right so if it's facing you left to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.149 
to right so if it's facing you left to
right<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:30.450> were<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.079> my<00:01:31.259> 45<00:01:31.740> degree

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
right if I were to make my 45 degree

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.690 
right if I were to make my 45 degree
angle<00:01:32.659> this<00:01:33.659> direction<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:35.070> need<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.670> sure

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
angle this direction you need to be sure

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.230 
angle this direction you need to be sure
you<00:01:36.119> remember<00:01:36.600> right<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.530> left<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.000> up

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you remember right to left so if it's up

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.620 
you remember right to left so if it's up
right<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.259> left<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.250> down<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.850> going<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
right to left if it's down it's going to

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.440 
right to left if it's down it's going to
be<00:01:43.189> left<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:45.530> that's<00:01:46.530> very<00:01:46.680> important

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.840 

I'm<00:01:49.960> going<00:01:50.289> to<00:01:50.500> take<00:01:50.680> my<00:01:50.890> fabric<00:01:51.280> now<00:01:51.399> laid<00:01:51.670> in

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
I'm going to take my fabric now laid in

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.389 
I'm going to take my fabric now laid in
my<00:01:51.969> position<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.899> way<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.049> have<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:53.530> if<00:01:54.340> you
