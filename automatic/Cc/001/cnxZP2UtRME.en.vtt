I<00:00:14.080> think<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:14.980> great<00:00:15.190> thing<00:00:15.370> about<00:00:15.400> a<00:00:15.639> motion

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
I think the great thing about a motion

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.540 
I think the great thing about a motion
capture<00:00:16.180> studio<00:00:17.140> when<00:00:17.410> we're<00:00:17.560> doing<00:00:17.740> all<00:00:18.279> of

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
capture studio when we're doing all of

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.099 
capture studio when we're doing all of
this<00:00:18.820> motion<00:00:19.060> captures<00:00:19.570> it<00:00:19.779> gives<00:00:19.930> you<00:00:20.050> a

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
this motion captures it gives you a

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.830 
this motion captures it gives you a
blank<00:00:20.380> slate<00:00:20.830> so<00:00:21.220> really<00:00:21.939> you<00:00:22.090> can<00:00:22.240> you<00:00:22.720> know

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
blank slate so really you can you know

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.650 
blank slate so really you can you know
fill<00:00:23.349> in<00:00:23.590> using<00:00:24.070> your<00:00:24.099> imagination<00:00:24.910> you<00:00:25.509> can

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
fill in using your imagination you can

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.470 
fill in using your imagination you can
fill<00:00:26.199> in<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.680> entire<00:00:27.009> space<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.489> the<00:00:28.119> great

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
fill in the entire space and the great

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.760 
fill in the entire space and the great
thing<00:00:28.660> about<00:00:28.689> Naughty<00:00:29.050> Dog<00:00:29.289> is<00:00:29.439> they<00:00:29.560> give<00:00:29.739> you

all these reference photos and they give
you<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.140> artwork<00:00:32.559> and<00:00:32.800> sort<00:00:33.040> of<00:00:33.100> the<00:00:33.309> rough

you the artwork and sort of the rough
sketchings<00:00:34.420> of<00:00:34.600> what<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> space<00:00:35.200> might<00:00:35.469> look

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
sketchings of what a space might look

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.350 
sketchings of what a space might look
like<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:36.430> main<00:00:36.579> thing<00:00:36.760> we<00:00:36.879> wanted<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.149> do<00:00:37.270> is

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
like the main thing we wanted to do is

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.600 
like the main thing we wanted to do is
we<00:00:37.450> really<00:00:37.690> wanted<00:00:37.930> to<00:00:38.079> render<00:00:38.440> sand<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.489> how

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
we really wanted to render sand and how

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.180 
we really wanted to render sand and how
our<00:00:40.539> characters<00:00:41.020> interact<00:00:41.559> with<00:00:41.710> sand<00:00:41.950> in<00:00:42.100> a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
our characters interact with sand in a

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.770 
our characters interact with sand in a
really<00:00:42.460> realistic<00:00:42.789> way<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.449> only<00:00:43.570> way<00:00:43.750> to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
really realistic way and the only way to

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.130 
really realistic way and the only way to
really<00:00:44.199> do<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.469> is<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:46.360> good<00:00:46.600> reference

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
really do that is to get good reference

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.800 
really do that is to get good reference
and<00:00:47.350> so<00:00:47.530> our<00:00:48.010> animators<00:00:48.700> our<00:00:49.090> effects<00:00:49.570> guys

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
and so our animators our effects guys

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.630 
and so our animators our effects guys
went<00:00:50.290> out<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.710> Imperial<00:00:51.100> dunes<00:00:51.310> in

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
went out to the Imperial dunes in

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.930 
went out to the Imperial dunes in
California<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.860> shot<00:00:53.860> themselves<00:00:54.130> trudging

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
California and shot themselves trudging

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.200 
California and shot themselves trudging
through<00:00:54.970> sand<00:00:55.829> falling<00:00:56.829> down<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:57.730> tumbling

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
through sand falling down and tumbling

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.229 
through sand falling down and tumbling
in<00:00:58.420> sand<00:00:58.840> we<00:00:59.350> actually<00:00:59.680> use<00:00:59.800> crash<00:01:00.130> pads<00:01:00.460> to

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
in sand we actually use crash pads to

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.450 
in sand we actually use crash pads to
walk<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.660> try<00:01:01.840> to<00:01:01.899> get<00:01:02.320> that<00:01:02.440> that<00:01:02.770> movement<00:01:03.309> of

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
walk to try to get that that movement of

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.389 
walk to try to get that that movement of
the<00:01:03.550> heel<00:01:03.730> how<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:04.210> kind<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.479> slips<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.399> it

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
the heel how it kind of slips and it

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.580 
the heel how it kind of slips and it
really<00:01:06.850> feels<00:01:07.119> that<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.420> think<00:01:07.630> we<00:01:07.719> did<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.469> good

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
really feels that I think we did a good

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.109 
really feels that I think we did a good
job<00:01:08.649> it's<00:01:09.159> really<00:01:09.340> great<00:01:09.549> to<00:01:09.579> actually<00:01:09.880> see

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
job it's really great to actually see

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.539 
job it's really great to actually see
like<00:01:10.960> when<00:01:11.170> you're<00:01:11.290> doing<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.189> game<00:01:12.340> and

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
like when you're doing the game and

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:13.889 
like when you're doing the game and
you're<00:01:12.670> seeing<00:01:12.969> them<00:01:13.180> actually<00:01:13.509> like<00:01:13.630> trudge

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
you're seeing them actually like trudge

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.209 
you're seeing them actually like trudge
up<00:01:14.049> the<00:01:14.200> dunes<00:01:14.409> for<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.649> first<00:01:14.829> time<00:01:14.979> I<00:01:15.009> think

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
up the dunes for the first time I think

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:16.679 
up the dunes for the first time I think
when<00:01:15.520> they<00:01:15.909> came<00:01:16.060> back<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.420> video

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
when they came back to the video

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:17.910 
when they came back to the video
reference<00:01:17.049> that<00:01:17.170> was<00:01:17.320> one<00:01:17.439> of<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.619> first

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
reference that was one of the first

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.399 
reference that was one of the first
parts<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.999> whole<00:01:19.240> video<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.929> can<00:01:20.289> see

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
parts in the whole video you can see

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.809 
parts in the whole video you can see
them<00:01:20.530> just<00:01:20.709> trying<00:01:20.979> different<00:01:21.100> ways<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.609> climb

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:21.819 
them just trying different ways to climb

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.669 
them just trying different ways to climb
up<00:01:21.999> the<00:01:22.149> dunes<00:01:22.359> and<00:01:22.659> climb<00:01:22.959> her<00:01:23.259> and<00:01:23.499> walk

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
up the dunes and climb her and walk

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.709 
up the dunes and climb her and walk
across<00:01:23.829> the<00:01:24.189> ridge<00:01:24.369> we<00:01:24.700> took<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.209> crash<00:01:25.420> pads

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
across the ridge we took the crash pads

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.239 
across the ridge we took the crash pads
and<00:01:25.869> put<00:01:25.990> them<00:01:26.139> on<00:01:26.229> an<00:01:26.350> angle<00:01:26.469> remember<00:01:27.130> this

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
and put them on an angle remember this

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:29.940 
and put them on an angle remember this
yeah<00:01:27.579> and<00:01:27.789> and<00:01:28.209> then<00:01:28.420> put<00:01:28.659> big<00:01:29.319> blankets<00:01:29.799> on

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
yeah and and then put big blankets on

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.010 
yeah and and then put big blankets on
those<00:01:30.130> crash<00:01:30.429> pads<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.969> then<00:01:31.240> had<00:01:31.509> me<00:01:31.689> kind<00:01:31.899> of

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
those crash pads and then had me kind of

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.980 
those crash pads and then had me kind of
bear<00:01:32.590> crawl<00:01:32.889> my<00:01:33.100> way<00:01:33.130> up<00:01:33.569> and<00:01:34.569> that's<00:01:34.719> what

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
bear crawl my way up and that's what

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.080 
bear crawl my way up and that's what
they<00:01:35.319> used<00:01:35.619> that<00:01:36.039> footage<00:01:36.369> that<00:01:36.969> we<00:01:37.060> captured

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
they used that footage that we captured

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.160 
they used that footage that we captured
in<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.719> suits<00:01:37.959> is<00:01:38.469> what<00:01:38.770> we<00:01:38.889> used<00:01:39.929> with<00:01:40.929> Drake

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
in the suits is what we used with Drake

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.410 
in the suits is what we used with Drake
climbing<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.770> dunes<00:01:41.799> I<00:01:42.310> think<00:01:42.670> if<00:01:42.880> I<00:01:43.029> had<00:01:43.209> come

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
climbing the dunes I think if I had come

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.050 
climbing the dunes I think if I had come
here<00:01:43.659> before<00:01:43.840> we<00:01:44.380> did<00:01:44.409> on<00:01:44.649> that<00:01:44.859> I<00:01:45.069> probably

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
here before we did on that I probably

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.309 
here before we did on that I probably
would<00:01:46.420> have<00:01:46.509> done<00:01:46.659> it<00:01:46.810> better

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
would have done it better

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.669 
would have done it better
I<00:01:47.829> think<00:01:48.490> it's<00:01:48.609> passable<00:01:49.209> right<00:01:49.479> yeah<00:01:50.049> what<00:01:50.590> we

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
I think it's passable right yeah what we

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.550 
I think it's passable right yeah what we
