when<00:03:08.890> it's<00:03:09.040> about<00:03:09.250> 97%<00:03:10.180> dry<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.860> way<00:03:12.069> I'm<00:03:12.489> not

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
when it's about 97% dry that way I'm not

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.199 
when it's about 97% dry that way I'm not
putting<00:03:13.030> heat<00:03:13.299> on<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.569> too<00:03:13.780> long<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.830> gets

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
putting heat on it too long and it gets

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.039 
putting heat on it too long and it gets
fairly<00:03:16.209> straight<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.599> course<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:16.959> not

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
fairly straight of course it's not

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.080 
fairly straight of course it's not
waiting<00:03:17.290> at<00:03:17.379> bone<00:03:17.560> strength<00:03:17.950> but<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.760> know<00:03:18.879> I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
waiting at bone strength but you know I

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.819 
waiting at bone strength but you know I
just<00:03:19.360> need<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.629> be<00:03:19.720> stretched<00:03:20.049> enough<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.650> that

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
just need to be stretched enough so that

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.509 
just need to be stretched enough so that
I<00:03:21.010> can<00:03:21.310> style<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.849> accordingly<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:23.519> another

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
I can style it accordingly and another

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.039 
I can style it accordingly and another
little<00:03:24.819> tidbit<00:03:25.120> about<00:03:26.049> how<00:03:26.560> my<00:03:26.799> hair<00:03:27.099> works<00:03:27.370> I

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
little tidbit about how my hair works I

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.920 
little tidbit about how my hair works I
like<00:03:29.049> can<00:03:29.470> never<00:03:29.709> get<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.069> ends<00:03:30.930> perfectly

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
like can never get the ends perfectly

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.199 
like can never get the ends perfectly
straight<00:03:32.319> but<00:03:32.530> that's<00:03:32.680> fine<00:03:32.980> because<00:03:33.670> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
straight but that's fine because the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.619 
straight but that's fine because the
major<00:03:34.420> concern<00:03:35.290> here<00:03:35.319> is<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.609> root<00:03:36.910> area<00:03:37.209> I'm

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
major concern here is the root area I'm

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.660 
major concern here is the root area I'm
just<00:03:37.959> trying<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.170> get<00:03:38.290> my<00:03:38.470> roots<00:03:38.709> nice<00:03:39.340> and

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
just trying to get my roots nice and

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.270 
just trying to get my roots nice and
straight<00:03:40.000> because<00:03:40.470> my<00:03:41.470> roots<00:03:41.739> are<00:03:42.010> the

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
straight because my roots are the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.220 
straight because my roots are the
tightest<00:03:42.849> spot<00:03:43.269> on<00:03:43.690> my<00:03:44.650> head<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.780> I'm<00:03:46.780> very

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
tightest spot on my head and I'm very

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.819 
tightest spot on my head and I'm very
tender<00:03:47.890> headed<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:48.489> if<00:03:48.609> my<00:03:48.790> roots<00:03:49.090> are

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
tender headed so if my roots are

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.920 
tender headed so if my roots are
relatively<00:03:50.829> straight<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.690> nice<00:03:52.690> and

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
relatively straight and nice and

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.229 
relatively straight and nice and
detangle<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.680> them<00:03:53.859> the<00:03:54.099> styling<00:03:54.519> process<00:03:55.000> is

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
detangle to them the styling process is

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.220 
detangle to them the styling process is
very<00:03:55.900> stress-free<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.700> as<00:03:58.359> you<00:03:58.540> can<00:03:58.720> see<00:03:59.019> my

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
very stress-free so as you can see my

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.020 
very stress-free so as you can see my
hair's<00:03:59.470> looking<00:03:59.650> pretty<00:04:00.040> dark<00:04:00.370> that's

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
hair's looking pretty dark that's

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.000 
hair's looking pretty dark that's
because<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.299> hunted<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.900> recently<00:04:04.470> yeah<00:04:05.470> it's<00:04:05.919> a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
because I hunted it recently yeah it's a

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.220 
because I hunted it recently yeah it's a
lot<00:04:06.160> darker<00:04:06.310> than<00:04:06.579> it<00:04:06.639> used<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.000> be

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
lot darker than it used to be

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.589 
lot darker than it used to be
interesting<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:09.549> noticed<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.329> when<00:04:10.510> I

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
interesting and I noticed that when I

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.979 
interesting and I noticed that when I
was<00:04:10.630> blowing<00:04:11.109> it<00:04:11.230> out<00:04:11.349> it<00:04:11.829> was<00:04:12.720> stronger<00:04:13.720> I

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
was blowing it out it was stronger I

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.500 
was blowing it out it was stronger I
think<00:04:14.049> it's<00:04:14.500> a<00:04:14.799> lot<00:04:15.280> less<00:04:15.609> susceptible<00:04:16.450> to

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
think it's a lot less susceptible to

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.740 
think it's a lot less susceptible to
damage<00:04:16.959> now<00:04:17.470> which<00:04:18.250> is<00:04:18.430> wonderful<00:04:18.700> so<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.599> guess

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
damage now which is wonderful so I guess

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.180 
damage now which is wonderful so I guess
this<00:04:19.900> is<00:04:20.049> what<00:04:20.200> my<00:04:20.349> hair's<00:04:20.590> looking<00:04:20.769> liking
