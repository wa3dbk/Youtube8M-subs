00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 hi to all the great couturiers 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.400
 I think this video will be interesting to a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.420
 who is interested in seeing how 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.609
 there is an increase in skill 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:24.029
 after 100 thousand points i.e. 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:27.660
 to achieve the milestone of the discovery of prints and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.939
 editable patterns a winter video because 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.000
 that I once had it very 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.780
 I wonder how she does it like 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.180
 prints open and now specially 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.180
 for this I and as you see there is no 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.920
 125 points to increase skill level 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.520
 I'll just buy 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.760
 this increase soon u increase by 1 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.460
 skill level order 75 coins as 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.730
 see i have them even more for her 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.369
 so here's how it happens 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.000
 increasing skill level and we see 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.510
 what besides 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 son of a colors of clothes and pattern colors 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.380
 And we have an editable pattern available. 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:25.170
 eprint and prints I have already opened 13 pieces 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.479
 this is my 14 print 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.650
 can push otherwise 2 game will 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.960
 save photos on your page 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.740
 this is such a trick of developers i click 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.770
 cancellation 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.500
 and now we can see what we 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.759
 discovered how to print the new will 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:53.990
 look at our clothes 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.990

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.700

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.340
