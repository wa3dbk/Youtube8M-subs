00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.649 
platter and the crossfader because you
know<00:01:43.350> our<00:01:43.650> I<00:01:43.680> DJ<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> bit<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.610> well<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.150> they're

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
know our I DJ a bit as well and they're

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.120 
know our I DJ a bit as well and they're
the<00:01:45.750> things<00:01:45.900> that<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.200> use<00:01:46.440> all<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.620> time<00:01:46.890> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the things that you use all the time I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.190 
the things that you use all the time I
think<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> big<00:01:48.150> innovation<00:01:48.690> for<00:01:48.870> us<00:01:48.990> was

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
think the big innovation for us was

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.690 
think the big innovation for us was
figuring<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.800> put<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.100> buttons<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.580> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
figuring out to put some buttons on the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.610 
figuring out to put some buttons on the
platter<00:01:50.940> and<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:52.140> those<00:01:52.380> things

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
platter and have that be those things

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.840 
platter and have that be those things
where<00:01:52.800> you<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.010> beat<00:01:53.220> match<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.760> hit

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
where you can beat match you can hit

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.490 
where you can beat match you can hit
stabs<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.600> home<00:01:54.810> d<00:01:55.050> scratches

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
stabs that you can home d scratches

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
stabs that you can home d scratches
that's<00:01:55.650> what<00:01:55.890> really<00:01:56.070> brought<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> together

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that's what really brought it together

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.980 
that's what really brought it together
for<00:01:56.909> us

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.480 

basically<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.080> have<00:02:01.110> three<00:02:01.830> streams<00:02:02.130> are

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
basically we have three streams are

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.610 
basically we have three streams are
coming<00:02:02.909> down<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.360> screen<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
coming down this screen and I think the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.320 
coming down this screen and I think the
thing<00:02:04.650> is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.130> difference<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:05.880> DJ<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
thing is the difference with DJ to

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.480 
thing is the difference with DJ to
guitar<00:02:06.750> hero<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.320> always<00:02:07.560> three<00:02:07.979> streams<00:02:08.280> as

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
guitar hero it's always three streams as

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.279 
guitar hero it's always three streams as
a<00:02:08.580> matter<00:02:08.759> what<00:02:08.940> level<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.300> are<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.959> where<00:02:10.140> we

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
a matter what level you are the where we

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.870 
a matter what level you are the where we
bring<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.619> difficulties<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.520> introduce

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
bring in difficulties we introduce

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.120 
bring in difficulties we introduce
things<00:02:12.090> like<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.569> cross<00:02:12.780> fader<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.980> will

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
things like the cross fader so that will

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.120 
things like the cross fader so that will
only<00:02:14.280> come<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.730> after<00:02:15.510> at<00:02:15.900> medium<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.560> above

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
only come in after at medium and above

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.550 
only come in after at medium and above
the<00:02:18.120> other<00:02:18.630> things<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:18.990> bring<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.350> our

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
