00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
because I'm just basing it on the

strength of the individual and the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.210 
strength of the individual and the
greens<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.480> little<00:02:36.750> bit<00:02:36.900> sturdier<00:02:37.290> tougher<00:02:38.010> and

the yellow is a little bit lighter okay
so<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.410> can<00:02:40.620> double<00:02:40.920> these<00:02:41.040> up<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.519> some

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
so you can double these up and some

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.059 
so you can double these up and some
exercises<00:02:42.410> based<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.560> what<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.799> made<00:02:43.950> your

exercises based on what you made your
muscle<00:02:44.370> group<00:02:44.549> you're<00:02:44.730> working<00:02:44.849> our<00:02:45.180> smaller

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
muscle group you're working our smaller

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.930 
muscle group you're working our smaller
muscle<00:02:45.810> group<00:02:45.989> well<00:02:46.530> will<00:02:47.130> require<00:02:47.760> more

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
muscle group well will require more

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.390 
muscle group well will require more
resistance<00:02:48.540> sure<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:49.079> like<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> general<00:02:50.250> leg

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
resistance sure so like a general leg

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.550 
resistance sure so like a general leg
press<00:02:50.670> that's<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:50.970> larger<00:02:51.329> exercise<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.319> take

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
this the great solution to get them to

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.700 
this the great solution to get them to
ease<00:05:20.130> them<00:05:20.460> into<00:05:20.670> exercising<00:05:21.420> as<00:05:22.320> I'm<00:05:22.440> sitting

ease them into exercising as I'm sitting
on<00:05:22.770> my<00:05:22.830> band's<00:05:23.100> it<00:05:23.640> could<00:05:23.850> be<00:05:24.060> because<00:05:24.630> you

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
on my band's it could be because you

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.200 
on my band's it could be because you
know<00:05:25.260> people<00:05:25.530> are<00:05:25.620> gonna<00:05:25.740> watch<00:05:25.980> TV<00:05:26.430> right<00:05:26.730> so

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
know people are gonna watch TV right so

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.820 
know people are gonna watch TV right so
we<00:05:27.570> really<00:05:27.810> need<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.080> get<00:05:28.200> them<00:05:28.380> do<00:05:28.560> some

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
we really need to get them do some

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.860 
we really need to get them do some
physical<00:05:29.250> activity<00:05:29.790> and<00:05:30.000> it<00:05:30.330> doesn't<00:05:30.660> take<00:05:30.840> a

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
physical activity and it doesn't take a

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.590 
physical activity and it doesn't take a
lot<00:05:31.140> of<00:05:31.500> physical<00:05:32.460> activity<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.180> promote

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
lot of physical activity to promote

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.660 
lot of physical activity to promote
weight<00:05:33.750> loss<00:05:33.810> so<00:05:34.710> we<00:05:34.980> find<00:05:35.280> that<00:05:35.460> if

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
weight loss so we find that if

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.790 
weight loss so we find that if
individuals<00:05:36.240> have<00:05:36.470> various<00:05:37.470> country

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800

high<00:05:40.950> volumes<00:05:41.310> of<00:05:41.490> exercise<00:05:42.060> maybe<00:05:42.480> from

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
high volumes of exercise maybe from

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.470 
high volumes of exercise maybe from
injury<00:05:43.170> or<00:05:43.290> obesity<00:05:43.800> already<00:05:44.370> that<00:05:45.090> this<00:05:45.300> is<00:05:45.450> a

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
injury or obesity already that this is a

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.590 
injury or obesity already that this is a
good<00:05:45.660> alternative<00:05:45.840> to<00:05:46.590> just<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.600> low-impact

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
good alternative to just a low-impact

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.880 
good alternative to just a low-impact
right<00:05:49.260> reduce<00:05:50.100> chances<00:05:50.340> of<00:05:50.640> injury<00:05:50.790> and

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
right reduce chances of injury and

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.930 
right reduce chances of injury and
