00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.500 

so<00:00:04.100> I'm<00:00:04.279> just<00:00:04.430> at<00:00:04.550> the<00:00:04.640> end<00:00:04.760> of<00:00:04.850> the<00:00:04.910> boil<00:00:05.120> here

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:05.510 
so I'm just at the end of the boil here

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.640 
so I'm just at the end of the boil here
and<00:00:05.630> I<00:00:05.690> wanted<00:00:05.900> to<00:00:06.020> show<00:00:06.319> how<00:00:07.040> the<00:00:08.650> the

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
and I wanted to show how the the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.010 
and I wanted to show how the the
recirculating<00:00:10.600> immersion<00:00:11.600> chiller<00:00:11.780> works

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.020 
recirculating immersion chiller works

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.539 
recirculating immersion chiller works
because<00:00:12.740> I've<00:00:12.860> had<00:00:12.949> a<00:00:12.980> bunch<00:00:13.100> of<00:00:13.219> people<00:00:13.309> ask

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
because I've had a bunch of people ask

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.100 
because I've had a bunch of people ask
me<00:00:13.730> about<00:00:13.760> it

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
me about it

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.780 
me about it
so<00:00:16.420> I'll<00:00:17.420> try<00:00:17.600> and<00:00:17.750> stick<00:00:17.930> a<00:00:17.960> photo<00:00:18.380> of<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:19.190> of

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
so I'll try and stick a photo of the of

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.070 
so I'll try and stick a photo of the of
the<00:00:20.030> immersion<00:00:20.210> chiller<00:00:20.510> outside<00:00:20.930> of<00:00:21.020> the

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
the immersion chiller outside of the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.770 
the immersion chiller outside of the
work<00:00:21.260> that's<00:00:21.950> how<00:00:22.100> the<00:00:22.160> boil<00:00:22.460> into<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.570> start

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:23.780 
work that's how the boil into the start

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.570 
work that's how the boil into the start
of<00:00:23.840> this<00:00:23.900> video<00:00:24.170> but<00:00:24.500> just<00:00:24.770> one<00:00:25.130> or<00:00:25.220> two<00:00:25.310> quick

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
of this video but just one or two quick

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.550 
of this video but just one or two quick
ly<00:00:25.760> show<00:00:25.940> how<00:00:26.120> it<00:00:26.210> works<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:26.750> I'm<00:00:27.230> done<00:00:27.440> the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
ly show how it works so I'm done the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.359 
ly show how it works so I'm done the
boil<00:00:27.770> right<00:00:27.920> now<00:00:28.070> you<00:00:28.970> can<00:00:29.119> see<00:00:29.390> I<00:00:29.860> am<00:00:30.860> at<00:00:31.070> just

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
boil right now you can see I am at just

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.560 
boil right now you can see I am at just
about<00:00:33.460> 100<00:00:34.460> degrees<00:00:34.520> because<00:00:35.030> it's<00:00:35.180> boiling

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
about 100 degrees because it's boiling

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.300 
about 100 degrees because it's boiling
my<00:00:35.989> thermometer<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.500> about<00:00:36.680> a<00:00:36.710> degree<00:00:37.010> off<00:00:37.130> it

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
my thermometer is about a degree off it

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.790 
my thermometer is about a degree off it
looks<00:00:37.430> like<00:00:37.810> and<00:00:38.810> as<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.110> can<00:00:39.230> see<00:00:39.290> there's<00:00:39.739> a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
looks like and as you can see there's a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.470 
looks like and as you can see there's a
boil<00:00:40.130> going<00:00:40.399> on<00:00:41.470> so<00:00:42.470> I'm<00:00:42.800> just<00:00:43.010> going<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:43.489> turn

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
boil going on so I'm just going to turn

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.340 
boil going on so I'm just going to turn
my<00:00:44.930> kettle<00:00:45.380> off<00:00:45.560> here<00:00:46.809> that<00:00:47.809> turns<00:00:48.050> off<00:00:48.200> my

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
my kettle off here that turns off my

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.139 
my kettle off here that turns off my
electrical<00:00:48.980> elements<00:00:49.430> no<00:00:49.820> it's<00:00:50.000> off<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:52.059> as<00:00:53.059> I

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
electrical elements no it's off and as I

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.000 
electrical elements no it's off and as I
turn<00:00:53.360> it<00:00:53.390> off<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:53.930> starts<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.260> slow<00:00:54.440> down<00:00:54.649> and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
turn it off it starts to slow down and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.440 
turn it off it starts to slow down and
the<00:00:55.190> boil<00:00:55.430> will<00:00:55.640> stop<00:00:55.820> rolling<00:00:56.180> almost

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
the boil will stop rolling almost

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.990 
the boil will stop rolling almost
immediately<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.829> then<00:00:57.950> I<00:00:58.040> just<00:00:58.190> on<00:00:58.550> the

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
immediately and then I just on the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.090 
immediately and then I just on the
counter<00:00:59.540> flow<00:00:59.690> I<00:00:59.809> mean<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.170> recirculating

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
counter flow I mean the recirculating

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.330 
counter flow I mean the recirculating
chiller<00:01:01.340> here<00:01:01.610> I<00:01:01.640> have<00:01:02.170> I<00:01:03.519> have<00:01:04.519> three<00:01:06.159> drops<00:01:07.159> I

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
chiller here I have I have three drops I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.639 
chiller here I have I have three drops I
guess<00:01:07.520> one<00:01:08.359> of<00:01:08.450> them<00:01:08.539> is<00:01:08.689> in<00:01:08.929> that<00:01:09.170> one's<00:01:09.289> here

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
guess one of them is in that one's here

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.109 
guess one of them is in that one's here
this<00:01:09.920> one's<00:01:10.130> out<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.639> this<00:01:10.969> is<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
this one's out and this is the

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.149 
this one's out and this is the
recirculation<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.020> what<00:01:12.770> I<00:01:12.799> need<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.069> do

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
recirculation and what I need to do

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.599 
recirculation and what I need to do
first<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:14.859> not<00:01:15.859> very<00:01:16.039> good<00:01:16.159> with<00:01:16.249> this<00:01:16.369> focus

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
first is not very good with this focus

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.769 
first is not very good with this focus
thing<00:01:16.909> yet<00:01:19.060> what<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.119> need<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.329> do<00:01:20.450> first<00:01:20.600> is

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:20.779 
thing yet what I need to do first is

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.149 
thing yet what I need to do first is
kind<00:01:20.990> of<00:01:21.049> just<00:01:21.170> chill<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.499> a<00:01:21.649> couple<00:01:21.979> degrees

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
kind of just chill it a couple degrees

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.769 
kind of just chill it a couple degrees
and<00:01:22.700> I'll<00:01:22.969> just<00:01:23.060> run<00:01:23.209> some<00:01:23.359> hot<00:01:23.389> water

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
and I'll just run some hot water

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:24.940 
and I'll just run some hot water
I<00:01:23.869> mean<00:01:24.079> cold<00:01:24.259> water<00:01:24.439> through<00:01:24.649> it<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:24.829> make

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
I mean cold water through it to make

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.340 
I mean cold water through it to make
that<00:01:25.039> happen<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.899> can<00:01:27.020> I'll<00:01:27.139> show<00:01:27.289> you

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
that happen and you can I'll show you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.649 
that happen and you can I'll show you
this<00:01:27.469> in<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.649> sec<00:01:27.829> this<00:01:27.979> is<00:01:28.039> the<00:01:28.389> I'll<00:01:29.389> have<00:01:29.450> an

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
this in a sec this is the I'll have an

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.789 
this in a sec this is the I'll have an
ice<00:01:29.779> bath<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.369> pre<00:01:31.369> chill<00:01:31.639> the<00:01:31.729> water<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.799> but

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
ice bath to pre chill the water and but

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:34.959 
ice bath to pre chill the water and but
I<00:01:33.829> don't<00:01:34.039> need<00:01:34.159> it<00:01:34.249> right<00:01:34.279> away<00:01:34.399> because<00:01:34.639> it'll

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
I don't need it right away because it'll

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.029 
I don't need it right away because it'll
just<00:01:35.149> it'll<00:01:35.420> just<00:01:36.109> burn<00:01:36.200> through<00:01:36.439> my<00:01:36.560> my<00:01:36.889> ice

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
just it'll just burn through my my ice

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.529 
just it'll just burn through my my ice
right<00:01:37.369> away<00:01:37.549> if<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.759> use<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:37.999> right<00:01:38.090> now<00:01:38.149> so<00:01:38.450> I'm

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
right away if I use it right now so I'm

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.099 
right away if I use it right now so I'm
just<00:01:38.599> going<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.840> turn<00:01:38.959> the<00:01:39.079> cold<00:01:39.289> water<00:01:39.439> on

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
just going to turn the cold water on

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.989 
just going to turn the cold water on
look<00:01:42.109> for<00:01:42.289> any<00:01:42.439> leaks<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:43.549> have<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.819> watch

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:43.999 
look for any leaks and you have to watch

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.809 
look for any leaks and you have to watch
this<00:01:44.209> part<00:01:44.419> so<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.689> kind<00:01:44.899> of<00:01:44.929> explodes<00:01:45.819> with

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
this part so it kind of explodes with

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.519 
this part so it kind of explodes with
some<00:01:47.029> steam<00:01:47.329> yeah<00:01:49.149> not<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:50.359> good<00:01:50.539> I<00:01:50.749> get<00:01:51.380> for

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:51.529 
some steam yeah not so good I get for

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:55.269 
some steam yeah not so good I get for
the<00:01:51.590> camera<00:01:52.329> and<00:01:53.740> anyway<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:54.770> want<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.099> for<00:01:55.249> a

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
the camera and anyway I want that for a

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:58.379 
the camera and anyway I want that for a
steam<00:01:55.490> bubble<00:01:55.759> comes<00:01:55.939> up<00:01:56.119> it's<00:01:56.599> a<00:01:56.689> lot<00:01:56.810> safer

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
steam bubble comes up it's a lot safer

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:03.870 
steam bubble comes up it's a lot safer
usually<00:01:59.389> don't<00:01:59.539> turn<00:01:59.659> on<00:01:59.840> quite<00:02:00.139> that<00:02:00.319> fast

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.980 

I'll<00:02:04.880> come<00:02:05.090> back<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.420> sec<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:07.780> I've<00:02:08.780> got<00:02:08.869> the

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
I'll come back in a sec so I've got the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.419 
I'll come back in a sec so I've got the
steam<00:02:09.229> off<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> lens<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.130> clean<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
steam off the lens and I clean the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.010 
steam off the lens and I clean the
couple<00:02:10.729> droplets<00:02:11.090> off<00:02:11.740> hope<00:02:13.600> so

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
couple droplets off hope so

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.210 
couple droplets off hope so
as<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.380> see<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.620> what's<00:02:15.890> coming<00:02:16.100> out<00:02:16.190> of

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
as you can see the what's coming out of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.800 
as you can see the what's coming out of
here<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.459> actually<00:02:16.760> probably<00:02:17.300> see<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.630> little

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
here is actually probably see a little

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.840 
here is actually probably see a little
bit<00:02:17.959> scheme<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.440> canopy<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.490> video

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
bit scheme in the canopy in the video

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.110 
bit scheme in the canopy in the video
but<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:21.160> can<00:02:22.160> see<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> lot<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:22.670> here

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
but I can see a lot of it here

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.150 
but I can see a lot of it here
and<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:24.110> we're<00:02:24.290> starting<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.590> chill<00:02:24.950> we're

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
and so we're starting to chill we're

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.080 
and so we're starting to chill we're
down<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.340> couple<00:02:25.580> degrees<00:02:25.940> already<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.640> you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
down a couple degrees already and you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
down a couple degrees already and you
can<00:02:32.209> see<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.450> it's<00:02:32.540> actually<00:02:32.810> started<00:02:33.050> to

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
can see that it's actually started to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.210 
can see that it's actually started to
clear<00:02:33.319> out<00:02:33.470> already

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
clear out already

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.920 
clear out already
and<00:02:34.520> there's<00:02:34.819> some<00:02:34.940> cold<00:02:35.120> break<00:02:35.330> going<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and there's some cold break going on and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.780 
and there's some cold break going on and
immediately<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:38.180> starts<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:39.260> cold

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
immediately it it it starts to get cold

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.430 
immediately it it it starts to get cold
but<00:02:40.790> thermometer<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.390> still<00:02:41.540> showing<00:02:41.750> looks

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
but thermometer is still showing looks

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.280 
but thermometer is still showing looks
like<00:02:42.590> 96<00:02:43.130> degrees<00:02:43.870> but<00:02:44.870> if<00:02:44.989> I<00:02:45.110> start

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
like 96 degrees but if I start

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.390 
like 96 degrees but if I start
recirculating<00:02:45.860> that'll<00:02:46.040> drop<00:02:46.160> really

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
recirculating that'll drop really

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
recirculating that'll drop really
quickly<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.000> reason<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:49.420> around

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
quickly and the reason is that around

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.540 
quickly and the reason is that around
the<00:02:50.660> coil<00:02:50.959> gets<00:02:51.320> really<00:02:51.650> cold<00:02:51.830> really<00:02:52.100> quickly

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
the coil gets really cold really quickly

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.340 
the coil gets really cold really quickly
but<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.940> rest<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.450> rest<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.110> and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
but the rest of the the rest of the and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.000 
but the rest of the the rest of the and
the<00:02:55.190> word<00:02:55.519> in<00:02:55.700> there<00:02:56.110> stays<00:02:57.110> really<00:02:57.380> hot<00:02:57.590> so

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
the word in there stays really hot so

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.150 
the word in there stays really hot so
what<00:02:58.880> we<00:02:59.000> do<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.180> help<00:02:59.540> with<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.110> we<00:03:00.980> come

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
what we do to help with that is we come

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.530 
what we do to help with that is we come
out<00:03:01.250> of<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.430> bottom<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.790> kettle<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.450> we

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
out of the bottom of the kettle and we

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.360 
out of the bottom of the kettle and we
go<00:03:02.690> through<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:05.150> pump<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.720> then<00:03:06.680> we<00:03:07.010> go<00:03:07.130> back

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
go through this pump and then we go back

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.530 
go through this pump and then we go back
there's<00:03:07.640> just<00:03:07.790> nothing<00:03:08.030> there's<00:03:08.180> nothing<00:03:08.450> in

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
there's just nothing there's nothing in

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.170 
there's just nothing there's nothing in
here<00:03:08.890> except<00:03:09.890> for<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.070> valve<00:03:10.250> let<00:03:10.850> me<00:03:10.910> go<00:03:11.030> back

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
here except for a valve let me go back

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.940 
here except for a valve let me go back
up<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.630> then<00:03:11.870> through<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.650> could<00:03:12.829> actually

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
up and then through and I could actually

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.990 
up and then through and I could actually
goes<00:03:13.250> down<00:03:14.650> down<00:03:15.650> into<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.070> kettle<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.549> spits

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
goes down down into the kettle and spits

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.729 
goes down down into the kettle and spits
directly<00:03:17.780> into<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.140> kettle<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.410> you'll<00:03:18.590> see

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
directly into the kettle and you'll see

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.530 
directly into the kettle and you'll see
it'll<00:03:18.980> start<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.310> whirlpool<00:03:19.670> here<00:03:19.910> in<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.269> second

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
it'll start a whirlpool here in a second

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.509 
it'll start a whirlpool here in a second
once<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.750> start<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.019> up<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.350> it's<00:03:22.130> important

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
once I start it up and it's important

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.220 
once I start it up and it's important
that<00:03:22.579> they<00:03:23.420> don't<00:03:23.570> start<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.870> pump<00:03:24.049> until

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
that they don't start the pump until

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.750 
that they don't start the pump until
it's<00:03:24.470> cooled<00:03:24.680> off<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.829> few<00:03:25.070> degrees<00:03:25.190> because<00:03:25.640> if

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
it's cooled off a few degrees because if

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.740 
it's cooled off a few degrees because if
it's<00:03:25.880> boiling<00:03:26.120> when<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.510> goes<00:03:26.600> through<00:03:26.630> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
it's boiling when it goes through the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.420 
it's boiling when it goes through the
pump<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.110> pump<00:03:27.140> will<00:03:27.410> start<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.680> stall<00:03:27.920> just

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
pump the pump will start to stall just

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.710 
pump the pump will start to stall just
because<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:29.000> pump<00:03:29.180> doesn't<00:03:29.420> do<00:03:29.480> very<00:03:29.510> well

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
because the pump doesn't do very well

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.900 
because the pump doesn't do very well
with<00:03:29.989> non<00:03:30.140> liquids<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:31.430> there<00:03:31.610> are<00:03:31.700> steam

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
with non liquids and there are steam

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.000 
with non liquids and there are steam
bubbles<00:03:32.269> in<00:03:32.360> there<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.440> have<00:03:33.650> this<00:03:33.769> valve

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
bubbles in there so I have this valve

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.870 
bubbles in there so I have this valve
open<00:03:35.019> salvus<00:03:36.019> closed<00:03:36.470> I'm<00:03:37.370> just<00:03:37.519> gonna<00:03:37.610> turn

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
open salvus closed I'm just gonna turn

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.460 
open salvus closed I'm just gonna turn
the<00:03:38.030> pump<00:03:38.239> on<00:03:38.360> here<00:03:39.250> there<00:03:40.250> we<00:03:40.310> go

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.560 

and<00:03:43.310> then<00:03:43.520> I'm<00:03:43.610> just<00:03:43.700> gonna<00:03:43.850> turn<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:44.270> valve

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
and then I'm just gonna turn this valve

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.340 
and then I'm just gonna turn this valve
on<00:03:44.870> I'm<00:03:45.320> gonna<00:03:45.530> open<00:03:45.740> it<00:03:45.860> up<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:47.330> as<00:03:48.050> I<00:03:48.200> do<00:03:48.260> that

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
on I'm gonna open it up and as I do that

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.990 
on I'm gonna open it up and as I do that
I<00:03:48.500> mean<00:03:48.650> I'm<00:03:48.860> gonna<00:03:49.010> focus<00:03:49.220> on<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:49.610> bits

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
I mean I'm gonna focus on this bits

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.490 
I mean I'm gonna focus on this bits
thermometer<00:03:50.480> here<00:03:50.720> because<00:03:50.990> you'll<00:03:51.140> see<00:03:51.350> that

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
thermometer here because you'll see that

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.370 
thermometer here because you'll see that
it'll<00:03:51.680> drop<00:03:52.030> there's<00:03:53.030> no<00:03:53.210> liquid<00:03:53.840> flowing<00:03:54.140> yet

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
it'll drop there's no liquid flowing yet

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.810 
it'll drop there's no liquid flowing yet
and<00:03:54.530> you'll<00:03:54.620> see<00:03:54.860> exactly<00:03:55.190> when<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.460> turn<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.730> on

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
and you'll see exactly when I turn it on

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.370 
and you'll see exactly when I turn it on
because<00:03:55.910> it'll<00:03:56.180> drop<00:03:56.390> probably<00:03:56.780> five<00:03:57.080> or<00:03:57.260> ten

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
because it'll drop probably five or ten

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.430 
because it'll drop probably five or ten
degrees<00:03:57.650> right<00:03:57.860> away<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.820> can<00:04:02.060> hear<00:04:02.300> it

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
degrees right away so you can hear it

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.700 
degrees right away so you can hear it
and<00:04:03.610> then<00:04:04.610> you<00:04:04.760> can<00:04:04.880> see<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.300> dropped<00:04:05.690> well<00:04:06.650> I

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
and then you can see it's dropped well I

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.110 
and then you can see it's dropped well I
guess<00:04:06.830> about<00:04:07.040> five<00:04:07.100> degrees<00:04:07.370> right<00:04:07.910> right

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
guess about five degrees right right

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.600 
guess about five degrees right right
away<00:04:08.330> and<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.380> will<00:04:09.740> keep<00:04:09.890> dropping<00:04:10.100> I'm

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
away and that will keep dropping I'm

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.190 
away and that will keep dropping I'm
just<00:04:10.760> gonna<00:04:10.880> keep<00:04:11.210> open<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.660> valve<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.990> little

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
just gonna keep open the valve a little

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.180 
just gonna keep open the valve a little
more<00:04:14.020> if<00:04:15.020> we<00:04:15.200> look<00:04:15.350> in<00:04:15.500> here<00:04:15.740> you'll<00:04:15.890> see<00:04:16.070> that

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
more if we look in here you'll see that

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.830 
more if we look in here you'll see that
the<00:04:16.310> words<00:04:16.489> actually<00:04:16.850> spinning<00:04:17.269> encircled

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
the words actually spinning encircled

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.380 
the words actually spinning encircled
right<00:04:17.959> now<00:04:18.080> and<00:04:18.830> that's<00:04:18.890> coming<00:04:19.580> out<00:04:19.700> of<00:04:19.940> the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
here and going down and then kind of

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.490 
here and going down and then kind of
just<00:04:26.120> spitting<00:04:26.420> out<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:26.870> going<00:04:27.080> around<00:04:27.320> in<00:04:27.440> a

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
just spitting out and going around in a

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.960 
just spitting out and going around in a
circle<00:04:27.530> like<00:04:27.920> this<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:30.800> can<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.430> have<00:04:31.760> ten

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
circle like this so I can I have ten

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.730 
circle like this so I can I have ten
gallons<00:04:32.300> in<00:04:32.390> here<00:04:32.600> I<00:04:32.930> can<00:04:33.290> fill<00:04:33.470> this<00:04:33.560> whole

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
gallons in here I can fill this whole

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.860 
gallons in here I can fill this whole
movement<00:04:33.950> probably<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:35.270> time<00:04:35.330> of<00:04:35.630> year<00:04:35.750> it's

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
movement probably this time of year it's

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.110 
movement probably this time of year it's
October<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.860> can<00:04:37.370> chill<00:04:37.520> this<00:04:37.610> whole<00:04:37.820> thing<00:04:38.000> and

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
October I can chill this whole thing and

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.000 
October I can chill this whole thing and
probably<00:04:39.940> probably<00:04:40.940> 20<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.420> 25<00:04:41.780> minutes

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
probably probably 20 to 25 minutes

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.750 
probably probably 20 to 25 minutes
depending<00:04:43.010> how<00:04:43.130> cold<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.460> ground<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.670> little

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
depending how cold the ground a little

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.180 
depending how cold the ground a little
bit<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.390> ground<00:04:44.600> water<00:04:44.750> is<00:04:44.920> it's<00:04:45.920> been<00:04:46.040> pretty

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
bit the ground water is it's been pretty

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.560 
bit the ground water is it's been pretty
cold<00:04:46.370> out<00:04:46.550> lately<00:04:46.700> so<00:04:46.940> it's<00:04:47.030> probably<00:04:47.300> pretty

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
cold out lately so it's probably pretty

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.380 
cold out lately so it's probably pretty
cool<00:04:48.310> anyway<00:04:49.310> you'll<00:04:49.730> see<00:04:49.850> that<00:04:49.970> I'm<00:04:50.090> are<00:04:50.180> down

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
cool anyway you'll see that I'm are down

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.909 
cool anyway you'll see that I'm are down
to<00:04:50.510> 80<00:04:50.630> degrees<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:52.550> that's<00:04:52.790> how<00:04:53.000> the

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
to 80 degrees and that's how the

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.600 
to 80 degrees and that's how the
recirculating<00:04:54.919> Emerson<00:04:55.280> chiller<00:04:55.460> works<00:04:55.669> I

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
recirculating Emerson chiller works I

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.650 
recirculating Emerson chiller works I
almost<00:04:58.610> forgot<00:04:58.910> so<00:04:59.180> once<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.390> get<00:04:59.510> down<00:04:59.600> to

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
almost forgot so once I get down to

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.140 
almost forgot so once I get down to
about<00:04:59.930> 60<00:05:00.440> degrees<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:01.190> like<00:05:01.700> to<00:05:01.790> put<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.000> lid

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
about 60 degrees I like to put the lid

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.260 
about 60 degrees I like to put the lid
on<00:05:02.300> so<00:05:02.510> that<00:05:03.160> nothing<00:05:04.160> nothing<00:05:04.730> from<00:05:05.120> the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
on so that nothing nothing from the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.770 
on so that nothing nothing from the
ceiling<00:05:05.930> here<00:05:06.080> my<00:05:06.230> basement<00:05:06.410> falls<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:07.480> and<00:05:08.480> I

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
ceiling here my basement falls in and I

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.909 
ceiling here my basement falls in and I
just<00:05:08.990> wait<00:05:09.110> till<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:09.320> get<00:05:09.380> stupid<00:05:09.680> about

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
just wait till I get stupid about

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.110 
just wait till I get stupid about
temperatures<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.610> make<00:05:10.730> sure<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.000> I've

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
temperatures to make sure that I've

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.470 
temperatures to make sure that I've
blown<00:05:11.390> off<00:05:11.630> all<00:05:11.900> the<00:05:12.220> auto<00:05:13.220> dms<00:05:13.640> precursor<00:05:14.180> or

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
blown off all the auto dms precursor or

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.920 
blown off all the auto dms precursor or
anything<00:05:14.720> that<00:05:15.580> might<00:05:16.580> evaporate<00:05:17.300> out<00:05:17.570> of<00:05:17.840> the

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
anything that might evaporate out of the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.440 
anything that might evaporate out of the
liquid<00:05:18.580> usually<00:05:19.580> do<00:05:19.790> this<00:05:19.940> in<00:05:20.090> two<00:05:20.210> hands

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
liquid usually do this in two hands

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.830 
liquid usually do this in two hands
there<00:05:21.260> we<00:05:21.320> go<00:05:22.000> so<00:05:23.000> that<00:05:23.150> just<00:05:23.390> leaves<00:05:23.540> a<00:05:23.660> little

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
there we go so that just leaves a little

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.880 
there we go so that just leaves a little
bit<00:05:23.930> of<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.050> hole<00:05:24.230> for<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.740> pipes<00:05:25.010> to<00:05:25.190> come<00:05:25.340> out

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
bit of a hole for the pipes to come out

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.170 
bit of a hole for the pipes to come out
so<00:05:27.890> I<00:05:27.919> have<00:05:28.160> the<00:05:28.220> water<00:05:28.430> going<00:05:28.610> pretty<00:05:28.940> quickly

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
so I have the water going pretty quickly

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.880 
so I have the water going pretty quickly
right<00:05:29.419> now<00:05:29.450> this<00:05:29.780> side<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.050> very<00:05:30.110> cold<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.740> this

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
right now this side is very cold to this

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.460 
right now this side is very cold to this
side<00:05:31.100> and<00:05:31.400> this<00:05:31.880> side<00:05:31.940> is<00:05:32.180> actually<00:05:32.480> it's<00:05:33.320> not

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
side and this side is actually it's not

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.110 
side and this side is actually it's not
too<00:05:33.950> warm<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.250> touch<00:05:34.280> with<00:05:34.640> if<00:05:34.730> I<00:05:34.820> turn<00:05:35.000> the

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
too warm to touch with if I turn the

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.850 
too warm to touch with if I turn the
water<00:05:35.270> down<00:05:35.450> a<00:05:35.510> little<00:05:35.630> bit<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:35.900> will<00:05:35.960> be<00:05:36.140> and

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
water down a little bit it will be and

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.080 
water down a little bit it will be and
this<00:05:36.950> one<00:05:37.160> is<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.430> same<00:05:37.610> temperature<00:05:37.970> as<00:05:38.030> the

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
this one is the same temperature as the

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.800 
this one is the same temperature as the
water<00:05:38.330> so<00:05:38.660> basically

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
water so basically

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
water so basically
looking<00:05:40.500> at<00:05:40.590> about<00:05:40.880> 56<00:05:41.880> degrees<00:05:42.240> right<00:05:42.450> now

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
looking at about 56 degrees right now

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.670 
looking at about 56 degrees right now
and<00:05:43.830> I<00:05:43.950> find<00:05:44.280> at<00:05:44.490> this<00:05:44.639> point<00:05:45.200> it<00:05:46.200> makes<00:05:46.470> sense

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
and I find at this point it makes sense

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.460 
and I find at this point it makes sense
to<00:05:47.040> I<00:05:47.580> can<00:05:48.030> crank<00:05:48.240> back<00:05:48.450> with<00:05:48.630> the<00:05:48.930> water<00:05:49.380> a

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
to I can crank back with the water a

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.460 
to I can crank back with the water a
little<00:05:49.650> bit<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:53.419> there<00:05:54.419> we<00:05:54.480> go<00:05:54.540> it's<00:05:54.900> coming

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
little bit so there we go it's coming

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.720 
little bit so there we go it's coming
over<00:05:55.650> there<00:05:55.800> pretty<00:05:55.919> quickly<00:05:56.190> so<00:05:56.310> if<00:05:56.550> I<00:05:56.669> turn

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
over there pretty quickly so if I turn

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.580 
over there pretty quickly so if I turn
it<00:05:56.940> down<00:05:56.970> a<00:05:57.090> little<00:05:57.210> bit<00:05:57.450> it'll<00:05:57.600> help<00:05:57.780> just

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
it down a little bit it'll help just

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.390 
it down a little bit it'll help just
save<00:05:58.740> some<00:05:58.950> water

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
save some water

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.950 
save some water
not<00:05:59.820> that<00:05:59.970> I<00:06:00.030> care<00:06:00.090> too<00:06:00.419> much<00:06:00.450> about<00:06:00.630> it

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
not that I care too much about it

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.250 
not that I care too much about it
because<00:06:01.230> the<00:06:01.380> way<00:06:01.470> Montreal<00:06:01.889> works<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:04.110> then

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
because the way Montreal works and then

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.430 
because the way Montreal works and then
here<00:06:04.860> I<00:06:04.889> have<00:06:05.220> this<00:06:05.310> pre<00:06:05.550> chiller<00:06:05.820> and<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:06.810> have

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
here I have this pre chiller and I have

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.830 
here I have this pre chiller and I have
put<00:06:07.680> some<00:06:07.980> cold<00:06:08.850> water<00:06:09.090> in<00:06:09.270> this<00:06:09.360> bucket<00:06:09.419> I'm

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
put some cold water in this bucket I'm

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.180 
put some cold water in this bucket I'm
just<00:06:09.990> gonna<00:06:10.110> throw<00:06:10.200> some<00:06:10.290> icing<00:06:10.680> on<00:06:10.770> top<00:06:10.919> of<00:06:11.070> it

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
just gonna throw some icing on top of it

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:32.540 
just gonna throw some icing on top of it
so<00:06:29.720> what<00:06:30.720> it's<00:06:30.870> going<00:06:31.050> in<00:06:31.290> I<00:06:31.500> get<00:06:31.950> really<00:06:32.370> cold

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
so what it's going in I get really cold

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.930 
so what it's going in I get really cold
before<00:06:33.590> it<00:06:34.590> reaches<00:06:34.890> the<00:06:34.919> boil<00:06:35.220> and<00:06:35.520> the

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
before it reaches the boil and the

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.640 
before it reaches the boil and the
higher<00:06:36.180> the<00:06:36.210> differential<00:06:36.810> we<00:06:36.900> have<00:06:37.050> quicker

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
higher the differential we have quicker

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.590 
higher the differential we have quicker
it'll<00:06:37.889> chill

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.070 

they<00:06:43.470> need<00:06:43.710> to<00:06:43.800> eat<00:06:43.830> or<00:06:44.100> anything<00:06:44.220> like<00:06:44.550> that

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
they need to eat or anything like that

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:52.910 
they need to eat or anything like that
and<00:06:46.080> that<00:06:48.710> submerged<00:06:49.710> and<00:06:51.050> that<00:06:52.050> will<00:06:52.290> preach

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
and that submerged and that will preach

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.560 
and that submerged and that will preach
all<00:06:53.130> the<00:06:53.220> water<00:06:53.400> pretty<00:06:53.640> well<00:06:53.880> and<00:06:54.210> if<00:06:54.330> I<00:06:54.420> get

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
all the water pretty well and if I get

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.970 
all the water pretty well and if I get
rid<00:06:54.720> of<00:06:54.750> it<00:06:54.930> of<00:06:55.020> sugar<00:06:55.290> the<00:06:55.440> best<00:06:55.650> every<00:06:55.830> once

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
rid of it of sugar the best every once

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.440 
rid of it of sugar the best every once
in<00:06:56.040> a<00:06:56.100> while<00:06:56.130> it<00:06:56.370> helps<00:06:56.460> helps<00:06:56.910> just<00:06:57.150> keep<00:06:57.300> the

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
in a while it helps helps just keep the

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.060 
in a while it helps helps just keep the
coil<00:06:57.690> I<00:06:58.020> call<00:06:58.410> it<00:06:58.470> the<00:06:58.560> same<00:06:58.740> way

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
coil I call it the same way

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.820 
coil I call it the same way
coil<00:06:59.670> inside<00:07:00.090> pools<00:07:00.480> I'm<00:07:01.290> you<00:07:01.410> can<00:07:01.530> see<00:07:01.680> it's

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
coil inside pools I'm you can see it's

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.670 
coil inside pools I'm you can see it's
cooled<00:07:02.130> ten<00:07:02.640> degree<00:07:02.880> is<00:07:03.000> just<00:07:03.210> enough<00:07:03.450> to<00:07:04.260> I

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
cooled ten degree is just enough to I

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.440 
cooled ten degree is just enough to I
guess<00:07:04.920> a<00:07:05.250> little<00:07:05.730> over<00:07:05.910> two<00:07:06.060> minutes<00:07:06.180> since

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
guess a little over two minutes since

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.110 
guess a little over two minutes since
I've<00:07:06.660> started<00:07:07.170> this<00:07:07.290> last<00:07:07.560> clip<00:07:08.120> hopefully

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
I've started this last clip hopefully

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.090 
I've started this last clip hopefully
that's<00:07:09.300> the<00:07:09.360> end<00:07:09.570> I<00:07:09.780> should<00:07:10.590> be<00:07:10.680> done<00:07:10.830> brewing

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 
that's the end I should be done brewing

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.760 
that's the end I should be done brewing
and<00:07:11.400> about<00:07:11.720> well<00:07:12.720> you're<00:07:13.230> done<00:07:13.350> chilling<00:07:13.620> to

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
and about well you're done chilling to

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.860 
and about well you're done chilling to
hopefully<00:07:14.040> in<00:07:14.100> about<00:07:14.190> ten<00:07:15.090> maybe<00:07:15.450> fifteen

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:15.870 
hopefully in about ten maybe fifteen

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.650 
hopefully in about ten maybe fifteen
minutes<00:07:16.170> and<00:07:17.040> then<00:07:17.610> all<00:07:17.880> I<00:07:17.940> need<00:07:18.030> to<00:07:18.180> do<00:07:18.420> is

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
minutes and then all I need to do is

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.210 
minutes and then all I need to do is
pump<00:07:19.050> it<00:07:19.170> into<00:07:19.260> fermenter<00:07:19.740> switch<00:07:20.010> goes

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
pump it into fermenter switch goes

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.880 
pump it into fermenter switch goes
pretty<00:07:20.370> quickly<00:07:20.610> and<00:07:20.880> then<00:07:21.000> they<00:07:21.150> clean<00:07:21.330> up

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.890 
pretty quickly and then they clean up

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.250 
pretty quickly and then they clean up
thanks<00:07:22.890> for<00:07:23.010> watching
