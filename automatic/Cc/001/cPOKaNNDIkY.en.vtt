of<00:00:54.340> what<00:00:54.490> I<00:00:54.520> was<00:00:54.670> worried<00:00:55.000> this<00:00:55.120> was<00:00:55.300> going<00:00:55.570> to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
of what I was worried this was going to

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.380 
of what I was worried this was going to
be<00:00:55.870> it<00:00:56.680> is<00:00:56.860> definitely<00:00:57.430> a<00:00:57.460> creaminess<00:00:58.000> but<00:00:58.150> it

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
be it is definitely a creaminess but it

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.640 
be it is definitely a creaminess but it
really<00:00:58.510> comes<00:00:58.750> through<00:00:58.900> mostly<00:00:59.470> when<00:00:59.620> you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
really comes through mostly when you

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.530 
really comes through mostly when you
nose<00:00:59.980> it<00:01:00.190> when<00:01:00.310> you<00:01:00.370> actually<00:01:00.520> retro<00:01:01.030> hail<00:01:01.270> and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
nose it when you actually retro hail and

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.750 
nose it when you actually retro hail and
it<00:01:02.050> allows<00:01:02.320> you<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.620> taste<00:01:03.070> that<00:01:03.340> cream<00:01:03.640> in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
it allows you to taste that cream in

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.249 
it allows you to taste that cream in
this<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.880> little<00:01:03.970> bit<00:01:04.210> more<00:01:04.360> I'd<00:01:04.869> say<00:01:05.049> that<00:01:05.170> the

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
this a little bit more I'd say that the

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.499 
this a little bit more I'd say that the
orange<00:01:05.680> is<00:01:05.740> a<00:01:05.799> bit<00:01:06.009> light<00:01:06.400> for<00:01:06.640> my<00:01:06.939> tastes<00:01:07.390> and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
tobacco it is sweet let me make that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.819 
tobacco it is sweet let me make that
clear<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:18.159> it<00:01:18.249> is<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.960> moderate<00:01:19.960> strength<00:01:20.499> but

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
clear and it is a moderate strength but

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:23.130 
clear and it is a moderate strength but
I<00:01:20.890> just<00:01:21.189> I<00:01:21.369> just<00:01:21.399> wish<00:01:21.609> everything<00:01:21.969> was<00:01:22.299> ramped

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
I just I just wish everything was ramped

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.959 
I just I just wish everything was ramped
up<00:01:23.289> a<00:01:23.499> little<00:01:23.710> bit<00:01:23.950> it's<00:01:24.280> really<00:01:24.490> hard<00:01:24.700> to<00:01:24.819> do

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
up a little bit it's really hard to do

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.520 
up a little bit it's really hard to do
without<00:01:25.090> making<00:01:25.569> it<00:01:25.630> clawing<00:01:26.170> though<00:01:26.319> so<00:01:26.499> I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
without making it clawing though so I

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.940 
without making it clawing though so I
think<00:01:26.649> that<00:01:26.950> they<00:01:27.039> did<00:01:27.219> a<00:01:27.249> good<00:01:27.399> job

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
end up getting some more of this in the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.850 
end up getting some more of this in the
future<00:01:50.090> because<00:01:50.450> as<00:01:50.660> I<00:01:50.780> said<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:51.590> not<00:01:51.710> as

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
future because as I said it's not as

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.740 
future because as I said it's not as
simple<00:01:52.190> as<00:01:52.370> an<00:01:52.640> orange<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.150> vanilla<00:01:53.420> flavor

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
simple as an orange and vanilla flavor

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.780 
simple as an orange and vanilla flavor
which<00:01:54.020> is<00:01:54.050> kind<00:01:54.650> of<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.800> usual<00:01:55.130> go-to<00:01:55.370> when<00:01:55.700> it

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
which is kind of the usual go-to when it

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.160 
which is kind of the usual go-to when it
comes<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.090> orange<00:01:56.360> creams<00:01:56.660> it's<00:01:56.840> something<00:01:57.110> a

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
comes to orange creams it's something a

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.450 
comes to orange creams it's something a
little<00:01:57.350> bit<00:01:57.470> different<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.250> if<00:01:58.340> that

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
little bit different so if that

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.860 
little bit different so if that
