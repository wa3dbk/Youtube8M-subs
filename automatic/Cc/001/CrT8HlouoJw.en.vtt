00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.200 

when<00:00:05.160> you're<00:00:05.279> measuring<00:00:05.430> your<00:00:05.580> finger<00:00:05.880> up<00:00:06.029> for

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
when you're measuring your finger up for

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.089 
when you're measuring your finger up for
a<00:00:06.270> ring<00:00:06.420> one<00:00:07.140> way<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.380> can<00:00:07.500> do<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.950> get<00:00:08.069> a

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
a ring one way you can do it is to get a

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.310 
a ring one way you can do it is to get a
standard<00:00:08.460> set<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.700> ring<00:00:09.030> gauges<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:10.170> then

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
standard set of ring gauges and then

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.810 
standard set of ring gauges and then
find<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.099> most<00:00:11.250> closely<00:00:11.370> matches

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
find the one that most closely matches

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.199 
find the one that most closely matches
your<00:00:11.969> finger<00:00:12.360> size<00:00:12.679> then<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.209> measure

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
your finger size then you can measure

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.260 
your finger size then you can measure
the<00:00:15.389> diameter<00:00:16.340> x<00:00:17.340> pi<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> get<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the diameter x pi to get the

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.970 
the diameter x pi to get the
circumference<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.260> then<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.770> use<00:00:19.860> that

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
circumference and then you can use that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.740 
circumference and then you can use that
to<00:00:20.130> measure<00:00:20.280> the<00:00:20.550> length<00:00:20.700> of<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.060> piece<00:00:21.630> of

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
to measure the length of the piece of

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.930 
to measure the length of the piece of
silver<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.080> need<00:00:22.430> however<00:00:23.430> there's<00:00:23.880> an

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
silver you need however there's an

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.480 
silver you need however there's an
alternative<00:00:24.300> way<00:00:24.450> of<00:00:24.480> doing<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:25.340> is<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
alternative way of doing it is a

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.420 
alternative way of doing it is a
jeweler's<00:00:27.330> trick<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:28.860> a<00:00:28.890> piece<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.220> fine

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
jeweler's trick you get a piece of fine

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.940 
jeweler's trick you get a piece of fine
wire<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.940> binding<00:00:30.300> wire<00:00:33.770> longer<00:00:34.770> than<00:00:34.890> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
wire this binding wire longer than you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.400 
wire this binding wire longer than you
think<00:00:35.129> you're<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.429> need<00:00:36.109> you<00:00:37.109> create<00:00:37.379> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
think you're going to need you create a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.840 
think you're going to need you create a
loop<00:00:39.469> then<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.559> put<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:42.469> ring<00:00:43.469> mandrel

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
loop then you put it on a ring mandrel

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.149 
loop then you put it on a ring mandrel
to<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:44.999> it<00:00:45.120> round<00:00:48.589> then<00:00:49.589> you<00:00:49.620> test<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> see

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
to make it round then you test it to see

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.439 
to make it round then you test it to see
if<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:50.670> size<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:50.909> your<00:00:51.149> finger

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
if it's the right size for your finger

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.469 
if it's the right size for your finger
if<00:00:52.109> it's<00:00:52.170> too<00:00:52.379> loose<00:00:52.909> tighten<00:00:53.909> it<00:00:53.969> up

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
if it's too loose tighten it up

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.910 
if it's too loose tighten it up
it's<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.469> loose<00:00:55.649> enough<00:00:55.920> then<00:00:56.249> you<00:00:56.429> can

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
it's not loose enough then you can

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.669 
it's not loose enough then you can
loosen<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.069> a<00:00:59.129> bit<00:00:59.809> keep<00:01:00.809> doing<00:01:01.019> that<00:01:01.199> tighten

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
loosen it a bit keep doing that tighten

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.709 
loosen it a bit keep doing that tighten
it<00:01:01.769> until<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.190> becomes<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.479> size<00:01:03.690> for

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it until it becomes the right size for

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.620 
it until it becomes the right size for
your<00:01:03.899> finger<00:01:04.909> here's<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> mandrel<00:01:06.330> again<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
your finger here's the mandrel again to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.600 
your finger here's the mandrel again to
make<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.780> round<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.200> need<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:10.610> little

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
make it round if you need to a little

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:22.390 
make it round if you need to a little
bit<00:01:11.790> tighter<00:01:12.030> than<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.240> still

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400 

okay<00:01:23.400> might<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> little<00:01:24.750> bit<00:01:25.170> tight

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
okay might be just a little bit tight

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.810 
okay might be just a little bit tight
but<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.980> tend<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.160> find<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.580> use<00:01:26.700> this

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
but I tend to find if you use this

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.400 
but I tend to find if you use this
technique<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.480> a<00:01:27.660> little<00:01:27.990> bit<00:01:28.170> tight<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
technique then a little bit tight it's

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.600 
technique then a little bit tight it's
usually<00:01:28.530> good<00:01:28.830> because<00:01:29.070> by<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> time<00:01:29.370> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
usually good because by the time you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.800 
usually good because by the time you
finish<00:01:29.790> making<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.240> ring<00:01:30.390> stretched<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
finish making it the ring stretched a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.780 
finish making it the ring stretched a
little<00:01:30.990> bit<00:01:31.080> anyway<00:01:31.460> there's<00:01:32.460> probably<00:01:32.700> about

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
little bit anyway there's probably about

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:41.120 
little bit anyway there's probably about
the<00:01:33.000> size<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.330> I<00:01:33.390> want<00:01:39.080> okay<00:01:40.080> so<00:01:40.950> now<00:01:41.040> I've

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the size that I want okay so now I've

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.780 
the size that I want okay so now I've
got<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> piece<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.640> wire<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.180> loop<00:01:43.550> that's<00:01:44.550> about

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
got a piece of wire a loop that's about

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.990 
got a piece of wire a loop that's about
the<00:01:44.940> size<00:01:45.120> that<00:01:45.150> I<00:01:45.390> want<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.720> my<00:01:45.840> ring

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.180 

so<00:01:50.540> now<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.050> we've<00:01:51.200> got<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.410> loop<00:01:51.680> of<00:01:51.800> wire<00:01:51.980> the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
so now that we've got a loop of wire the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.370 
so now that we've got a loop of wire the
same<00:01:52.400> size<00:01:52.610> as<00:01:52.730> we<00:01:52.850> want<00:01:53.030> for<00:01:53.180> our<00:01:53.270> ring<00:01:53.510> we're

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
same size as we want for our ring we're

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.750 
same size as we want for our ring we're
going<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.560> cut<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.800> open<00:01:54.890> we'll<00:01:55.400> cut<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.550> in<00:01:55.700> the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
going to cut it open we'll cut it in the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.840 
going to cut it open we'll cut it in the
middle<00:01:55.970> here<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.420> if<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.200> cut<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.470> near<00:01:57.620> the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
middle here so if we cut it near the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.400 
middle here so if we cut it near the
twisty<00:01:58.850> bit<00:01:59.000> sometimes<00:01:59.690> it<00:01:59.960> gets<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.140> bit<00:02:00.260> vague

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
twisty bit sometimes it gets a bit vague

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.370 
twisty bit sometimes it gets a bit vague
as<00:02:00.620> to<00:02:00.650> where<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.430> ends<00:02:02.120> of<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.270> loop<00:02:02.390> are<00:02:02.600> so

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
as to where the ends of the loop are so

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.660 
as to where the ends of the loop are so
we<00:02:03.470> get<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.680> like<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:04.010> cut<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.580> open

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
we get it like that cut it open

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.470 
we get it like that cut it open
straighten<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.720> out<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.759> shows<00:02:10.970> us<00:02:11.120> what

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
straighten it out and that shows us what

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.180 
straighten it out and that shows us what
length<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.810> metal<00:02:12.080> we<00:02:12.200> need<00:02:12.380> in<00:02:12.680> order<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:13.010> make

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
length of metal we need in order to make

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.530 
length of metal we need in order to make
this<00:02:13.340> ring<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:15.020> what<00:02:15.200> I'm<00:02:15.290> going<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.440> do<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:15.650> is

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
this ring so what I'm going to do now is

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.350 
this ring so what I'm going to do now is
get<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.600> piece<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.900> sheet<00:02:18.320> silver<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.610> I'll

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
get a piece of sheet silver and I'll

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:29.590 
get a piece of sheet silver and I'll
mark<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.750> up<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.320> order<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.590> cut<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.860> ring

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.300 

today<00:02:29.750> I'm<00:02:29.870> going<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.080> make<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.230> ring<00:02:30.440> using<00:02:30.680> 1

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
today I'm going to make a ring using 1

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.480 
today I'm going to make a ring using 1
mil<00:02:31.520> sheet<00:02:31.760> silver<00:02:32.980> it's<00:02:33.980> going<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.190> be<00:02:34.280> 5

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
mil sheet silver it's going to be 5

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.950 
mil sheet silver it's going to be 5
millimeters<00:02:34.940> wide<00:02:35.120> so<00:02:35.480> I've<00:02:35.540> just<00:02:35.720> marked

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
millimeters wide so I've just marked

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.620 
millimeters wide so I've just marked
five<00:02:36.110> millimeters<00:02:36.560> wide<00:02:36.710> there<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.100> there

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
five millimeters wide there and there

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.090 
five millimeters wide there and there
normally<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.660> would<00:02:39.020> mark<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.320> up<00:02:39.440> using<00:02:39.740> a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
normally I would mark it up using a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.250 
normally I would mark it up using a
scribe<00:02:40.520> R<00:02:40.730> which<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.330> scribe<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.660> line<00:02:41.780> into<00:02:42.170> it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
scribe R which we scribe a line into it

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.920 
scribe R which we scribe a line into it
or<00:02:42.740> draw<00:02:42.980> using<00:02:43.130> pencil<00:02:43.610> but<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.600> scribe

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
or draw using pencil but the scribe

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.570 
or draw using pencil but the scribe
lines<00:02:45.230> often<00:02:45.620> know<00:02:45.860> very<00:02:46.070> hard<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.370> see

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
lines often know very hard to see

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.980 
lines often know very hard to see
because<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.270> silver<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.570> quite<00:02:47.750> reflective

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
because the silver is quite reflective

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.530 
because the silver is quite reflective
so<00:02:48.920> today<00:02:49.220> I'm<00:02:49.370> going<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.610> experiment<00:02:50.060> using<00:02:50.480> a

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
so today I'm going to experiment using a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.470 
so today I'm going to experiment using a
sharpie<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.580> instead<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.970> can<00:02:53.210> come<00:02:53.360> off

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
sharpie and instead this can come off

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.160 
sharpie and instead this can come off
using<00:02:54.040> methylated<00:02:55.040> spirits<00:02:55.370> afterwards<00:02:56.300> so

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
using methylated spirits afterwards so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:12.070 
using methylated spirits afterwards so
I'm<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.470> mark<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.740> part

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.130 

okay<00:03:12.650> sure<00:03:13.010> we're<00:03:13.190> certainly<00:03:13.520> well<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:15.020> that

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
okay sure we're certainly well and that

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.270 
okay sure we're certainly well and that
should<00:03:15.260> be<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.380> lot<00:03:15.500> easier<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.920> see<00:03:16.130> than

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
should be a lot easier to see than

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.600 
should be a lot easier to see than
pencil<00:03:16.670> lines<00:03:16.850> or<00:03:17.120> scribe<00:03:17.480> lines<00:03:18.190> now<00:03:19.190> we<00:03:19.520> can

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
pencil lines or scribe lines now we can

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.940 
pencil lines or scribe lines now we can
see<00:03:19.730> that<00:03:19.850> I've<00:03:20.000> made<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.450> piece<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.590> silver

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
see that I've made the piece of silver

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.760 
see that I've made the piece of silver
the<00:03:22.160> same<00:03:22.340> length<00:03:22.580> as<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.090> unwrapped<00:03:23.770> piece

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
the same length as the unwrapped piece

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.700 
the same length as the unwrapped piece
of<00:03:24.920> wire<00:03:25.160> that<00:03:25.490> I<00:03:25.730> measured<00:03:26.000> up<00:03:26.090> with<00:03:26.240> before

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
of wire that I measured up with before

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.750 
of wire that I measured up with before
now<00:03:27.710> I'm<00:03:27.800> going<00:03:27.950> to<00:03:28.010> cut<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.250> out<00:03:28.310> with<00:03:28.520> a<00:03:28.580> saw

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
now I'm going to cut that out with a saw

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.110 
now I'm going to cut that out with a saw
and<00:03:29.710> then<00:03:30.710> I'll<00:03:30.830> go<00:03:31.580> through<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.820> rest<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.060> the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
and then I'll go through the rest of the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.360 
and then I'll go through the rest of the
steps<00:03:32.300> in<00:03:32.480> turning<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.810> into<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:33.080> ring

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.560 

I'm<00:03:40.370> about<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.730> start<00:03:40.790> cutting<00:03:41.210> this<00:03:41.300> with<00:03:41.480> the

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
I'm about to start cutting this with the

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.530 
I'm about to start cutting this with the
piercing<00:03:41.780> saw<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:43.760> might<00:03:43.910> notice<00:03:44.180> because

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
piercing saw you might notice because

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.310 
piercing saw you might notice because
I'm<00:03:44.660> right-handed

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
I'm right-handed

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.630 
I'm right-handed
I've<00:03:45.620> actually<00:03:45.860> marked<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.310> up<00:03:46.370> on<00:03:46.520> the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
I've actually marked it up on the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.700 
I've actually marked it up on the
left-hand<00:03:47.030> side<00:03:47.300> of<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.630> piece<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.960> silver

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
left-hand side of the piece of silver

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.220 
left-hand side of the piece of silver
the<00:03:49.340> reason<00:03:49.580> for<00:03:49.700> this<00:03:49.820> is<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.810> need<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:50.990> cut

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
the reason for this is you need to cut

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.380 
the reason for this is you need to cut
along<00:03:51.320> on<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.530> outside<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.160> line<00:03:52.390> rather

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
along on the outside of the line rather

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.450 
along on the outside of the line rather
than<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.660> inside<00:03:53.960> so<00:03:54.740> it<00:03:54.800> means<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.160> want<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.370> be

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
than the inside so it means I want to be

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.800 
than the inside so it means I want to be
cutting<00:03:55.700> on<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.880> outside<00:03:56.210> with<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.450> line<00:03:56.660> on

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
cutting on the outside with the line on

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.870 
cutting on the outside with the line on
the<00:03:56.900> left-hand<00:03:57.140> side<00:03:57.560> if<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:58.400> cut<00:03:58.550> along<00:03:58.760> the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
the left-hand side if you cut along the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.400 
the left-hand side if you cut along the
line<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.240> end<00:03:59.390> up<00:03:59.510> narrowing<00:03:59.780> your<00:03:59.990> piece<00:04:00.260> of

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
line you end up narrowing your piece of

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.500 
line you end up narrowing your piece of
metal<00:04:00.680> more<00:04:00.830> than<00:04:00.950> you<00:04:01.040> want<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.360> but<00:04:02.360> because

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
metal more than you want to but because

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.060 
metal more than you want to but because
I'm<00:04:02.780> cutting<00:04:03.080> on<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.230> right<00:04:03.380> hand<00:04:03.590> side<00:04:03.680> and

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
I'm cutting on the right hand side and

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.070 
I'm cutting on the right hand side and
I'm<00:04:04.220> right-handed<00:04:04.460> it's<00:04:05.390> easier<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:05.810> see<00:04:05.990> it

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
I'm right-handed it's easier to see it

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.140 
I'm right-handed it's easier to see it
if<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.440> line<00:04:06.830> is<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.130> left<00:04:07.400> which<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:07.940> more

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
if the line is to the left which is more

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.660 
if the line is to the left which is more
towards<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.570> center<00:04:08.720> line<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:10.250> start

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
towards the center line so I start

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.520 
towards the center line so I start
cutting<00:04:10.880> that<00:04:11.000> in<00:04:11.960> order<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.170> get<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.380> cut

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
cutting that in order to get the cut

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.220 
cutting that in order to get the cut
started<00:04:13.040> we<00:04:13.940> actually<00:04:13.970> run<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.810> piercing<00:04:15.110> saw

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
started we actually run the piercing saw

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.930 
started we actually run the piercing saw
backwards<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.740> little<00:04:15.770> these<00:04:16.489> are<00:04:16.640> designed<00:04:16.880> to

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
backwards a little these are designed to

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.630 
backwards a little these are designed to
cut<00:04:17.239> when<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.080> move<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.560> saw<00:04:19.100> straight<00:04:19.400> down

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
cut when you move the saw straight down

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.640 
cut when you move the saw straight down
however<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.690> get<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:20.930> started<00:04:21.170> we<00:04:21.470> run

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
however to get it started we run

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:29.830 
however to get it started we run
backwards<00:04:22.600> like<00:04:23.600> this<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:25.120> little<00:04:26.120> weird<00:04:28.810> get<00:04:29.810> a

now<00:05:08.020> these<00:05:08.170> piercing<00:05:08.590> blade<00:05:08.800> piecing<00:05:09.580> school

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
now these piercing blade piecing school

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.100 
now these piercing blade piecing school
blades<00:05:09.970> are<00:05:10.150> quite<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.360> narrow<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:10.840> they<00:05:10.930> tend

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
blades are quite a narrow and they tend

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:30.159 
blades are quite a narrow and they tend
to<00:05:11.139> break<00:05:11.350> quite<00:05:11.500> easily

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.480 

okay<00:05:31.169> administer<00:05:31.770> avoid<00:05:31.980> breaking<00:05:32.400> your

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
okay administer avoid breaking your

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.360 
okay administer avoid breaking your
blade<00:05:32.669> so<00:05:32.910> far<00:05:33.470> I've<00:05:34.470> been<00:05:34.590> cutting<00:05:34.770> just<00:05:35.100> on

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
blade so far I've been cutting just on

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.100 
blade so far I've been cutting just on
the<00:05:35.490> right<00:05:35.639> hand<00:05:35.820> side<00:05:35.880> of<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.180> line<00:05:36.330> there<00:05:36.570> so

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
the right hand side of the line there so

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.330 
the right hand side of the line there so
far<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.410> experiment<00:05:37.860> with<00:05:37.949> the<00:05:38.010> sharpie

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
far the experiment with the sharpie

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.650 
far the experiment with the sharpie
seems<00:05:38.580> to<00:05:38.669> be<00:05:38.729> working<00:05:39.030> pretty<00:05:39.180> well<00:05:39.300> so<00:05:39.449> I

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
seems to be working pretty well so I

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.909 
seems to be working pretty well so I
think<00:05:39.750> I<00:05:39.900> might<00:05:40.050> stick<00:05:40.290> with<00:05:40.440> that<00:05:40.560> technique

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
think I might stick with that technique

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.340 
think I might stick with that technique
in<00:05:41.040> the<00:05:41.100> future<00:05:41.370> from<00:05:41.490> right<00:05:41.669> here<00:05:42.350> meantime

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
in the future from right here meantime

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.620 
in the future from right here meantime
I'll<00:05:43.530> keep<00:05:43.560> cutting<00:05:44.210> master<00:05:45.210> cut<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.360> fairly

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
I'll keep cutting master cut a fairly

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.020 
I'll keep cutting master cut a fairly
straight<00:05:45.870> line<00:05:46.080> if<00:05:46.860> you<00:05:47.130> are<00:05:47.280> going<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.580> waiver

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
straight line if you are going to waiver

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.750 
straight line if you are going to waiver
a<00:05:48.180> bit<00:05:48.419> try<00:05:48.750> to<00:05:48.810> make<00:05:48.990> sure<00:05:49.139> that<00:05:49.350> you<00:05:49.650> weave<00:05:50.520> to

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
a bit try to make sure that you weave to

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.820 
a bit try to make sure that you weave to
the<00:05:50.880> outside<00:05:51.240> because<00:05:51.930> if<00:05:52.229> you<00:05:52.320> cut<00:05:52.500> into<00:05:52.680> the

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
the outside because if you cut into the

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.870 
the outside because if you cut into the
metal<00:05:52.919> you're<00:05:53.280> not<00:05:53.400> going<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.580> be<00:05:53.669> able<00:05:53.729> to

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
metal you're not going to be able to

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.879 
metal you're not going to be able to
fill<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.090> hole<00:05:54.240> back<00:05:54.449> up<00:05:54.630> if<00:05:55.199> you<00:05:55.380> cut<00:05:55.560> off<00:05:55.680> to

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
fill the hole back up if you cut off to

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.070 
fill the hole back up if you cut off to
the<00:05:55.979> right<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.790> outside<00:05:57.150> of<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.330> line<00:05:57.510> then

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
the right the outside of the line then

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:23.290 
the right the outside of the line then
you'll<00:05:58.229> be<00:05:58.350> able<00:05:58.440> to<00:05:58.590> file<00:05:58.770> it<00:05:58.919> smooth<00:05:59.160> later

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.900 

okay<00:06:24.300> I've<00:06:24.660> finished<00:06:25.320> the<00:06:25.560> cut<00:06:25.770> along<00:06:26.760> the

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
okay I've finished the cut along the

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.100 
okay I've finished the cut along the
length<00:06:27.000> of<00:06:27.180> the<00:06:27.300> ring<00:06:27.450> and<00:06:27.780> I've<00:06:27.900> almost

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
length of the ring and I've almost

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.260 
length of the ring and I've almost
finished<00:06:28.320> the<00:06:28.530> cut<00:06:28.680> along<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:29.010> width<00:06:29.270> I'm

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
finished the cut along the width I'm

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.490 
finished the cut along the width I'm
just<00:06:30.450> going<00:06:30.600> to<00:06:30.660> cut<00:06:30.840> through<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.110> funnel<00:06:31.320> bit

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
just going to cut through the funnel bit

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.310 
just going to cut through the funnel bit
of<00:06:31.590> it<00:06:31.680> now<00:06:31.940> so<00:06:32.940> far<00:06:33.210> my<00:06:33.389> piercing<00:06:33.900> saw<00:06:34.050> blade

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
of it now so far my piercing saw blade

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.409 
of it now so far my piercing saw blade
has<00:06:34.530> managed<00:06:34.830> to<00:06:34.919> live<00:06:35.300> throughout<00:06:36.300> the

has managed to live throughout the

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.510 
has managed to live throughout the
ordeal<00:06:36.680> now<00:06:37.680> because<00:06:37.980> the<00:06:38.100> bit<00:06:38.220> of<00:06:38.280> metal<00:06:38.460> is

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
ordeal now because the bit of metal is

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.860 
ordeal now because the bit of metal is
about<00:06:38.580> to<00:06:38.760> fall<00:06:38.910> off<00:06:38.970> I'll<00:06:39.450> clamp<00:06:39.690> it<00:06:39.840> down

to fight another day so there's the
final<00:06:56.640> strip<00:06:56.910> of<00:06:57.000> metal<00:06:57.120> it's<00:06:57.780> come<00:06:57.930> out
