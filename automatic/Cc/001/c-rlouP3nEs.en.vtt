neck harness work even power lifters do
this<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> certain<00:00:55.020> extent<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:56.340> because

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this to a certain extent that's because

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.389 
this to a certain extent that's because
having<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.210> strong<00:00:57.480> neck<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.960> crucial<00:00:58.440> or<00:00:59.219> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
having a strong neck is crucial or you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.950 
having a strong neck is crucial or you
know<00:00:59.489> staying<00:00:59.789> upright<00:01:00.180> during<00:01:00.840> your

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
know staying upright during your

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.470 
know staying upright during your
movements<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.180> understand

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
movements because if they understand

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.660 
movements because if they understand
that<00:01:03.600> when<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.049> neck<00:01:04.260> collapses<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.460> upper

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that when your neck collapses the upper

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.030 
that when your neck collapses the upper
back<00:01:05.850> usually<00:01:06.030> collapses<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.920> when

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
back usually collapses with it and when

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.260 
back usually collapses with it and when
the<00:01:08.130> upper<00:01:08.310> back<00:01:08.490> collapse<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> lot<00:01:09.210> of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the upper back collapse is a lot of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.780 
the upper back collapse is a lot of
people<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.960> lower<00:01:10.170> back<00:01:10.490> collapses<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.580> well

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
people the lower back collapses as well

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.789 
people the lower back collapses as well
so<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> synergistic<00:01:12.720> effect<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.500> thing

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so it's a synergistic effect one thing

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.499 
so it's a synergistic effect one thing
affects<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.430> other<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.150> having<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.420> strong

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
affects the other so having a strong

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.270 
affects the other so having a strong
that's<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.110> support<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.860> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that's going to support you in that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.690 
that's going to support you in that
cause<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.560> also<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.830> stabilization

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
cause and also you know stabilization

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
cause and also you know stabilization
and<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.060> time<00:01:21.210> stuff<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:22.530> strength

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and all that time stuff so for strength

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310 
and all that time stuff so for strength
it's<00:01:23.040> good<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:24.150> addition<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.570> you're<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> field

to having a lot of compression in that
area<00:02:03.869> from<00:02:04.079> doing<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> network<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.219> neck

harness isn't shit you might be safe in
that<00:02:08.129> regard

that regard
training<00:02:10.850> your<00:02:11.090> neck<00:02:11.300> has<00:02:11.540> more<00:02:11.930> than<00:02:12.500> just<00:02:12.740> an

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
training your neck has more than just an

training your neck has more than just an
aesthetic<00:02:13.070> looks<00:02:13.490> more<00:02:13.730> than<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:14.030> being

aesthetic looks more than just being

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.440 
aesthetic looks more than just being
thick<00:02:15.530> all<00:02:15.770> around<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.880> know<00:02:17.000> it

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
thick all around so that you know it

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.850 
thick all around so that you know it
gives<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.960> illusion<00:02:18.020> of<00:02:18.320> bigger<00:02:18.470> traps

gives you the illusion of bigger traps
and<00:02:19.040> shit<00:02:19.250> now<00:02:20.060> let's<00:02:20.330> break<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.690> down<00:02:20.720> a

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
and shit now let's break it down a

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.140 
and shit now let's break it down a
scientific<00:02:21.830> approach<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.340> why<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.910> could<00:02:23.060> be

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
scientific approach and why you could be

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.090 
scientific approach and why you could be
good<00:02:23.300> for<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.840> reason<00:02:24.140> we<00:02:24.920> have<00:02:24.950> to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
good for that reason we have to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.350 
good for that reason we have to
understand<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.430> people<00:02:25.640> who<00:02:25.910> do<00:02:26.090> football

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
understand that people who do football

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.390 
understand that people who do football
specifically<00:02:27.170> guys<00:02:27.350> are<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.740> neck<00:02:27.980> at<00:02:28.340> a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
specifically guys are in the neck at a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.060 
specifically guys are in the neck at a
really<00:02:28.760> high<00:02:28.790> frequency<00:02:29.360> usually<00:02:30.290> have<00:02:30.680> very

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
really high frequency usually have very

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.190 
really high frequency usually have very
well-developed<00:02:31.460> wraps<00:02:31.910> as<00:02:32.120> well<00:02:32.570> even<00:02:33.110> if

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
well-developed wraps as well even if

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.470 
well-developed wraps as well even if
they're<00:02:33.350> natural<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:35.060> reason<00:02:35.300> why<00:02:35.420> this

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
they're natural and the reason why this

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.150 
they're natural and the reason why this
occurs<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.050> because<00:02:36.110> when<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:36.860> do<00:02:36.950> neck

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
occurs is because when you do neck

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.410 
occurs is because when you do neck
training<00:02:37.460> your<00:02:37.550> specific<00:02:38.060> you're<00:02:38.210> usually

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
training your specific you're usually

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.000 
training your specific you're usually
going<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.720> do<00:02:38.840> higher<00:02:39.050> reps<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:39.560> which<00:02:39.860> is

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
going to do higher reps but which is

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.400 
going to do higher reps but which is
endurance<00:02:40.520> training<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:40.970> sets<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.410> given

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
endurance training that sets and given

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.960 
endurance training that sets and given
this<00:02:42.500> fact<00:02:42.710> you<00:02:42.950> can<00:02:43.100> train<00:02:43.310> on<00:02:43.400> ultra<00:02:43.850> high

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
this fact you can train on ultra high

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.510 
this fact you can train on ultra high
frequency<00:02:44.030> what<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.080> call<00:02:45.520> overtraining

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
frequency what is this call overtraining

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.730 
frequency what is this call overtraining
you<00:02:47.360> train<00:02:47.570> your<00:02:47.690> neck<00:02:47.840> every<00:02:48.050> fucking<00:02:48.590> day

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
which increases the nuclei in the muscle

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.010 
which increases the nuclei in the muscle
cell<00:02:51.800> which<00:02:52.550> in<00:02:52.790> turn<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.390> going<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.840> help

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
cell which in turn is going to help

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.990 
cell which in turn is going to help
build<00:02:54.260> your<00:02:54.320> neck<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.800> traps<00:02:55.070> bigger<00:02:55.340> when

you do your actual strength building

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.400 
you do your actual strength building
exercises<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.630> let's<00:02:59.780> say<00:02:59.930> you've<00:03:00.110> been<00:03:00.200> doing

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
high reps right you built up all the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.810 
high reps right you built up all the
mitochondria<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.980> nuclei<00:03:07.370> in<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.520> muscle

mitochondria the nuclei in the muscle

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.910 
mitochondria the nuclei in the muscle
cell<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:08.120> all<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:08.300> type<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.450> stuff<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.260> then

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
cell and all that type of stuff and then

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.950 
cell and all that type of stuff and then
you<00:03:09.950> go<00:03:10.250> into<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.520> bodybuilding<00:03:11.000> program<00:03:11.360> where
