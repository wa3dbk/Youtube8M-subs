pack to make it safer flight ascended at

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.030 
pack to make it safer flight ascended at
800<00:01:38.549> feet<00:01:38.579> per<00:01:39.090> minute<00:01:39.600> which<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.680> thought<00:01:40.860> was

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
800 feet per minute which I thought was

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.480 
800 feet per minute which I thought was
pretty<00:01:41.100> impressive<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.740> course<00:01:44.040> when<00:01:44.340> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
pretty impressive but of course when you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.920 
pretty impressive but of course when you
look<00:01:44.520> at<00:01:44.820> something<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> had<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> jetpack

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
look at something if you had a jetpack

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.130 
look at something if you had a jetpack
like<00:01:46.290> an<00:01:46.439> Iron<00:01:46.590> Man<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:47.549> wood<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.420> dust<00:01:48.840> just

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
like an Iron Man that wood or dust just

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.340 
like an Iron Man that wood or dust just
like<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.500> jet<00:01:49.860> super<00:01:50.460> or<00:01:50.520> something<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.350> that's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
like a jet super or something but that's

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.940 
like a jet super or something but that's
that's<00:01:53.159> pretty<00:01:54.090> impressive<00:01:54.500> one<00:01:55.500> day<00:01:55.680> we'll

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that's pretty impressive one day we'll

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.980 
that's pretty impressive one day we'll
be<00:01:56.040> able<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.579> something<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.960> I

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
gonna allow a jetpack to park in your

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.990 
gonna allow a jetpack to park in your

the<00:02:26.360> best<00:02:26.510> bike<00:02:27.160> park<00:02:28.160> my<00:02:28.310> jetpack<00:02:28.550> here<00:02:29.030> I

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
the best bike park my jetpack here I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.590 
the best bike park my jetpack here I
don't<00:02:30.530> think<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:30.890> gonna<00:02:31.040> work

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
don't think that's gonna work

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.820 
don't think that's gonna work
maybe<00:02:32.600> one<00:02:32.840> day<00:02:32.990> instead<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.290> being<00:02:33.530> fuel

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
maybe one day instead of being fuel

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.800 
maybe one day instead of being fuel
power<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.520> can<00:02:34.700> be<00:02:34.880> electric<00:02:35.420> powered

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
power and this can be electric powered

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.370 
power and this can be electric powered
yeah<00:02:36.260> they're<00:02:36.500> super<00:02:37.010> batteries<00:02:37.520> one<00:02:38.390> day<00:02:38.600> but

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
yeah they're super batteries one day but

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.500 
yeah they're super batteries one day but
meantime<00:02:40.280> it's<00:02:40.880> something<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.209> generates

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
meantime it's something that generates

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.720 
meantime it's something that generates
electric<00:02:42.140> power<00:02:42.290> nuclear<00:02:43.100> power<00:02:43.550> and

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
electric power nuclear power and

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.240 
electric power nuclear power and
Germany's<00:02:44.120> being<00:02:44.330> shut<00:02:44.540> down<00:02:44.570> in<00:02:44.870> 2022<00:02:45.380> it's

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
Germany's being shut down in 2022 it's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.710 
Germany's being shut down in 2022 it's
not<00:02:46.430> surprising<00:02:46.610> Germany<00:02:47.300> would<00:02:47.420> choose<00:02:47.690> to

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
not surprising Germany would choose to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.420 
not surprising Germany would choose to
shut<00:02:47.990> down<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.350> nuclear<00:02:48.530> power<00:02:48.980> plants

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
shut down the nuclear power plants

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.600 
shut down the nuclear power plants
considering<00:02:50.330> what<00:02:50.600> just<00:02:50.810> happened<00:02:51.380> to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
considering what just happened to

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.060 
considering what just happened to
Fukushima<00:02:52.610> in<00:02:52.730> Japan<00:02:53.470> right<00:02:54.470> now<00:02:54.530> they<00:02:54.890> have

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
Fukushima in Japan right now they have

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.970 
Fukushima in Japan right now they have
17<00:02:55.790> plants<00:02:56.300> that<00:02:56.810> will<00:02:56.959> either<00:02:57.200> stay<00:02:57.620> closed

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
17 plants that will either stay closed

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.400 
17 plants that will either stay closed
or<00:02:58.340> shut<00:02:58.850> down<00:02:59.060> within<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.510> next<00:02:59.600> 11<00:03:00.140> years

right now 23% of their energy comes from
nuclear<00:03:04.100> which<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:04.880> quite<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> lot<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:06.230> they

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
nuclear which is quite a lot but they

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.229 
nuclear which is quite a lot but they
plan<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:06.950> replace<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.520> with<00:03:07.640> other<00:03:07.790> forms<00:03:08.180> such

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
plan to replace it with other forms such

2022 the other three will be shut down
as<00:03:25.430> well<00:03:25.610> like<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.600> said<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.930> help<00:03:27.080> reduce

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
as well like I said the help reduce

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.470 
as well like I said the help reduce

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
the same time period as well as increase

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.940 
the same time period as well as increase
their<00:03:34.430> wind<00:03:34.790> farm<00:03:35.060> output<00:03:35.299> and<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:36.560> other

forms of energy possible that are clean
based<00:03:39.910> but<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:40.940> really<00:03:41.750> improve<00:03:42.350> upon<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:43.250> way

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
based but I really improve upon this way

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.060 
based but I really improve upon this way
of<00:03:44.420> making<00:03:45.280> power<00:03:46.330> it's<00:03:47.330> much<00:03:47.930> better<00:03:48.680> in<00:03:49.040> my

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
of making power it's much better in my

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.550 
of making power it's much better in my
opinion<00:03:49.360> it's<00:03:50.650> safer<00:03:51.650> cleaner<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:53.140> well<00:03:54.140> not

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
opinion it's safer cleaner it's well not

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.710 
opinion it's safer cleaner it's well not
necessarily<00:03:54.709> clean<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.519> new<00:03:55.610> Bueller's<00:03:55.970> nice

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
necessarily clean and new Bueller's nice

nothing happens new coolers

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.540 
nothing happens new coolers
okay<00:03:59.390> they<00:03:59.510> like<00:03:59.660> coal<00:03:59.960> coal<00:04:00.560> only<00:04:01.220> reason

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
okay they like coal coal only reason

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.520 
okay they like coal coal only reason
people<00:04:01.700> use<00:04:01.850> nuclear<00:04:02.570> cuz<00:04:02.930> usually<00:04:03.200> it's<00:04:03.470> a

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
people use nuclear cuz usually it's a

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.400 
people use nuclear cuz usually it's a
cost-effective<00:04:04.280> solution<00:04:04.490> but<00:04:05.240> in<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.260> case

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
cost-effective solution but in the case

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.150 
cost-effective solution but in the case
of<00:04:06.440> Japan<00:04:06.890> is<00:04:08.140> not<00:04:09.140> very<00:04:09.410> cost-effective

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
of Japan is not very cost-effective

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
of Japan is not very cost-effective
right<00:04:10.340> now<00:04:10.520> if<00:04:10.730> we're<00:04:10.880> trying<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.260> fix<00:04:12.260> repair
