 in gaming without this game sphere 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.260
 casual games would not have grown to

 although this game is not for everyone very much 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.860
 it is difficult to deny its influence on the seventh 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.290
 console generation 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.610

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.400
 clones to with or hardcore simulators 12 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.229

 enjoy to this day it was not 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.490
 first race done in 3d but the most 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.110
 influential were not always the first 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.399
 virtual racing can no longer 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.009
 meet modern standards 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.470
 but without it, the fate of 3d racing would be 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
 a foggy race might comprehend 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.829

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.970
 shooters on consoles and water golden oh but 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.560
 07 shooter lived mostly on 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.230
 as well as today 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.670
 RTS of course today this game will 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.740
 only lovers run 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.930
 ponastalgic for the same who 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.000
 missed her in her time today she 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.700

 course this game laid the foundations of two 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.800
 other genres dota and tower defense 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.680
 without this game the market of mobile games and 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.930
 eSports would look differently about work 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.270
 the table is proof that the fashion game 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.060
 bring immense benefits and blizzard without 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.770
 this would not create heroes of the storm 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.420
 it also proves that blizam needs 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.850
 finish the map editor for the second 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.240

 fighter 2 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.860
 this is exactly the game that became 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.840
 the forefather of all of today's fights even 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.600
 modern 3d fighting games scooped their 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.610
 the inspiration from her street fighter was 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.470
 so thorough and what if your 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.880
 the game has no basic street mechanics 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.790
 fighter then it will not be considered 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.370
 fighting, she also established a tradition of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.290
 release in goth and ultimate version of games where 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.820
 instead of buying a supplement you will have 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.930
 also buy the original 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.570
 say thank you capcom eighth

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.770
 third-person shooter 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.690
 based on the principles of gears of war if 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.000
 tactical shooter in which you play 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.519
 has a system of shelters then know this 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.190
 the system was borrowed from the Persians about 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.050
 such shelters are probably the only thing 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.330
 allows you to shoot more accurately on consoles 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.489
 otherwise you will have to torment the system. 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.350
 auto guidance and tricky overtakes to 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.030
 Do not get bored seventh world of warcraft 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.130
 before wog found his niche he 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.709
 had a small on the right group of fans 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.269
 those times zhanar sought to increase 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.450
 interactions between players 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.070
 rather than increasing the amount of content 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.250
 in other words the games were more like 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.050
 sandbox than amusement park 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.030
 despite this the bob itself remains 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.760
 influential mr pg 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.110
 she made many developers 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.700
 competitors by wasted for the sake of 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.109
 creating a warcraft copy 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.709
 and all because of the constant updates 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.230

 almost all rts here you and the mouse and collection 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.000
 resources 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.550
 although she was not the first but precisely 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.960
 without it, there would be no starcraft warcraft 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.180
 comand and conqure series 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.370
 or even league of legends being 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.940
 revolutionary at one time replay it 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.850
 today can only a devoted fan 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.980
 5th place ultima in primitive times 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.070
 simple gameplay and banal graphics

 plots people appeared ultima this game 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.730
 brought to the rps genre casual encounters and 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.580
 turn-based battles 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.100
 these mechanics are still good but in 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.140
 most djp p this 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.090
 probably one of the most influential games 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.550
 as rpd at that time were more 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.770
 desktop then ultima came 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.400
 and showed that computers are able 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.760
 convey the whole spirit of the genre arpg fourth 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.160

 from there literally without a thought and his father 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.050
 wolfenstein but simply there would be no shooters 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.060
 and everything that we were content with was 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.510
 2d scrolling shooter and metal slug 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.490
 doom not only raised the fps genre but also 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.110
 was the first game that was accused of 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.870
 excessive violence albeit without 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.570
 consequences or industry 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.850
 third place space invaders space 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.100
 invaders sparked gaming spark 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.580
 a huge industry fire 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.110
 turn 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.900
 already rival hollywood in 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.030
 popularity and budget is another important 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.169
 position of the game in the industry was that 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.289
 no need to copy 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.960
 already raspiareny 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.779
 popular with an important gift for gaming 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.029
 it was the introduction of competition in the game not 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:05.599
 there was an account of endless passing and 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.830
 increasing difficulty second place 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.189
 Mario brothers 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.589
 everyone knows who Mario is he probably 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:15.529
 most recognizable character in video games and 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:19.430
 not without reason but the reason is 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:22.789
 that the franchise has been alive and well since 1983 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.569
 years without mario the whole industry would have fallen into 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.539
 melancholy 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.879
 In addition to the resurrection of video games Mario 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.830
 gave us a galaxy of similar platformers 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.660
 and the graphics are a bit prettier than a piece 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.770

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.330
 in history though not the very first punk 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.340
 proved that gaming is very 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.400
 attractive industry worthy 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.200
 any investments and spent forces 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.150
 ping pong not only gave life to video games 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.880
 but also pushed to purchase personal 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.190
 computers it is pong indirectly to blame 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.910
 is that in every home now stands by
