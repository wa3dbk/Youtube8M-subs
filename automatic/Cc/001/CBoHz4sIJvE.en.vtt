00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello and welcome to hard bike in 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.359
 this video 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.600
 the news calendar week 15 news 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.300
 2014 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.340
 the support for windows xp was on 8 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.809
 april set microsoft has it 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.849
 of course, already many times 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.830
 but still mentions that for him 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.840
 it did not realize it has microsoft 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.699
 small mini game made there plays 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.189
 you a little blue male the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.019
 bottom are all windows xp programs and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.330
 the male has to xp all windows 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.130
 program picture shoot as long as 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.050
 one the old windows xp programs then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 After that you have killed the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.130
 way to say windows xp goodbye 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.870
 press a red button and then 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.820
 A nuclear bomb explodes in the background 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.510
 put virtually all windows xp away 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.460
 should 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.590
 Of course, if I'm a relatively funny one 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.760
 idea however advertisers windows xp 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.960
 the game will stay 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.930
 probably will not change 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.789
 an Israeli start up should now be one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.800
 have developed new battery there within 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.199
 of 30 seconds is loaded 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.270
 This battery is not a lithium ion battery 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.699
 as before but consists of one 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.070
 organic nanomaterial the power supply 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.359
 to charge the battery is however 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.400
 something big 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.950
 It is currently the size of a notebook 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.200
 power supply but you want that up 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.640
 to reduce the start of 2016 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.110
 therefore this is the acute problem 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.820
 probably as wiped out at 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.860
 smartphones because with such a 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 technology then i believe that then it will 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.390
 extra vending machines are available to charge the mobile phone 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.150
 It only takes 30 seconds 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.619
 there are new rumors about the new amd 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.689
 and nvidia cards the he 9 370 x2 1536 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.509
 Stream processors have what they need 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.990
 he makes them stronger than she does 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.990
 1980 should have 3072 stream processors 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.250
 which is more than the 290 ickx 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.140
 and the 390 iks is supposed to stream all 4224 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.299
 Processors are pretty busy right now 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.729
 gigantic would be according to current 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.049
 procedure would be an immense 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.899
 However, power consumption will be this 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.790
 graphics cards have 20 nanometers for the first time 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.939
 which will reduce the power consumption 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.920
 in addition, the re-370 should I have 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.899
 to appear in july or august 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.479
 the big brothers will be short 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.950
 come later when again there are left 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.550
 according to the top model gtx 880 it should 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.990
 3200 cura processors have 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.130
 320 pieces are more than the gtx 87 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.530
 also by the new max mÃ¼ller 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.960
 architecture works every user came yet 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.680
 More effective is a day of penance for up to 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.800
 950 megahertz has 4 gb of gddr5 memory 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.720
 the clocked with 7400 megawatts, however 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.950
 she has only a 256 bit 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.400
 memory interface 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.140
 this can mean so much that the gtx 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.780
 880 first in the middle class chip of 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.090
 Maxwell contains the high end chip 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.020
 then probably only at the gtx 89th 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.140
 be found 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.110
 So it was synonymous with kepler the gtx 680th 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.090
 had only the gf104 chip the gtx 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:58.300
 480 and 780 tdk 110 chip so the high 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.430
 end keppler chip amd apparently wants to 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.470
 to make toshiba together ssds 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.480
 These should probably be under the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.820
 Radeon brand will appear on the market 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.100
 you want for ssds controller or 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.710
 firma utz use he ssds 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.990
 makes power and toshiba memory modules 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.480
 Produce in a 19 nanometer process 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.090
 amd wants to take this step around 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.010
 better bundles from cpu mainboards 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.780
 to offer graphics cards and cream 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.060
 So they do not do that to new ones 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.130
 to develop high performance ssds but 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.670
 attractive to the oem market too 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.190
 do 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.290
 because the more one in a pc from a 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.190
 company banned the more discount chambers 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.320
 knock out 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.360
 that also with the technology news for 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.739
 this week you almost liked it again 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.350
 has gone up in a thumb 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.250
 if you want to load it up then 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.250
