00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
annoying on there is a third one it has

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.779 
annoying on there is a third one it has
not<00:00:29.900> come<00:00:30.110> out<00:00:30.230> yet<00:00:30.289> or<00:00:30.740> there's<00:00:31.280> going<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.760> be

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
not come out yet or there's going to be

not come out yet or there's going to be
a<00:00:31.880> third<00:00:32.090> one<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:32.780> we're<00:00:33.079> going<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.260> move<00:00:33.410> along

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
a third one so we're going to move along

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.939 
a third one so we're going to move along
it<00:00:34.129> never<00:00:34.699> lasts<00:00:35.180> only<00:00:35.359> climb<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:36.019> the<00:00:36.050> vent<00:00:36.319> so

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
it never lasts only climb to the vent so

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.619 
it never lasts only climb to the vent so
this<00:00:37.489> is<00:00:37.670> what<00:00:38.059> they're<00:00:38.179> doing<00:00:38.390> right<00:00:38.480> now

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629
