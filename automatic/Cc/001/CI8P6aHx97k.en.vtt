like<00:00:33.770> we<00:00:33.980> built<00:00:34.309> a<00:00:34.610> bench<00:00:35.390> I<00:00:35.780> got<00:00:36.140> into<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:36.950> I

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
like we built a bench I got into it so I

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.000 
like we built a bench I got into it so I
signed<00:00:37.790> up<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.929> started<00:00:39.559> coming<00:00:39.829> to<00:00:39.949> you

sketching<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.550> designing<00:00:43.879> will<00:00:44.570> learn

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
sketching the designing will learn

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.259 
sketching the designing will learn
something<00:00:45.170> up<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.469> classroom<00:00:46.399> go<00:00:47.059> right

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
something up in the classroom go right

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.240 
something up in the classroom go right
out<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.539> shop<00:00:47.839> and<00:00:47.870> go<00:00:48.320> build<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.739> wall<00:00:48.949> and

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
out to the shop and go build a wall and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.220 
out to the shop and go build a wall and
use<00:00:49.550> all<00:00:49.789> that<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:50.480> know<00:00:50.570> Pythagorean

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
use all that you know Pythagorean

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.860 
use all that you know Pythagorean
theorem<00:00:51.649> we<00:00:51.829> just<00:00:52.039> learn<00:00:52.280> about<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:52.999> this<00:00:53.690> is

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
theorem we just learn about and this is

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.040 
theorem we just learn about and this is
what<00:00:54.230> I<00:00:54.260> want<00:00:54.589> because<00:00:55.100> it's<00:00:55.429> just<00:00:55.489> that

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
what I want because it's just that

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.439 
what I want because it's just that
hands-on<00:00:57.050> real<00:00:57.469> life<00:00:57.739> experience<00:00:58.449> rather

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
hands-on real life experience rather

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.989 
hands-on real life experience rather
than<00:00:59.629> a<00:01:00.170> textbook<00:01:00.859> someone<00:01:01.489> could<00:01:01.670> put<00:01:01.969> a

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
than a textbook someone could put a

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:03.759 
than a textbook someone could put a
textbook<00:01:02.359> in<00:01:02.539> front<00:01:02.719> of<00:01:02.780> my<00:01:02.839> face<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.230> I<00:01:03.320> can<00:01:03.530> I

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
textbook in front of my face and I can I

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.250 
textbook in front of my face and I can I
can<00:01:04.400> do<00:01:04.580> it<00:01:04.790> I<00:01:04.820> can<00:01:04.970> do<00:01:05.300> the<00:01:05.449> problems<00:01:05.930> but<00:01:06.230> I

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
can do it I can do the problems but I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.040 
can do it I can do the problems but I
don't<00:01:06.500> know<00:01:06.710> why<00:01:06.950> I'm<00:01:07.220> doing<00:01:07.370> them<00:01:07.670> but<00:01:08.540> when

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
don't know why I'm doing them but when

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.020 
don't know why I'm doing them but when
you're<00:01:09.200> here<00:01:09.620> you<00:01:09.860> know<00:01:10.070> why<00:01:10.340> you're<00:01:10.610> doing<00:01:10.640> it

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
you're here you know why you're doing it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.300 
you're here you know why you're doing it
you<00:01:11.360> can<00:01:11.540> see<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.020> it's<00:01:12.290> a<00:01:12.680> you're<00:01:13.100> actually

you can see it it's a you're actually
creating<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:14.149> result<00:01:14.540> rather<00:01:14.810> than<00:01:15.110> just

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
creating a result rather than just

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.010 
creating a result rather than just
writing<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.700> on<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.149> piece<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.450> paper<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:17.840> you

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.359 
writing it on a piece of paper that you
can<00:01:18.229> throw<00:01:18.470> away<00:01:18.649> it's<00:01:18.890> something<00:01:19.220> that
