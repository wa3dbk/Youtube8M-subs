to<00:01:03.210> start<00:01:03.420> changing<00:01:03.750> things<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.850> mean

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
to start changing things up now I mean

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.090 
to start changing things up now I mean
the<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.080> thing<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.350> want<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:07.710> him<00:01:07.799> change

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the one thing I want to see him change

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.090 
the one thing I want to see him change
is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.780> Devastator<00:01:10.260> bolter<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
is a the Devastator bolter and the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.620 
is a the Devastator bolter and the
plasma<00:01:11.460> cane<00:01:11.640> squad<00:01:11.940> they're<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.420> quite

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
plasma cane squad they're not quite

could be spent a little better and in

I<00:03:20.840> think<00:03:21.840> that's<00:03:21.990> where<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.350> big<00:03:22.380> difference

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
I think that's where the big difference

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.640 
I think that's where the big difference
between<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.220> Devastator<00:03:23.700> squad<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.650> tac

they<00:04:08.400> get<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.700> Amelia<00:04:09.120> with<00:04:09.239> guardian<00:04:09.660> squad

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
they get to Amelia with guardian squad

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.100 
they get to Amelia with guardian squad
they<00:04:10.140> just<00:04:10.350> tend<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.620> tear<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:10.980> apart<00:04:12.110> yeah

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
they just tend to tear it apart yeah

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.570 
they just tend to tear it apart yeah
that's<00:04:13.320> just<00:04:13.380> a<00:04:13.590> testament<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.220> the

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
that's just a testament to the

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.440 
that's just a testament to the
crappiness<00:04:15.330> ignore<00:04:15.870> dr<00:04:16.200> johnson<00:04:16.530> yeah<00:04:17.060> i<00:04:18.060> was

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
crappiness ignore dr johnson yeah i was

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.580 
crappiness ignore dr johnson yeah i was
trying<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> think<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:18.959> way<00:04:19.080> to<00:04:19.109> say<00:04:19.410> that

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
trying to think of a way to say that

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.110 
trying to think of a way to say that
right<00:04:19.769> it's<00:04:19.950> not<00:04:20.130> upset<00:04:20.459> or<00:04:20.489> eldar<00:04:20.880> players

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
right it's not upset or eldar players

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.630 
right it's not upset or eldar players
but<00:04:21.450> yeah<00:04:21.540> I<00:04:21.989> mean<00:04:22.650> took<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.130> right<00:04:23.220> guardians

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
but yeah I mean took it right guardians

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.520 
but yeah I mean took it right guardians
are<00:04:23.790> great<00:04:23.970> once<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.450> get<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.630> tier<00:04:24.900> two<00:04:25.080> once

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
are great once you get to tier two once

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.740 
are great once you get to tier two once
you<00:04:25.650> get<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:26.430> battle<00:04:26.700> gear<00:04:26.820> upgrades<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.479> once

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
you get the battle gear upgrades in once

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.560 
you get the battle gear upgrades in once
you<00:04:27.870> get<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.020> warlock<00:04:28.580> but<00:04:29.580> before<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.270> they

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
you get a warlock but before that they

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.700 
you get a warlock but before that they
sort<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.110> suck<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.540> TAC<00:04:33.780> squads<00:04:33.930> out<00:04:34.320> then

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
sort of suck so to TAC squads out then

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.560 
sort of suck so to TAC squads out then
the<00:04:34.890> first<00:04:35.100> generator<00:04:35.580> let's<00:04:36.210> see<00:04:36.360> how<00:04:36.419> this

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
the first generator let's see how this

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.260 
the first generator let's see how this
works<00:04:36.720> for<00:04:36.900> any<00:04:37.020> kiddos<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.950> have<00:04:38.789> a<00:04:38.820> feeling

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
works for any kiddos I have a feeling

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.820 
works for any kiddos I have a feeling
that<00:04:39.300> these<00:04:39.570> Guardians<00:04:40.110> wats<00:04:40.350> are<00:04:40.500> all<00:04:40.650> going

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
that these Guardians wats are all going

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.260 
that these Guardians wats are all going
to<00:04:40.919> start<00:04:41.160> dying<00:04:41.520> very<00:04:41.910> quick

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
to start dying very quick

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.660 
to start dying very quick
we<00:04:42.590> gonna<00:04:43.590> get<00:04:43.740> that<00:04:43.860> grenade<00:04:44.160> off<00:04:44.370> on<00:04:44.550> the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
we gonna get that grenade off on the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.980 
we gonna get that grenade off on the
generator<00:04:45.030> though<00:04:45.330> the<00:04:45.570> one<00:04:45.780> lonely

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
generator though the one lonely

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.630 
generator though the one lonely
generator<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:46.590> indicators<00:04:47.070> did<00:04:47.280> manage<00:04:47.520> to

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
generator the indicators did manage to

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.970 
generator the indicators did manage to
squeak<00:04:47.850> oh<00:04:48.000> yeah<00:04:48.420> the<00:04:49.140> second<00:04:49.560> one<00:04:49.710> gets

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
squeak oh yeah the second one gets

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.150 
squeak oh yeah the second one gets
triple<00:04:50.940> teamed<00:04:51.180> by<00:04:51.450> two<00:04:51.480> tax<00:04:51.960> rods<00:04:52.260> in<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.590> force

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
triple teamed by two tax rods in a force

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.300 
triple teamed by two tax rods in a force
commander<00:04:54.560> I'm<00:04:55.560> surprised<00:04:55.950> he<00:04:56.070> didn't<00:04:56.220> take

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
commander I'm surprised he didn't take

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.010 
commander I'm surprised he didn't take
more<00:04:56.520> losses<00:04:56.700> than<00:04:56.880> he<00:04:57.060> did<00:04:57.210> yeah<00:04:59.570> so<00:05:00.570> aniket

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
more losses than he did yeah so aniket

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.810 
more losses than he did yeah so aniket
us<00:05:01.140> definitely<00:05:01.560> not<00:05:02.010> wanting<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.400> lose<00:05:02.640> an

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
us definitely not wanting to lose an

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.750 
us definitely not wanting to lose an
entire<00:05:02.910> generators<00:05:03.690> this<00:05:03.930> time<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:05.460> this

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
entire generators this time so this

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.220 
entire generators this time so this
should<00:05:06.030> be<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.270> period<00:05:06.660> in<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.870> game<00:05:07.020> where

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
should be a period in the game where

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.320 
should be a period in the game where
Annika<00:05:07.620> dose<00:05:07.770> is<00:05:08.040> booming<00:05:08.790> with<00:05:08.820> military

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
Annika dose is booming with military

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.300 
Annika dose is booming with military
superiority<00:05:09.600> having<00:05:10.260> invested<00:05:10.800> all<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.040> his

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
superiority having invested all of his

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.790 
superiority having invested all of his
resources<00:05:11.670> in<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.090> two<00:05:12.270> early<00:05:12.600> TAC<00:05:12.840> squads<00:05:13.020> so

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
resources in the two early TAC squads so

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.160 
resources in the two early TAC squads so
nothing<00:05:14.370> at<00:05:14.490> this<00:05:14.580> point<00:05:14.700> should<00:05:15.060> really<00:05:15.630> give

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
nothing at this point should really give

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.200 
nothing at this point should really give
him<00:05:16.290> pause<00:05:16.500> out<00:05:16.800> on<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.040> field<00:05:17.250> so<00:05:17.880> we'll<00:05:18.030> see

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
him pause out on the field so we'll see

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.820 
him pause out on the field so we'll see
how<00:05:18.240> much<00:05:18.480> he<00:05:18.600> can<00:05:18.720> capitalize<00:05:18.900> on<00:05:19.260> that<00:05:19.560> in

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
how much he can capitalize on that in

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.160 
how much he can capitalize on that in
terms<00:05:19.860> of<00:05:20.100> Mac<00:05:20.310> control<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.030> lock<00:05:21.690> down<00:05:21.900> pal

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
terms of Mac control and lock down pal

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.800 
terms of Mac control and lock down pal
yeah<00:05:22.410> one<00:05:22.920> thing<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:23.490> just<00:05:24.480> the<00:05:24.510> UH<00:05:24.600> nup

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
yeah one thing is that just the UH nup

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.750 
yeah one thing is that just the UH nup
grade<00:05:25.020> TAC<00:05:25.350> squads<00:05:25.500> they<00:05:26.070> do<00:05:26.130> almost<00:05:26.610> nothing

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
grade TAC squads they do almost nothing

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.850 
grade TAC squads they do almost nothing
to<00:05:27.150> generators<00:05:27.720> without<00:05:28.470> any<00:05:28.620> kind<00:05:28.770> of

grenade flames or anything like that

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.500 
grenade flames or anything like that
they<00:05:31.080> really<00:05:31.290> can't<00:05:31.620> do<00:05:31.770> anything<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:32.510> for

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
they really can't do anything to for

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.590 
they really can't do anything to for
meaningful<00:05:34.020> generator<00:05:34.470> her<00:05:34.650> ass<00:05:34.830> yeah<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:36.000> we

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
meaningful generator her ass yeah and we

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.080 
meaningful generator her ass yeah and we
do<00:05:36.720> have<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.930> tier<00:05:37.110> 2<00:05:37.260> upgrade<00:05:37.820> from<00:05:38.820> bio

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
do have a tier 2 upgrade from bio

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.260 
do have a tier 2 upgrade from bio
terabytes<00:05:40.190> very<00:05:41.190> little<00:05:41.520> power<00:05:41.700> right<00:05:42.090> now

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
terabytes very little power right now

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.270 
terabytes very little power right now
and<00:05:42.390> he's<00:05:42.510> spending<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.930> on<00:05:43.160> upgrading<00:05:44.160> his

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
and he's spending it on upgrading his

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.760 
and he's spending it on upgrading his
guardian<00:05:44.640> squads<00:05:44.910> it<00:05:45.090> looks<00:05:45.240> like<00:05:45.420> I<00:05:45.770> don't

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
guardian squads it looks like I don't

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.560 
guardian squads it looks like I don't
know<00:05:46.830> how<00:05:47.010> he'll<00:05:47.490> falcon<00:05:47.940> or<00:05:48.030> a<00:05:48.210> free<00:05:48.420> herself

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
know how he'll falcon or a free herself

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.510 
know how he'll falcon or a free herself
to<00:05:49.020> youtube<00:05:49.410> but<00:05:49.440> he<00:05:49.710> was<00:05:49.890> able<00:05:50.070> to<00:05:50.250> get<00:05:50.340> that

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
to youtube but he was able to get that

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.990 
to youtube but he was able to get that
off<00:05:54.440> looks<00:05:55.440> like<00:05:55.590> we<00:05:55.740> have<00:05:55.800> a<00:05:55.860> couple<00:05:56.070> upgrades

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
off looks like we have a couple upgrades

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.390

definitely<00:06:36.840> not<00:06:37.140> the<00:06:38.130> original<00:06:38.370> only<00:06:38.880> power

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
definitely not the original only power

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.790

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
generator yep so it looks like one of

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.060 
generator yep so it looks like one of
