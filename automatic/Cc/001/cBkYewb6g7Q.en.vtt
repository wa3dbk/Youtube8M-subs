00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.750
 pretty much at first glance 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:17.439
 looks idyllic is your sorry of 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.910
 Techland and the developers are not 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.790
 completely unknown they already have call of 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.860
 juarez for example and also 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.590
 I do not play any other zombie anymore 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.200
 just come in and see what we are seeing 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.910
 Gameplay scenes from the ps4 version and 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.160
 they look pretty cool 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 He looks really impressive from what we 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.660
 could already see from the game 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.730
 where to see in the middle of the picture are so 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.530
 two bars of an orange and yellow one 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.350
 are permanently displayed there it goes 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.720
 therefore there are two kinds of stamina in the game 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.489
 So you have energy for the race 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.170
 and responsible for all acrobatics 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.020
 I'll come down to that right now 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.540
 bar for all types of attack so 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.160
 so faults and so on this applies 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.960
 will beam itself often than teachers 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.950
 We are also very nice in this play 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.950
 will see videos 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.710
 Too bad is a very quick game 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.630
 So despite slow zombies you will 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.820
 here only very rarely come to rest yes 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.650
 what you see is exactly what it has 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.000
 such a kind of parcours mechanics the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.370
 It's a bit like mirror's edge 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.740
 was already running so ego view 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.479
 skip climbing slip 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.800
 and that works as well as you have 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.290
 So almost always the possibility itself 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.000
 somewhere to pull up somewhere 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.440
 it all works very well 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.210
 fluid and looks pretty pretty 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.160
 cool but a good feeling I think 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.509
 for the body and for the 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.610
 the movements of the main character of the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.960
 pretty cool 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.940
 otherwise it is an open world 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.340
 history so you have this city here 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.710
 probably in south america that stands 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.030
 but not so tight of course 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.380
 it in zombie apocalypse 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.060
 Of course you are once again 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.830
 survivors and, of course, there are also 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.899
 other surviving where you have to help 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.729
 but otherwise everything is like this 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.979
 very free with quests and so on 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.170
 therefore also the lower left small 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.759
 mini map with points on where you 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.530
 Looks okay , there's something to pick there 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.830
 there's something to find there I just have to 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.810
 down 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.850
 and of course there are weapons and 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.019
 Attacks are usually not straight 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.070
 nicely staged I say it like that 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.239
 So already a game for adults and 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.769
 cool thing is that you later in the 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.049
 Just went so an art crafting 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.610
 system has so you find objects 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.620
 For example, what do I know a stick 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.970
 and a metal part can then 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.799
 connect with each other and then has so 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.140
 what exactly is there like a club 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.180
 several such dynamic elements we 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.829
 will see it soon if the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.420
 protagonist manipulated a car and 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.930
 Several zombies simultaneously in the air 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.030
 to hunt 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.709
 and I appreciate in the finished game 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.140
 we then several so we will be several 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.260
 such things see the pretty 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.690
 meanwhile, everything gets horny and horny 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.750
 is attracted and then there is the evil 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.750
 surprise 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.430
 It was a pity that was good 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.720
 important in the game is not just in 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.690
 technical aspects there is a day 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.489
 night change means it will be in 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.440
 So it's not natural, of course 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.420
 real time but it will be a kind of 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.739
 give course of the day and then just 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.319
 sometime dark as you can see here 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.970
 and when it gets dark then it will 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.940
 really mean and hard because then 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.810
 even more zombies come even more greedy 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.099
 zombies and then you have to be as possible 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.900
 Discover or just go home 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.860
 or something will escape because otherwise it will 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.200
 very bad 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.790
 not only that the zombies are greedy 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.760
 There are also special ones together 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.890
 until the most aggressive behind you 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.250
 are her or especially strong attacks 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.100
 So i think that after gameplay 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.549
 we are pretty challenging 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.590
 challenge is also a good one 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.430
 keyword because it is quite small 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.200
 of course, a technical 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.510
 challenge that had previously namely 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.230
 not so well known in their games 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.690
 which now includes not me again 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.280
 come up with that very finished on 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.110
 so I hope that the market came 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.519
 there are few bugs and that all around 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.390
 runs because then that could be a real 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.410
 be a secret tip 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.410
 I'm looking forward to it
