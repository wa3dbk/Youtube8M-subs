00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
sand entity z' to start out we have

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.970 
sand entity z' to start out we have
fence<00:00:23.220> posts<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.850> balls<00:00:24.230> now<00:00:25.230> everything<00:00:25.859> I'm

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
fence posts and balls now everything I'm

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.230 
fence posts and balls now everything I'm
going<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.160> show<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.310> today<00:00:26.490> kind<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.029> follows

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
going to show you today kind of follows

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.259 
going to show you today kind of follows
the<00:00:27.449> same<00:00:27.660> principle<00:00:28.490> the<00:00:29.490> entity<00:00:29.910> will<00:00:30.119> take

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the same principle the entity will take

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.170 
the same principle the entity will take
the<00:00:30.390> form<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> last<00:00:31.260> hitbox<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.279> used<00:00:32.669> so

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the form of the last hitbox you used so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.130 
the form of the last hitbox you used so
let<00:00:33.360> me<00:00:33.420> demonstrate<00:00:33.540> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
let me demonstrate that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.319 
let me demonstrate that
so<00:00:34.860> most<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> regular<00:00:36.149> fence

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
so most of we have the regular fence

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.720 
so most of we have the regular fence
post<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.559> if<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.829> actually<00:00:38.160> hover<00:00:38.370> over

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
post and and if I actually hover over

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
post and and if I actually hover over
one<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.390> you'll<00:00:40.170> see<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.500> actually

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
one of these you'll see they actually

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.770 
one of these you'll see they actually
morphs<00:00:41.280> into<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.000> hitbox<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.690> actually

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
morphs into the hitbox you can actually

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
morphs into the hitbox you can actually
see<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.350> hitbox<00:00:43.950> outline<00:00:44.309> there<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
see the little hitbox outline there so

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.299 
see the little hitbox outline there so
if<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.239> go<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> there<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.870> changes<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.559> one

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
if I go to there it changes to this one

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
if I go to there it changes to this one
over<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.760> go<00:00:48.180> here<00:00:48.450> change<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
over here go here change that one and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.690 
over here go here change that one and
the<00:00:49.620> center<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.520> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the center one is kind of like this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900 
the center one is kind of like this
quarter<00:00:51.300> vertical<00:00:51.899> slab<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> few

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
quarter vertical slab so there are a few

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850 
quarter vertical slab so there are a few
variations<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.680> those

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
variations of this and if you have those

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
variations of this and if you have those
ones<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:56.520> also<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.510> other

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
ones and they also the the other

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.209 
ones and they also the the other
direction<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.140> well<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.710> they're<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
direction as well but they're just the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.830 
direction as well but they're just the
same<00:00:59.399> we<00:01:00.120> also<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.160> crossroad<00:01:02.160> which

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
same we also have the crossroad which

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
same we also have the crossroad which
produces<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.519> kind<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:05.880> actually<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
produces a kind of it's not actually a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
produces a kind of it's not actually a
half<00:01:06.390> vertical<00:01:07.380> slab<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.830> more

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
half vertical slab because it's more

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.550 
half vertical slab because it's more
than<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.150> wedge<00:01:10.080> thing

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
than that but it's like a wedge thing

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.240 
than that but it's like a wedge thing
and<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.580> also<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> corner<00:01:13.130> see<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and and we also have the corner see the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.950 
and and we also have the corner see the
corner<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.030> corner<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.390> different<00:01:15.750> from

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
corner the corner is different from

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.160 
corner the corner is different from
wedge<00:01:16.880> there<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.970> go<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.600> basically<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.110> is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
wedge there we go and basically this is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
wedge there we go and basically this is
the<00:01:19.350> same<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.740> each<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.880> just

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the same for each of these so I just

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
the same for each of these so I just
change<00:01:21.930> independently<00:01:22.880> depending<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
change independently depending on the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.289 
change independently depending on the
block<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.530> likewise<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.340> stone<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.210> is

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
block and likewise the stone one is

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
block and likewise the stone one is
similar<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.200> mossy<00:01:29.040> stone<00:01:29.340> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
similar but because mossy stone is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999 
similar but because mossy stone is
actually<00:01:29.689> mossy<00:01:30.689> stone<00:01:30.960> fence<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.710> actually

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
actually mossy stone fence is actually

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.190 
actually mossy stone fence is actually
the<00:01:32.100> same<00:01:32.340> block<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:34.009> regular<00:01:35.009> they<00:01:35.369> change

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
the same block as regular they change

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.770 
the same block as regular they change
they<00:01:37.200> both<00:01:37.380> change<00:01:37.650> at<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.829> same<00:01:37.950> time<00:01:38.780> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
they both change at the same time the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.780 
they both change at the same time the
next<00:01:40.049> two<00:01:40.229> are<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:41.040> stable<00:01:41.490> because<00:01:41.579> they

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
next two are more stable because they

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.510 
next two are more stable because they
don't<00:01:41.939> actually<00:01:42.090> change<00:01:43.159> so<00:01:44.159> these<00:01:44.280> two<00:01:44.490> are

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
don't actually change so these two are

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.880 
don't actually change so these two are
just<00:01:44.759> chests<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.540> end<00:01:45.840> chests<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
just chests and end chests and as you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.609 
just chests and end chests and as you
can<00:01:46.979> see<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.909> slightly<00:01:48.540> scaled<00:01:49.350> down

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
can see they are a slightly scaled down

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.969 
can see they are a slightly scaled down
version<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.200> wood<00:01:52.200> block<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
version of the wood block and the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.550 
version of the wood block and the
Obsidian<00:01:53.340> block<00:01:53.720> next<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> panes

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
Obsidian block next we have the panes

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.760 
Obsidian block next we have the panes
and<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.100> bars<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:57.299> work<00:01:57.770> practically

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and the bars so these work practically

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.889 
and the bars so these work practically
the<00:01:58.950> same<00:01:59.100> as<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.790> fence<00:02:00.240> posts<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.689> walls

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the same as the fence posts in the walls

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.980 
the same as the fence posts in the walls
so<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.100> actually<00:02:02.250> come<00:02:02.610> over<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:03.119> you'll

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
so if I actually come over here you'll

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.600 
so if I actually come over here you'll
see<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:04.439> actually<00:02:04.469> changes<00:02:05.130> into<00:02:05.460> these

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
see they actually changes into these

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.940 
see they actually changes into these
weird<00:02:06.090> shapes<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.780> likewise<00:02:07.140> with<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.770> earth

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
weird shapes and likewise with the earth

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.850 
weird shapes and likewise with the earth
bars

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
bars

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.530 
bars
you<00:02:10.190> have<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.550> crossroad<00:02:11.000> again<00:02:11.270> which

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
you have the crossroad again which

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.220 
you have the crossroad again which
creates<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:12.370> vertical<00:02:13.370> glass<00:02:14.300> slab<00:02:14.930> and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
creates this vertical glass slab and

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.220 
creates this vertical glass slab and
again<00:02:15.530> we<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:15.770> also<00:02:15.920> do<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.520> with<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.820> bars

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
again we can also do that with the bars

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.300 
again we can also do that with the bars
and<00:02:18.230> then<00:02:18.350> we<00:02:18.410> have<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.650> corner<00:02:18.980> block<00:02:19.160> as

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
and then we have the corner block as

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.860 
and then we have the corner block as
well<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.390> actually<00:02:20.720> look<00:02:20.810> really

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
well and this actually look really

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.810 
well and this actually look really
really<00:02:21.260> nice<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.070> might<00:02:22.460> not

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
really nice and you might not

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.670 
really nice and you might not
necessarily<00:02:22.970> see<00:02:23.540> from<00:02:23.690> here<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.410> try

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
necessarily see from here but if I try

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.790 
necessarily see from here but if I try
to<00:02:24.710> actually<00:02:25.570> play<00:02:26.570> some<00:02:26.780> blocks<00:02:27.170> let's

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
to actually play some blocks let's

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.120 
to actually play some blocks let's
actually<00:02:28.160> see<00:02:29.770> actually<00:02:30.770> see<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:30.980> more

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
actually see actually see it more

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.990 
actually see actually see it more
profoundly<00:02:31.640> see<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.420> that's<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:33.380> really<00:02:33.560> nice

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
profoundly see that that's a really nice

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.610 
profoundly see that that's a really nice
really<00:02:35.000> nice<00:02:35.240> little<00:02:35.510> look<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.020> as<00:02:36.440> going

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
really nice little look to that as going

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.920 
really nice little look to that as going
there<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.400> does<00:02:37.520> it<00:02:37.610> with<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.910> bars<00:02:38.660> as

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
there so it does it with the bars as

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.530 
there so it does it with the bars as
well<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:39.830> those<00:02:39.950> basically<00:02:40.670> act<00:02:40.970> exactly<00:02:41.480> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
well so those basically act exactly the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.540 
well so those basically act exactly the
same<00:02:41.750> as<00:02:41.900> one<00:02:42.050> another<00:02:42.290> there<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.370> final

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
same as one another there the final

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.280 
same as one another there the final
mutation<00:02:44.209> was<00:02:44.450> partly<00:02:44.870> brought<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.200> my

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
mutation was partly brought to my

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.100 
mutation was partly brought to my
attention<00:02:45.320> by<00:02:45.680> log<00:02:45.980> stone<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.750> turns<00:02:47.930> out

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
attention by log stone so it turns out

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.300 
attention by log stone so it turns out
that<00:02:48.610> falling<00:02:49.610> stained<00:02:50.060> glass<00:02:50.770> now<00:02:51.770> appears

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
that falling stained glass now appears

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.979 
that falling stained glass now appears
as<00:02:52.400> one<00:02:52.730> single<00:02:53.150> flat<00:02:53.330> color<00:02:53.540> now<00:02:53.720> it

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
as one single flat color now it

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.510 
as one single flat color now it
previously<00:02:54.410> had<00:02:54.650> kind<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.190> had<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.340> bit<00:02:55.489> of

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
previously had kind of had a bit of

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.790 
previously had kind of had a bit of
cagey<00:02:55.820> look<00:02:56.090> to<00:02:56.270> it<00:02:56.420> but<00:02:56.630> now<00:02:56.989> they<00:02:57.650> just

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
cagey look to it but now they just

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.380 
cagey look to it but now they just
appear<00:02:58.070> like<00:02:58.220> this<00:02:58.400> just<00:02:58.730> one<00:02:58.940> single<00:02:59.120> color

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
appear like this just one single color

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.010 
appear like this just one single color
so<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.860> raises<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.640> question<00:03:02.060> what<00:03:02.630> happens

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
so this raises the question what happens

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.430 
so this raises the question what happens
when<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.530> summon<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.360> pain<00:03:05.360> version<00:03:06.200> of

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
when you summon the pain version of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.650 
when you summon the pain version of
stained<00:03:06.860> glass<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:08.090> same<00:03:08.300> thing<00:03:08.570> that

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
stained glass the same thing that

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.720 
stained glass the same thing that
happens<00:03:08.989> when<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.350> summon<00:03:09.680> regular<00:03:10.190> falling

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
happens when you summon regular falling

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.699 
happens when you summon regular falling
glass<00:03:10.880> panes<00:03:11.150> except<00:03:11.690> these<00:03:11.840> ones<00:03:12.140> have<00:03:12.380> weird

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
glass panes except these ones have weird

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.130 
glass panes except these ones have weird
colors<00:03:13.100> so<00:03:13.880> as<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.120> can<00:03:14.239> demonstrate<00:03:14.360> they<00:03:14.930> will

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
colors so as I can demonstrate they will

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.530 
colors so as I can demonstrate they will
all<00:03:15.350> move<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:16.280> unison<00:03:16.459> because<00:03:16.970> they<00:03:17.060> are<00:03:17.239> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
all move in unison because they are the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.840 
all move in unison because they are the
same<00:03:17.870> tile<00:03:18.500> ID<00:03:18.739> they've<00:03:19.310> just<00:03:19.459> got<00:03:19.610> different

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
same tile ID they've just got different

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.300 
same tile ID they've just got different
data<00:03:20.000> values<00:03:20.360> and<00:03:20.600> as<00:03:21.320> I<00:03:21.470> move<00:03:21.620> along<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:22.130> will

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
data values and as I move along it will

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.539 
data values and as I move along it will
just<00:03:22.459> change<00:03:22.730> shapes<00:03:23.360> as<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.959> half<00:03:24.549> vertical

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
just change shapes as the half vertical

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.750 
just change shapes as the half vertical
slab<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.540> corner<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.489> there<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.610> have

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
slab and the corner and there you have

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.539 
slab and the corner and there you have
it<00:03:28.940> so<00:03:29.690> there<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.959> are<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.680> weird<00:03:30.920> mutant

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
it so there you are the weird mutant

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:44.530 
it so there you are the weird mutant
falling<00:03:32.000> sand<00:03:32.239> entity

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.599 

you
