there are they are choking there's a few
things<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.690> help<00:00:40.050> treat<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
things that we can do to help treat this

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.240 
things that we can do to help treat this
one<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.660> some<00:00:42.870> very<00:00:43.110> big<00:00:43.410> vigorous

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
one is some very big vigorous

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.569 
one is some very big vigorous
stimulation<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.890> ever<00:00:46.920> watch<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
stimulation of them if you ever watch a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.450 
stimulation of them if you ever watch a
newborn<00:00:48.420> mother<00:00:48.989> dog<00:00:49.289> take<00:00:49.980> care<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
newborn mother dog take care of the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.220 
newborn mother dog take care of the
puppies<00:00:50.850> after<00:00:51.149> they're<00:00:51.390> first<00:00:51.660> born<00:00:51.750> they

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
puppies after they're first born they

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.950 
puppies after they're first born they
lick<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.399> they<00:00:53.520> rub<00:00:53.820> them<00:00:54.059> around<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.719> move

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
lick and they rub them around they move

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.189 
lick and they rub them around they move
them<00:00:55.260> around<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.489> mimic<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.210> by

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
them around and so we can mimic that by

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.889 
them around and so we can mimic that by
lots<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.649> stimulation<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> towel<00:00:59.910> often

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
lots of stimulation with a towel often

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.020 
lots of stimulation with a towel often
that<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.260> stimulate<00:01:01.559> breathing<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.879> then

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that can stimulate breathing and then

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.179 
that can stimulate breathing and then
I'll<00:01:03.120> stimulate<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> flow<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.650> mucus

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
I'll stimulate the flow of that mucus

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.190 
I'll stimulate the flow of that mucus
out<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.760> their<00:01:05.909> trachea<00:01:06.240> out<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.080> their

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
out of their trachea out of their

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
out of their trachea out of their
windpipe<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:08.420> simple<00:01:09.920> bulb<00:01:10.920> syringe<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.490> this

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
windpipe a simple bulb syringe like this

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
windpipe a simple bulb syringe like this
or<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.689> people<00:01:12.840> may<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.290> something

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
or a lot of people may have something

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.520 
or a lot of people may have something
similar<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.280> for<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> turkey<00:01:15.270> baster

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
similar to this for like a turkey baster

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
similar to this for like a turkey baster
things<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:18.000> expecting<00:01:18.390> a

things like that if you are expecting a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.929 
things like that if you are expecting a
litter<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.930> puppies<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.740> would<00:01:20.310> recommend<00:01:20.759> an

litter of puppies I would recommend an
investment<00:01:21.600> into<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> simple<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.500> bulb

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
investment into a simple little bulb

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.120 
investment into a simple little bulb
syringe<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:24.500> basically<00:01:25.500> compress

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
syringe like this basically compress

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the tube here and that stuck into the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
the tube here and that stuck into the
back<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.920> their<00:01:32.040> throat<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.850> repeat<00:01:33.210> this

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
back of their throat and you repeat this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.310 
back of their throat and you repeat this
procedure<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.520> mucus<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.210> pull<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
procedure as we get to mucus out pull it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.499 
procedure as we get to mucus out pull it
up<00:01:37.439> into<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> syringe

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
up into the syringe

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.179 
up into the syringe
squirt<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> back<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.590> repeat<00:01:40.979> that

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
squirt it back out and repeat that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.160 
them upside down when you're rubbing
them<00:01:46.610> will<00:01:47.610> help<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.240> some<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> flow<00:01:48.960> out

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
them will help with some of the flow out

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.569 
them will help with some of the flow out
there

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
there

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.780

I've seen many clients do a shaking

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.480 
I've seen many clients do a shaking
method<00:01:54.240> where<00:01:54.869> they<00:01:55.049> they<00:01:55.649> throw<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.189> puppy

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
method where they they throw the puppy

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.109 
method where they they throw the puppy
like<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.540> do<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:57.869> recommend<00:01:58.350> that

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
like this we do not recommend that

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.420 
like this we do not recommend that
recent<00:02:00.119> studies<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.869> method<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:02.159> shown

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
recent studies on that method have shown

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.830 
recent studies on that method have shown
increased<00:02:03.149> incidence<00:02:03.869> of
