00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.619

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.670
 let's synchronize all because only 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.380
 we have about 30 songs I know that you 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.640
 they will have a million songs and such 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.200
 they want to select certain 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.640
 songs or just everything 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.140
 they have their itunes 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.450
 after that they just have to go 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.710
 down here where they synchronize will give 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.570

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.229
 if they see a button at this moment 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.119
 which says apply or apply pressure on that 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.430

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.160

 is going to be the first options and 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.140
 inside of here we can simply put 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.840

 synchronize if they have mac from here they 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.730

 windows 8 or windows 7 or any laptop 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.630
