00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.210 
fully realized I think it may be because
of<00:07:54.630> the<00:07:54.720> personalities<00:07:55.440> and<00:07:55.470> because<00:07:55.890> of<00:07:55.919> the

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 
of the personalities and because of the

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.400 
of the personalities and because of the
habits<00:07:56.820> of<00:07:56.940> the<00:07:57.060> days<00:07:57.240> it<00:07:57.900> was<00:07:58.080> hard<00:07:58.320> to

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.410 
habits of the days it was hard to

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.230 
habits of the days it was hard to
contain<00:07:58.919> and<00:07:59.220> maybe<00:07:59.370> the<00:07:59.520> maturity<00:07:59.970> hadn't

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 
contain and maybe the maturity hadn't

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.409 
contain and maybe the maturity hadn't
caught<00:08:00.390> up<00:08:00.570> with<00:08:00.750> the<00:08:00.960> concept<00:08:01.789> so<00:08:02.789> in<00:08:03.090> a<00:08:03.240> way<00:08:03.390> I

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:03.419 
caught up with the concept so in a way I

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:05.270 
caught up with the concept so in a way I
almost<00:08:03.570> feel<00:08:03.870> like<00:08:03.930> a<00:08:04.260> band<00:08:04.560> like<00:08:04.770> this<00:08:04.979> is

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 
almost feel like a band like this is

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.300 
almost feel like a band like this is
it's<00:08:06.180> kind<00:08:06.450> of<00:08:06.510> trying<00:08:07.260> to<00:08:07.470> pick<00:08:07.889> up<00:08:08.100> with<00:08:08.280> that

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:08.310 
it's kind of trying to pick up with that

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.090 
it's kind of trying to pick up with that
left<00:08:08.850> off
