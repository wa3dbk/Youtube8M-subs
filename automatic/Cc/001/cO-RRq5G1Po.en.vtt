now<00:01:59.850> what's<00:02:00.210> interesting<00:02:00.330> about<00:02:00.660> this<00:02:00.840> is

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
now what's interesting about this is

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.020 
now what's interesting about this is
that<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.410> lends<00:02:01.650> itself<00:02:01.980> to<00:02:02.130> actually<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> lot

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that it lends itself to actually a lot

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.990 
that it lends itself to actually a lot
of<00:02:03.240> more<00:02:03.630> non-raid<00:02:04.440> situations<00:02:05.190> than<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
of more non-raid situations than the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.640 
of more non-raid situations than the
other<00:02:06.120> weapon<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.660> feel<00:02:06.870> like<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.560> other

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
other weapon see I feel like the other

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.410 
other weapon see I feel like the other
raid<00:02:07.830> weapons<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.640> lend<00:02:08.819> themselves<00:02:08.849> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
raid weapons really lend themselves to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.960 
raid weapons really lend themselves to
crotas<00:02:09.840> end'<00:02:10.019> abyss<00:02:10.920> defiant<00:02:11.430> i<00:02:11.489> feel<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:11.819> is

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
crotas end' abyss defiant i feel like is

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.270 
crotas end' abyss defiant i feel like is
the<00:02:12.180> best<00:02:12.480> raid<00:02:12.810> gun<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.319> can<00:02:13.500> get<00:02:13.680> out<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the best raid gun you can get out of the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.160 
the best raid gun you can get out of the
hard<00:02:14.849> mode<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.150> crotas<00:02:15.420> end<00:02:15.569> because<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
hard mode of crotas end because of the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.380 
hard mode of crotas end because of the
hives<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.590> delish<00:02:16.920> main<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.610> hive<00:02:17.790> disrupter

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
hives is delish main the hive disrupter

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.150 
hives is delish main the hive disrupter
and<00:02:18.570> then<00:02:18.960> also

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
and then also

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.640 
and then also
uh<00:02:20.190> what's<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.820> last<00:02:21.060> one<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.480> think<00:02:21.780> increased

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
uh what's the last one I think increased

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.820 
uh what's the last one I think increased
damage<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.280> hive<00:02:23.880> majors<00:02:24.300> or<00:02:24.480> might<00:02:24.630> be

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
damage to hive majors or might be

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.410 
damage to hive majors or might be
penetrate<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.980> walls<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.490> darkness<00:02:27.030> whatever

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
penetrate the walls of darkness whatever

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.210 
penetrate the walls of darkness whatever

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
finally I came this close to dismantling

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.630 
finally I came this close to dismantling
that<00:02:54.630> 18<00:02:55.020> it's<00:02:55.110> up<00:02:55.230> blocks<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.770> cannot<00:02:56.310> stand

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
that 18 it's up blocks I cannot stand

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.970 
that 18 it's up blocks I cannot stand
that<00:02:56.790> thing<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.300> only<00:02:57.990> use<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.500> when<00:02:58.860> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
that thing I only use it when the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.350 
that thing I only use it when the
nightfall<00:02:59.340> happens<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.880> void<00:03:00.090> which

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
nightfall happens to be void which

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.790 
nightfall happens to be void which
hasn't<00:03:00.570> been<00:03:00.720> in<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.990> while<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.170> don't<00:03:01.470> think<00:03:01.650> I'm

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
hasn't been in a while I don't think I'm

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.860 
hasn't been in a while I don't think I'm
I'm<00:03:02.160> going<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.400> bet<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.640> uh<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.660> week's

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
I'm going to bet that uh this week's

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.390 
I'm going to bet that uh this week's
going<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.260> our<00:03:04.560> comm<00:03:04.740> priest<00:03:05.070> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
going to be our comm priest and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.760 
going to be our comm priest and
hopefully<00:03:06.120> void<00:03:06.300> now<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:06.990> to<00:03:07.200> keep<00:03:07.380> modifiers

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
hopefully void now the to keep modifiers

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.110 
hopefully void now the to keep modifiers
are<00:03:07.860> going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.070> be<00:03:08.130> rapidly<00:03:08.550> landing<00:03:08.880> three

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
forward you got to see the boost you

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.100 
forward you got to see the boost you
getting<00:04:06.120> arranged<00:04:06.480> there<00:04:06.630> that's<00:04:06.810> pretty

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
getting arranged there that's pretty

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.020
