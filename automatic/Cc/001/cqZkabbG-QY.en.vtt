00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.720
 hello everyone welcome once again to 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.510
 my channel my name is carolina and today I 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.140
 I bring a colorful makeup like 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.970
 can see but at the same time elegant I know 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.890
 that it has happened to many that in some 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.320
 occasion they are suddenly on the beach or in 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.680
 a very hot place they live in cities 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.500
 that are very hot and suddenly 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.390
 They have an elegant event at night and 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.870
 They do not know how to put on makeup then 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.640
 they resort to the typical smoky to that I do not know to 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.039
 the most basic neutral colors 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.660
 because then it's the easiest thing 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.430
 simple what is supposed to be for the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.609
 night but this time I'm going to 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.789
 teach one more idea for the night but 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.500
 well colorful for its climates so well 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.989
 hot or warm like you 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.329
 tell and then to take advantage of that 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.399
 I personally can not I do not live in 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.469
 a climate of those that I would love but 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.610
 Well for the people who need it 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.930
 it's an excellent option it's super easy 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.670
 and you can combine it with the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.200
 collected or loose hair I'm going to 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.119
 video and then nothing and you 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.759
 dressed and well as I told them then no 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.040

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.320
 bring step by step I hope you like it 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.270

 subscribe if you are not yet 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.270
 first is to put a private or a 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.700
 concealer on all our eyelids 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.360
 so the colors moved a lot 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.670
 more and then it is as more even our 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.280
 eyelid color you know we 're going 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.680
 to spread with the most delicate finger of 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.659
 our hand and we will also put a 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.750
 little bit below by for the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.240
 lower eyelid and right now what am 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.700
 doing is putting a shadow like 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.240
 color of my skin only on the fixed eyelid 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.880
 like a little eyebrow because I do not know 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.830
 I need on the lower eyelid now 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.090
 I'm going to use a dark brown shadow 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.099
 like this one 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.379
 and I'm going to use it as a color 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.989
 transition then I will use of 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.959
 once a brush to blur and go 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.060
 to put on the whole fold of my eye and 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.060
 I'm going to blur this color very well 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.160
 now it's going to take a yellow like this 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.980
 as pale or pastel and then put on the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.959
 eyelid mobile but only there in the part 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.519
 of the lacrimal as to the middle do not 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.519
 I want to put on all the eyelid 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.950
 and then a single aquamarine like this what 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.110
 will put on the rest of the mobile eyelid 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.850
 as you can see I am using the 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.530
 brochita that comes in the shadows for 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.660
 that they see that if we can work with 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.210
 them too and I'm putting them together 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.030
 little bit because at the end like I was 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.940
 is going to turn into a green color and here 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.920
 I'm retouching the brown color to use 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.870
 this rosita very pale to put it on 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.670
 the lower eyelid this is something that we 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.650
 will notice a lot is like a 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:22.409
 touch and very subtle 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.409
 and now I'm going to outline my eyes 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.940
 Now I'm going to put a black pencil in the 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.940
 Lower and upper water line 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.430
 and I'm going to continue with the mascara or I'm 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.230
 using london spell 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.450
 lies that is super good has a brush 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.920
 very fat but just put one out 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.730
 because I use tabs again 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.730
 artificial 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.760
 and well here I am putting them 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.680
 showed a lot because for me it's very 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.780
 difficult to record putting on my eyelashes 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.069
 I have to do many pirouettes then 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.069
 It is very difficult to do it 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.439
 well here I'm putting a little 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.439
 of blush 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.750
 and for the final touch on the lips I'm going 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.270
 to use this orange color of revlon 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.830
 that is super cute and apart they are super 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.750
 chÃ©veres because they have like brillito 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.020
 once and this is what the 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.790
 then touch this makeup and then this one 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.200
 and it brings shine like but I told them 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.760
 I want to give more shine because the same goes to 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.100
 be for the night then I'll put 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.280
 a little bit of this wellton clean 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.950
 white that has like sub tones 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.430
 reddish and well this is the look 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.360
 finished with the hair collected 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.400
 Obviously if it's for a party 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.150
 elegant I advise you to collect the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.860
 hair 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.360
 if it's something more formal they can take it 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.280
 I loose that later I'm going to 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.750
 show and I wanted to explain that to 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.360
 Although we use all the 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.910
 Cakes in the eyes does not show much 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.020
 for the brown color we put 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.960
 previously so if you want it to be 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.479
 see more do not use brown 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.400
 Now here I am going to start releasing my 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.169
 hair to show you the great 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.069
 difference it makes with loose hair to 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.069
 a hair collected 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.620
 and well this is how we are with the 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.170
 hair loose if the difference is much 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.720
 then you know that this is like 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.760
 something more informal and relaxed while 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.030
 that the collected hair do for something 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.580
 more formal then that's all I hope 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.650
 that you really liked this video 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.780

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.170
 people who need it because they are 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.570
 in summer and if they are not in summer, 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.620

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.510
