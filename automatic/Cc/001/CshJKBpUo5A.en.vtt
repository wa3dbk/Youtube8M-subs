00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.569
 working near the minor chords 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:20.689
 the minor agreements that we're taking today I've 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.789
 just that the court dylan minor 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.869
 the chords of e minor 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.869
 finally the court of the deadline 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.780
 let's start with the first cut the chord 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.320
 here they have the diagram 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.550
 you follow 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.530
 according to the explanation is that it says and adds with what the injured in the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.980
 proper place 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.000
 and her grams indicates that we should tear ourselves from the fifth string towards 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.950
 down 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.940
 seen here let's go do twice 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 in relation to the fifth string down 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.430
 efe once again 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.510
 very well and that is known as the car I played the court in fact the - 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.360
 one two three four if they are fixed 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.630
 the last time we lost the accordion and so 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.230
 and a contribution was heard with a bit of a tone 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.560
 a little more the quota with more energy than we listen to differences 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.340
 because it does 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.480
 the biggest 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.280
 and then I'm going to pass it - so you can hear the difference 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.400
 higher 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.950
 at least 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.630
 the biggest 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.350
 the least 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.280
 urge soto that is a difference that will help us 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.360
 that we can understand the difference in how these percent are heard and 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.500
 bulls values 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.480
 against consumers now let's move on to the second chord 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.080
 - what would be network - 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.460
 here once again they have the court diagram 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 I josÃ© your fingers 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.220
 the agreement that we already were indicates that this court should be torn from the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.500
 fourth rope down the fifth and the sixth 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.249
 not be nobody seen here we go two months 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.109
 once again 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.109
 we will hear the premature 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.629
 re minor 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.049
 now let's go before the sheep sector that day the derby 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.149
 that here they have the diagram 

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.559
 as in his fingers only two of the subjects to accommodate 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.459
 we are two volumes easier to learn 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.559
 millennium 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.989
 smooth this agrarian entity tells us that in this tone with that court 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.229
 we can tear the six flamenco strings 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.229
 let's do it then 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.409
 the money so that your children the difference 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.049
 less 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.899
 less 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:09.549
 I hope to continue learning 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.519
 in independent
