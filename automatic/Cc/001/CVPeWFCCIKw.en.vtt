Stage<00:00:08.580> four<00:00:08.940> -<00:00:09.179> ten

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
Stage four - ten

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.459 
Stage four - ten
I<00:00:09.950> want<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.070> start<00:00:11.340> out<00:00:11.519> by<00:00:11.550> saying<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.509> really

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
I want to start out by saying I really

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.680 
I want to start out by saying I really
didn't<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.400> level<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:15.030> spent<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.450> lot<00:00:15.630> of

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
didn't like this level I spent a lot of

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.300 
didn't like this level I spent a lot of
time<00:00:16.049> trying<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.410> figure<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
time trying to figure it out and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.599 
time trying to figure it out and
couldn't<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.390> end<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:19.130> had<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.160> restart

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
couldn't and in the end I had to restart

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.500 
couldn't and in the end I had to restart
to<00:00:20.820> buying<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.960> solution<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:23.240> within<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
to buying the solution here within the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.960 
to buying the solution here within the
game<00:00:24.689> which<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.619> vowed<00:00:25.830> not<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.099> do<00:00:26.369> twice<00:00:26.640> in

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
game which I vowed not to do twice in

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.960 
game which I vowed not to do twice in
the<00:00:27.269> same<00:00:27.449> game<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.099> which<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.250> had<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.760> in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
the same game but which I had to do in

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.170 
the same game but which I had to do in
this<00:00:30.150> case<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.080> even<00:00:31.890> after<00:00:32.460> learning<00:00:32.820> how<00:00:33.149> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
this case and even after learning how to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.069 
this case and even after learning how to
solve<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
solve it

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.810 
solve it
I<00:00:34.579> felt<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:37.500> solution<00:00:37.860> was

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
I felt that it just the solution was

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.990 
I felt that it just the solution was
just<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.420> intuitive<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.710> like<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.700> not

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
just not intuitive at all like I'm not

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.549 
just not intuitive at all like I'm not
saying<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.540> smartest<00:00:42.960> person<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.440> earth

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
saying I'm the smartest person on earth

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.110 
saying I'm the smartest person on earth
and<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.070> couldn't<00:00:44.370> solve<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.760> nobody

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and if I couldn't solve that nobody

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.819 
and if I couldn't solve that nobody
could<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:47.000> it's<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.270> difficult<00:00:49.020> just

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
could but it's just difficult just

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.479 
could but it's just difficult just
wasn't<00:00:50.610> fun<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.270> didn't<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.739> anyways

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
wasn't fun I didn't like it but anyways

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.060 
wasn't fun I didn't like it but anyways
here's<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> solution<00:00:54.379> there<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.500> stars<00:00:55.829> on

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
here's the solution there are stars on

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.740 
here's the solution there are stars on
the<00:00:56.160> walls<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.800> apparently<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:59.070> are

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
the walls and apparently they are

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.200 
the walls and apparently they are
numbers<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> clock<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.100> tap<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
numbers on the clock if you tap on the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.609 
numbers on the clock if you tap on the
star<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:05.430> star<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.000> flashes<00:01:06.600> once<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.380> this

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
star this star it flashes once so this

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.670 
star this star it flashes once so this
is<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:07.950> o'clock<00:01:08.510> if<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.720> tap<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.290> second

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
is one o'clock if you tap on the second

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.550 
is one o'clock if you tap on the second
star<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.430> flashes<00:01:12.000> twice<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.350> two

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
star it flashes twice so this is two

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.550 
star it flashes twice so this is two
o'clock<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:14.970> don't<00:01:15.509> want<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> keep<00:01:16.110> doing<00:01:16.409> this

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
o'clock I don't want to keep doing this

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.070 
o'clock I don't want to keep doing this
because<00:01:16.619> every<00:01:17.189> time<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:18.119> tap<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.750> star

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
because every time you tap on the star

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.609 
because every time you tap on the star
the<00:01:19.799> trap<00:01:20.070> door<00:01:20.280> opens<00:01:21.000> wider<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.470> do

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the trap door opens wider and if you do

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.190 
the trap door opens wider and if you do
this<00:01:22.740> enough<00:01:22.890> times<00:01:23.600> you'll<00:01:24.600> die<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> you

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
this enough times you'll die and you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140 
this enough times you'll die and you
need<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.500> start<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.890> over<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.759> don't<00:01:26.909> want

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
need to start this over and I don't want

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.249 
need to start this over and I don't want
to<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:28.100> right<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.280> anyways<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.840> star

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
to do it right now anyways the the star

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.030 
to do it right now anyways the the star
over<00:01:35.270> here<00:01:36.270> I'll<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.810> tap<00:01:37.049> right<00:01:37.079> beside<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
over here I'll just tap right beside it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.940 
over here I'll just tap right beside it
this<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.909> flash<00:01:39.150> four<00:01:39.540> times<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.770> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
this will flash four times so this is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.940 
this will flash four times so this is
four<00:01:41.310> o'clock<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.990> this<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.259> planet<00:01:43.560> here

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
four o'clock and this little planet here

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.539 
four o'clock and this little planet here
that<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.549> shining<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.119> light<00:01:46.250> this<00:01:47.250> would

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that that's shining a light this would

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.300 
that that's shining a light this would
be<00:01:47.820> three<00:01:48.149> o'clock<00:01:48.479> effectively<00:01:49.290> because<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
be three o'clock effectively because the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.620 
be three o'clock effectively because the
star<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.970> left<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:53.159> two<00:01:54.030> o'clock<00:01:54.149> and

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
star on the left is to two o'clock and

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.289 
star on the left is to two o'clock and
the<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.100> right<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.640> four<00:01:57.030> o'clock<00:01:57.259> so

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
the one on the right is four o'clock so

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.240 
the one on the right is four o'clock so
if<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.509> move<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> other<00:02:01.740> side<00:02:02.719> this<00:02:03.719> one

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
if you move to the other side this one

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.999 
if you move to the other side this one
would<00:02:05.250> be<00:02:05.280> let<00:02:06.210> me<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.570> three<00:02:06.960> four<00:02:07.380> five<00:02:07.740> six

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
would be let me see three four five six

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.540 
would be let me see three four five six
seven<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.390> would<00:02:09.569> be<00:02:09.599> eight<00:02:09.899> o'clock

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
seven this one would be eight o'clock

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.580 
seven this one would be eight o'clock
if<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.210> look<00:02:12.450> at<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.690> two<00:02:12.900> beams<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.410> light

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
if you look at the two beams of light

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.830 
if you look at the two beams of light
you'll<00:02:14.400> find<00:02:14.760> one<00:02:15.030> that's<00:02:15.210> shorter<00:02:15.540> than<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
you'll find one that's shorter than the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.050 
you'll find one that's shorter than the
other<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.100> shorter<00:02:17.460> one<00:02:17.610> will<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
other so the shorter one will be the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.330 
other so the shorter one will be the
hour<00:02:18.210> hand<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.350> longer<00:02:19.740> one<00:02:19.950> will<00:02:20.130> be<00:02:20.220> two

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
hour hand and the longer one will be two

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.150 
hour hand and the longer one will be two
minutes<00:02:20.490> hand<00:02:21.110> which<00:02:22.110> effectively<00:02:22.680> makes

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
minutes hand which effectively makes

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.060 
minutes hand which effectively makes
this<00:02:23.880> arrangement<00:02:26.540> 8:15<00:02:27.540> 8<00:02:27.870> o<00:02:27.930> clock<00:02:28.110> 50

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
this arrangement 8:15 8 o clock 50

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.240 
this arrangement 8:15 8 o clock 50
minutes<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:32.130> now<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.820> we<00:02:33.240> know<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:35.010> go

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
minutes so now that we know this we go

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.510 
minutes so now that we know this we go
to<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.640> special<00:02:36.390> keypad<00:02:37.080> which<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.220> really

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
to this special keypad which is really

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.060 
to this special keypad which is really
confusing<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:39.750> need<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.110> somehow<00:02:40.320> enter

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
confusing and we need to somehow enter

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.050 
confusing and we need to somehow enter
in<00:02:41.840> 8:15<00:02:42.840> now<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.740> way<00:02:44.130> they<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.790> laid

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
in 8:15 now the way they have this laid

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.610 
in 8:15 now the way they have this laid
out<00:02:45.270> is<00:02:47.030> these<00:02:48.030> lights<00:02:48.450> here<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.200> group<00:02:49.440> of

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
out is these lights here this group of

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.340 
out is these lights here this group of
lights<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:51.600> left

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
lights on the left

lights on the left
each<00:02:52.740> light<00:02:53.220> represents<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.180> hour<00:02:54.860> so<00:02:55.860> you'll

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
each light represents one hour so you'll

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.700 
each light represents one hour so you'll
need<00:02:56.550> to<00:02:57.590> make<00:02:58.590> eight<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:59.100> them<00:02:59.250> light<00:02:59.520> up<00:02:59.730> and

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
need to make eight of them light up and

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.460 
need to make eight of them light up and
this<00:03:01.710> group<00:03:02.040> here<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.820> center<00:03:03.210> each<00:03:04.080> light

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
this group here in the center each light

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.570 
this group here in the center each light
represents<00:03:05.100> ten<00:03:05.340> minutes<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.720> II<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:08.040> make<00:03:08.340> one

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
represents ten minutes so II to make one

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.540 
represents ten minutes so II to make one
of<00:03:08.700> them<00:03:08.820> light<00:03:09.060> up<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.920> cluster<00:03:11.520> here

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
of them light up and this cluster here

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.390 
of them light up and this cluster here
on<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.270> right<00:03:12.510> each<00:03:13.290> one<00:03:13.590> represents<00:03:14.220> one

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
on the right each one represents one

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.820 
on the right each one represents one
minute<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.770> you<00:03:16.770> need<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.930> make<00:03:18.930> five<00:03:19.260> light<00:03:19.620> up

minute so you need to make five light up
and<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:21.420> lights<00:03:21.630> will<00:03:21.990> represent<00:03:22.430> 8:15<00:03:23.430> and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
and the lights will represent 8:15 and

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:36.900 
and the lights will represent 8:15 and
the<00:03:24.090> door<00:03:24.330> will<00:03:24.540> open

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910
