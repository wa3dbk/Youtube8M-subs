some servers play exactly like they

some servers play exactly like they
should<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> how<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.960> would<00:02:04.170> expect<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.649> to

that is to say there's no bullshit you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.660 
that is to say there's no bullshit you

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
damage and you get the kill but then you

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.820 
damage and you get the kill but then you
get

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
get

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.890 
get
to<00:02:12.980> other<00:02:13.130> servers<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.970> play<00:02:14.150> like<00:02:14.360> absolute

to other servers that play like absolute

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.200 
to other servers that play like absolute
freakin<00:02:15.380> garbage<00:02:15.950> with<00:02:16.400> nothing<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:16.820> one-hit

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
freakin garbage with nothing but one-hit

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.270

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
kills and trade kills yet it still has

kills and trade kills yet it still has
these<00:02:19.550> same<00:02:19.850> twenty<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.600> thirty<00:02:20.840> ping<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.380> think

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
these same twenty to thirty ping I think

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.650 
these same twenty to thirty ping I think
the<00:02:22.070> reason<00:02:22.340> for<00:02:22.460> this<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.790> again<00:02:23.210> this<00:02:23.510> is

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the reason for this and again this is

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.780 
the reason for this and again this is
just<00:02:23.960> my<00:02:24.140> opinion<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.070> theory<00:02:25.430> that<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.670> am

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
just my opinion and a theory that I am

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.340 
just my opinion and a theory that I am
working<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.540> have<00:02:26.750> been<00:02:26.930> working<00:02:27.200> on

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
working on that I have been working on

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.140 
working on that I have been working on
is<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.130> whatever<00:02:28.280> reason<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
is that for whatever reason the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.090 
is that for whatever reason the
synchronization<00:02:29.960> between<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.290> game<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.010> the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
synchronization between the game and the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.550 
synchronization between the game and the
server<00:02:31.610> is<00:02:31.970> sometimes<00:02:32.510> buggered<00:02:32.990> or<00:02:33.200> delayed

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
server is sometimes buggered or delayed

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.160 
server is sometimes buggered or delayed
or<00:02:33.860> fucked<00:02:34.250> or<00:02:34.520> broken<00:02:35.000> call<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.720> whatever<00:02:35.900> you

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
or fucked or broken call it whatever you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.680 
or fucked or broken call it whatever you
want<00:02:36.440> this<00:02:37.040> leads<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.520> packet<00:02:38.120> loss<00:02:38.390> or

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
want this leads to a packet loss or

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.660 
want this leads to a packet loss or
delay<00:02:39.170> from<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.650> game<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.490> you're<00:02:40.640> playing

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
delay from the game that you're playing

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.870 
delay from the game that you're playing
on<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.900> server<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.470> again<00:02:43.070> this<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:43.730> just

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
on to the server and again this is just

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.670 
on to the server and again this is just
regardless<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.630> pink<00:02:44.840> some<00:02:45.230> games<00:02:45.470> with

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
regardless of pink some games with

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.830 
regardless of pink some games with
twenty<00:02:46.040> ping<00:02:46.220> are<00:02:46.370> awesome<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.000> then<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.600> get

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
twenty ping are awesome and then you get

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.050 
twenty ping are awesome and then you get
into<00:02:47.960> a<00:02:48.050> game<00:02:48.260> like<00:02:48.290> ten<00:02:49.220> ping<00:02:49.490> and<00:02:49.730> it's<00:02:49.850> just

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
into a game like ten ping and it's just

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.740 
into a game like ten ping and it's just
terrible

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
terrible

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.930 
terrible
so<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.290> packets<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.800> info<00:02:52.010> are<00:02:52.190> sent<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.640> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
so the packets of info are sent to the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.400 
so the packets of info are sent to the
server<00:02:53.150> what<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.600> think<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:53.930> happening<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.380> that

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
server what I think is happening is that

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.440 
server what I think is happening is that
sometimes<00:02:54.920> there<00:02:55.100> is<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.190> delay<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.910> lag<00:02:56.270> in

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
sometimes there is a delay or lag in

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.360 
sometimes there is a delay or lag in
that<00:02:56.570> information<00:02:56.900> relay<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.920> leads<00:02:58.160> to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
that information relay and that leads to

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.699 
that information relay and that leads to
bad<00:02:58.610> an<00:02:58.910> inconsistent<00:02:59.450> hit<00:02:59.780> detection<00:03:00.020> there

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
bad an inconsistent hit detection there

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.250 
bad an inconsistent hit detection there
is<00:03:00.860> thus<00:03:01.459> far<00:03:01.490> no<00:03:02.060> rhyme<00:03:02.300> nor<00:03:02.690> reason<00:03:02.750> as<00:03:03.230> to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
is thus far no rhyme nor reason as to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.890 
is thus far no rhyme nor reason as to
why<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:03.770> is<00:03:04.070> happening<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.730> just<00:03:05.090> for<00:03:05.780> in

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
why this is happening that just for in

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.380 
why this is happening that just for in
my<00:03:06.110> personal<00:03:07.010> opinion<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.520> think<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.270> the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
my personal opinion I think that is the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.390 
my personal opinion I think that is the
problem<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:08.900> is<00:03:09.380> what<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.740> leading<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.280> this

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
problem and is what is leading to this

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.270 
problem and is what is leading to this
inconsistent<00:03:11.180> hit<00:03:11.300> detection<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:12.350> what<00:03:12.770> is<00:03:13.010> my

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
inconsistent hit detection so what is my

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.490 
inconsistent hit detection so what is my
solution<00:03:13.610> what<00:03:14.000> is<00:03:14.120> my<00:03:14.240> quote<00:03:14.600> unquote<00:03:14.750> fix

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
solution what is my quote unquote fix

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.979 
solution what is my quote unquote fix

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
for the bad net code that everyone seems

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.840

quit<00:03:24.110> that<00:03:24.260> shit<00:03:24.320> server<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.220> try<00:03:25.580> another

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
quit that shit server and try another

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.449 
quit that shit server and try another
one<00:03:26.000> call<00:03:26.660> me<00:03:26.750> stupid<00:03:27.019> or<00:03:27.350> crazy<00:03:27.410> but<00:03:28.160> that's

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
one call me stupid or crazy but that's

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.520 
one call me stupid or crazy but that's
my<00:03:28.730> big<00:03:29.030> solution<00:03:29.510> as<00:03:29.630> I<00:03:29.989> said<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.260> biggest

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
my big solution as I said the biggest

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.840 
my big solution as I said the biggest
problem<00:03:30.800> with<00:03:30.890> this<00:03:31.040> game<00:03:31.280> for<00:03:31.550> me<00:03:31.670> is

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
problem with this game for me is

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.880 
problem with this game for me is
inconsistent<00:03:32.720> hit<00:03:32.810> detection<00:03:33.019> regardless<00:03:33.709> of

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
inconsistent hit detection regardless of

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.199 
inconsistent hit detection regardless of
the<00:03:34.010> pink<00:03:34.250> again<00:03:34.700> there's<00:03:34.880> no<00:03:35.000> rhyme<00:03:35.180> or

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
the pink again there's no rhyme or

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.150 
the pink again there's no rhyme or
reason<00:03:35.360> why<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:35.750> happens<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.350> just<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.860> is

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
reason why this happens it just it is

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.949 
reason why this happens it just it is
what<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.519> some<00:03:38.060> servers<00:03:38.450> are<00:03:38.540> great<00:03:38.690> and

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
what it is some servers are great and

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.080 
what it is some servers are great and
others<00:03:39.350> are<00:03:39.500> shit<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.100> my<00:03:40.190> solution<00:03:40.640> is<00:03:40.790> if<00:03:41.030> I

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
others are shit so my solution is if I

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.699 
others are shit so my solution is if I
get<00:03:41.150> into<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.510> server<00:03:41.750> where<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.080> get<00:03:42.290> one<00:03:42.530> hit

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
get into a server where I get one hit

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.680 
get into a server where I get one hit
kill<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:42.920> few<00:03:43.160> times<00:03:43.430> or<00:03:43.700> not<00:03:44.209> seeing<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.570> hit

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
kill a few times or not seeing the hit

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.479 
kill a few times or not seeing the hit
markers<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.140> should<00:03:45.380> be<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.739> will<00:03:46.310> leave

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
markers I should be I will leave

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.330 
markers I should be I will leave
immediately<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.510> try<00:03:47.930> another<00:03:48.380> server<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:49.100> I

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
immediately and try another server and I

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.100 
immediately and try another server and I
will<00:03:49.459> keep<00:03:49.700> trying<00:03:49.970> another<00:03:50.269> server<00:03:50.570> until<00:03:50.989> I

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
will keep trying another server until I

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.140 
will keep trying another server until I
get<00:03:51.290> into<00:03:51.500> one<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:51.890> feels<00:03:52.280> right<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.820> get<00:03:53.030> in

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
get into one that feels right I get in

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.060 
get into one that feels right I get in
do<00:03:53.300> you<00:03:53.750> see<00:03:53.930> exactly<00:03:54.380> what<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:54.709> expect<00:03:55.010> to
