actually<00:00:15.719> opens<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> place<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.590> you

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
actually opens to the place that you

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.609 
actually opens to the place that you
last<00:00:17.010> closed<00:00:17.600> so<00:00:18.600> if<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.779> go<00:00:18.900> ahead<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.260> zoom<00:00:19.410> up

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
last closed so if I go ahead and zoom up

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.990 
last closed so if I go ahead and zoom up
to<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.340> United<00:00:20.609> States<00:00:21.470> close<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.250> launch

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
to the United States close it and launch

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000 
to the United States close it and launch
it<00:00:24.210> again<00:00:24.420> it'll<00:00:25.380> pull<00:00:25.590> up<00:00:25.680> right<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.949> that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it again it'll pull up right in that

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.290 
it again it'll pull up right in that
area<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:29.310> big<00:00:29.490> Bell<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.849> whistle<00:00:29.970> that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
area so the big Bell and whistle that

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.600 
area so the big Bell and whistle that
came<00:00:30.480> from<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.779> new<00:00:30.990> version<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.619> this

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
came from this new version is this

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.709 
came from this new version is this
virtual<00:00:33.480> globe<00:00:33.960> 3d<00:00:34.710> globe<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.579> I'm<00:00:36.450> actually

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
virtual globe 3d globe and I'm actually

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
virtual globe 3d globe and I'm actually
not<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.050> big<00:00:37.230> fan<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.100> don't<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
not a big fan of it I don't think the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.000 
not a big fan of it I don't think the
graphics<00:00:39.000> are<00:00:39.390> particularly<00:00:39.930> nice<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.829> not

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
graphics are particularly nice it's not

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.639 
graphics are particularly nice it's not
very<00:00:41.280> responsive<00:00:44.930> zoom<00:00:45.930> around<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.440> it's

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
very responsive zoom around here it's

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.619 
very responsive zoom around here it's
not<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> one-to-one<00:00:47.430> change<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.480> see

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
not a one-to-one change as you can see

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.900 
not a one-to-one change as you can see
if<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.870> push<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.440> little<00:00:49.649> bit<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.520> moves<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
if I push just a little bit it moves a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.869 
if I push just a little bit it moves a
lot<00:00:51.170> also<00:00:52.170> when<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.280> globe<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
lot also when you have a globe like this

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.510 
lot also when you have a globe like this
you'd<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.300> spin<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> spinning

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
you'd like to spin it and the spinning

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.340 
you'd like to spin it and the spinning
mechanics<00:00:56.520> aren't<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:56.879> intuitive<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.109> I'm

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
mechanics aren't very intuitive so I'm

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
mechanics aren't very intuitive so I'm
really<00:00:58.620> not<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> fan<00:01:00.109> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:02.940> ahead

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
really not a fan and then as I go ahead

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
really not a fan and then as I go ahead
and<00:01:03.120> zoom<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> other<00:01:04.650> pet<00:01:04.920> peeve

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and zoom in this is the other pet peeve

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
and zoom in this is the other pet peeve
and<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.180> biggest<00:01:06.540> complaint<00:01:06.960> from

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and this is the biggest complaint from

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.690 
and this is the biggest complaint from
the<00:01:07.229> previous<00:01:07.619> version<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> was<00:01:08.130> not<00:01:08.369> fixed

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the previous version that was not fixed

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.539 
the previous version that was not fixed
is<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.930> no<00:01:10.140> control<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.860> user<00:01:11.130> when

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
is that you have no control as user when

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.780 
is that you have no control as user when
it<00:01:11.670> switches<00:01:11.970> versions<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> map<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
it switches versions of the map and

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.649 
it switches versions of the map and
eventually<00:01:14.790> i<00:01:15.320> zoom<00:01:16.320> into<00:01:16.470> Chicago<00:01:17.040> here<00:01:17.659> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
eventually i zoom into Chicago here it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.620 
eventually i zoom into Chicago here it
defaults<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> road<00:01:20.070> map<00:01:23.240> where<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.330> just

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
defaults to a road map where it just

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
defaults to a road map where it just
really<00:01:24.960> isn't<00:01:25.200> all<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.500> interesting

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
really isn't all that interesting

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.899 
really isn't all that interesting
I'd<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.689> rather<00:01:27.750> give<00:01:28.170> my<00:01:28.350> road<00:01:29.100> maps<00:01:29.340> from

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
I'd much rather give my road maps from

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.280 
I'd much rather give my road maps from
someone<00:01:30.329> aside<00:01:30.570> from<00:01:30.720> National<00:01:31.049> Geographic

the other issue that I have with this
version<00:01:36.930> 2.0<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.619> consistency<00:01:38.280> I'll<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.420> ahead

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

you<00:01:45.869> notice<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.290> couple<00:01:46.439> grey<00:01:47.100> spots<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:48.060> one

depends<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> size<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.560> scale<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.220> we

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
depends on the size and scale and if we

depends on the size and scale and if we
can<00:02:08.459> fit<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.849> we'll<00:02:09.030> do<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.780> just

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
can fit it in we'll do it that just

can fit it in we'll do it that just
doesn't<00:02:10.170> make<00:02:10.379> sense<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.099> pointed<00:02:11.700> out<00:02:11.790> that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
doesn't make sense I pointed out that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.520 
doesn't make sense I pointed out that
that's<00:02:12.090> not<00:02:12.270> what<00:02:12.420> they<00:02:12.510> did<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.810> Kosovo<00:02:13.319> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that's not what they did with Kosovo and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.760 
that's not what they did with Kosovo and
that's

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650 
that's
not<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.070> they<00:02:14.190> did<00:02:14.250> here<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.420> I'll<00:02:15.510> go<00:02:15.630> ahead

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
not what they did here so I'll go ahead

of course that doesn't bode well okay so

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.370 
of course that doesn't bode well okay so

takes us there and we'll click and hold
and<00:03:18.770> this<00:03:19.770> is<00:03:19.920> one<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.190> nice<00:03:20.370> features<00:03:20.790> it

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
and this is one of the nice features it

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.120 
and this is one of the nice features it
actually<00:03:21.209> brings<00:03:21.450> up<00:03:21.690> Libya<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.470> flag<00:03:22.709> lots

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
actually brings up Libya the flag lots

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.120 
actually brings up Libya the flag lots
of<00:03:23.310> information<00:03:24.120> on<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.470> country<00:03:25.650> itself

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
of information on the country itself

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.090 
of information on the country itself
which<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.459> pretty<00:03:26.640> nice<00:03:27.140> but<00:03:28.140> what<00:03:28.860> they<00:03:29.040> do

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
which is pretty nice but what they do

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.420 
which is pretty nice but what they do
with<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:29.970> particular<00:03:30.209> zoom<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.430> just

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
with it this particular zoom is just

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.590 
with it this particular zoom is just
drop<00:03:32.670> polygon<00:03:33.270> around<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.810> country<00:03:34.230> and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
drop polygon around the country and

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.760 
drop polygon around the country and
instead<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.750> actually<00:03:37.140> pulling<00:03:37.440> out<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
instead of actually pulling out the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.430 
instead of actually pulling out the
actual<00:03:38.040> features<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.090> Athens<00:03:39.660> right<00:03:40.170> here

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
actual features and so Athens right here

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.840 
actual features and so Athens right here
is<00:03:40.650> actually<00:03:41.010> showing<00:03:41.190> grayed<00:03:41.490> out<00:03:41.520> because

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
is actually showing grayed out because

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.530 
is actually showing grayed out because
it's<00:03:42.120> not<00:03:42.270> within<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.850> lines<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.120> polygon

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
it's not within the lines of the polygon

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.300 
it's not within the lines of the polygon
of<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.750> country<00:03:46.110> it<00:03:46.500> just<00:03:46.680> really<00:03:46.860> seems<00:03:47.130> like

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
of the country it just really seems like

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.470 
of the country it just really seems like
a<00:03:47.720> lazy<00:03:50.330> lazily<00:03:51.330> put<00:03:51.540> together<00:03:51.690> map<00:03:52.520> so<00:03:53.520> it's

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
a lazy lazily put together map so it's

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.940 
a lazy lazily put together map so it's
still<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> great<00:03:54.900> resource<00:03:55.350> there's<00:03:55.650> lots<00:03:55.830> of

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
still a great resource there's lots of

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.100 
still a great resource there's lots of
good<00:03:56.100> information<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.240> it's<00:03:57.930> still

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
good information on it and it's still

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.900 
good information on it and it's still
National<00:03:58.530> Geographic<00:03:58.800> maps<00:03:59.280> which<00:03:59.580> are<00:03:59.700> just

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
National Geographic maps which are just

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.820 
National Geographic maps which are just
always<00:04:00.090> great<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.570> look<00:04:00.690> at<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.140> there's<00:04:01.770> a

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
always great to look at but there's a

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.680 
always great to look at but there's a
lot<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.490> improvement<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.090> they<00:04:03.300> could<00:04:03.480> do

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
lot of improvement that they could do

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.080 
lot of improvement that they could do
and<00:04:03.990> I<00:04:04.230> hope<00:04:04.410> when<00:04:04.980> version<00:04:05.310> 3.0<00:04:05.790> finally

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
and I hope when version 3.0 finally

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.620 
and I hope when version 3.0 finally
comes<00:04:06.270> out<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:07.110> they<00:04:07.350> adjust<00:04:08.100> this<00:04:08.630> Auto

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
comes out that they adjust this Auto

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.500 
comes out that they adjust this Auto
scale<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.860> we<00:04:10.950> can<00:04:11.070> actually<00:04:11.250> zoom<00:04:11.610> in<00:04:12.330> a

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
scale and so we can actually zoom in a
