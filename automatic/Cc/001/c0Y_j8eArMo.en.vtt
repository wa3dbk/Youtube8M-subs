but<00:00:00.420> if<00:00:00.659> you<00:00:01.020> wanted<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.319> actually<00:00:01.410> create<00:00:01.860> a

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
but if you wanted to actually create a

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:10.400 
but if you wanted to actually create a
controller<00:00:06.799> to<00:00:07.799> do<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.069> same<00:00:08.280> thing<00:00:09.050> I'll<00:00:10.050> do

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
controller to do the same thing I'll do

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.440 
controller to do the same thing I'll do
that<00:00:10.440> with<00:00:10.679> this<00:00:10.710> joint<00:00:11.160> now<00:00:11.280> what<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.240> can

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
that with this joint now what I can

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.490 
that with this joint now what I can
actually<00:00:12.809> do<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:14.389> have<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> second<00:00:15.870> node<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.350> can

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
actually do is have a second node we can

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.519 
actually do is have a second node we can
have<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> group<00:00:16.949> note<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.400> does<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:17.789> us

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
have a group note that does this for us

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.529 
have a group note that does this for us
that<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.619> kind<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.859> hides<00:00:20.130> those<00:00:20.539> translate

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that it kind of hides those translate

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.339 
that it kind of hides those translate
values<00:00:21.920> ok<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:22.980> I'm<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> create<00:00:24.740> another

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
values ok so I'm going to create another

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.759 
values ok so I'm going to create another
circle<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:30.170> what<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.470> do<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.679> I'm

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
circle and what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.290 
circle and what I'm going to do is I'm
actually<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> group<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.940> itself

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
actually going to group it to itself

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.780 
actually going to group it to itself
okay<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.770> I'm<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> hit<00:00:35.250> command<00:00:35.399> G

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
okay so I'm just going to hit command G

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.479 
okay so I'm just going to hit command G
and<00:00:36.120> now<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:36.989> group<00:00:37.290> one

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
and now you can see we have group one

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.709 
and now you can see we have group one
and<00:00:38.489> normally<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> be<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.360> along

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and normally you want to be going along

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.240 
and normally you want to be going along
and<00:00:41.030> naming<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.329> stuff<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.070> just<00:00:44.070> for

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and naming all this stuff but just for

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.450 
and naming all this stuff but just for
speeding<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.289> tutorial<00:00:46.309> we'll<00:00:47.309> just

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
speeding up this tutorial we'll just

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.529 
speeding up this tutorial we'll just
kind<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.640> breeze<00:00:47.850> through<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.120> or<00:00:48.210> renaming

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
kind of breeze through with or renaming

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.510 
kind of breeze through with or renaming
ok<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.379> now<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.100> nervous

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
ok so now you can see I have nervous

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.430 
ok so now you can see I have nervous
circle<00:00:50.850> under<00:00:51.000> group<00:00:51.300> 1<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:51.719> remember<00:00:52.199> this

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
circle under group 1 now remember this

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
circle under group 1 now remember this
is<00:00:52.500> different<00:00:52.860> than<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> shapes<00:00:53.550> ok<00:00:54.090> because

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
is different than the shapes ok because

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
is different than the shapes ok because
we<00:00:54.420> still<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> shape<00:00:55.110> node<00:00:55.320> under<00:00:55.469> this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
we still have the shape node under this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.189 
we still have the shape node under this
nerve<00:00:55.949> circle<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:57.210> groups<00:00:57.480> allow<00:00:57.719> us<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.020> do

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
nerve circle what groups allow us to do

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.160 
nerve circle what groups allow us to do
is<00:00:58.730> preserve<00:00:59.730> whatever<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.539> underneath<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
is preserve whatever is underneath it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.670 
is preserve whatever is underneath it
right<00:01:01.710> basically<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.699> um<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.500> good<00:01:04.500> analogy

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
right basically it's um a good analogy

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.520 
right basically it's um a good analogy
of<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.939> imagine<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> nerve<00:01:06.990> circle<00:01:07.439> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
of this is imagine the nerve circle is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 
of this is imagine the nerve circle is
somebody<00:01:07.860> writing<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.250> bus<00:01:08.460> ok<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.689> bus<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
somebody writing a bus ok and the bus is

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.539 
somebody writing a bus ok and the bus is
the<00:01:10.260> group<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.189> wherever<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.520> group<00:01:11.760> goes

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
the group so wherever the group goes

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.390 
the group so wherever the group goes
right<00:01:14.549> where<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> bus<00:01:15.150> goes<00:01:15.420> being<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> group

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
right where the bus goes being the group

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
right where the bus goes being the group
ok<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:18.450> moving<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.689> group<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> nerve

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
ok you see I'm moving to group the nerve

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.870 
ok you see I'm moving to group the nerve
circle<00:01:19.770> actually<00:01:20.040> goes<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
circle actually goes with it and the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.600 
circle actually goes with it and the
nerves<00:01:21.090> circle<00:01:21.570> stays<00:01:22.259> relative<00:01:22.860> ok<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.490> can

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
nerves circle stays relative ok you can

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.940 
nerves circle stays relative ok you can
see<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.820> values<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.390> change<00:01:24.710> okay<00:01:25.710> because

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
see as values do not change okay because

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.090 
see as values do not change okay because
we're<00:01:26.070> affecting<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.759> parent<00:01:27.229> ok<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:29.009> what

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
we're affecting the parent ok so what

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
we're affecting the parent ok so what
I'm<00:01:29.220> actually<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.240> similar

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
I'm actually going to do here is similar

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.350 
I'm actually going to do here is similar
to<00:01:31.140> how<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.320> first<00:01:31.740> did<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.759> I'm<00:01:32.970> going<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
to how we first did this I'm going to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.700 
to how we first did this I'm going to
select<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:35.549> group<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.200> then<00:01:37.200> I'm<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
select the group and then I'm going to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.190 
select the group and then I'm going to
shift<00:01:37.979> select<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:39.000> joint<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.710> hip<00:01:40.860> parent

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
shift select this joint and hip parent

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.810 
shift select this joint and hip parent
ok<00:01:43.200> now<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.860> automatically<00:01:44.250> takes<00:01:44.520> us<00:01:44.670> back

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
ok now this automatically takes us back

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.730 
ok now this automatically takes us back
to<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> group<00:01:45.270> node<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.530> actually

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
to the group node if you actually

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649 
to the group node if you actually
deselect<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> group<00:01:47.909> known<00:01:48.119> what<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.570> do

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
deselect the group known what you can do

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.910 
deselect the group known what you can do
is<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.899> go<00:01:49.020> into<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> old<00:01:49.439> liner<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
is you can go into the old liner and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.709 
is you can go into the old liner and
just<00:01:50.729> find<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:53.000> under<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.180> joint<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:56.719> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
just find just under this joint here and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.539 
just find just under this joint here and
also<00:01:57.840> hit<00:01:58.049> frame<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.740> hit<00:01:58.890> F<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.430> your

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
also hit frame if you hit F on your

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.149 
also hit frame if you hit F on your
keyboard<00:01:59.729> it'll<00:02:00.119> it'll<00:02:00.659> reveal<00:02:01.320> whatever

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
keyboard it'll it'll reveal whatever

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.470 
keyboard it'll it'll reveal whatever
we're<00:02:02.399> looking<00:02:02.430> for

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.410 

okay<00:02:07.480> so<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.310> highlight<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.789> curve<00:02:10.030> you

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
okay so if you highlight the curve you

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.000 
okay so if you highlight the curve you
press<00:02:10.630> up<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:11.020> your<00:02:11.170> keyboard<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.740> will<00:02:11.860> take

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
press up on your keyboard that will take

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.190 
press up on your keyboard that will take
you<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.310> group<00:02:12.490> node<00:02:12.760> okay<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.930> then<00:02:14.050> we

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
you to the group node okay and then we

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.290 
you to the group node okay and then we
can<00:02:14.320> head<00:02:14.440> F<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.800> here<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.820> will<00:02:15.940> show<00:02:16.150> it

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
can head F in here and that will show it

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.660 
can head F in here and that will show it
okay<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.290> now<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.650> can<00:02:17.920> see<00:02:18.040> it's<00:02:18.160> parented<00:02:18.640> to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
okay so now you can see it's parented to

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.820 
okay so now you can see it's parented to
this<00:02:19.000> choice<00:02:19.210> if<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.510> actually<00:02:19.690> move<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.290> join

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
this choice if I actually move this join

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.300 
this choice if I actually move this join
round<00:02:21.070> or<00:02:21.340> rotate<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.720> see<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.320> it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
round or rotate it you can see that it

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.160 
round or rotate it you can see that it
moves<00:02:24.490> with<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:25.750> I'm<00:02:25.810> going<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.960> do<00:02:26.080> is

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
moves with it so what I'm going to do is

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.270 
moves with it so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:26.230> going<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.380> highlight<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.860> group<00:02:27.040> node

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
I'm going to highlight the group node

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.730 
I'm going to highlight the group node
again<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.390> can<00:02:28.510> either<00:02:28.600> do<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.960> nail<00:02:29.500> liner

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
again you can either do that nail liner

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.060 
again you can either do that nail liner
or<00:02:30.010> selected<00:02:30.430> here<00:02:30.550> press<00:02:30.880> up<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.800> move<00:02:32.800> up<00:02:32.920> the

unpaired okay can also go edit unpaired
down<00:02:47.470> here<00:02:47.709> should<00:02:48.280> be<00:02:48.630> ok<00:02:49.630> now<00:02:49.870> I'm<00:02:50.230> going<00:02:50.350> to

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
down here should be ok now I'm going to

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.680 
down here should be ok now I'm going to
do<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.650> I'm<00:02:50.739> just<00:02:50.800> going<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.070> take<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.690> group

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
do is I'm just going to take the group

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.420 
do is I'm just going to take the group
node<00:02:52.930> here<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.560> I'm<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:53.980> going<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.250> rotate

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
node here and I'm just going to rotate

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.940 
node here and I'm just going to rotate
it<00:02:56.580> 90<00:02:57.989> like<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.370> okay<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:01.830> important<00:03:02.830> thing

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
it 90 like that okay and important thing

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.130 
it 90 like that okay and important thing
now<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.400> we<00:03:03.610> do<00:03:03.910> not<00:03:03.940> freeze<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.900> group

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
now is that we do not freeze the group

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.979 
now is that we do not freeze the group
node<00:03:05.459> okay<00:03:06.459> so<00:03:06.970> we're<00:03:07.090> only<00:03:07.209> manipulating<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
node okay so we're only manipulating the

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.210 
node okay so we're only manipulating the
group<00:03:08.170> node<00:03:08.380> right<00:03:08.530> now<00:03:08.709> if<00:03:08.830> you<00:03:08.920> you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
group node right now if you you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.650 
group node right now if you you
shouldn't<00:03:09.520> have<00:03:09.550> any<00:03:09.640> values<00:03:10.209> on<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.390> nerves

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
shouldn't have any values on the nerves

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.789 
shouldn't have any values on the nerves
circle<00:03:11.170> just<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.160> group<00:03:12.400> node<00:03:13.110> okay<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.320> so

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
circle just the group node okay and so

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:15.780 
circle just the group node okay and so
now<00:03:14.950> what<00:03:15.100> we're<00:03:15.250> going<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.430> do<00:03:15.580> is<00:03:15.670> we're

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
now what we're going to do is we're

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.610 
now what we're going to do is we're
actually<00:03:15.910> going<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:18.480> parent<00:03:19.480> constrain<00:03:19.930> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
actually going to parent constrain the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.820 
actually going to parent constrain the
joint<00:03:22.709> okay<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:25.510> nerve<00:03:25.690> circle<00:03:26.200> not<00:03:26.620> the

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
joint okay to the nerve circle not the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.440 
joint okay to the nerve circle not the
group<00:03:27.070> okay<00:03:27.790> because<00:03:27.970> we<00:03:28.060> still<00:03:28.209> want<00:03:28.390> to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
group okay because we still want to

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.170 
group okay because we still want to
build<00:03:28.600> us<00:03:28.720> like<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.860> circle<00:03:30.820> to

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
build us like this this circle to

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.780 
build us like this this circle to
control<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:31.780> I'm<00:03:31.870> going<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.049> highlight<00:03:32.790> the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
control it so I'm going to highlight the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.650 
control it so I'm going to highlight the
joint<00:03:35.730> okay<00:03:36.730> or<00:03:36.910> actually<00:03:37.090> highlight<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
joint okay or actually highlight the

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.310 
joint okay or actually highlight the
curve<00:03:37.930> just<00:03:38.739> like<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.010> joint<00:03:39.480> constrain<00:03:40.480> parent

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
curve just like a joint constrain parent

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.310 
curve just like a joint constrain parent
okay<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:43.000> now<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.180> can<00:03:43.299> see<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.510> if<00:03:43.780> i<00:03:43.900> rotate

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
okay so now you can see that if i rotate

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.759 
okay so now you can see that if i rotate
this<00:03:44.910> it<00:03:45.910> affects<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.390> joint<00:03:46.720> its<00:03:47.260> values<00:03:47.620> are

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
this it affects the joint its values are

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.729 
this it affects the joint its values are
0<00:03:47.799> but<00:03:48.730> it's<00:03:49.000> on<00:03:49.209> that<00:03:49.420> axis<00:03:49.680> okay<00:03:50.680> so

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
0 but it's on that axis okay so

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.500 
0 but it's on that axis okay so
everything<00:03:51.190> from<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.670> group<00:03:51.880> note<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.360> now

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
everything from that group note is now

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.090 
everything from that group note is now
cycling<00:03:53.200> down<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.930> child<00:03:56.230> but<00:03:56.830> we<00:03:56.920> don't

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
cycling down to the child but we don't

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.340 
cycling down to the child but we don't
have<00:03:57.250> those<00:03:57.370> values<00:03:57.820> but<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.209> takes<00:03:58.420> on<00:03:58.720> that

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
have those values but it takes on that

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.670 
have those values but it takes on that
orientation<00:04:00.360> okay<00:04:01.360> now<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.170> other<00:04:02.410> thing<00:04:02.500> you

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
orientation okay now the other thing you

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.289 
orientation okay now the other thing you
have<00:04:02.890> to<00:04:02.920> be<00:04:03.100> careful<00:04:03.250> when<00:04:03.549> you<00:04:03.670> do<00:04:03.880> this<00:04:04.060> sort

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
have to be careful when you do this sort

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.319 
have to be careful when you do this sort
of<00:04:04.390> control<00:04:04.810> system<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.410> if<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.700> now<00:04:06.880> pull<00:04:07.209> this

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
of control system is if I now pull this

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.289 
of control system is if I now pull this
away<00:04:07.690> okay<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:08.650> can<00:04:08.829> see<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.489> joint<00:04:10.150> is

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
away okay you can see that that joint is

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.680 
away okay you can see that that joint is
locked<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:11.079> this<00:04:11.230> controller<00:04:12.450> so<00:04:13.450> what<00:04:13.600> we

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
locked to this controller so what we

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.180 
locked to this controller so what we
have<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.900> do<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.620> make<00:04:15.040> sure<00:04:15.069> we<00:04:15.430> attach

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
have to do is make sure we attach

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.750 
have to do is make sure we attach
now<00:04:16.280> this<00:04:16.940> control<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:19.070> rest<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.670> the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
now this control to the rest of the

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.400 
now this control to the rest of the
joints<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.110> it<00:04:21.230> moves<00:04:21.410> with<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.950> okay<00:04:23.410> so

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
joints so that it moves with it okay so

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.600 
joints so that it moves with it okay so
what<00:04:24.530> I'm<00:04:24.620> going<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.770> do<00:04:24.950> is<00:04:25.070> you<00:04:25.280> got<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.520> make

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
what I'm going to do is you got to make

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.160 
what I'm going to do is you got to make
sure<00:04:25.850> that<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.060> attach<00:04:26.420> it<00:04:26.450> to<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.930> next

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
sure that you attach it to the next

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.370 
sure that you attach it to the next
joint<00:04:27.710> up<00:04:28.510> okay<00:04:29.510> and<00:04:29.690> what<00:04:29.840> we're<00:04:29.960> going<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.260> do

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
joint up okay and what we're going to do

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.260 
joint up okay and what we're going to do
is<00:04:30.500> we're<00:04:30.620> actually<00:04:30.710> going<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.130> take<00:04:31.400> this

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
is we're actually going to take this

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.950 
is we're actually going to take this
joint<00:04:32.690> joint<00:04:33.200> too<00:04:33.820> okay<00:04:34.820> not<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.480> controller

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
joint joint too okay not the controller

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.620 
joint joint too okay not the controller
if<00:04:36.320> you<00:04:36.560> use<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.770> controller<00:04:37.280> system<00:04:37.850> okay

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
if you use a controller system okay

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.910 
if you use a controller system okay
we're<00:04:38.870> just<00:04:38.900> going<00:04:39.170> to<00:04:39.200> take<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:41.920> joint

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
we're just going to take the joint

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.900 
we're just going to take the joint
itself<00:04:43.840> okay<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.050> I'm<00:04:45.170> going<00:04:45.290> to<00:04:45.350> take

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
itself okay and I'm going to take

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.010 
itself okay and I'm going to take
command<00:04:46.910> click<00:04:47.360> on<00:04:47.600> group<00:04:48.560> 1<00:04:49.480> i'm<00:04:50.480> going<00:04:50.780> to<00:04:50.870> go

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
command click on group 1 i'm going to go

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.100 
command click on group 1 i'm going to go
constrain<00:04:51.620> parent<00:04:55.210> okay<00:04:56.210> so<00:04:56.270> now<00:04:56.570> that<00:04:56.600> will

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
constrain parent okay so now that will

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.550 
constrain parent okay so now that will
go<00:04:57.340> wherever<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:59.420> hand<00:04:59.660> goes<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.230> if<00:05:00.320> i<00:05:00.410> were

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
go wherever the hand goes and if i were

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.480 
go wherever the hand goes and if i were
to<00:05:00.710> rotate<00:05:00.860> this<00:05:01.400> joint<00:05:03.070> you<00:05:04.070> can<00:05:04.220> see<00:05:04.460> that

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
to rotate this joint you can see that

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.150 
to rotate this joint you can see that
the<00:05:05.330> control<00:05:05.750> moves<00:05:06.080> with<00:05:06.320> it<00:05:07.390> and<00:05:09.040> so<00:05:10.040> does

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
the control moves with it and so does

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.810 
the control moves with it and so does
this<00:05:10.220> one<00:05:11.530> okay<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:12.590> now<00:05:12.950> we<00:05:13.010> can<00:05:13.280> still<00:05:13.550> have

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
this one okay so now we can still have

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.300 
this one okay so now we can still have
that<00:05:14.530> controller<00:05:15.530> that<00:05:15.800> has<00:05:15.980> these<00:05:16.160> nice

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
that controller that has these nice

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.500 
that controller that has these nice
clean<00:05:16.610> value<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.060> everything<00:05:17.390> is<00:05:17.480> zeroed

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
clean value that everything is zeroed

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.440 
clean value that everything is zeroed
out<00:05:18.280> okay<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:20.440> it<00:05:21.440> still<00:05:21.860> has<00:05:22.450> that

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
out okay and it still has that

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.480 
out okay and it still has that
rotational<00:05:23.930> axis<00:05:24.350> so<00:05:24.890> again<00:05:25.040> we<00:05:25.190> have<00:05:25.340> those

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
rotational axis so again we have those

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.770 
rotational axis so again we have those
three<00:05:25.820> different<00:05:26.180> methods<00:05:26.330> right<00:05:27.290> we<00:05:27.440> have

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
three different methods right we have

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.890 
three different methods right we have
the<00:05:29.780> actual<00:05:29.930> joint<00:05:31.090> display<00:05:32.090> handle<00:05:32.480> okay

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
the actual joint display handle okay

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.409 
the actual joint display handle okay
again<00:05:33.140> that's<00:05:33.350> in<00:05:33.500> your<00:05:33.650> attribute<00:05:34.040> editor

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
again that's in your attribute editor

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.170 
again that's in your attribute editor
display<00:05:35.419> handle<00:05:35.810> turn<00:05:36.350> that<00:05:36.470> on<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:36.680> off<00:05:37.180> we

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
display handle turn that on and off we

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.690 
display handle turn that on and off we
can<00:05:38.300> parent<00:05:38.720> the<00:05:39.110> shape<00:05:39.500> of<00:05:39.770> a<00:05:40.100> curve<00:05:40.370> to<00:05:40.400> a

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
can parent the shape of a curve to a

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.650 
can parent the shape of a curve to a
joint<00:05:41.860> okay<00:05:42.860> so<00:05:42.919> now<00:05:43.220> that<00:05:43.250> that<00:05:44.030> shape<00:05:44.360> now<00:05:44.540> is

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
joint okay so now that that shape now is

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.560 
joint okay so now that that shape now is
actually<00:05:44.810> part<00:05:45.200> of<00:05:45.290> that<00:05:45.470> joint<00:05:48.700> okay<00:05:49.700> or<00:05:49.970> we

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
actually part of that joint okay or we

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.790 
actually part of that joint okay or we
can<00:05:50.660> create<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:51.020> separate<00:05:51.470> controller<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:54.620> we

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
can create a separate controller that we

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.850 
can create a separate controller that we
can<00:05:54.980> now<00:05:55.100> use<00:05:56.080> that<00:05:57.080> is<00:05:57.200> not<00:05:57.350> part<00:05:57.740> of<00:05:57.830> that

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
can now use that is not part of that

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.250 
can now use that is not part of that
joint
