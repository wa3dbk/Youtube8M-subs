alright the half-cab kickflip to do the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.880 
alright the half-cab kickflip to do the
half-cab<00:00:04.020> kickflip<00:00:04.410> need<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.710> know<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:04.859> to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
half-cab kickflip need to know how to

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.810 
half-cab kickflip need to know how to
have<00:00:05.100> cad<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.779> kickflip<00:00:06.799> so<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.460> basic

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
have cad and kickflip so the basic

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.009 
have cad and kickflip so the basic
concept<00:00:09.300> it's<00:00:09.420> actually<00:00:09.719> pretty<00:00:09.900> easy

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
concept it's actually pretty easy

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.320 
concept it's actually pretty easy
they're<00:00:10.920> easier<00:00:11.219> than<00:00:11.370> backside<00:00:11.759> flip<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.240> you

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
they're easier than backside flip so you

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.539 
they're easier than backside flip so you
don't<00:00:12.480> need<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> know<00:00:12.840> those<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:14.309> want<00:00:14.490> to

your body spinning with the board as it
rotates<00:01:35.010> you<00:01:35.670> want<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:35.970> sure<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> keep

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
rotates you want to make sure you keep

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.200 
rotates you want to make sure you keep
your<00:01:36.509> body<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> board<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.740> times

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
your body with the board at all times

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.040 
your body with the board at all times
another<00:01:39.210> problem<00:01:39.330> is<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.690> want<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> rotate

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
another problem is you want to rotate

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.630 
another problem is you want to rotate
that's<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.649> because<00:01:40.979> you're<00:01:41.220> not<00:01:41.310> flicking

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
that's just because you're not flicking

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.920 
that's just because you're not flicking
hard<00:01:41.820> enough<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.149> move<00:01:42.300> your<00:01:42.330> foot<00:01:42.509> back<00:01:42.660> more

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
hard enough so move your foot back more

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.580 
hard enough so move your foot back more
to<00:01:43.530> help<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.479> overcompensate<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.660> and<00:01:45.869> if

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to help that overcompensate that and if

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950 
to help that overcompensate that and if
the<00:01:46.710> boards<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> sort<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.810> popping<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the boards to sort of popping and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.660 
the boards to sort of popping and
clicking<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.410> rocketing<00:01:49.890> out<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.250> way<00:01:50.399> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
clicking and rocketing out that way you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.930 
clicking and rocketing out that way you
want<00:01:51.660> to<00:01:51.750> try<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.960> UM<00:01:52.320> pop<00:01:53.100> back<00:01:53.550> more

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
want to try to UM pop back more

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.870 
want to try to UM pop back more
backwards<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.660> hang<00:01:55.190> because<00:01:56.190> when<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.729> do

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
backwards and hang because when you do

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.510 
backwards and hang because when you do
that<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.390> causes<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.990> board<00:01:58.289> to<00:01:58.979> spin<00:01:59.340> with

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that it causes the board to spin with

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.650 
that it causes the board to spin with
your<00:01:59.670> body<00:01:59.910> so<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.270> when<00:02:00.479> you're<00:02:00.539> rolling

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
your body so that when you're rolling

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.170 
your body so that when you're rolling
fakie<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.259> pot<00:02:01.500> will<00:02:02.130> call<00:02:02.369> not<00:02:02.610> naturally

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
fakie the pot will call not naturally

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.060 
fakie the pot will call not naturally
that<00:02:03.390> way<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> pop<00:02:04.410> straight<00:02:04.649> down<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that way if you pop straight down the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.890 
that way if you pop straight down the
boards<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.610> sort<00:02:07.009> over

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
boards it's going to sort over

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.300 
boards it's going to sort over
so<00:02:09.900> what<00:02:10.230> you<00:02:10.320> really<00:02:10.770> want<00:02:10.980> to<00:02:11.010> make<00:02:11.130> sure<00:02:11.160> you
