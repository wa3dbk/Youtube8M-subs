you now need to pull the wrist loop up
through<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> double<00:00:11.730> loop<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.599> place<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.259> on

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
through the double loop and place it on

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.369 
through the double loop and place it on
the<00:00:13.440> index<00:00:13.799> finger<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.340> same<00:00:14.849> hand<00:00:15.389> here
