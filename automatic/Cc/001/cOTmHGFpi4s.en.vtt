00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.600 
every game deserves a chance i give
starcraft<00:01:30.260> 2<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.470> chance<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.040> it<00:01:31.100> just<00:01:31.250> wasn't

starcraft 2 a chance and it just wasn't

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.910 
starcraft 2 a chance and it just wasn't

sophisticated piece of technology such

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.600 
sophisticated piece of technology such
as<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.630> game<00:02:26.870> because<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:27.410> really<00:02:27.650> really

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
as this game because it's really really

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.250 
as this game because it's really really
hard<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:29.090> program<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.020> little

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
hard to program I have a little

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.020 
hard to program I have a little
experience<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.950> programming<00:02:31.520> not<00:02:31.640> too<00:02:31.850> much

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
experience of programming not too much

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.750 
experience of programming not too much
but<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.840> could<00:02:33.440> not<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.740> imagine<00:02:34.280> it's<00:02:34.430> really

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
but I could not just imagine it's really

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.000 
but I could not just imagine it's really
hard<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.300> to<00:02:35.990> make<00:02:36.170> sure<00:02:36.320> everything's<00:02:36.830> right

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
hard to to make sure everything's right

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.070 
hard to to make sure everything's right
on<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.250> first<00:02:37.430> go<00:02:37.700> around<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.720> fact<00:02:38.930> that

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
on the first go around and the fact that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.960 
on the first go around and the fact that
they<00:02:39.740> listen<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.160> us<00:02:40.340> here<00:02:40.610> on<00:02:40.700> Twitter

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
they listen to us here on Twitter

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.670 
they listen to us here on Twitter
because<00:02:41.390> that's<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:41.900> way<00:02:42.080> we<00:02:42.110> can<00:02:42.350> get<00:02:42.560> to

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
because that's one way we can get to

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.490 
because that's one way we can get to
them<00:02:42.800> just<00:02:43.040> by<00:02:43.220> tweeting<00:02:43.580> at<00:02:43.820> them<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.290> guess<00:02:45.290> is

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
them just by tweeting at them I guess is

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.100 
them just by tweeting at them I guess is
that<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.980> terminology<00:02:46.810> tweeting<00:02:47.810> at<00:02:47.900> them

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
that the terminology tweeting at them

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.200 
that the terminology tweeting at them
but<00:02:48.320> but<00:02:49.070> yeah<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.310> mean<00:02:49.460> they<00:02:49.760> definitely

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
but but yeah I mean they definitely

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.550 
but but yeah I mean they definitely
listen<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.600> Twitter<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.080> that's<00:02:51.200> one<00:02:51.410> of<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
listen to Twitter and that's one of the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.910 
listen to Twitter and that's one of the
big<00:02:51.800> positives<00:02:52.490> so<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:53.570> next<00:02:53.600> positive<00:02:54.020> kind

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
big positives so the next positive kind

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.240 
big positives so the next positive kind
of<00:02:55.010> goes<00:02:55.130> back<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:56.090> me<00:02:56.750> as<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.140> gamer<00:02:57.590> I've

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
of goes back to to me as a gamer I've

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.800 
of goes back to to me as a gamer I've

for three years now and in the last game

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.410 
for three years now and in the last game
modern<00:03:03.320> warfare<00:03:03.530> 2<00:03:03.920> didn't<00:03:04.850> really<00:03:05.150> make<00:03:05.360> it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
modern warfare 2 didn't really make it

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.570 
modern warfare 2 didn't really make it

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
in a competitive gaming scene because of

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.310 
in a competitive gaming scene because of
some<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.910> reasons<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.390> mentioned<00:03:08.630> there

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
some of the reasons I mentioned there

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.380 
some of the reasons I mentioned there
were<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.530> lot<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.710> hacks<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.910> game<00:03:11.150> just

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
were a lot of hacks and the game just

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.060 
were a lot of hacks and the game just
wasn't<00:03:11.810> really<00:03:11.960> suited<00:03:12.320> for<00:03:12.530> major<00:03:12.830> league

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070

parte the founder and creator of this

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.960 
parte the founder and creator of this
game<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.440> think<00:03:55.010> that's<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.310> big<00:03:55.580> positive

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
game so I think that's a big positive

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.030 
game so I think that's a big positive
and<00:03:56.540> even<00:03:56.870> for<00:03:57.020> those<00:03:57.140> guys<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:57.770> don't

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
and even for those guys that don't

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.400 
and even for those guys that don't
really<00:03:58.250> play<00:03:58.640> in<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.880> competitive<00:03:59.390> scene<00:03:59.720> you

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
really play in the competitive scene you

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.800 
really play in the competitive scene you
guys<00:04:00.590> can<00:04:00.800> kind<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.130> rest<00:04:01.490> rest<00:04:01.940> assured<00:04:02.450> that

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
guys can kind of rest rest assured that

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.950 
guys can kind of rest rest assured that
they<00:04:03.470> still<00:04:03.770> made<00:04:04.070> a<00:04:04.100> good<00:04:04.340> game<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.210> I<00:04:05.750> think

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
they still made a good game and I think

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.450 
they still made a good game and I think
that's<00:04:06.110> one<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.530> standard<00:04:06.950> is<00:04:07.100> you<00:04:07.370> know

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
that's one of the standard is you know

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.060 
that's one of the standard is you know
did<00:04:07.670> it<00:04:07.700> go<00:04:07.880> major<00:04:08.120> league<00:04:08.420> or<00:04:08.630> not<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:09.800> anyways

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
did it go major league or not so anyways

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.890 
did it go major league or not so anyways
that's<00:04:10.310> one<00:04:10.580> of<00:04:10.670> my<00:04:10.760> pros<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.480> I<00:04:11.540> think<00:04:11.780> the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
that's one of my pros and I think the

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.900 
that's one of my pros and I think the
reason<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.650> did<00:04:12.860> go<00:04:13.070> professional<00:04:13.520> or

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
reason that it did go professional or

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.760 
reason that it did go professional or
whatever<00:04:14.150> again<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.990> terminology<00:04:15.590> for

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
whatever again the terminology for

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.490 
whatever again the terminology for
saying<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.250> went<00:04:16.820> major<00:04:17.120> league<00:04:17.480> just<00:04:18.170> doesn't

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
saying it went major league just doesn't

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.810 
saying it went major league just doesn't
make<00:04:18.590> sense<00:04:18.650> because<00:04:19.160> I'm<00:04:19.370> not<00:04:19.459> sure<00:04:19.670> if<00:04:19.730> you

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
make sense because I'm not sure if you

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.210 
make sense because I'm not sure if you
guys<00:04:19.910> are<00:04:20.060> familiar<00:04:20.180> with<00:04:20.480> that<00:04:20.980> but<00:04:21.980> I<00:04:22.040> think

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
guys are familiar with that but I think

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.520 
guys are familiar with that but I think
the<00:04:22.340> main<00:04:22.490> reason<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:23.120> did<00:04:23.360> was<00:04:24.290> because

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
the main reason that it did was because

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.680 
the main reason that it did was because
of<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.919> maps<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.550> maps<00:04:25.580> in<00:04:26.030> this<00:04:26.180> game<00:04:26.450> are

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
of the maps the maps in this game are

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.280 
of the maps the maps in this game are
great

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
great

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.100 
great
they're<00:04:27.560> really<00:04:27.880> or<00:04:28.880> at<00:04:29.390> least<00:04:29.420> what<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:29.900> look

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
they're really or at least what you look

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.980 
they're really or at least what you look
for<00:04:30.320> in<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.650> major<00:04:30.980> league<00:04:31.130> gaming<00:04:31.430> map<00:04:31.790> is<00:04:32.090> is

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
for in a major league gaming map is is

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.260 
for in a major league gaming map is is
it<00:04:33.170> symmetrical<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:33.980> is<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.250> lopsided<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:35.090> it

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
it symmetrical and is it lopsided so it

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.330 
it symmetrical and is it lopsided so it
has<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.480> be<00:04:35.750> symmetrical<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.950> can't<00:04:37.190> be

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
has to be symmetrical and it can't be

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.240 
has to be symmetrical and it can't be
lopsided<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.930> think<00:04:39.170> trev<00:04:39.620> really<00:04:40.070> did<00:04:40.220> a

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
lopsided and I think trev really did a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.820 
lopsided and I think trev really did a
good<00:04:40.460> job<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.730> doing<00:04:41.060> this<00:04:41.330> again<00:04:42.290> they<00:04:42.500> really

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
good job of doing this again they really

Maya<00:05:35.270> kill<00:05:35.570> streak<00:05:35.780> so<00:05:36.050> that<00:05:36.560> really<00:05:36.920> leads<00:05:37.250> to

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
Maya kill streak so that really leads to

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.220 
Maya kill streak so that really leads to
a<00:05:37.580> lot<00:05:37.910> of<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.120> higher<00:05:38.360> killstreaks<00:05:38.990> not

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
being called in as much because they're

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.640 
being called in as much because they're
just<00:05:41.360> harder<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.720> get<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.050> that<00:05:42.320> was<00:05:42.410> another

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
just harder to get and that was another

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.490 
just harder to get and that was another
positive<00:05:43.360> making<00:05:44.360> air<00:05:44.600> support<00:05:45.050> not<00:05:45.320> as
