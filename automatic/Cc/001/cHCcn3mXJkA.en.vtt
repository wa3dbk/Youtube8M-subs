now<00:00:00.539> one<00:00:01.140> of<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.410> things<00:00:01.680> that<00:00:01.920> you<00:00:02.129> will<00:00:02.399> find

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:03.259 
now one of the things that you will find

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.360 
now one of the things that you will find
which<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.440> quite<00:00:04.740> interesting<00:00:06.560> this<00:00:07.560> piston

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
which is quite interesting this piston

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.490 
which is quite interesting this piston
right<00:00:08.639> here<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.370> 1918<00:00:14.330> igniter<00:00:15.330> model<00:00:15.809> this

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
right here is a 1918 igniter model this

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.910 
right here is a 1918 igniter model this
one<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> later<00:00:17.460> model<00:00:18.390> igniter<00:00:18.930> model<00:00:20.779> the

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
one is a later model igniter model the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.290 
one is a later model igniter model the
the<00:00:22.920> difference<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:25.380> wrist<00:00:25.619> pin<00:00:26.300> that

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the difference is is the wrist pin that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.080 
the difference is is the wrist pin that
goes<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.050> piston<00:00:29.869> this<00:00:30.869> wrist<00:00:31.199> pin<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
goes in this piston this wrist pin and

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.770 
goes in this piston this wrist pin and
wrist<00:00:33.090> pin<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.510> goes<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.340> piston<00:00:35.340> are

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
wrist pin that goes in this piston are

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.889 
wrist pin that goes in this piston are
different<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.950> pistons<00:00:38.430> are<00:00:38.579> different<00:00:39.059> you

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
different the pistons are different you

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.760 
different the pistons are different you
will<00:00:40.620> find<00:00:40.950> three<00:00:42.020> you<00:00:43.020> will<00:00:43.140> find<00:00:43.410> three

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
will find three you will find three

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.500 
will find three you will find three
different<00:00:43.980> kinds<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.730> pistons<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.890> other<00:00:47.129> one

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
different kinds of pistons the other one

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.880 
different kinds of pistons the other one
being<00:00:48.739> this<00:00:49.739> spark<00:00:50.700> plug<00:00:50.760> model<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
difference between the two or this one

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.160 
difference between the two or this one
is<00:00:56.129> bigger<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.719> only<00:00:57.960> has<00:00:58.440> three<00:00:59.100> rings

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
is bigger and it only has three rings

is<00:01:07.770> no<00:01:08.119> valid<00:01:09.119> reason<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.130> leave<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.430> these

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
is no valid reason to leave one of these

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.499 
is no valid reason to leave one of these

just going to leave that with that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.630 
just going to leave that with that
that's<00:01:25.259> enough<00:01:25.619> that's<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:26.100> I'm<00:01:26.250> gonna<00:01:26.430> say

that's enough that's all I'm gonna say

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.050 
that's enough that's all I'm gonna say

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
in the piston here you would put it

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.330 
in the piston here you would put it
unplayed<00:02:55.390> cutter<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:56.630> here<00:02:56.989> in<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.069> cross

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.179 
these engines can you find any balancing
other<00:05:35.000> than<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.389> flat<00:05:36.839> wheels<00:05:37.080> so<00:05:37.589> I<00:05:37.620> assumed

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:38.189 
other than the flat wheels so I assumed

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:40.399 
other than the flat wheels so I assumed
and<00:05:38.550> but<00:05:38.819> they<00:05:38.939> were<00:05:39.000> low<00:05:39.300> they<00:05:39.839> were<00:05:39.900> low

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
and but they were low they were low

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.929 
and but they were low they were low
speed<00:05:41.009> engines<00:05:43.279> that's<00:05:44.279> another<00:05:44.580> thing<00:05:44.759> about

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:44.939 
speed engines that's another thing about

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.110 
speed engines that's another thing about
the<00:05:45.180> oils<00:05:45.629> for<00:05:45.870> these<00:05:46.110> engines<00:05:46.759> the<00:05:47.759> you<00:05:48.000> know

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
the oils for these engines the you know

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.800 
the oils for these engines the you know
basically<00:05:48.330> you<00:05:48.990> know<00:05:49.229> 600<00:05:49.710> rpm<00:05:50.360> 650<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.659> know

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
basically you know 600 rpm 650 you know

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.570 
basically you know 600 rpm 650 you know
that's<00:05:52.080> that's<00:05:52.529> about<00:05:52.740> what<00:05:52.949> these<00:05:53.129> engines

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
that's that's about what these engines

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.320 
that's that's about what these engines
run<00:05:53.819> and<00:05:54.180> most<00:05:54.930> most<00:05:55.469> of<00:05:55.740> the<00:05:55.800> owners<00:05:56.310> tends<00:05:56.969> to

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
run and most most of the owners tends to

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.369 
run and most most of the owners tends to
run<00:05:57.960> an<00:05:58.110> engine<00:05:58.289> slower<00:05:59.389> which<00:06:00.389> is<00:06:00.629> in<00:06:01.020> my

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
run an engine slower which is in my

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.689 
run an engine slower which is in my
opinion<00:06:02.009> the<00:06:02.460> correct<00:06:03.389> way<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:03.990> do<00:06:04.289> it<00:06:04.490> no<00:06:05.490> need

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
opinion the correct way to do it no need

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:11.740 
opinion the correct way to do it no need
to<00:06:05.789> over<00:06:06.120> run<00:06:06.300> an<00:06:06.449> engine<00:06:06.800> for<00:06:07.800> no<00:06:07.889> reason<00:06:08.689> the

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.379 

but<00:06:12.750> that<00:06:12.960> with<00:06:13.169> that<00:06:13.319> said<00:06:14.180> one<00:06:15.180> of<00:06:15.210> the

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
but that with that said one of the

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.579 
but that with that said one of the
reasons<00:06:15.779> that<00:06:15.839> I<00:06:16.020> that<00:06:16.770> I'm<00:06:17.009> at<00:06:17.789> the<00:06:18.149> old<00:06:18.589> you

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:19.589 
reasons that I that I'm at the old you

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:21.439 
reasons that I that I'm at the old you
need<00:06:19.889> a<00:06:19.919> different<00:06:20.430> grade<00:06:20.849> of<00:06:20.879> oil<00:06:21.149> a

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
need a different grade of oil a

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.980 
need a different grade of oil a
different<00:06:21.870> type<00:06:22.050> of<00:06:22.080> oil<00:06:22.500> for<00:06:23.250> a<00:06:23.310> slow<00:06:24.060> cold

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
different type of oil for a slow cold

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.409 
different type of oil for a slow cold

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:33.079 
speed hot running engine the oilers is
just<00:06:31.020> not<00:06:31.199> interchanged<00:06:32.039> it<00:06:32.550> don't<00:06:32.819> take<00:06:33.060> a

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.089 
just not interchanged it don't take a

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:36.409 
just not interchanged it don't take a
rocket<00:06:33.210> science<00:06:33.839> to<00:06:33.990> know<00:06:34.139> that<00:06:35.240> the<00:06:36.240> reason

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
rocket science to know that the reason

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.730 
rocket science to know that the reason
about<00:06:36.899> the<00:06:37.110> balance<00:06:37.500> on<00:06:37.649> these<00:06:37.919> and<00:06:38.370> if

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
about the balance on these and if

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.529 
about the balance on these and if
you<00:06:38.830> run<00:06:39.190> these<00:06:39.400> engines<00:06:39.849> at<00:06:40.000> a<00:06:40.030> higher<00:06:40.270> speed

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
you run these engines at a higher speed

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.969 
you run these engines at a higher speed
they<00:06:40.870> do<00:06:40.930> tend<00:06:41.710> to<00:06:41.919> be<00:06:42.160> out<00:06:42.789> of<00:06:42.819> balance<00:06:43.979> yeah

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
they do tend to be out of balance yeah

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.029 
they do tend to be out of balance yeah
that's<00:06:45.729> that's<00:06:46.150> true<00:06:46.509> of<00:06:47.139> one<00:06:47.440> and<00:06:47.710> another

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
that's that's true of one and another

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:52.320 
that's that's true of one and another
thing<00:06:48.280> is<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:49.210> risk<00:06:49.509> pens<00:06:50.370> if<00:06:51.370> you<00:06:51.699> compare

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
thing is the risk pens if you compare

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.969 
thing is the risk pens if you compare
these<00:06:54.210> right<00:06:55.210> there<00:06:55.240> is<00:06:55.750> four<00:06:56.080> examples<00:06:56.800> of

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:56.979 
these right there is four examples of

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.430 
these right there is four examples of
wrist<00:06:57.250> pins<00:06:57.639> that<00:06:58.030> was<00:06:58.360> in<00:06:58.599> a<00:06:59.819> well<00:07:00.819> that's

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
wrist pins that was in a well that's

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.290 
wrist pins that was in a well that's
let's<00:07:02.440> take<00:07:02.830> that<00:07:03.009> one<00:07:03.190> out<00:07:03.220> of<00:07:03.370> the<00:07:03.669> equation

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
let's take that one out of the equation

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.749 
let's take that one out of the equation
there's<00:07:05.139> four<00:07:05.470> examples<00:07:05.830> that<00:07:06.220> was<00:07:06.430> in<00:07:06.639> a

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 
there's four examples that was in a

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.629 
there's four examples that was in a
ignitor<00:07:07.270> engine<00:07:07.930> these<00:07:08.620> three<00:07:09.039> are<00:07:09.250> factory

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
ignitor engine these three are factory

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:19.290 
ignitor engine these three are factory
this<00:07:14.819> this<00:07:15.819> one<00:07:16.090> is<00:07:16.630> a<00:07:16.690> solid<00:07:17.349> risk<00:07:17.590> pen<00:07:18.300> center

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
this this one is a solid risk pen center

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.029 
this this one is a solid risk pen center
hole<00:07:19.509> drilled<00:07:19.870> here<00:07:20.139> and<00:07:20.349> there<00:07:20.470> was<00:07:20.620> a<00:07:20.650> center

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 
hole drilled here and there was a center

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.839 
hole drilled here and there was a center
hole<00:07:21.190> here<00:07:21.639> but<00:07:21.819> they<00:07:22.590> they<00:07:23.590> drilled<00:07:24.370> a<00:07:24.490> slot

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:24.849 
hole here but they they drilled a slot

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:28.710 
hole here but they they drilled a slot
in<00:07:25.090> there<00:07:25.360> so<00:07:25.720> that<00:07:25.750> when<00:07:26.139> you<00:07:26.699> when<00:07:27.699> you<00:07:27.940> screw

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 
in there so that when you when you screw

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.050 
in there so that when you when you screw
this<00:07:28.930> in<00:07:29.229> here<00:07:29.650> and<00:07:29.800> it<00:07:30.069> bottoms<00:07:30.430> out<00:07:30.580> on<00:07:30.789> there

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
this in here and it bottoms out on there

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.909 
this in here and it bottoms out on there
you<00:07:31.240> actually<00:07:31.690> can<00:07:31.900> spread<00:07:32.199> that<00:07:32.380> apart<00:07:32.800> a

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
you actually can spread that apart a

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.180 
you actually can spread that apart a
little<00:07:33.039> bit<00:07:33.310> to<00:07:33.729> lock<00:07:33.970> it<00:07:34.150> in<00:07:34.270> position<00:07:35.190> this

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.190 
little bit to lock it in position this

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.370 
little bit to lock it in position this
one<00:07:36.520> has<00:07:37.240> a<00:07:37.270> hole<00:07:37.630> drilled<00:07:37.930> all<00:07:38.110> the<00:07:38.259> way

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.380 
one has a hole drilled all the way

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.610 
one has a hole drilled all the way
through<00:07:38.680> it<00:07:39.330> which<00:07:40.330> if<00:07:40.599> you<00:07:40.840> screw<00:07:41.169> that<00:07:41.409> in

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620 
through it which if you screw that in

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.649 
through it which if you screw that in
there<00:07:41.919> they<00:07:42.520> would<00:07:42.729> probably<00:07:43.210> be<00:07:43.389> a<00:07:43.419> little

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:43.659 
there they would probably be a little

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:46.469 
there they would probably be a little
Direction<00:07:44.699> deflection<00:07:45.699> as<00:07:45.849> compared<00:07:46.300> to<00:07:46.449> a

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 
Direction deflection as compared to a

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.110 
Direction deflection as compared to a
solid<00:07:47.020> one<00:07:47.169> but<00:07:48.039> it<00:07:48.190> does<00:07:48.370> have<00:07:48.580> to<00:07:48.699> hold<00:07:48.909> all

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 
solid one but it does have to hold all

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.390 
solid one but it does have to hold all
the<00:07:49.240> way<00:07:49.360> through<00:07:49.630> so<00:07:49.840> so<00:07:50.229> you<00:07:50.289> just<00:07:50.979> here<00:07:51.250> in

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 
the way through so so you just here in

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.709 
the way through so so you just here in
hand<00:07:51.699> you<00:07:51.909> can<00:07:51.940> tell<00:07:52.360> that<00:07:52.509> there<00:07:52.659> are

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:52.719 
hand you can tell that there are

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:56.939 
hand you can tell that there are
different<00:07:53.050> weights<00:07:54.030> this<00:07:55.030> one<00:07:55.380> has<00:07:56.380> a<00:07:56.409> deeper

00:07:56.939 --> 00:07:56.949 
different weights this one has a deeper

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:00.330
