00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.630
 My name is gasparelo and in this video I'm going 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.130
 talk about two trails tents 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.890
 I'll make some comparisons 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.309
 on them are tents for use 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.689
 individual is a bivouac 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.910
 dimension 2 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.550
 I already did the evaluations of these tents 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.260
 individually on my channel and military 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.440
 but this video is more to bring the 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.010
 differences between them the bivouac tent 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.869
 one is too small, it's hard for you 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.390
 accommodate this tent together with your 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.090
 I do not like backpacking, for example . 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.010
 leaving my backpack in the advancement area is 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.540
 Make a backpack sleep on the tripod with 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.880
 a rain shelter with a bag 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.239
 Plastic I do not like I like and backpack 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.280
 like my backpack inside the tent 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.649
 Why should I need some? 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.210
 make a snack I have 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.450
 all my hand 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.789
 there is also a tent which is has a 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.309
 very small height is not only the space 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.739
 for you to lie down for you to change 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.659
 clothes will be a little difficult is difficult 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.409
 sit in this tent so 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.409
 small that she is 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.920
 Good people, I can not sit 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:27.410
 inside the tent is it has a size 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.630
 even reduced and if you need 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.240
 stay inside that tent for example 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.670
 A whole day of rain is you're gonna stay 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.020
 very bored 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.990
 It is a very light tent has 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.330
 approximately one pound and 600 grams is 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.290
 an equipment a very good finish 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.930
 with the excellent ones is very light and 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.660
 good resistance but it is a tent that 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.710
 for you to spend two or three days or 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.350
 more 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.260
 You will not like the tent it is. 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.540
 needed a little more space now 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.430
 to that for those adventures that 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.790
 You're not sure you're going. 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.680
 to spend the night is that you want only one thing 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.080
 to really break a gari does not want 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.490
 carrying weight is an excellent tent 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.470
 for that aspect 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.590
 now I'll talk a little bit about account 2 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.680
 account two is a heavier stall 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.430
 she is about 3 pounds and 300 pounds 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.739
 grams 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.350
 there are tents that are larger than the quota 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.690
 2 with a very close weight 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.600
 but account two is very efficient 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.360
 against winds and also against rain 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.100
 she has rods that intersect making 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.650
 very sturdy tent even in the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.150
 aspect of the wind and also has many 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.040
 fixing points 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:48.770
 you will be protected with this 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:51.500
 tent in relation to the rains and wind is 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.300
 a tent that is sold and can be 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.640
 used up for two people 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.590
 But I'll tell only one person for you. 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.020
 comfortable inside the tent that 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.330
 all your equipment in there too 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.220
 for those who like to use and advance it 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.580
 has a good advancement area to let 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.850
 a dirty pan boot other things 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.850
 like this 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.830
 I like to carry a little weight of 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.070
 backpack is but in relation to his tent 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.360
 time to change that concept a bit 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.360
 I preferred to stay with a little 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.180
 more comfort inside my belly 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.110
 and I have preferred tents a little 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.600
 larger 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.090
 even if I have to pay a little 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.690
 price of carrying a heavier tent 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.790
 I really liked the booth count 2 and it's the 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.680
 model that I highly recommend 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.180
 I recommend with eyes closed the tent 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.070
 dimension 2 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.200

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.720
