00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.390
 the terms the truth is about 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.850
 I work as best I can, I'll show you 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.520
 coach as I come but good is going to 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.780
 be his edition and where he plays not 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.780
 I will respect that decision 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:28.880
 and of course me because I am from strengths 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.550
 Basic here is always pretty face 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.309
 to america for the sports gold that 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.650
 there are from basic forces and 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.829
 representing the highest level I think that 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.269
 well I'm proud 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.269
 this face the america 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.149
 to take new 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.170
 and of course I think that 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.120
 winning on saturday the team is going to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.390
 have a lot of confidence to close 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.340
 the tournament but well we have to take 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.060
 in mind that it is America and we have to 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.060
 improve your bearing 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:26.870
 I do not do my part, I do not have big 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.870
 friends there then the victory 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.259
 and already at this level all the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.869
 defeats and again but if he wins 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.930
 of a team on his to his court and being 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.710
 america you feel good you feel a lot 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.710
 better and it makes you happy 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.830
 in general as you see greetings that arrive 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.310
 things change 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.990
 for this I will do well the truth that 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.940
 match with solos I show you that there 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.370
 to do things well and good 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.790
 past games were stumbles that 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.790
 had the team 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.710
 this vector I worry about my team 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.940
 by my colleagues so I trust 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.300
 them that we can take victory on 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.300
 developing 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.390
 if we also have injured and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.080
 expelled then I think it's going to be 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.080
 a very even match 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.570
 leave concentrated and trust in the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.520
 work of the week and if obviously 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.690
 have a lot of faith in the partner that goes to 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.690
 be well your work 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.450
 you do not know her 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.240
 well there are also many people at heart 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.200
 I think it's going to be even and 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.200
 one of these 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.630
 in some matches 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.710
 I repeat that the concentration is 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.890
 team was playing well and for 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.650
 mistakes we were sometimes tied 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.180
 they won then we have worked the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.300
 concentration and good treatment of 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.300
 ball 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.740
 d 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.380
 cut 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.630
 without being warned but that I know 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.270
 they are going to support there because it is america 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.160
 so I do not think they're going sideways 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.420
 of the Americanists with that that's going to 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.420
 be very canijo
