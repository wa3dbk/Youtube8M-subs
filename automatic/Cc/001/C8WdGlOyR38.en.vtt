hi<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.190> wanted<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.939> do<00:00:03.060> another<00:00:03.090> video<00:00:03.570> on

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
hi I wanted to do another video on

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.230 
hi I wanted to do another video on
comparing<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.279> first<00:00:05.700> generation

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
comparing the first generation

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.730 
comparing the first generation
paperwhite<00:00:06.810> with<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.140> second<00:00:07.470> generation

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
paperwhite with the second generation

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.080 
paperwhite with the second generation
paperwhite<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.820> dark<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.990> here<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.530> am

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
paperwhite in the dark so here I am

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.720 
paperwhite in the dark so here I am
pretty<00:00:12.090> much<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.570> dark<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:14.160> can<00:00:14.490> see

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
pretty much in the dark and you can see

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.480 
pretty much in the dark and you can see
on<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.030> side<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.470> first<00:00:17.340> generation

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
on this side is the first generation

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.880 
on this side is the first generation
paperwhite<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.960> side<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
paperwhite and on this side is the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.340 
paperwhite and on this side is the
second<00:00:20.400> generation<00:00:20.490> paperwhite<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.510> both<00:00:22.320> of

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
second generation paperwhite and both of

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.169 
second generation paperwhite and both of
them<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:22.890> set<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:25.970> L<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.480> brightness<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.590> 12

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
them are set to a L a brightness of 12

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.479 
them are set to a L a brightness of 12
so<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.210> can<00:00:31.170> sort<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.529> see<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.769> difference

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
so you can sort of see the difference

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
so you can sort of see the difference
here<00:00:32.730> between<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.630> colors<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.050> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
here between the colors you know this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
here between the colors you know this
one<00:00:37.440> being<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.890> little<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:38.219> more<00:00:38.340> bluish<00:00:38.820> while

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
one being a little bit more bluish while

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.150 
one being a little bit more bluish while
this<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:40.700> being<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:42.540> much<00:00:43.160> fairly

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
this one being pretty much fairly

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.569 
this one being pretty much fairly
natural<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.090> color<00:00:45.800> let<00:00:46.800> me<00:00:46.920> try<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.430> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
natural in color let me try to get this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
natural in color let me try to get this
to<00:00:47.640> focus<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:51.890> well<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.010> any<00:00:53.370> case<00:00:54.739> yet<00:00:55.739> you

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to focus here well in any case yet you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.170 
to focus here well in any case yet you
could<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.430> difference<00:00:56.730> between<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
could see the difference between the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.299 
could see the difference between the
colors<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.780> how<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.590> more<00:00:58.859> bluish<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
colors and how one is more bluish and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.569 
colors and how one is more bluish and
one<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.879> more<00:01:00.120> natural<00:01:00.480> paper<00:01:01.079> looking<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.430> let

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
one is more natural paper looking so let

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.070 
one is more natural paper looking so let
me<00:01:02.670> turn<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> way<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:05.659> that's<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
me turn it all the way up and that's the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.039 
me turn it all the way up and that's the
lighting<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.250> all<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> way<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
lighting for all the way up and all the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
lighting for all the way up and all the
way<00:01:10.260> down<00:01:15.350> so<00:01:16.350> all<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> way<00:01:16.799> down<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.280> could

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
way down so all the way down you could

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.030 
way down so all the way down you could
see<00:01:17.640> how<00:01:20.600> one<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.320> less<00:01:22.560> blotchy

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
see how one is a little bit less blotchy

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.370 
see how one is a little bit less blotchy
this<00:01:23.850> one<00:01:24.060> being<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> first<00:01:24.659> generation<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
this one being the first generation and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.960 
this one being the first generation and
this<00:01:25.590> one<00:01:25.799> being<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.310> bit<00:01:26.400> more<00:01:26.580> smooth

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this one being a little bit more smooth

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.050 
this one being a little bit more smooth
being<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> second<00:01:27.840> generation<00:01:28.790> let<00:01:29.790> me<00:01:29.850> just

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
being the second generation let me just

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.990 
being the second generation let me just
turn<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> little<00:01:30.720> bit<00:01:30.930> slightly<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:32.000> because

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
turn it a little bit slightly up because

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.179 
turn it a little bit slightly up because
actually<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:35.930> first<00:01:36.930> generation<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.860> act

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
actually the first generation one act

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.179 
actually the first generation one act
looks<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:38.909> bit<00:01:39.090> brighter<00:01:39.740> or<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> create

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
looks a little bit brighter or a create

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.530 
looks a little bit brighter or a create
a<00:01:41.280> brighter<00:01:41.820> effect<00:01:42.680> so<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.329> for<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.390> most

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
a brighter effect so but for the most

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.569 
a brighter effect so but for the most
part<00:01:47.030> there<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> go<00:01:48.360> that's<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.579> difference

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
part there you go that's the difference

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.679 
part there you go that's the difference
in<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:54.659> two<00:01:55.040> as<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:56.579> okay<00:01:57.210> thank<00:01:57.600> you

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
in the two as you can see okay thank you

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.170 
in the two as you can see okay thank you
for<00:01:57.869> watching
