00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
guess I kind of agree with that but at

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.150 
guess I kind of agree with that but at
the<00:02:46.720> same<00:02:46.900> time<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.680> know<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:47.830> got<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.040> think

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
the same time you know you got to think

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.710 
the same time you know you got to think
about<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.459> fact<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.730> sometimes<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.600> know

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
about the fact that sometimes you know

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.050 
about the fact that sometimes you know
some<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.930> these<00:02:50.050> tracks<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:51.489> wouldn't<00:02:51.819> race

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
some of these tracks you wouldn't race

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.960 
some of these tracks you wouldn't race
on<00:02:52.360> them<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:53.830> might<00:02:54.220> not<00:02:54.340> race<00:02:54.549> on<00:02:54.760> them<00:02:54.850> at

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
on them you might not race on them at

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.160 
on them you might not race on them at
night<00:02:55.000> or<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.330> might<00:02:55.420> not<00:02:55.569> race<00:02:55.780> on<00:02:55.989> them<00:02:56.080> in

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
night or you might not race on them in

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.420 
night or you might not race on them in
the<00:02:56.260> rain<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.890> feel<00:02:57.069> like<00:02:57.160> they're<00:02:57.310> trying

this<00:03:32.530> thing<00:03:32.709> at<00:03:33.100> night<00:03:33.549> in<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.329> rain<00:03:34.510> yeah<00:03:35.230> um

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
this thing at night in the rain yeah um

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.390 
this thing at night in the rain yeah um
and<00:03:36.870> whereas<00:03:37.870> Yas<00:03:38.109> Marina<00:03:38.140> I<00:03:38.739> mean<00:03:39.160> Yas<00:03:39.370> Marina

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
and whereas Yas Marina I mean Yas Marina

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.699 
and whereas Yas Marina I mean Yas Marina
it<00:03:39.970> as<00:03:40.600> far<00:03:40.840> as<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.109> know<00:03:41.200> not<00:03:41.350> having<00:03:41.530> the

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
it as far as you know not having the

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.150 
it as far as you know not having the
rain<00:03:41.950> for<00:03:42.519> that<00:03:42.640> I<00:03:42.670> mean<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.359> well<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:44.140> guess<00:03:45.040> you

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
rain for that I mean in well I guess you

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.039 
rain for that I mean in well I guess you
could<00:03:45.190> go<00:03:45.459> either<00:03:45.609> way<00:03:45.700> on<00:03:45.820> that<00:03:46.090> but<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.750> think

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
could go either way on that but I think

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.330 
could go either way on that but I think
the<00:03:47.140> fact<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:47.380> they<00:03:47.500> have<00:03:47.680> yas<00:03:47.859> marina<00:03:48.040> at

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
the fact that they have yas marina at

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.190 
the fact that they have yas marina at
night<00:03:48.579> is<00:03:48.790> a<00:03:48.820> really<00:03:49.540> really<00:03:49.570> good<00:03:49.900> thing<00:03:50.109> a

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
to be all over that because it's a

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.990 
to be all over that because it's a
really<00:04:08.530> cool<00:04:08.829> track<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.430> it's<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.579> really<00:04:09.730> neat

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
really cool track and it's a really neat

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.879 
really cool track and it's a really neat
layout<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:10.690> i<00:04:11.109> think<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.380> there's<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:11.769> many

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
layout and i think that there's so many

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.559 
layout and i think that there's so many
little<00:04:12.100> there's<00:04:12.609> so<00:04:12.819> many<00:04:12.910> little<00:04:13.209> weird

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
little there's so many little weird

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.000 
little there's so many little weird
things<00:04:13.989> in<00:04:14.139> that<00:04:14.290> track<00:04:14.590> there's<00:04:14.829> so<00:04:14.920> many

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
things in that track there's so many

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.090 
things in that track there's so many
little<00:04:15.280> odd<00:04:15.430> off<00:04:15.819> camber<00:04:16.299> corners<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.100> kind

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
little odd off camber corners and kind

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.029 
little odd off camber corners and kind
of<00:04:18.630> it's<00:04:19.630> almost<00:04:19.810> got<00:04:20.019> a<00:04:20.049> little<00:04:20.350> section<00:04:20.859> i

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
of it's almost got a little section i

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.250 
of it's almost got a little section i
wouldn't<00:04:21.549> say<00:04:21.700> it<00:04:21.820> resembles<00:04:22.330> i<00:04:22.539> almost<00:04:23.110> said

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
wouldn't say it resembles i almost said

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.870 
wouldn't say it resembles i almost said
it<00:04:23.349> resembled<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.919> corkscrew<00:04:24.430> on<00:04:24.550> Laguna

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
it resembled the corkscrew on Laguna

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.240 
it resembled the corkscrew on Laguna
Seca<00:04:25.030> I<00:04:25.300> mean<00:04:25.450> it's<00:04:25.659> nowhere<00:04:26.440> close

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
Seca I mean it's nowhere close

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.430 
Seca I mean it's nowhere close
to<00:04:27.640> that<00:04:27.790> kind<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.180> magnitude<00:04:28.570> but<00:04:28.870> it's

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
to that kind of a magnitude but it's

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.850 
to that kind of a magnitude but it's
like<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:30.420> you<00:04:31.420> know<00:04:31.570> meanie<00:04:31.900> version<00:04:32.620> and

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
like the you know meanie version and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.400 
like the you know meanie version and
it's<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:33.430> this<00:04:33.640> little<00:04:33.700> tiny<00:04:34.570> elevation

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
it's like this little tiny elevation

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.320 
it's like this little tiny elevation
change<00:04:35.740> but<00:04:36.340> it's<00:04:36.550> got<00:04:36.760> this<00:04:36.940> really<00:04:37.210> weird

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
change but it's got this really weird

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.320 
change but it's got this really weird
kind<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.080> almost<00:04:38.560> role<00:04:39.220> in<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.730> camber<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.240> the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
kind of almost role in the camber of the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.910 
kind of almost role in the camber of the
track<00:04:40.570> at<00:04:40.750> least<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:41.050> way<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.350> track<00:04:41.590> kind<00:04:41.830> of

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
track at least the way the track kind of

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.130 
track at least the way the track kind of
rolls<00:04:42.160> into<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.520> different<00:04:42.850> corner<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.330> it's<00:04:44.080> a

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
rolls into a different corner and it's a

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.540 
rolls into a different corner and it's a
really<00:04:44.260> cool<00:04:44.470> spot<00:04:44.800> in<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.070> track<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.520> I

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
really cool spot in the track and I

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.830 
really cool spot in the track and I
haven't<00:04:45.790> driven<00:04:45.910> on<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.180> in<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.300> long<00:04:46.420> time<00:04:46.630> so

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
haven't driven on it in a long time so

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.480 
haven't driven on it in a long time so
I'm<00:04:46.900> having<00:04:47.140> trouble<00:04:47.230> remembering<00:04:47.470> but<00:04:48.040> it's

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
I'm having trouble remembering but it's

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.650 
I'm having trouble remembering but it's
definitely<00:04:48.760> going<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.150> be<00:04:49.240> like<00:04:49.360> I<00:04:49.420> said<00:04:49.630> a

definitely going to be like I said a

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.050 
definitely going to be like I said a
track<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:49.990> I'm<00:04:50.290> very<00:04:51.280> interested<00:04:51.610> to<00:04:51.790> try

track that I'm very interested to try

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.670 
track that I'm very interested to try
now<00:04:52.630> another<00:04:52.990> track<00:04:53.260> that<00:04:53.380> I'm<00:04:53.440> going<00:04:53.530> to<00:04:53.590> be

brands hatch in it's always been a track
that<00:05:04.660> I've<00:05:04.840> enjoyed<00:05:05.110> it's<00:05:05.290> always<00:05:05.470> been<00:05:05.560> a

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
that I've enjoyed it's always been a

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.080 
that I've enjoyed it's always been a
track<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.830> I've<00:05:06.010> wanted<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.340> go<00:05:06.400> back<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:06.880> and

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
track that I've wanted to go back to and

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.520 
track that I've wanted to go back to and
always<00:05:07.510> been<00:05:07.630> a<00:05:07.660> track<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.169> think<00:05:08.410> is<00:05:08.500> a

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
always been a track that I think is a

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.710 
always been a track that I think is a
lot<00:05:08.800> of<00:05:08.950> fun<00:05:09.190> because<00:05:09.760> it's<00:05:09.910> not<00:05:10.090> too<00:05:10.360> it's<00:05:10.570> not

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
lot of fun because it's not too it's not

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.450 
lot of fun because it's not too it's not
the<00:05:10.870> track<00:05:11.020> that's<00:05:11.200> that's<00:05:11.650> too<00:05:11.890> long<00:05:12.160> or

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
the track that's that's too long or

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.130 
the track that's that's too long or
anything<00:05:12.700> like<00:05:12.730> that<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.270> it's<00:05:13.660> not<00:05:13.810> overly

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
anything like that and it's not overly

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.380 
anything like that and it's not overly
complicated<00:05:14.800> either<00:05:14.980> as<00:05:15.280> far<00:05:15.550> as<00:05:15.910> kind<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.240> the

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
complicated either as far as kind of the

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.260 
complicated either as far as kind of the
the<00:05:16.810> base<00:05:17.110> map<00:05:17.830> of<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.160> track<00:05:18.370> goes<00:05:18.610> but<00:05:19.180> at

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
the base map of the track goes but at

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.820 
the base map of the track goes but at
the<00:05:19.330> same<00:05:19.510> time<00:05:19.750> it's<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.140> difficult<00:05:20.320> track<00:05:20.680> to

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
the same time it's a difficult track to

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.080 
the same time it's a difficult track to
master<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.310> I<00:05:21.340> think<00:05:21.490> that<00:05:21.580> that's<00:05:21.700> why<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:21.970> lot

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
master and I think that that's why a lot

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.730 
master and I think that that's why a lot
of<00:05:22.270> people<00:05:22.360> enjoy<00:05:22.840> running<00:05:23.110> on<00:05:23.320> that<00:05:23.470> track

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
of people enjoy running on that track

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.250 
of people enjoy running on that track
but<00:05:24.340> some<00:05:24.610> and<00:05:24.820> as<00:05:25.240> far<00:05:25.510> as<00:05:25.660> some<00:05:25.990> of<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.140> other

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
but some and as far as some of the other

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.780 
but some and as far as some of the other
tracks<00:05:26.560> go<00:05:26.740> I<00:05:26.890> mean<00:05:27.070> I'm<00:05:27.220> really<00:05:27.550> looking
