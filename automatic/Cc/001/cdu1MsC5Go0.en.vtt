00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.319
 nthe 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.139
 the 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.789
 world understands itself 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.990
 see some players 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.249
 here is to give the password 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.309
 or why not just transmit the data 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:20.439
 because I believe 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.919
 the 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.849
 true it'll go 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.060
 I will feel better 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.060
 once we get the cd or dvd 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.389
 here's how 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.389

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.849
 but what happens at the end 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.009
 bcp loads an attack program in the 2006 turn 

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.559
 we must protect users 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:51.279

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.469

 let's say I'm what I do not want to influence and the young man's body 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:11.689
 because yes 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:13.789
 it's protecting them 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.789
 something in the dead man's school to do good 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:18.360
 it is true 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.360
 purpose of this contest 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.149
 in fact I do not understand either 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:26.050
 so simple 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.529
