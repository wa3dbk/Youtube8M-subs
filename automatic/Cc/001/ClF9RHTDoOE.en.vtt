 of loading when entering people to five 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.949
 campaigns I can also know that if 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.900
 you press the touring team that makes you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.430
 tails and then a kind comes out 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.630
 little button that says that if you give him the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.460
 triangle page to an event is worth 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.170
 This is the event and well, it consists of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.939
 four races four races with the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.170
 four vehicles of the new tlc high life 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.669
 in this case we are going to play the first 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.860
 with the environment and we go there he wants 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.090
 follow perfectly well let's addicted 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.380
 I already ask for the trick you always have 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 it's a really good thing at the beginning 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.680
 it cost a lot but that always 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.879
 I go out well dude, I have the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 feeling that I 'm going to go to 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.210
 You do not ask, it 's because there are times 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 that in some races something is still in 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.270
 safety plan with my mother that I can 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.980
 with everything but again I have the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.520
 feeling that they are going to hit me 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.770
 godmother in the good good glasses worth 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.969
 second I'm going second I'm going second one thing 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.300
 that I do not like about this environment is that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.070
 it's not as if not the truth will not stick 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.149
 so much with the new cement grab that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.460
 that the wheel does not grip the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.840
 cement and you will know that I do not like anything and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.850
 it's the same first there 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.859
 and I can not catch the race 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.869
 consists of two laps the circuit is of 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.250
 four kilometers or so let's continue 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.569
 try to win it you know you will not follow 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.100
 climb all the races the best with 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:19.429
 a kind of series since there are four 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.429
 careers 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:32.780

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.660
 batman 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.460

 there is also a little touch like the 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.660

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:21.769

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.780
