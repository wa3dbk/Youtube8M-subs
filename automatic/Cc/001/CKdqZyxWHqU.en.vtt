00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 I'm from BENFICA 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.329
 This makes me feel better. 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.869
 I have the gene 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 That to any greatness 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.800
 I'm from a fighter club 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.900
 That in the fight with fervor 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.900
 Never found a rival 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:01.300
 In this our Portugal 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.990
 Be BENFIKIST 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.070
 is to have in the soul 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.549
 The immense flame 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.320
 What conquers us 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.479
 And leads to the palm 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.500
 The intense light 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.440
 From the sun there in the sky 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.130
 Laughter comes and kisses 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.690
 With great pride, your 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.550
 The gaudy sweaters 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.860
 That in the fields to vibrate 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 They are popping poppies
