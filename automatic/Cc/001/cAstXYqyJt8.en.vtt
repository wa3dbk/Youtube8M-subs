00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:13.780
 hello everyone, onf with you they and this guys 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:18.010
 would have to be a series building together 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.980
 but I had a very pleasant evening. 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.890
 almost just ai n't not beat all that u 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.910
 I have on the table okay why do you need to know 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.240
 how is my bomb 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.860
 The first time I recorded a series of building 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.170
 and the guys I later turned out in the end 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.289
 so that I turned off the microphone 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.980
 sat down 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:44.829
 began to voice the already recorded series 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.550
 recorded the voice acting okay, I check 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:52.109
 voice acting is when recording sound 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:57.370
 there was a setting not to record a microphone 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:01:00.670
 I thought in general, I decided to just have 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.399
 do a review on what i have built i 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.750
 Now tell it exactly 25 minutes I 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.040
 spent to build this 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.899
 wonderful miracle is peculiar 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.880
 so we have 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.219
 stylistic house I don't know maybe 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.810
 you will like maybe not and I wanted 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.840
 show you what can be done very 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.329
 quickly very big and very fast 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.360
 principle let's start in this case 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:30.700
 we only need buttons on the floor here and 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.640
 here also we go right away well here you are 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.100
 of course dark is not lit because 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.170
 that food shaderpack is included under the walls not 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.430
 to the ceiling because it is here 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.759
 the window is so beautiful that just when 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.049
 the game without shaders gives coverage in the house 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.829
 corridor is made to your taste 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.799
 personally 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.630
 room large chests bedroom 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.299
 small bedroom for the crib and so 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.369
 then the map will be available to you in 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.329
 description of the video download 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.249
 equip as you want and one more 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.380
 also a big room we go in and she 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:09.729
 after all, it expands so beautiful here 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.800
 scenery wow wow here and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.129
 Look here is also pretty cool 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.870
 panoramic window I would say such 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.450
 how can this word can't pick up not 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.090
 can pick up asymmetrical style here 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.040
 two blocks to 4 blocks but nonetheless 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.989
 turned out pretty cool house like 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.360
 you see not very big but for one 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:37.480
 player in survival mode is enough 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.459
 I am prevented by the rain remove it here 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.319
 let's go around building here 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.450
 we have a small shelter who wants 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.150
 can arrange some shops here 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.640
 or something like that to enjoy life 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:54.010
 i pass through the grass so we go on to 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.700
 you would be beautiful and quite illuminated 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.030

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.549

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.030
