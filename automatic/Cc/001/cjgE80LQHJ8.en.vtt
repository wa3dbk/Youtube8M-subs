is a little bit more golden this is a
lot<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.069> fun<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.340> do<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.579> kind<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.790> shows<00:02:45.970> you

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
lot of fun to do it kind of shows you

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.479 
lot of fun to do it kind of shows you
the<00:02:46.150> color<00:02:46.690> scheme<00:02:47.049> but<00:02:47.470> not<00:02:47.709> much<00:02:48.010> much<00:02:48.280> more

where<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.000> think<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.450> value<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:54.990> why<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.230> did

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
where I think the value and why I did

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.250 
where I think the value and why I did
this<00:04:55.740> what<00:04:55.919> this<00:04:56.070> expect<00:04:56.520> is<00:04:56.990> these<00:04:57.990> are<00:04:58.110> two

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
this what this expect is these are two

great<00:04:58.380> wines<00:04:58.680> we<00:04:58.980> started<00:04:59.460> with<00:04:59.610> this<00:04:59.730> one<00:04:59.940> and

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
great wines we started with this one and

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.760 
great wines we started with this one and
I<00:05:00.570> think<00:05:00.630> when<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:00.930> tasted<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.410> you<00:05:01.530> probably

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
I think when you tasted it you probably

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.170 
I think when you tasted it you probably
enjoyed<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:02.370> you<00:05:02.610> probably<00:05:02.910> thought<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.060> was

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
enjoyed it you probably thought it was

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.570 
enjoyed it you probably thought it was
really<00:05:03.330> nice<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.750> as<00:05:03.900> did<00:05:04.200> I<00:05:04.320> but<00:05:04.620> when<00:05:05.460> you

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
really nice and as did I but when you

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.240 
really nice and as did I but when you
step<00:05:05.910> up<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:06.570> taste<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.960> real<00:05:06.990> deal<00:05:07.530> single

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250

vineyard<00:05:08.400> white<00:05:08.669> burning<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.900> kind<00:05:10.260> of<00:05:10.380> gave

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
vineyard white burning that kind of gave

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.110 
vineyard white burning that kind of gave
you<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.770> opportunity<00:05:11.010> and<00:05:11.490> when<00:05:11.669> we<00:05:11.760> bounced

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
you the opportunity and when we bounced

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.690 
you the opportunity and when we bounced
back<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.479> forth<00:05:12.660> to<00:05:13.169> really<00:05:13.500> see<00:05:14.280> the

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
back and forth to really see the

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
back and forth to really see the
difference<00:05:14.930> between<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:16.700> quality<00:05:17.700> wine<00:05:17.910> but<00:05:18.690> a

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
difference between a quality wine but a

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.960 
difference between a quality wine but a
super<00:05:19.110> quality<00:05:19.680> wine<00:05:19.830> over<00:05:20.160> here<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.669> it's<00:05:20.820> I

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
super quality wine over here and it's I

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.580 
super quality wine over here and it's I
really<00:05:21.630> think<00:05:21.870> you<00:05:22.110> know<00:05:22.200> I'm<00:05:22.290> excited

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
really think you know I'm excited

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.770 
really think you know I'm excited
because<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:23.010> was<00:05:23.070> even<00:05:23.400> more<00:05:23.669> dramatic<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:24.660> me

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
because it was even more dramatic to me

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.909 
because it was even more dramatic to me
than<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.020> thought<00:05:25.169> I<00:05:25.229> might<00:05:25.380> have<00:05:25.440> done<00:05:25.590> because

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
than I thought I might have done because

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.310 
than I thought I might have done because
the<00:05:26.070> beets<00:05:26.220> though<00:05:26.340> is<00:05:26.460> such<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:26.700> nice<00:05:26.940> wine<00:05:27.320> and

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
the beets though is such a nice wine and

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.050 
the beets though is such a nice wine and
now<00:05:28.560> you<00:05:28.620> can<00:05:28.919> really<00:05:29.190> see<00:05:29.370> where<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.669> dollars

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
now you can really see where the dollars

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.940 
now you can really see where the dollars
are<00:05:30.090> being<00:05:30.210> spent<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:31.200> technology<00:05:31.740> is<00:05:31.800> to

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
are being spent the technology is to

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.650 
are being spent the technology is to
pick<00:05:32.130> picking<00:05:32.460> at<00:05:32.610> lower<00:05:32.790> years<00:05:33.090> better

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
pick picking at lower years better

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.409 
pick picking at lower years better
better<00:05:34.050> vineyards<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.850> I<00:05:35.850> hope<00:05:36.030> this<00:05:36.150> was<00:05:36.360> a

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
better vineyards and I hope this was a

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.390 
better vineyards and I hope this was a
very<00:05:36.660> eye-opening<00:05:36.900> experience<00:05:37.770> to<00:05:37.979> the

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
very eye-opening experience to the

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.950 
very eye-opening experience to the
difference<00:05:38.880> in<00:05:39.060> quality<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:39.720> this<00:05:39.810> is

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
difference in quality and this is

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.719 
difference in quality and this is
Chardonnay<00:05:40.410> and<00:05:40.620> Chardonnay<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:41.610> know

Chardonnay and Chardonnay you know

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.880 
Chardonnay and Chardonnay you know
varies<00:05:42.300> but<00:05:42.539> you<00:05:42.810> know<00:05:42.930> there's<00:05:43.440> a<00:05:43.500> lot<00:05:43.770> of

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
varies but you know there's a lot of

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.409 
varies but you know there's a lot of
other<00:05:43.979> grapes<00:05:44.280> out<00:05:44.430> there<00:05:44.580> to<00:05:44.669> bury<00:05:44.850> even<00:05:45.210> more

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
other grapes out there to bury even more
