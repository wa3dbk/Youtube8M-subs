let's begin with the vintage channel on
the<00:03:20.370> showman<00:03:20.850> setting<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.480> let's<00:03:21.989> take<00:03:22.170> a

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
the showman setting and let's take a

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:41.280

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
with the flick of the switch and hear

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:19.900 
with the flick of the switch and hear
what<00:03:59.230> that<00:03:59.260> sounds<00:03:59.409> like

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.060 

moving<00:04:20.720> over<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.170> burn<00:04:21.410> channel<00:04:21.890> there's

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
moving over to the burn channel there's

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.070 
moving over to the burn channel there's
a<00:04:22.130> lot<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.700> tweak<00:04:22.910> ability<00:04:23.330> on<00:04:23.480> this<00:04:23.630> channel

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
a lot of tweak ability on this channel

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.780 
a lot of tweak ability on this channel
what<00:04:24.620> I'm<00:04:24.710> going<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.920> do<00:04:25.010> is<00:04:25.100> let<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.340> hear<00:04:25.550> it

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
what I'm going to do is let you hear it

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.640 
what I'm going to do is let you hear it
with<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.090> settings<00:04:26.450> I<00:04:26.540> have<00:04:26.720> here<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.260> I'll

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
with the settings I have here and I'll

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.860 
with the settings I have here and I'll
move<00:04:27.860> this<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.400> game<00:04:28.640> structure<00:04:29.180> from<00:04:29.330> gain<00:04:29.630> 1

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
move this the game structure from gain 1

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.710 
move this the game structure from gain 1
to<00:04:30.020> gain<00:04:30.170> two<00:04:30.410> so<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.650> hear<00:04:31.070> how<00:04:31.580> both<00:04:32.510> these

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
to gain two so you hear how both these

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.140 
to gain two so you hear how both these
gain<00:04:33.020> knobs<00:04:33.800> react<00:04:34.310> with<00:04:34.490> one<00:04:34.640> another<00:04:34.700> and

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
gain knobs react with one another and
