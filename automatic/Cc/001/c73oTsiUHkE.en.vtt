Magica<00:00:05.240> she<00:00:06.240> wasn't<00:00:06.480> really<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.720> main

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020

Magica she wasn't really a main
character<00:00:07.259> she<00:00:07.950> was<00:00:08.040> kind<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.480> sidekick

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
character she was kind of a sidekick

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.499 
character she was kind of a sidekick
minor<00:00:10.469> character<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.820> thought<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.420> would

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
minor character but I thought it would

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.970 
minor character but I thought it would
have<00:00:12.599> been<00:00:12.719> pretty<00:00:12.929> cool<00:00:13.200> if<00:00:13.410> she<00:00:13.559> had<00:00:13.740> been<00:00:13.769> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
have been pretty cool if she had been a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.340 
have been pretty cool if she had been a
magical<00:00:14.610> girl<00:00:14.759> cuz<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.690> think<00:00:15.809> she<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
magical girl cuz I think she was the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.950 
magical girl cuz I think she was the
prettiest<00:00:16.800> character<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.910> series<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.510> just

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
prettiest character in the series I just

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.720 
prettiest character in the series I just
I<00:00:19.050> really<00:00:19.080> loved<00:00:19.500> her<00:00:19.680> hair<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.250> was<00:00:20.369> just<00:00:20.550> like

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
I really loved her hair it was just like

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.330 
I really loved her hair it was just like
so<00:00:21.000> big<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.449> bouncy<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.410> wanted<00:00:22.920> her<00:00:23.070> hair

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
so big and bouncy and I wanted her hair

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.849 
so big and bouncy and I wanted her hair
and<00:00:24.289> because<00:00:25.289> she<00:00:25.410> also<00:00:25.529> had<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.800> really

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and because she also had like really

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.730 
and because she also had like really
pretty<00:00:26.250> eyes<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.880> someone<00:00:27.300> told<00:00:27.660> me<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.260> he

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
pretty eyes and someone told me that he

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.479 
pretty eyes and someone told me that he
told<00:00:28.980> me<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.369> Japanese<00:00:29.609> actually<00:00:30.300> means<00:00:30.510> eyes

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
told me in Japanese actually means eyes

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.590 
told me in Japanese actually means eyes
so<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.550> kind<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.880> makes<00:00:33.030> sense<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.450> she's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
so that kind of makes sense that she's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.569 
so that kind of makes sense that she's
got<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.290> prettiest<00:00:34.770> eyes<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> all

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.720 
got like the prettiest eyes out of all
the<00:00:35.670> characters<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:36.300> well<00:00:36.350> but<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.680> kind<00:00:38.579> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the characters as well but I kind of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
the characters as well but I kind of
stopped<00:00:39.059> liking<00:00:39.690> her<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> character<00:00:40.680> about

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579

stopped liking her as a character about
midway<00:00:42.030> through<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.510> series<00:00:42.870> when<00:00:43.219> she<00:00:44.219> kind

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that she shouldn't kind of have gone

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
that she shouldn't kind of have gone
after<00:00:52.469> him<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.430> was<00:00:53.520> kind<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
after him because that was kind of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.439 
after him because that was kind of
psychos<00:00:54.480> guy<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:56.129> there's<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.489> unspoken<00:00:57.000> rule

the unspoken rule that all girls know

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.510 
the unspoken rule that all girls know
and<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> kind<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> didn't<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> fact

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and so I kind of didn't like the fact

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880 
and so I kind of didn't like the fact
that<00:01:08.640> she<00:01:09.060> did<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> series<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that she did that in the series and I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.820 
that she did that in the series and I
was<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.220> worried<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.790> doing<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.659> hair<00:01:12.990> in

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
was so worried about doing the hair in

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.940 
was so worried about doing the hair in
this<00:01:13.979> picture<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.500> wasn't<00:01:16.500> sure<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

was<00:01:17.009> gonna<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.509> didn't<00:01:18.840> really

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
was gonna do it because I didn't really

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
was gonna do it because I didn't really
have<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.650> colors<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.280> anyway<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.000> broke

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
this picture it would have been

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.240 
this picture it would have been
absolutely<00:01:44.820> impossible<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.890> done<00:01:47.100> that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
absolutely impossible to have done that

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.389 
absolutely impossible to have done that
so<00:01:47.640> luckily<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.810> had<00:01:49.079> my<00:01:49.110> green<00:01:49.439> kopecks<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.100> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
so luckily I had my green kopecks and I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.980 
so luckily I had my green kopecks and I
actually<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.850> liked<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.329> way<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.810> hair

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
actually really liked the way the hair

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.340 
actually really liked the way the hair
kind<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.320> turned<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.920> end<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:54.350> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
kind of turned out in the end so that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.330 
kind of turned out in the end so that
was<00:01:55.619> pretty<00:01:55.890> cool<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:58.290> only<00:01:58.619> downside

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
was pretty cool and the only downside

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.420 
was pretty cool and the only downside
really<00:01:59.759> is<00:02:00.000> when<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> started<00:02:01.229> using<00:02:01.439> my<00:02:01.920> copics

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
really is when I started using my copics

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.179 
really is when I started using my copics
it<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.149> makes<00:02:03.450> me<00:02:03.630> really<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.710> want<00:02:05.009> more

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
it then makes me really really want more

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.670 
it then makes me really really want more
