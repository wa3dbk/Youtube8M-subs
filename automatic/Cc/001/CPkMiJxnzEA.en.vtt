same rhoda minces org and I got a
special<00:00:20.070> line<00:00:20.430> recent<00:00:21.119> call<00:00:21.390> mine<00:00:21.570> latias<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
special line recent call mine latias and

team really really similar to mine
except<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.050> don't<00:00:28.170> think<00:00:28.500> his<00:00:28.619> Landers<00:00:29.039> is

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070

special<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:30.689> most<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.140> them<00:00:31.230> are

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
special because most of them are

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
special because most of them are
physical<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.520> that's<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.360> say<00:00:33.540> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
physical but that's not to say that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.900 
physical but that's not to say that
special<00:00:34.140> Andres<00:00:34.559> isn't<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.040> gigantic<00:00:35.670> fucking

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
he'd go for the flame thrower but he

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
he'd go for the flame thrower but he
ends<00:01:58.439> up<00:01:58.469> going<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.890> bug<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.310> predicting<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
ends up going for bug was predicting the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.660 
ends up going for bug was predicting the
obvious<00:02:00.299> which<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.869> here<00:02:01.259> I'm<00:02:01.740> gonna<00:02:02.070> go<00:02:02.310> into

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
obvious which and here I'm gonna go into

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.090 
obvious which and here I'm gonna go into
sizzle<00:02:03.030> for<00:02:03.299> absolutely<00:02:03.810> no<00:02:04.079> reason<00:02:04.110> but

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
sizzle for absolutely no reason but

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.370 
sizzle for absolutely no reason but
they're<00:02:05.579> kind<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.939> his<00:02:06.060> reason<00:02:06.509> cuz<00:02:06.750> i<00:02:06.960> wanna

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
they're kind of his reason cuz i wanna

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.850 
they're kind of his reason cuz i wanna
check<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.829> he<00:02:07.979> scarfed<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.520> well<00:02:08.729> cuz

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860

anyway<00:02:14.240> now<00:02:14.660> I'm<00:02:14.810> gonna<00:02:14.960> switch<00:02:15.260> out<00:02:15.470> on<00:02:15.710> just

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
anyway now I'm gonna switch out on just

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.880 
anyway now I'm gonna switch out on just
to<00:02:16.310> check<00:02:16.550> for<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.970> flamethrower<00:02:17.530> sizzle<00:02:18.530> I

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
to check for the flamethrower sizzle I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.910 
to check for the flamethrower sizzle I
don't<00:02:19.340> know<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.730> was<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.360> guess<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.710> worked

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
don't know I was I guess it worked

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.950 
don't know I was I guess it worked
because<00:02:22.040> I'm<00:02:22.310> pretty<00:02:22.910> much<00:02:22.970> I'm<00:02:23.420> 100-percent

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
because I'm pretty much I'm 100-percent

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.890 
because I'm pretty much I'm 100-percent
sure<00:02:24.320> he<00:02:24.590> scarfed<00:02:24.920> but<00:02:25.370> since<00:02:26.330> I<00:02:26.420> wasn't<00:02:26.780> gonna

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
sure he scarfed but since I wasn't gonna

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.930 
sure he scarfed but since I wasn't gonna
be<00:02:26.960> able<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.290> do<00:02:27.470> shit<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.860> him<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.280> now<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.610> sack

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
with my own flame thrower but I'm pretty

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.100 
with my own flame thrower but I'm pretty
sure<00:02:33.980> he's<00:02:34.340> gonna<00:02:34.460> switch<00:02:34.760> out<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.630> I'm<00:02:35.990> gonna

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
go for the u-turn instead as he brings

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.980 
go for the u-turn instead as he brings
in<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:38.480> tyranitar<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:39.560> um<00:02:40.030> yeah<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.570> detour

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
in this tyranitar so um yeah this detour

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.630 
in this tyranitar so um yeah this detour
isn't<00:02:42.410> really<00:02:42.620> gonna<00:02:42.800> do<00:02:43.010> much<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.250> anything
