what<00:02:17.750> we<00:02:17.870> might<00:02:18.050> do<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.350> cut<00:02:18.560> out<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.739> bit<00:02:18.980> of

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
what we might do is cut out a bit of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.699 
what we might do is cut out a bit of
rock<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.569> paint<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.230> black<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.680> yellow

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
coming into the top and bottom stations

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.559 
coming into the top and bottom stations
and<00:02:38.780> get<00:02:39.440> caught<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:42.580> on<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:44.209> grid<00:02:44.420> work

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
and get caught on the on the grid work

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.580 
and get caught on the on the grid work
here<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:47.000> what<00:02:47.239> I'm<00:02:47.329> going<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.780> do<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.170> just<00:02:48.350> put

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
here so what I'm going to do is just put

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.120 
here so what I'm going to do is just put
a<00:02:48.620> bit<00:02:48.829> of<00:02:48.860> black<00:02:49.730> tape<00:02:50.090> around<00:02:51.049> so<00:02:51.590> they<00:02:51.860> can't

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
a bit of black tape around so they can't

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.670 
a bit of black tape around so they can't
go<00:02:52.370> into<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.880> inside<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.570> mean<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:54.350> covered

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
go into the inside I mean it's covered

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.440 
go into the inside I mean it's covered
by<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.860> building<00:02:55.310> anyhow<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.060> won't<00:02:56.360> be

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
by the building anyhow so you won't be

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.900 
by the building anyhow so you won't be
able<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.630> see<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:57.019> and<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.290> just<00:02:57.430> for<00:02:58.430> ongoing

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
able to see it and it just for ongoing

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.220 
able to see it and it just for ongoing
continuous<00:02:59.690> use

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
continuous use

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.130 
continuous use
it'll<00:03:01.070> just<00:03:01.280> protect<00:03:01.640> those<00:03:01.850> jams<00:03:02.780> from

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
it'll just protect those jams from

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.720 
it'll just protect those jams from
happening<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.680> we'll<00:03:06.950> do<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.250> same<00:03:07.459> thing

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
happening and we'll do the same thing

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.780 
happening and we'll do the same thing
with<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.970> top<00:03:08.150> station<00:03:08.720> as<00:03:08.870> well<00:03:09.609> just<00:03:10.609> so

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
with the top station as well just so

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.560 
with the top station as well just so
that<00:03:10.940> answer<00:03:11.299> to<00:03:11.390> catch<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:12.019> those<00:03:12.260> sand

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
that answer to catch on those sand

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.900 
that answer to catch on those sand

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.819 
cable changed from black to silver I
tried<00:03:23.000> using<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.660> metal<00:03:24.079> thread<00:03:24.320> option<00:03:24.680> that

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
tried using the metal thread option that

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.890 
tried using the metal thread option that
comes<00:03:25.040> with<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.519> kit<00:03:25.730> however<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.540> kept

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
comes with the kit however I kept

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.410 
comes with the kit however I kept
thinking<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.859> it<00:03:28.190> has<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.370> retain<00:03:28.850> memory

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
thinking it and it has a retain memory

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.630 
thinking it and it has a retain memory
so<00:03:30.109> there's<00:03:30.320> lumps<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:30.859> bumps<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.430> wire

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
so there's lumps and bumps and the wire

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.280 
so there's lumps and bumps and the wire
that<00:03:31.910> just<00:03:32.180> wouldn't<00:03:32.390> go<00:03:32.660> away

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
that just wouldn't go away

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.340 
that just wouldn't go away
and<00:03:33.709> my<00:03:33.950> indelicate<00:03:34.700> fingers<00:03:35.239> couldn't<00:03:36.079> knot

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
and my indelicate fingers couldn't knot

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.590 
and my indelicate fingers couldn't knot
it<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.859> my<00:03:37.160> super<00:03:37.430> glue<00:03:37.700> wouldn't<00:03:38.180> stick<00:03:38.420> it

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
it and my super glue wouldn't stick it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.259 
it and my super glue wouldn't stick it
so<00:03:39.470> back<00:03:39.859> to<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.130> black<00:03:40.340> thread<00:03:40.640> which<00:03:41.090> is

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
so back to the black thread which is

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.509 
so back to the black thread which is
much<00:03:41.450> easier<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:42.200> manipulate<00:03:42.530> when<00:03:43.130> putting

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
much easier to manipulate when putting

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.610 
much easier to manipulate when putting
the<00:03:43.640> chairs<00:03:43.910> on<00:03:44.180> or<00:03:44.390> rearranging<00:03:45.260> them

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
the chairs on or rearranging them

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.190 
the chairs on or rearranging them
maybe<00:03:46.400> it'll<00:03:46.640> later<00:03:46.880> date<00:03:47.180> I'll<00:03:47.480> try<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.900> wire

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
maybe it'll later date I'll try the wire

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.430 
maybe it'll later date I'll try the wire
again<00:03:48.590> as<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.859> doesn't<00:03:49.100> look<00:03:49.310> cool<00:03:49.549> though

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
again as it doesn't look cool though

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.229 
again as it doesn't look cool though

something<00:04:14.750> I'm<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.110> bit<00:04:15.410> apprehensive<00:04:15.650> about

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
something I'm a bit apprehensive about

as<00:04:16.489> electronics<00:04:17.120> are<00:04:17.239> not<00:04:17.390> my<00:04:17.600> field<00:04:17.959> and<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
as electronics are not my field and the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.490 
as electronics are not my field and the
German<00:04:19.010> instructions<00:04:19.640> even<00:04:20.329> translated<00:04:21.170> it<00:04:21.410> a

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
German instructions even translated it a

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.940 
German instructions even translated it a
bit<00:04:21.709> confusing<00:04:22.250> along<00:04:22.700> with<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:22.910> small<00:04:23.150> diagram
