if you drive economically or if you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.810 
if you drive economically or if you
wanna<00:00:56.579> raise<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.660> drag<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.230> whatever<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:59.520> type

wanna raise a drag or whatever they type
our<00:01:00.120> version<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.590> DSP<00:01:02.129> C<00:01:02.370> has<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> same

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
our version of the DSP C has the same

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.340 
our version of the DSP C has the same
dual<00:01:04.350> walk<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> SPC<00:01:05.549> ID<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.840> means

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
dual walk as the SPC ID so this means

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.969 
dual walk as the SPC ID so this means
you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.220> boost<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.740> 2.5<00:01:10.740> bar<00:01:11.840> maximum<00:01:12.979> also

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you can boost up to 2.5 bar maximum also

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.550 
you can boost up to 2.5 bar maximum also
or<00:01:14.130> fes2<00:01:14.640> G<00:01:15.299> readyboost<00:01:15.630> controllers<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
or fes2 G readyboost controllers the

profit be on top and profit a on the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.800 
profit be on top and profit a on the
bottom<00:01:20.659> so<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.640> profit<00:01:24.000> beats<00:01:24.210> are<00:01:24.450> really

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
bottom so the profit beats are really

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.980 
bottom so the profit beats are really
easy<00:01:25.080> boost<00:01:25.799> controller<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.150> see<00:01:27.390> you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
easy boost controller as you can see you

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.010 
easy boost controller as you can see you
only<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.409> three<00:01:28.740> thousand<00:01:29.159> one<00:01:29.220> two<00:01:29.460> three

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
only have three thousand one two three

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.280 
only have three thousand one two three
you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.200> set<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:32.369> low<00:01:33.210> boost<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.869> one

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you can set up one low boost and one

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.859 
you can set up one low boost and one
high<00:01:34.829> boost<00:01:35.119> that's<00:01:36.119> everything<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.840> need

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
high boost that's everything you need

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.330 
high boost that's everything you need
then<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:37.950> our<00:01:38.159> third<00:01:38.520> dial<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:39.180> balance

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
then you have our third dial for balance

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.429 
then you have our third dial for balance
so<00:01:41.340> profit<00:01:41.790> being<00:01:42.000> able<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.509> save<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.930> programs

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
so profit being able to save to programs

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.100 
so profit being able to save to programs
like<00:01:43.829> low<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.579> high<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.780> set<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.020> one

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
like low and high so you can set up one

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.830 
like low and high so you can set up one
for<00:01:46.500> economy<00:01:46.890> driving<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:48.090> for<00:01:48.360> racing

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
for economy driving and one for racing

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.630 
for economy driving and one for racing
whatever<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.560> profit<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
whatever you up to the profit a on the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
whatever you up to the profit a on the
bottom<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:55.170> bit<00:01:55.259> more

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
bottom it's a little bit more

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
bottom it's a little bit more
complicated<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.700> has<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:57.060> more

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
complicated because it has a lot more

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.870 
complicated because it has a lot more
options<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.810> boost<00:01:58.619> safety<00:01:59.310> control

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
options like boost safety control

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.859 
options like boost safety control
warning<00:02:00.860> overtake<00:02:01.860> boost<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.610> whatever<00:02:03.420> but

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
warning overtake boost and whatever but

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.319 
warning overtake boost and whatever but
in<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.619> main<00:02:04.799> thing<00:02:05.100> it's<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> same<00:02:05.640> easy

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
in the main thing it's the same easy

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.999 
in the main thing it's the same easy
thing<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.530> connect<00:02:07.829> two<00:02:07.979> wires

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
thing you just have to connect two wires

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.750 
thing you just have to connect two wires
you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.940> see<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.390> red<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.530> black<00:02:10.760> that's

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you can see here red and black that's

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.580 
you can see here red and black that's
plus<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.300> minus<00:02:12.599> that's<00:02:12.810> everything

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
plus and minus that's everything

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.339 
plus and minus that's everything
me<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.060> hooked<00:02:15.239> up<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
me and then it's hooked up you have a

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.270 
me and then it's hooked up you have a
small<00:02:16.620> display<00:02:17.220> that's<00:02:17.970> here<00:02:18.209> on<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.620> profit

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
small display that's here on the profit

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.030 
small display that's here on the profit
gate<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.120> yeah<00:02:21.900> that's<00:02:22.110> very<00:02:22.170> simple<00:02:22.680> you

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
gate and yeah that's very simple you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.250 
gate and yeah that's very simple you
just<00:02:23.069> set<00:02:23.519> up<00:02:23.640> boost<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.080> also

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
just set up boost and you can also

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.199 
just set up boost and you can also
change<00:02:25.830> programs<00:02:26.750> from<00:02:27.750> A<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.959> B<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.970> it's<00:02:29.970> very

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
change programs from A to B so it's very

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.350 
change programs from A to B so it's very
easy<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.840> you're<00:02:31.440> driving<00:02:31.940> internal<00:02:32.940> gate<00:02:33.150> or

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
easy if you're driving internal gate or

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.660 
easy if you're driving internal gate or
external<00:02:33.959> wastegate<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.459> switch<00:02:35.640> it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
external wastegate you can switch it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.220 
external wastegate you can switch it
here<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.879> SPC<00:02:38.879> it<00:02:39.030> will<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.269> here<00:02:39.510> it's

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
here and on the SPC it will be here it's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.789 
here and on the SPC it will be here it's
very<00:02:40.349> important<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.069> have<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.760> good<00:02:42.569> result

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
very important to have a good result

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.990 
very important to have a good result
otherwise<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:44.190> doesn't<00:02:44.489> work

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
otherwise it doesn't work

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.180 
otherwise it doesn't work
of<00:02:45.319> course<00:02:46.319> the<00:02:46.440> boost<00:02:46.650> controller<00:02:47.010> needs

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
of course the boost controller needs

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.520 
of course the boost controller needs
information<00:02:47.400> about<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> boost<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.260> have

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
information about the boost so you have

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.729 
information about the boost so you have
to<00:02:49.709> get<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> line<00:02:50.489> connected<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.739> vacuum

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
to get a line connected to the vacuum

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.350 
to get a line connected to the vacuum
system<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:55.280> intake<00:02:56.280> manifold<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:57.090> your

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
system on the intake manifold of your

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.589

pressure<00:02:57.660> boost<00:02:58.110> gauge<00:02:58.319> low<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.160> whatever<00:02:59.599> so

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
pressure boost gauge low of whatever so

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.229 
pressure boost gauge low of whatever so
the<00:03:00.930> boost<00:03:01.110> controller<00:03:01.760> gets<00:03:02.760> information

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
the boost controller gets information

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.830 
the boost controller gets information
about<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> boost<00:03:04.140> pressure<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.660> he<00:03:06.660> can

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
about the boost pressure and then he can

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.650 
about the boost pressure and then he can
control<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.379> of<00:03:07.500> course<00:03:07.879> you<00:03:08.879> can<00:03:09.090> see<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
control it of course you can see on the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.830 
control it of course you can see on the
back<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:09.870> it's<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:11.310> vacuum<00:03:12.030> host<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.569> have<00:03:12.660> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
back here it's a vacuum host you have to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.720 
back here it's a vacuum host you have to
connect<00:03:13.170> all<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.390> profit<00:03:15.390> B<00:03:15.540> will<00:03:15.810> be<00:03:15.959> here

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
connect all the profit B will be here

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.479 
connect all the profit B will be here
it's<00:03:17.730> very<00:03:18.000> easy<00:03:18.530> okay<00:03:19.530> let's<00:03:20.010> go<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
it's very easy okay let's go on to the

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.069 
it's very easy okay let's go on to the
bonnet<00:03:20.870> okay<00:03:21.870> here<00:03:22.079> we<00:03:22.230> are<00:03:22.260> this<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.680> my<00:03:22.920> RB<00:03:23.250> 25

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
bonnet okay here we are this is my RB 25

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.590 
bonnet okay here we are this is my RB 25
as<00:03:25.079> you<00:03:25.200> can<00:03:25.380> see<00:03:25.530> here<00:03:26.090> this<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.299> line<00:03:27.540> I

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
as you can see here this is the line I

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.589 
as you can see here this is the line I
told<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:27.989> before<00:03:28.290> about<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.859> boost<00:03:29.069> pressure

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
told you before about the boost pressure

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.539 
told you before about the boost pressure
it's<00:03:30.599> fitted<00:03:30.840> between<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.319> fuel<00:03:31.950> pressure

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
it's fitted between the fuel pressure

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.440 
it's fitted between the fuel pressure
regulator<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.720> intake<00:03:34.349> manifold<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.970> the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
regulator and the intake manifold so the

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.589 
regulator and the intake manifold so the
boot<00:03:36.599> controller<00:03:36.840> gets<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.139> signal<00:03:38.299> so<00:03:39.299> as<00:03:39.450> you

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
boot controller gets a signal so as you

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.050 
boot controller gets a signal so as you
can<00:03:39.720> see<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.349> a<00:03:40.380> blitz<00:03:40.859> well<00:03:41.069> do<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.760> wealth

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
can see this is a blitz well do a wealth

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.259 
can see this is a blitz well do a wealth
boosting<00:03:42.720> up<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.250> 2.5<00:03:44.250> bar<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:45.810> used<00:03:46.349> two<00:03:46.620> colors

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
boosting up to 2.5 bar I used two colors

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.409 
boosting up to 2.5 bar I used two colors
so<00:03:48.269> it's<00:03:48.450> easy<00:03:48.599> to<00:03:48.810> see<00:03:49.190> you<00:03:50.190> have<00:03:50.370> one<00:03:50.400> in<00:03:51.000> and

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
so it's easy to see you have one in and

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.680 
so it's easy to see you have one in and
one<00:03:51.450> out<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.609> is<00:03:54.329> intercooler<00:03:55.200> system

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
one out so in is intercooler system

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.600 
one out so in is intercooler system
or<00:03:56.990> directly<00:03:57.950> on<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:59.920> turbo<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.220> out<00:04:02.120> is<00:04:02.540> the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
or directly on the turbo and out is the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.550 
or directly on the turbo and out is the
the<00:04:04.610> gate<00:04:05.080> of<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.380> turbo<00:04:07.480> so<00:04:08.480> also<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.290> can

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
the gate of the turbo so also you can

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.380 
the gate of the turbo so also you can
use<00:04:10.570> directly<00:04:11.570> from<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.930> intercooler<00:04:12.290> system

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
use directly from the intercooler system

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.750 
use directly from the intercooler system
from<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:15.350> intercooler<00:04:15.740> system<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:16.700> in<00:04:17.060> or<00:04:18.760> you

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
from the intercooler system to in or you

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.210 
from the intercooler system to in or you
can<00:04:19.970> use<00:04:20.120> directly<00:04:20.540> from<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.810> turbo<00:04:21.140> many<00:04:21.920> RB

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
can use directly from the turbo many RB

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.940 
can use directly from the turbo many RB
25<00:04:22.670> says<00:04:23.290> this<00:04:24.290> top<00:04:24.610> top<00:04:25.610> main<00:04:25.790> pipe<00:04:26.950> they

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
25 says this top top main pipe they

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.590 
25 says this top top main pipe they
don't<00:04:28.130> have<00:04:28.250> any<00:04:28.430> connections<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.270> can

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
don't have any connections so you can

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.390 
don't have any connections so you can
put<00:04:29.900> directly<00:04:30.080> from<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.560> turbo<00:04:30.860> or<00:04:31.070> just

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
put directly from the turbo or just

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.480 
put directly from the turbo or just
drill<00:04:32.090> opinion<00:04:32.540> like<00:04:32.780> me<00:04:33.160> so<00:04:34.160> yeah<00:04:34.310> basically

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
drill opinion like me so yeah basically

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.910 
drill opinion like me so yeah basically
that's<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.690> have<00:04:35.720> to<00:04:36.200> connect<00:04:36.530> power<00:04:36.740> and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
that's it you have to connect power and

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.840 
that's it you have to connect power and
ground<00:04:37.330> in<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.630> out<00:04:39.310> set<00:04:40.310> up<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.700> boost

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
ground in and out set up the boost

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.030 
ground in and out set up the boost
control<00:04:41.210> on<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.420> boost<00:04:41.600> you<00:04:41.690> need<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:43.390> they

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
control on the boost you need and they

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.180 
control on the boost you need and they
boost<00:04:46.040> pressure<00:04:46.370> that's<00:04:46.670> everything
