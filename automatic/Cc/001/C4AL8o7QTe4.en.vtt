like vegetables at all so they're a lot
to<00:00:31.380> creative<00:00:31.859> ways<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.090> first

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
to creative ways to do this the first

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.150 
to creative ways to do this the first
thing<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.750> parents<00:00:34.530> should<00:00:34.739> always

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
thing that parents should always

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.840 
thing that parents should always
remember<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.059> repeat<00:00:36.510> repeat<00:00:36.899> repeat<00:00:37.850> but

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
remember is to repeat repeat repeat but

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.520 
remember is to repeat repeat repeat but
while<00:00:39.030> we're<00:00:39.270> repeating<00:00:39.600> vegetables<00:00:40.290> and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
while we're repeating vegetables and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.920 
while we're repeating vegetables and
kids<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:40.920> saying<00:00:41.219> they<00:00:42.090> don't<00:00:42.270> love<00:00:42.629> them

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
kids are saying they don't love them

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.799 
kids are saying they don't love them
there<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.590> ways<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.860> pack<00:00:44.250> them<00:00:44.489> into<00:00:44.809> recipes

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
there are ways to pack them into recipes

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.950 
there are ways to pack them into recipes
so<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.289> they're<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.710> pleasant<00:00:47.190> tasting

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
so that they're more pleasant tasting

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.490 
so that they're more pleasant tasting
one<00:00:48.960> idea<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.730> smoothies<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.809> another<00:00:52.140> idea

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
one idea is smoothies and another idea

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.729 
one idea is smoothies and another idea
for<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.829> summer<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.430> sort<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.850> along<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.270> same

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
for the summer is sort of along the same

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.060 
for the summer is sort of along the same
wavelength<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:57.020> popsicles<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.289> if

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
wavelength and that is popsicles so if

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.369 
wavelength and that is popsicles so if
you<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> great<00:00:59.670> blender<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.719> blend

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you have a great blender you can blend

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.030 
you have a great blender you can blend
lots<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.190> nutritious<00:01:02.699> things<00:01:03.559> into<00:01:04.559> popsicles

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
lots of nutritious things into popsicles

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.950

first what we're going to do is decide
how<00:01:26.340> much<00:01:26.700> liquid<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.479> need<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> did

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
how much liquid we need so what I did

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.770 
how much liquid we need so what I did
with<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.159> popsicle<00:01:30.150> trays<00:01:30.390> we're<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
with my popsicle trays we're going to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
with my popsicle trays we're going to
make<00:01:30.900> two<00:01:31.229> trays<00:01:31.909> is<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.860> fill<00:01:34.860> them<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.100> water

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
make two trays is I fill them with water

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
make two trays is I fill them with water
and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.119> measure<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:36.810> how<00:01:37.140> much

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and then I measure to see how much

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.020 
and then I measure to see how much
liquid<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.890> was<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> need<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> each<00:01:38.820> one

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
liquid I was going to need and each one

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.760 
liquid I was going to need and each one
of<00:01:39.060> my<00:01:39.240> trays<00:01:39.570> holds<00:01:40.049> about<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.259> cup<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.740> half

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
of my trays holds about a cup and a half

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.539 
of my trays holds about a cup and a half
of<00:01:41.040> liquid<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.570> make<00:01:42.689> two<00:01:42.930> trays

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
of liquid so I'm going to make two trays

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.370 
of liquid so I'm going to make two trays
then<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> shoot<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.329> about<00:01:45.570> 3<00:01:46.079> cups

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
then I'm going to shoot for about 3 cups

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.780 
then I'm going to shoot for about 3 cups
of<00:01:46.740> liquid<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.780> liquid<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.259> go<00:01:49.409> up

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
of liquid so I want the liquid you go up

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.000 
of liquid so I want the liquid you go up
precut<00:01:50.510> much<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.230> know<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:51.740> have

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
precut much so that I know that I have

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.260 
precut much so that I know that I have
enough<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.490> fill<00:01:52.670> all<00:01:52.880> of<00:01:53.360> my<00:01:53.810> possible<00:01:54.320> trace

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
enough to fill all of my possible trace

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.480 
enough to fill all of my possible trace
so<00:01:56.270> we<00:01:57.140> have<00:01:57.350> a<00:01:57.380> recipe<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:57.920> makes<00:01:58.250> about

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
so we have a recipe that makes about

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.030 
so we have a recipe that makes about
three<00:01:58.760> cups<00:01:58.910> of<00:01:59.120> liquid<00:01:59.410> and<00:02:00.410> then<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:00.860> can

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
three cups of liquid and then you can

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.920 
three cups of liquid and then you can
play<00:02:01.280> with<00:02:01.490> if<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:01.820> need<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.300> little<00:02:02.600> bit<00:02:02.720> more

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
play with if you need a little bit more

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.260 
play with if you need a little bit more
you<00:02:03.200> can<00:02:03.380> add<00:02:03.560> some<00:02:03.860> other<00:02:04.010> ingredients<00:02:04.760> to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
you can add some other ingredients to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.270 
you can add some other ingredients to
make<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.630> volume<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.050> little<00:02:06.080> bit<00:02:06.350> more<00:02:06.530> so

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
make the volume a little bit more so

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.040 
make the volume a little bit more so

expand I think we'll never use expand
and<00:04:33.230> look<00:04:34.230> at<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.500> by<00:04:34.860> magic<00:04:35.610> we<00:04:36.090> actually
