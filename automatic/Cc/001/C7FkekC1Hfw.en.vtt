00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello friends now on your 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.529
 let's play apocalypse over here we see 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.960
 this is an ascetic main menu and you hear 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.849
 my standard substrate for silent movies 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.949
 why because it is very early 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.609
 version of the game and there is very little content 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:22.230
 I start it on easy 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.890
 I think go out why after 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.750
 and understand after the first couple of my deaths 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.470
 maybe and maybe guess 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.600
 Immediately the game is valid for the current min 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.829
 does not shine nor appearance 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.370
 filling but in this game personally for 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.370
 i'm important not to show this or more precisely in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.440
 This video for yourself set a goal for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.840
 more to show what's in the game 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.680
 there is now to tell something that you do not 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.510
 may appear if promises 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 developer will be executed but first 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.510
 I note that developers may even 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.769
 one person frankly we are now 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.710
 let's die to our friends developer 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.470
 honestly stated that the cycle would be very 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.509
 Should we not see the game for a very long time 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.180
 just did not even name the date not game 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.430
 not to notice us for the first time you killed 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.630
 see even on easy 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.340
 destroy the first zombie wrong 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.189
 just this time we start with 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.230
 ax and katana you with katana and night 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.250
 although probably now 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.880
 holy soul in general back to my 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.130
 the story 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.010
 the developer promised to implement 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.070
 many very interesting features 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.290
 somehow for example let's see if you 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.300
 anything so pretty now 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.490
 monotonous houses and in them as a rule 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.660
 here is in the same room with the bedroom 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.750
 is always 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.530
 bows if in some house there is like 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.410
 almost a hundred percent that he will 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.310
 here in this room yes that's how it is there 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.530
 ax general of this zombie safe 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.620
 weld through the window yes they are while you 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.300
 different serious artificial 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.520
 the intelligence of this case at hand so 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.100
 here about the promise of developers we 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:31.950
 we will have to lead let's say 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:35.070
 survivors on the created map but few 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.920
 will just collect these very survivors 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.790
 it will also be necessary to provide them 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.440
 equipment and resources for what we 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.200
 will need to capture various 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.650
 sector and above all buildings that is 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.940
 for example our survivors 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.580
 will be able to live in the houses that we 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.879
 freed secured will be able to erect 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.560
 what's there so what's called will 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.440
 build fortifications 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.190
 to make it easier to defend in zombies in 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.940
 Generally this is the case, we play elements 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.049
 articles and item on and space rockets 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.209
 certainly pretty simple i think but 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.909
 all the same they will be well for us naturally 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.410
 promise and elements lpg where now 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:27.000
 without them, action in general so far 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.310
 here is this bit of action yet to see 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:42.680
 nothing else but this body action 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:42.680
 now one more stupid zombie from such 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.099
 littered with 20 health 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.180
 I thought again, let's start again like this 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:58.140
 so my friends 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.120
 I will tell you honestly while the game of itself 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.569
 nothing interesting 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.900
 why because it is not a game it is rather 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.690
 a demonstration that a person works 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:14.750
 working on the project and so far his 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:17.430
 threw yes what we will see then me personally 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.370
 how optimists want to believe that we 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.770
 see at least some of what we 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.590
 promised because even if this 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.410
 part can be realized 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.860
 get a very interesting game because 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.810
 I would really like to see the game in 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.389
 which at the same time will be this way 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.199
 Combine elements of rpg and strategy and 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.820
 action zombie themes do not know 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.520
 probably most likely just a tribute to fashion 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.680
 which now we are just all over the place I 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.870
 I think it's no secret that now 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.570
 these games enjoy huge 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.400
 popular and therefore appear 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.520
 whole 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:01.009
 mountain days like mushrooms after rain so 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.940
 In general, I think that my video is already possible 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.620
 slowly round out i'll just tell you 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.500
 I will try to finish this 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:14.090
 total until the game is in very early 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.400
 development stage when we see 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.220
 some less playable version 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.240
 not yet known but big plans 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.930
 collection survivors of their accomplishment 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.669
 resource supply and of course I think that 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.710
 one of the most important parts naturally 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.600
 can be called action action vs zombies 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:38.300
 but here these seasoned shooter's 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:42.669
 very significant elements else 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.479
 same technical game too 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.400
 has a certain problem 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.229
 so you see some freezes 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.960
 pictures sometimes though maybe of course 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.090
 I just carries well and thanks to friends 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.759
 you for watching this video 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.630
 leave the name of any games by 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:02.680

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.680
 materials and bye
