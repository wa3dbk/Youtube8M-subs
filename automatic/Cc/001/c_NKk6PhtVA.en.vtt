this<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.780> what<00:00:03.929> we<00:00:04.020> use<00:00:04.200> for<00:00:04.670> mixing<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.759> dry

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970

tried all different methods and finally
this<00:00:18.260> was<00:00:18.440> the<00:00:18.530> one<00:00:18.680> we<00:00:18.800> settled<00:00:19.160> on<00:00:19.869> we<00:00:20.869> could

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
this was the one we settled on we could

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.010 
this was the one we settled on we could
make<00:00:21.170> up<00:00:21.320> quite<00:00:21.770> a<00:00:21.800> few<00:00:21.950> barrels<00:00:22.190> of<00:00:22.490> a<00:00:23.020> face

mixer<00:00:24.380> -<00:00:24.619> I'm<00:00:24.970> using<00:00:25.970> this<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:26.450> we've<00:00:26.570> got<00:00:26.689> our

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
mixer - I'm using this and we've got our

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.859 
mixer - I'm using this and we've got our
measurements<00:00:27.230> all<00:00:27.380> all<00:00:27.980> worked<00:00:28.310> out<00:00:28.660> so<00:00:29.660> if<00:00:29.779> we

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
measurements all all worked out so if we

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.460 
measurements all all worked out so if we
get<00:00:30.050> one<00:00:30.230> good<00:00:30.439> load<00:00:30.710> each<00:00:31.520> time<00:00:32.170> we<00:00:33.170> make<00:00:33.320> up

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
get one good load each time we make up

the bait me bass mix we load up these
big<00:00:37.070> barrels<00:00:38.350> see<00:00:39.350> we've<00:00:39.500> got<00:00:39.560> a<00:00:39.620> couple

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
big barrels see we've got a couple

they're ready to go they hold you know a
couple<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:42.800> under<00:00:42.980> pound<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.989> our<00:00:45.110> bass<00:00:45.290> mix

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
couple of under pound and our bass mix

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.279 
couple of under pound and our bass mix
we<00:00:45.770> take<00:00:45.950> from<00:00:46.160> there<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:47.750> I<00:00:47.809> measure<00:00:48.019> it<00:00:48.199> out

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
we take from there and I measure it out

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.090 
we take from there and I measure it out
carefully<00:00:49.090> into<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.120> white<00:00:50.780> bucket<00:00:51.019> and<00:00:51.920> that

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
carefully into a white bucket and that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.990 
carefully into a white bucket and that
white<00:00:52.280> bucket<00:00:52.519> represents<00:00:53.149> one<00:00:53.660> mix<00:00:54.879> as<00:00:55.879> you

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
white bucket represents one mix as you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.829 
white bucket represents one mix as you
can<00:00:56.120> see<00:00:56.269> we've<00:00:56.480> got<00:00:56.510> about<00:00:58.420> about<00:00:59.420> ten<00:00:59.660> and<00:00:59.750> a

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
can see we've got about about ten and a

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.189 
can see we've got about about ten and a
half<00:01:00.019> pound<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:02.300> way<00:01:02.449> it<00:01:02.539> works<00:01:02.749> out<00:01:02.899> of<00:01:03.079> our

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
half pound the way it works out of our

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.470 
half pound the way it works out of our
different<00:01:03.499> additives<00:01:03.890> that<00:01:04.190> go<00:01:05.120> into<00:01:05.300> the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
different additives that go into the

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.580 
different additives that go into the
basements<00:01:06.020> after<00:01:06.410> we've<00:01:06.909> mixed<00:01:07.909> all<00:01:08.210> up

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
basements after we've mixed all up

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.260 
basements after we've mixed all up
so<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:11.350> that's<00:01:12.350> our<00:01:12.530> base<00:01:12.710> mix<00:01:13.009> site<00:01:13.280> that

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
so that that's our base mix site that

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.830 
so that that's our base mix site that
one<00:01:14.540> set<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:14.960> base<00:01:15.170> mix<00:01:15.939> represents<00:01:16.939> a<00:01:17.000> 68<00:01:17.540> mix

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
one set of base mix represents a 68 mix

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.990 
one set of base mix represents a 68 mix
so<00:01:18.829> we<00:01:18.979> take<00:01:19.189> 68<00:01:19.869> break<00:01:20.869> them<00:01:20.990> up<00:01:21.610> add<00:01:22.610> one<00:01:22.880> of

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
so we take 68 break them up add one of

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.730 
so we take 68 break them up add one of
our<00:01:23.119> flavors<00:01:23.390> there's<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.930> few<00:01:24.110> of<00:01:24.200> our<00:01:24.259> flavors

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
our flavors there's a few of our flavors

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.929 
our flavors there's a few of our flavors
there<00:01:24.950> I<00:01:26.890> had<00:01:27.890> one<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.159> our<00:01:28.220> flavors<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:28.880> they

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
there I had one of our flavors and they

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.969 
there I had one of our flavors and they
go<00:01:29.060> into<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.360> big<00:01:29.509> mixer

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.999 

and<00:01:34.280> that's<00:01:34.850> added<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.479> dry<00:01:35.719> mix<00:01:36.009> all

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
and that's added to the dry mix all

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.399 
and that's added to the dry mix all
together<00:01:37.219> in<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.670> big<00:01:37.820> mixer<00:01:40.390> give<00:01:41.390> it<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.509> good

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
together in the big mixer give it a good

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.819 
together in the big mixer give it a good
mix<00:01:42.710> up<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.159> it<00:01:43.250> comes<00:01:43.429> out<00:01:43.610> into<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:43.820> nice

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829

work<00:05:22.000> out<00:05:22.120> really<00:05:22.330> well<00:05:22.630> I<00:05:24.120> never<00:05:25.120> use<00:05:25.330> use<00:05:26.110> a

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
work out really well I never use use a

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.590 
work out really well I never use use a
ton<00:05:26.410> of<00:05:26.440> wood<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.800> make<00:05:26.920> them<00:05:27.160> but<00:05:27.480> but<00:05:28.480> it's

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
ton of wood to make them but but it's

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.570 
ton of wood to make them but but it's
good<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:29.080> was

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.760 

so<00:05:32.150> this<00:05:32.300> rep<00:05:32.479> will<00:05:32.690> put<00:05:32.810> on<00:05:32.900> about<00:05:33.139> 70<00:05:33.530> pound

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
so this rep will put on about 70 pound

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.119 
so this rep will put on about 70 pound
which<00:05:33.949> is<00:05:34.069> what<00:05:34.190> will<00:05:34.910> make<00:05:34.940> Senoia<00:05:36.039> and<00:05:37.039> then

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
which is what will make Senoia and then

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.430 
which is what will make Senoia and then
we'll<00:05:37.220> do<00:05:37.310> that<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.490> couple<00:05:37.669> of<00:05:37.789> times<00:05:37.879> a<00:05:38.150> week

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
we'll do that a couple of times a week

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.399 
we'll do that a couple of times a week
and<00:05:39.440> that<00:05:39.590> gives<00:05:39.770> us<00:05:39.889> enough<00:05:40.240> light<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.270> see<00:05:41.419> we

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
and that gives us enough light to see we

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:47.619 
and that gives us enough light to see we
use<00:05:42.530> a<00:05:42.590> lot<00:05:42.710> of<00:05:42.740> I<00:05:44.470> will<00:05:45.470> typically<00:05:45.800> buy<00:05:46.039> up<00:05:46.629> two
