00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 after 8 long years of developers from 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.420

 March 2013 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310
 and accessible to the masses the game became 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.910
 in November of the same year and although over 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.730
 by creation 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.470
 alvin worked only 15 people a total 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.029
 financing was modest 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.309
 1600000 dollars 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.739
 alvin has already conquered the unreachable for 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.660
 many other games tops including 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.550
 took the award for the best browser in 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.680
 blog we sat on the portal joystick and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.690
 won in greenlight gathering in 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.000
 in the near future go to steam 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.020
 let's see together 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.120
 allowed the project to achieve such success 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.640
 first about bad unfortunately interesting 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.340
 storylines new MCI to not shine 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.690
 although it did more than 8 years and so for it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.260
 time you could think of something 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.960
 sensible 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.489
 scripted over generations 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.680
 the kingdom of eldin flourished and his 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.260
 the inhabitants lived in peace and harmony 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.049
 however, suddenly discovered special 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 magical spheres possessing a mysterious 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.090
 force capable of destroying all life on 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.680
 royal decree dangerous 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.770
 artifacts hid in the far corners 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.290
 empire but it was too late thirst 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.180
 the authorities have clouded the mind of the defenders to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.700
 same lord infernal mp 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.009
 emperor tristan clear villain judging by 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.350
 the name of the country aimed at conquering 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.189
 spheres and only one path remains 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.680
 block 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.540
 the kingdom of oldrin in general everything is like that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.210
 very trite though as it says folk 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.340
 wisdom fritupley us have a horse in the teeth not 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.140
 watching adventure by tradition 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.090
 character creation begins in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.369
 simple editor just know that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.560
 no classes and professions at first 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.750
 choose will not have to go first 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.640
 learning there and we will meet 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.290
 local graphics are not at all 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.979
 corresponding to the 2014 level here 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.930
 game creation time 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.570
 affected in full 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.880
 but music and sound are not distracting 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.049
 even the opposite of gameplay inspire 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.840
 accomplishment of feats 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.830
 but stop i got distracted and so at the end 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.650
 your teaching mission 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.900
 drag the monster into the cave you jump into 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.020
 portal and find yourself in the city there then us and 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.540
 Elvin will evaluate in all its glory here 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.640
 What do you think is important in the MRC with 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.800
 sloping action right boevka 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.690
 to master it is not easy but very simple 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.880
 click on the foe 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.640
 and attack it without forgetting timely 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.170
 apply the skill of destruction methods 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.420
 the enemy is also familiar with 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.580
 the help of melee weapons swords and 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.220
 axes of clubs and the like magic 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.290
 all sorts of bows there is not difficult to understand and 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.360
 in 6 characteristics by which 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.400
 can increase the damage from a certain 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.470
 type of weapon to increase the standard of living 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.630
 accuracy but and so on and that's what 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.120
 really distinguishes l2 from others 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.690
 browsers so this is an impressive system 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.970
 talents 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.280
 there are 6 branches in each of which 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.590
 more than 30 abilities affecting 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.020
 character development correctly pumped 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.150
 skills are the key to successful destruction 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.880
 the enemy but be careful 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.100
 English game is a chance to make a mistake with 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.959
 choice besides most talents 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.300
 one branch requires 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.860
 a certain number of previous ones 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.170
 that is sprayed over several 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.690
 directions don't make sense you just don't 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.700
 enough points but the result is worth it 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.980
 let's say full templar leveling 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.019
 turns a character into a tank with a huge 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.030
 the amount of armor and health a sword 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.340
 will make you a killing machine 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.560
 spreading deadly spells 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.450
 another chip is a direct link 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.970
 talents with class spells 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.920
 enhancing the effectiveness of skills that 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.440
 which is already hinting at 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.239
 the need for specialization of the hero so 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.610
 that for example who chose the path of a warrior 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.200
 better quickly explore the decrease 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.510
 skill recovery rates 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.370
 used with a two-handed weapon if he 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.769
 really wants to be effective 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.540
 Fighter certainly impressive dimensions 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.760
 virtual world on research 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.920
 which u and then not one day game 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.239
 time you will not believe it though 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.760
 browser mmorpg 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.010
 but an inexperienced hero easily gets lost in 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.110
 maze of locations besides huge 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.000
 open spaces are just colossal 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.430
 opportunities for players preferring 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.410
 peaceful pastime including 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.540
 gathering and croft in l2 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.850
 as many as seven search related skills 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.890
 resources from mushrooms on the clearing to 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.430
 gems in the mine and 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.530
 pumping these skills about 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.720
 walks automatically as you apply 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.550
 well and without creating items from these 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.160
 most resources too 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.620
 another integral part of the game became 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.410
 spells magic types as species 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.530
 the heroes here are three miles range and sang for 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.900
 warrior archer and mage respectively 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.180
 most of them are familiar to everyone by 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.720
 gram fantasies but there are interesting 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.030
 samples 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.190
 for example full tires on her fiftieth 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.560
 level creates a powerful shock wave 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.750
 in addition also fry your enemies besides 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.910
 there are fighting spells and universal 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.639
 facilitating hard working days 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.860
 characters of all classes finally need 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.050
 put a plus to the project and for the big 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.789
 the number of both single and group 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.830
 dungeons though find a command for 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.080
 passage dungeon difficult but 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.389
 fans of quests will not be bored 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.009
 currently more than six missions 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.440
 hundreds and this despite the fact that 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.509
 this browser and no year week there 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.979
 philbin and the possibility of investing real 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.530
 money in the project which greatly facilitates 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.360
 life although in principle you can play without 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.550
 real but be prepared for the fact that 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.820
 earn a cool ammunition will 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.430
 oh how long by and large alvin 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.680
 very unusual browser mmorpg with 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.050
 good starting data big 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.240
 World dynamic boevkoy and mass 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.310
 interesting quests unfortunately first 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.860
 impression spoils the aging 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.810
 Graphics meet as is known for clothing 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.400
 but you remember that the development 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.050
 engaged in a small studio 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.270
 which means to find fault with her 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.070
 the creation is not worth it and yet the developers 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.960
 will have to try hard to 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.210
 bring your creation to people however 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.680
 after the people in steam on servers 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.870
 obviously will be more 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.659
 i will win will be a great chance 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.940
 to succeed is the main thing to create 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.940
 or managed to take this chance
