00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.970
 I'll tell you what you do to take the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.910
 login password at the time you go 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.859
 to enter the windows 10 computer 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.619
 I believe that on windows 8 it's the same 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.779
 procedure so if you have 28 you can 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.290
 do the same thing 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:41.340
 first you will do a following 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:47.640
 the windows button but r the two screen 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:01:03.379

00:00:47.640 --> 00:01:03.379
