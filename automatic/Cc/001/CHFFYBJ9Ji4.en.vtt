00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.859
 Hello, I'm 20 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 I'm a fashion designer founder 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.460
 model at castings based in berlin 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.109
 because I'm very involved in knitting 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.490
 worker and even big fan of 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.230
 knit fabrics I am this year too 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.949
 a very good topic as his trainer 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.050
 with Michael 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:38.910
 These are 1 course to pack this course 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.710
 So you're learning to knit again 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.090
 material bypasses which cinder track 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.940
 be skeptical that namely the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.920
 umbrella term for knit fabrics 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.649
 There are just the knit fabrics to it 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.440
 what different bonds we have 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.690
 Which kind of knitwear? 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.710
 come out of it and it seems truer 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.399
 I'll be a bit more specific 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.260
 to explain 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.180
 also with regard to cut and in relation 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.740
 Sewing on yourself how to do that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.450
 industry believes 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.920
 We will be the topic of all 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.920
 pages illuminate from the outside and from 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.540
 inside we look very closely at which 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.150
 There are, of course, and there is, of course, one 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.950
 project and looks into this project 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.230
 That's her back on the doll 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.750
 knit cardigan then relatively simple 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.370
 cuts have chosen me and I 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.140
 I sewed the bucket here in these 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.880
 very very thick knit fabric we will 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.340
 So look at how these patterns look like 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.050
 processing makes whole again also 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.310
 Inside and out, what looks like 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.880
 must pay attention to these very thick 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.070
 materials 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.140
 Of course we will do this together 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 Here again in a slightly thinner 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.070
 process fabric 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.360
 we will use a feed for it 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.570
 that is, the Simkar hire you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.280
 Take once with and once without food 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.110
 and of course, ours 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.690
 the main concern here is the real one 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.130
 cardigan that we go completely that is 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.080
 the fabric we also use in our micros 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.150
 have packed box in it you find 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.590
 Both the cut gear as well 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.530
 also the fabric of your home 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.330
 comes that you want all that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.460
 together then you need a few more 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.040
 weights if you have a scooter knife 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.720
 good at home is a pair of scissors and the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.399
 very sharp denies these strictly 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.039
 Some of the fabrics are also called thick fabrics 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.890
 need to cut a small scissors yes 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.570
 a small hand measures exactly 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.890
 Safety pins needles are important 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.460
 and of course not on the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.040
 have a table 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.540
 Who our sewing machine you can call 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.950
 normal with a household machine 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.690
 but you can also use it 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.870
 a lok machine if you have one 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.930
 of course have nice if the edges in 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.890
 are wonderfully clean and enchants 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.510
 not really know outside 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.730
 except that deal with a machine 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.610
 must and what is with this 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.430
 best tips assures 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.430
 for you, a contract remains until next
