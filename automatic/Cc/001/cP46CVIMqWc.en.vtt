done that wrong this defense is actually
decent<00:01:39.649> I<00:01:40.100> reckon<00:01:40.520> if<00:01:40.640> this<00:01:40.820> was<00:01:41.060> played<00:01:41.420> in

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
decent I reckon if this was played in

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.209 
decent I reckon if this was played in
real<00:01:41.840> life<00:01:42.079> like<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.530> wouldn't<00:01:42.860> lose<00:01:42.979> that

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
real life like we wouldn't lose that

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.850 
real life like we wouldn't lose that
much<00:01:43.490> maybe<00:01:44.000> by<00:01:44.360> tengo<00:01:44.780> tengo<00:01:45.049> cesare<00:01:45.530> nothing

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
much maybe by tengo tengo cesare nothing

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.709 
much maybe by tengo tengo cesare nothing
football<00:01:46.189> ok<00:01:46.670> fat<00:01:46.969> goes<00:01:47.240> isn't<00:01:47.450> nothing

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.690 
football ok fat goes isn't nothing
football<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:48.500> probably<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.159> fine<00:01:49.399> ill

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
football so probably is that fine ill

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.340 
football so probably is that fine ill
but<00:01:50.060> that's<00:01:50.270> decent<00:01:50.509> with<00:01:50.930> a<00:01:50.960> new<00:01:51.109> bit<00:01:51.140> of

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
but that's decent with a new bit of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.569 
but that's decent with a new bit of
practice<00:01:51.680> we<00:01:51.799> might<00:01:52.009> be<00:01:52.159> able<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.460> actually

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
practice we might be able to actually

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.670 
practice we might be able to actually
win<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.030> game<00:01:53.270> though<00:01:53.689> fans<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.200> girl<00:01:54.469> don't
