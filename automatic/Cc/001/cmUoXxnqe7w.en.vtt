00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:39.809
 Today I pass the level of the participant all 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:42.030
 at the beginning then what I forgot because 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.550
 then I did just how I worked 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:51.020
 I also combine the inner part of the biceps with 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.020
 triceps muscle antagonist very good 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:00.600
 rich muscle shrinking tongue 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.059
 2 here and when we cut the second 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.830
 muscle shake the world again before scattering for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.810
 biceps any exercise 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.300
 which I can always combine this 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.850
 make sure 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.850
 well wait, how about water biceps I went to 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:24.790
 pyramid of the so -called two-step 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.100
 kilogram did the machine itself 8 as the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.200
 same little fox little weight on 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.380
 eight times the biggest weight at once 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.720
 you can make this pyramid 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:43.210
 ten times the biggest weight 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:46.810
 general pyramid 5 dumbbells step 2 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.479
 kilograms the largest of the work 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.119
 either by 1 or two depending 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.860
 from this work the smallest knit 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.680
 by 8 or 10 repetitions and each time 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.170
 weight increases by 2 kilograms 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.729
 the number of repetitions is reduced if 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.340
 we go accordingly from less weight 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.009
 no longer can go from the larger to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.329
 lesser 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:18.720
 and here also load down with small 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:21.750
 weight shock went to the amount we have 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.480
 work standing leggings back so that 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.489
 us and the man of me as much as possible 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.680
 vertically perpendicular small 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.109
 not well and works on 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.090
 the number of times when I work from scratch 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.090
 again yes I don't like working with 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.190
 surface does not work 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.069
 small corners and main 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.139
 coming on big we will regret to 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.260
 the little ones will not work it out so 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:54.180
 the weights are bad so i'm for 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.859
 if the king lets you let me have been 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.389
 there is no injury yes to the back there 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:02.659
 because it's all very individual 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:06.329
 work neat history backwater 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:09.209
 elbows back and back straight and running 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.150
 accordingly depending on the purpose 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.980
 which we put 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.360
 biceps exercise can combine them 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.420
 can make of them another program 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.080
 good luck everybody less in the morning and see you on 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.080
