00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
first thing we're doing is laying them

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.460 
first thing we're doing is laying them
down<00:01:12.950> however<00:01:13.520> want<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:13.880> have<00:01:14.060> them<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:14.540> have

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
in mind that the photos in the middle

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.740 
in mind that the photos in the middle
won't<00:01:18.380> be<00:01:18.619> visible<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.970> ugliest

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.190 
won't be visible so have the ugliest
photos<00:01:21.350> there<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:23.090> can<00:01:23.270> also<00:01:23.299> do<00:01:23.780> what<00:01:24.020> I

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
photos there and you can also do what I

did<00:01:24.260> I<00:01:24.680> found<00:01:25.070> some<00:01:25.490> photos<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:26.540> I<00:01:26.750> didn't

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
did I found some photos that I didn't

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.859 
did I found some photos that I didn't
like<00:01:27.409> but<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.100> backgrounds<00:01:28.729> were<00:01:29.000> beautiful

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
like but the backgrounds were beautiful

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.920 
like but the backgrounds were beautiful
so<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.200> was<00:01:30.500> really<00:01:30.770> suitable

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.360 

next<00:01:36.930> time<00:01:37.080> grabbing<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> mirror<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:38.010> see<00:01:38.220> how

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
next time grabbing the mirror to see how

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.750 
next time grabbing the mirror to see how
it<00:01:38.490> looks<00:01:38.760> and<00:01:39.290> moving<00:01:40.290> some<00:01:40.560> photos<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
it looks and moving some photos but and

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.490 
it looks and moving some photos but and
now<00:01:41.910> we're<00:01:42.120> going<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.480> glue<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> photos<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
now we're going to glue the photos to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100 
now we're going to glue the photos to
the<00:01:43.620> canvas<00:01:44.130> I'm<00:01:44.700> using<00:01:45.120> the<00:01:45.390> harpy<00:01:45.720> glue<00:01:45.870> from

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the canvas I'm using the harpy glue from

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
the canvas I'm using the harpy glue from
Tiger<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.790> worked<00:01:48.030> perfectly<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.870> would

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
Tiger and it worked perfectly I would

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.670 
Tiger and it worked perfectly I would
not<00:01:49.440> recommend<00:01:49.800> to<00:01:50.250> use<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.700> hot<00:01:50.970> glue<00:01:51.000> gun

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
not recommend to use a hot glue gun

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.890 
not recommend to use a hot glue gun
because<00:01:52.680> most<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> time<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.300> see<00:01:54.570> on

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
because most of the time you can see on

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.100 
because most of the time you can see on
the<00:01:55.050> photos<00:01:55.470> where<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> glue<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.640> behind<00:01:57.360> so

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the photos where the glue is behind so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.410 
the photos where the glue is behind so
use<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.740> regular<00:01:58.920> glue<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.580> this<00:01:59.730> step<00:01:59.940> you<00:02:05.420> can

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
use a regular glue for this step you can

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.940 
use a regular glue for this step you can
see<00:02:06.690> that<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:06.930> use<00:02:07.170> some<00:02:07.380> black<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.800> white

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
see that I use some black and white

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.850 
see that I use some black and white
pictures<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.790> colored<00:02:09.330> pictures<00:02:09.720> turned<00:02:10.680> out

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
pictures and colored pictures turned out

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.130 
pictures and colored pictures turned out
pretty<00:02:11.190> good<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.990> also

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
pretty good I think but you can also

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.160 
pretty good I think but you can also
find<00:02:13.470> some<00:02:13.620> pictures<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.220> magazines<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:15.180> use

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
find some pictures in magazines and use

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.080 
find some pictures in magazines and use
them<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.500> make<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.860> photo<00:02:17.160> College<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
them to make a photo College the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.780 
them to make a photo College the
possibilities<00:02:18.810> are<00:02:18.840> endless<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:25.580> just<00:02:26.580> keep

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
possibilities are endless so just keep

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.340 
possibilities are endless so just keep
going<00:02:27.030> until<00:02:27.270> you're<00:02:27.600> finished<00:02:27.780> with<00:02:28.110> all<00:02:28.320> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
going until you're finished with all the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.310 
going until you're finished with all the
photos<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.270> always<00:02:30.270> measure<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.900> between

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
photos and always measure in between

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.990 
photos and always measure in between
with<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.560> mirror<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.190> make<00:02:32.340> sure<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.820> get

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
with a mirror to make sure you get

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.400 
with a mirror to make sure you get
exactly<00:02:33.210> what<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.110> were<00:02:34.320> looking<00:02:34.470> for

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.140 

that's<00:02:41.410> basically<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.950> for<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.250> DIY<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:43.000> can

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
that's basically it for this DIY you can

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.760 
that's basically it for this DIY you can
put<00:02:43.300> some<00:02:43.450> articles<00:02:43.840> over<00:02:43.990> if<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.380> want<00:02:44.560> to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
put some articles over if you want to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.790 
put some articles over if you want to
but<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.340> not<00:02:45.459> necessary<00:02:46.330> but<00:02:47.110> then<00:02:47.530> just

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
but it's not necessary but then just

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.559 
but it's not necessary but then just
glue<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.160> mirror<00:02:48.370> with<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.610> hot<00:02:48.850> glue<00:02:49.150> gun<00:02:49.180> the

glue the mirror with a hot glue gun the
glue<00:02:49.840> dries<00:02:50.140> really<00:02:50.440> fast<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.250> good<00:02:51.459> to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
glue dries really fast so it's good to

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.610 

first<00:03:47.510> we're<00:03:47.720> going<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:47.990> place<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.350> tape<00:03:48.590> on

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
first we're going to place the tape on

first we're going to place the tape on

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.860 
the outside of the glass container and
because<00:03:51.560> always<00:03:51.860> is<00:03:52.400> circular<00:03:53.030> we<00:03:53.690> have

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
because always is circular we have

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.310 
depended accordingly boundary I decided
to<00:04:00.740> take<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.160> entire<00:04:01.310> ways<00:04:02.120> just<00:04:02.810> in<00:04:03.080> case

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
to take the entire ways just in case

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.770 
to take the entire ways just in case
they<00:04:03.590> would<00:04:03.680> go<00:04:03.860> any<00:04:04.100> paint<00:04:04.490> on<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:05.030> it's

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
they would go any paint on it it's

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.580 
they would go any paint on it it's
better<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.440> be<00:04:06.560> safe<00:04:06.770> than<00:04:06.830> sorry

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.260 

next<00:04:12.590> grab<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:12.980> paint<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.550> sponge<00:04:13.880> it's

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
next grab the paint and the sponge it's

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.330 
next grab the paint and the sponge it's
not<00:04:14.480> necessary<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.110> use<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.320> sponge<00:04:15.770> I<00:04:16.070> just

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
not necessary to use the sponge I just

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.120 
not necessary to use the sponge I just
prefer<00:04:16.820> that<00:04:16.989> but<00:04:17.989> talking<00:04:18.350> about<00:04:18.530> what's

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
prefer that but talking about what's

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.300 
prefer that but talking about what's
necessary<00:04:19.880> paint<00:04:20.690> away<00:04:21.410> from<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:21.980> tape

necessary paint away from the tape

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.580 
necessary paint away from the tape
you're<00:04:23.060> much<00:04:23.300> more<00:04:23.570> likely<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:24.020> get<00:04:24.260> straight

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
you're much more likely to get straight

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.140 
you're much more likely to get straight
lines<00:04:24.890> if<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.400> do<00:04:25.610> that

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
lines if you do that

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.170 
lines if you do that
so<00:04:26.419> have<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:26.750> in<00:04:27.169> mind

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
so have that in mind

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.510 
so have that in mind
let's<00:04:30.180> me<00:04:30.539> know<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.319> the<00:04:31.949> reason<00:04:32.310> why<00:04:32.400> I'm

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
let's me know this the reason why I'm

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.129 
let's me know this the reason why I'm
painting<00:04:32.879> first<00:04:33.090> with<00:04:33.389> this<00:04:33.569> paint<00:04:33.930> is

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
painting first with this paint is

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.589 
painting first with this paint is
because<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.680> spray<00:04:34.949> paint<00:04:35.190> is<00:04:35.789> so<00:04:36.090> thin<00:04:36.419> that

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
because the spray paint is so thin that

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.520 
because the spray paint is so thin that
it<00:04:37.139> would<00:04:37.349> easily<00:04:37.620> drip<00:04:38.069> under<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.669> tape<00:04:38.909> and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
it would easily drip under the tape and

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.740 
it would easily drip under the tape and
ruin<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.710> straight<00:04:41.039> line<00:04:41.490> thing<00:04:41.909> here<00:04:42.509> you

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
ruin the straight line thing here you

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.860 
ruin the straight line thing here you
know<00:04:42.979> yeah<00:04:43.979> so<00:04:44.580> that's<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:45.030> main<00:04:45.240> reason<00:04:45.599> for

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
know yeah so that's the main reason for

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.649 
know yeah so that's the main reason for
this

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:51.659 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.050 

I<00:04:51.690> waited<00:04:52.590> for<00:04:52.800> like<00:04:52.949> five<00:04:53.159> minutes<00:04:53.340> until<00:04:53.819> I

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
I waited for like five minutes until I

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.839 
I waited for like five minutes until I
start<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:54.569> spray<00:04:54.960> paint<00:04:55.289> but<00:04:55.560> then<00:04:56.430> you<00:04:56.669> want

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
start to spray paint but then you want

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.969 
start to spray paint but then you want
to<00:04:56.940> wait<00:04:57.120> again<00:04:57.599> for<00:04:57.870> like<00:04:58.199> eight<00:04:58.470> minutes

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
to wait again for like eight minutes

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.330 
to wait again for like eight minutes
maybe<00:04:59.639> and<00:05:00.139> after<00:05:01.139> that<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.800> can<00:05:01.979> start<00:05:02.250> to

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
maybe and after that you can start to

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.379 
maybe and after that you can start to
peel<00:05:02.550> off<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:02.880> tape<00:05:03.259> carefully<00:05:08.240> now<00:05:09.240> your
