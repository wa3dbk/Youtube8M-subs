00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:13.120
 and hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.160
 limestone today I wanted to tell you 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.650
 about one very interesting team in 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.070
 minecraft called samantha links 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.900
 and 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.970
 and so what is the essence of this 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.759
 teams but maybe many of you know 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.189
 that commands himself he serves to 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.480
 call various mobs with some kind of 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.000
 unusual properties 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.010
 however it also serves to 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.219
 cause blocks like that of us 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.950
 he himself spelled out further phalanx and tidy 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.680
 that represent the coordinates of the variables 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.380
 there is always 0.1.0 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.210
 further spelled title and do this 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:51.040
 of this it means aldi good land with 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.750
 grass yes here we have nothing 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.730
 remarkable block with grass and this is it 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.160
 go here spelled out further spelled out 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.180
 motion 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.540
 005, but more precisely 001 300500 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.939
 and the brackets are closed 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.540
 the essence of this command the essence is that 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.700
 title attributed 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.180
 properties of the block on which 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.930
 written yde ie a motion this movement 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.000
 that is, it will move with such and such but I 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.690
 don't even know with such a speed with 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.550
 so much power we push a blog about which 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.060
 registered here that is we click on 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.900
 button and we have a05 power block 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.790
 on a toy moves up to like this 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.160
 here we can also freely 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.250
 change this command that is if we 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.070
 For example, we introduce here but let's say 4 tones with 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.530
 the block will fly away that way and calmly 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.630
 get up here somewhere yes here and so here it is 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.180
 works quite well I think 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.160
 Well, the coordinates are used to 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.310
 find actually this unit because 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.290
 that it is necessary to put it all means here in 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.620
 this place but you can put it of course 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.770
 and that is a little bit higher then we 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.229
 just prescribe 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.119
 higher well coordinates higher and then it will be 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.459
 move this particular block yes all 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.890
 simple enough and he broke about 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.769
 something he fell out like sand sometimes falls 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.840
 the torch is mined so and so here we have 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.160
 here we have the exact same 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.760
 team but between id and motion is written 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.480
 time 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.480
 what is time time one creates a blog not 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.670
 depends well that is how it moves the block 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.650
 regardless of whether it is on top 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.019
 command block livania that is, if 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.860
 there is no grass block nothing will happen 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.769
 if red is in every place 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.410
 then everything will work fine if 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.230
 it is not all bad but there is 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.060
 some strange lags and here is a block 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.220
 which we signed will be free 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.799
 spawn even no matter what 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.220
 he is not, that is, he will move 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.960
 no matter what it is not 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.630
 bathe and all of us iron appears 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.110
 block here is such a command sound funk 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.020
 the stage 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.220
 coordinates where to get this block 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.200
 Haydee time &amp; motion movement what we 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.350
 need x 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.560
 y and z next we have another interesting 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.710
 command even the most functions but between 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.770
 type of a lady with time we have written 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.100
 trails and there alone what is it trail there 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:32.900
 one prescribes a breakdown that will 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:36.620
 falling properties can be said not 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.200
 exist an environment in which he cannot 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.870
 exist well as it were if this 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.700
 the block falls on Wednesday where it can't 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.730
 exist it falls out that is just 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.490
 Patsa and all he fell as how happens if 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.450
 sand falls on say torch redstone 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.490
 or ordinary fakir 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.610
 that is, we press the god of the earth appears 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.370
 she fall torch he falls if removed 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.200
 drops there then he most likely just 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.120
 set let's by the way check 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.840
 give an hour, remove dr experience and see 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.239
 what will happen at all 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.730
 no he still bottle very strange 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.540
 oh well we go further here we have 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.079
 cheerful jumping block yes he weighed 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.900
 jumps 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.690
 it's a block of redstone so can do 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.160
 Only the block table is necessary unfortunately and so 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.160
 what is there to eat on here is nothing special 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.090
 same phonics and same 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.919
 The coordinates of the ID are worth it. 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.900
 clouds and motion 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.030
 yes everything is as usual why is he 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.979
 jump well because it's a damn block 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.530
 redstone ie if we are now 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.710
 try to remove and he's playing he is cool 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.250
 damn yes if we try to remove 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.280
 then I could show that you can put 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.470
 block redstone on the command block and he 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.870
 it simply activates ie every time 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.330
 when this block rises and back 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.820
 regards the command block he him 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.010
 activates and forces itself 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.990
 jump that is like this 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.510
 works that is, we have a team we 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.220
 put a block of red stone and he jumps 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.320
 just because it activates the blog 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.450
 teams that makes him jump 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.560
 Well, you can continue to create such 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.610
 here are interesting 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.250
 I don't know how to call it 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.169
 pieces when a block from one place jump 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.849
 on the other well, everything is clear that is myself 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.660
 he phalanx and again the same 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:29.810
 coordinates and the same idea of motion 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.960
 arranged so that 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.940
 this is the block we moved to 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.919
 the side to which he needs to move 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.090
 to get to the next command 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.910
 unit and honestly the option is somehow very 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.550
 strangely passing because sort of hotel 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.710
 stella he basically jumped normally 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.480
 everything was good and wonderful but here 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.680
 now we are in some strange jumps 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.900
 that is, kn 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.510
 teleported slope bow ported 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.820
 it's a little weird but in general that is 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.610
 another fun scheme here we have 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:01.430
 spelled the most phalanx and the same 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.800
 one title 42 i.e. go to command 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.050
 this is not iron itself 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.460
 block time one to block itself 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.070
 created and motion 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.700
 Well, the motion you can build yourself 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.479
 unless of course you want to reproduce this 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.270
 the team itself also we have again 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:22.850
 iron block and here we have these 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.100
 pumpkins yes here's the most usual pumpkin and so 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.520
 what this command does we click on 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.229
 the lever flies a bunch of blocks and they all fall 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.729
 in such a way that burned iron 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.220
 Golem regret it is not very visible and 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.750
 understandable and he generally with the memory somewhere not 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.120
 so wrong but still he 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.320
 spawns on that is spawns 4 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.550
 iron blocks let's see again 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.170
 they fall in such a way that 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.480
 an iron golem lining up 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.449
 pumpkin drops though a little logan but all 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.449
 it still falls and will work on the article 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.729
 brother go away please hinder your 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:56.159
 breathing but in general 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:56.460
 How does the Samantha links team work ? 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:58.259
 and 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.939
 I think it's just wonderful 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.919
 the team is very interesting you can 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.789
 create amazing cards for example here 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.620
 with such blocks 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.360
 I hope that if you will 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.249
 play that team us will you 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.030
 correctly flip the block from block to 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:13.490
 blog because here you saw that is 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.130
 here we have here all the pancake works then 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.320
 there they fall beautifully yes that is they 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.750
 jump fall everything beautifully happens a 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.210
 here something is wrong 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.010
 strange well and in general this is all i 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.690
 I wanted to show you all today thanks 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.370
 like a look put friends call 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.440
 leave comments and also not 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.130
 forget to subscribe to the channel with you was 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.350
 lime table 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.350
 good luck to all and golem flew
