00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
can like set that as like position one

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.830 
can like set that as like position one
as<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.570> says<00:04:04.810> let's<00:04:05.800> try<00:04:05.950> again<00:04:09.600> no<00:04:10.600> I

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
as it says let's try again no I

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.229 
as it says let's try again no I

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
second position set would okay that

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.749 
second position set would okay that
works<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:20.829> then<00:04:20.979> you<00:04:21.099> can<00:04:21.220> make<00:04:21.310> giant<00:04:21.489> walls
