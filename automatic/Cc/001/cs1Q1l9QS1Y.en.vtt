00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.219
 as you have seen create a shocking intro 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.320
 for your videos it's really easy but 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.160
 well first of all let me leave my 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.320
 presence' 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.270
 a year ago I started business by 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.539
 Internet they met with the 500 in the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.619
 issue, how does most people start? 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.689
 after investigating the niches of 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.880
 market where I could focus my business 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.129
 I realized that the subject that I liked 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.809
 it was marketing with videos but I had 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.330
 a problem I had never made a video 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.100
 professional in my life and much less with 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.989
 business purposes 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.030
 that is, I had signed videos with my 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.760
 camcorder and had them uploaded to youtube 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.470
 but I really did not know how to edit them and 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.050
 improve them so that they really look 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.730
 professionals and after evaluating 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.620
 many entrepreneurs who make videos 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.350
 for your online business I realized 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.030
 that very few but really very few 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.000
 they knew how to create videos really 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.100
 professionals and that if I learned I could 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.199
 teach entrepreneurs how to make them 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.630
 then start to train in this 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.880
 thematic to learn how to make videos 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.130
 professionals for my business and after 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.380
 of a few months I already knew everything 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.000
 I needed to know how to do that 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.340
 means that if I was a complete 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.560
 novice making professional videos and 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.179
 I could learn that means that you 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.090
 You can also learn how to make videos 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.009
 professionals 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.570
 in the trainings that I took I gave 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.799
 mind that one of the things that 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.049
 greatly improved the 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.210
 professionalism of a video was that 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.950
 had a shocking intro when I 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.299
 I saw the intros of the videos told me 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.310
 buff 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.020
 this must be very difficult to do until 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.610
 that one day someone showed me how to do 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.439
 an intro and finally I realized 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.969
 us what was it doing when 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.490
 they have the tools and the templates 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.670
 appropriate and that anyone can 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.959
 do in 3 shocking to climb 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.119
