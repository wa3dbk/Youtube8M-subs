know what if you want to make this
recipe<00:00:36.350> you<00:00:37.350> need<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.739> put<00:00:38.040> more<00:00:38.489> yeast<00:00:39.149> into

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
recipe you need to put more yeast into

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.549 
recipe you need to put more yeast into
it<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.920> those<00:00:41.579> yeast<00:00:42.000> can<00:00:42.390> fully<00:00:42.809> process

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it so that those yeast can fully process

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.750 
it so that those yeast can fully process
your<00:00:44.460> sugar<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.690> alcohol<00:00:46.579> fermenting<00:00:47.579> to

your sugar into alcohol fermenting to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.020 
your sugar into alcohol fermenting to
dryness<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.840> call<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.670> put

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
dryness is what we call it so if you put

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.319 
dryness is what we call it so if you put
too<00:00:51.719> little<00:00:52.219> yeast<00:00:53.219> into<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.120> times

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
too little yeast into it a lot of times

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.350 
too little yeast into it a lot of times
it'll<00:00:54.539> mess<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.620> batch<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.370> sometimes<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it'll mess up the batch so sometimes you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.020 
it'll mess up the batch so sometimes you
have<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> build<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.410> yeast<00:00:58.680> colony<00:00:59.309> into<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
have to build your yeast colony into a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.959 
have to build your yeast colony into a
stronger<00:01:00.809> yeast<00:01:01.500> colony<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.219> simply<00:01:02.640> more

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
stronger yeast colony with simply more

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.080 
stronger yeast colony with simply more
cells<00:01:03.619> how<00:01:04.619> would<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.939> would

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
cells how would you do that you would

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.109 
cells how would you do that you would
use<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.390> yeast<00:01:06.840> starter<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.920> yeast<00:01:08.670> starter

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
use a yeast starter a yeast starter

includes or would actually consist of
some<00:01:13.650> equipment<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.369> some<00:01:14.580> ingredients<00:01:14.880> okay

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
some equipment and some ingredients okay

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
some equipment and some ingredients okay
so<00:01:16.409> i'm<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.920> show<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.430> equipment

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
so i'm going to show you the equipment

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.510 
so i'm going to show you the equipment
the<00:01:18.900> equipment<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.130> would<00:01:20.250> need<00:01:20.460> would

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the equipment that you would need would

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.679 
the equipment that you would need would
be<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.210> flask<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> bottle<00:01:23.090> such<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.450> one

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
be a flask or a bottle such as this one

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.679 
be a flask or a bottle such as this one
here<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.830> foam<00:01:26.070> stopper<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.030> foam

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
here and then a foam stopper a foam

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.050 
here and then a foam stopper a foam
stopper<00:01:28.290> allows<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> little<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.280> oxygen<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
stopper allows a little bit of oxygen to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.569 
stopper allows a little bit of oxygen to
interact<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:30.810> during<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.650> first<00:01:32.250> stage

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
interact because during the first stage

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
interact because during the first stage
of<00:01:32.850> yeast<00:01:33.180> growth<00:01:33.600> they're<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> want<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
of yeast growth they're going to want to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.030 
of yeast growth they're going to want to
absorb<00:01:34.829> oxygen<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:36.320> combination<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.680> flask

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
absorb oxygen so combination of a flask

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.300 
absorb oxygen so combination of a flask
and<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.790> stopper<00:01:39.390> along<00:01:40.200> with<00:01:40.439> their<00:01:40.950> food

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and a stopper along with their food

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.580 
and a stopper along with their food
source<00:01:41.729> which<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.600> case<00:01:42.659> would<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.380> our

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
source which in this case would be our

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.830 
source which in this case would be our
yeast<00:01:43.890> starter<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.579> then<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> actual<00:01:45.479> yeast

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
yeast starter and then the actual yeast

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.920 
yeast starter and then the actual yeast
itself<00:01:46.409> all<00:01:47.280> those<00:01:47.640> things<00:01:47.939> would<00:01:48.149> constitute

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
itself all those things would constitute

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.710 
itself all those things would constitute
your<00:01:49.170> yeast<00:01:49.470> starter<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.420> want<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
your yeast starter so if you want to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.920 
your yeast starter so if you want to
really<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> good<00:01:52.530> vigorous<00:01:53.040> fermentation

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
really get a good vigorous fermentation

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.740 
really get a good vigorous fermentation
make<00:01:54.930> sure<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.530> your<00:01:56.070> beer<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.759> wine<00:01:57.270> comes

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
make sure that your beer or wine comes

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.770 
make sure that your beer or wine comes
out<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.469> way<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.680> want<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.430> make<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> good

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
out the way you want it to make a good

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.870 
out the way you want it to make a good
solid<00:02:01.170> yeast<00:02:01.590> starter<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.219> everything<00:02:02.670> will

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
solid yeast starter and everything will

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.049
