119 I'm going to talk about maximizing
strength<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.139> size

maximum size and maximum strength

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.650 
maximum size and maximum strength
because<00:00:16.830> they're<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.490> worried<00:00:17.940> about<00:00:18.119> their

about it and then you limit the amount

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.120 
about it and then you limit the amount
of<00:00:30.269> weight<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.810> lift<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.560> some

of weight you can lift because of some
form<00:00:32.969> or<00:00:33.270> change<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.840> form<00:00:34.230> yeah<00:00:34.710> you're

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
form or change in your form yeah you're

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
form or change in your form yeah you're
towing<00:00:35.280> out<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.270> somehow<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.660> moved

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
towing out this way or somehow you moved

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.500 
towing out this way or somehow you moved
a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.530> bit<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.100> oh<00:00:38.399> my<00:00:38.550> god<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.090> exercise

a little bit and oh my god the exercise

a little bit and oh my god the exercise
is<00:00:39.840> now<00:00:39.989> worthless<00:00:40.559> because<00:00:41.489> somehow<00:00:41.730> your

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
form wasn't is exactly the same as

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.720 
form wasn't is exactly the same as
demonstrated<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.950> magazine<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.670> a

a front dumbbell raise and because he
was<00:01:07.020> moving<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> little<00:01:07.710> bit<00:01:08.010> people<00:01:08.670> were

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
was moving a little bit people were

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.090 
was moving a little bit people were
getting<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.390> over<00:01:09.600> his<00:01:10.140> case<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.979> you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
getting all over his case are you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.969 
getting all over his case are you
kidding<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:12.270> guy's<00:01:12.450> using<00:01:12.900> almost<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
kidding me the guy's using almost you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
kidding me the guy's using almost you
know<00:01:14.100> more<00:01:14.340> than<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.670> third<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> his<00:01:15.119> body<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
know more than one third of his body and

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.840 
know more than one third of his body and
sometimes<00:01:16.110> when<00:01:16.320> he<00:01:16.380> does<00:01:16.530> standing<00:01:17.220> front

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
sometimes when he does standing front

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.999 
sometimes when he does standing front
dumbbell<00:01:18.240> raises<00:01:18.390> uses<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> hundred<00:01:19.470> pounds

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
dumbbell raises uses a hundred pounds

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
dumbbell raises uses a hundred pounds
but<00:01:20.400> I'm<00:01:20.520> sure<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.330> showed<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> video<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
but I'm sure if we showed a video of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.870 
but I'm sure if we showed a video of
that<00:01:22.020> people<00:01:22.799> would<00:01:22.920> get<00:01:23.040> oh<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.430> god<00:01:23.670> he's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that people would get oh my god he's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
that people would get oh my god he's
moving<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> understand

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
moving but what you have to understand

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.880 
moving but what you have to understand
is<00:01:26.659> it's<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.960> end<00:01:28.970> contraction<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.270> matters

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
is it's the end contraction that matters

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.950 
is it's the end contraction that matters
okay<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> move<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.750> bit

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
okay so if you have to move a little bit

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.130 
okay so if you have to move a little bit
to<00:01:34.380> then<00:01:34.530> hoist<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.250> dumbbell<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.840> create

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to then hoist that dumbbell up to create

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
to then hoist that dumbbell up to create
that<00:01:37.320> maximal<00:01:37.950> contraction<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that maximal contraction that's what you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
that maximal contraction that's what you
do<00:01:39.650> okay<00:01:40.650> same<00:01:41.070> thing<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.310> curls<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.790> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
do okay same thing with curls if you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.760 
do okay same thing with curls if you
have<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> move<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:42.570> bit<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.439> take<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
have to move a little bit to take the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.190 
have to move a little bit to take the
pressure<00:01:44.100> off<00:01:44.280> your<00:01:44.549> lower<00:01:44.759> back<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.720> start

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
pressure off your lower back or to start

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.700 
pressure off your lower back or to start
the<00:01:46.649> contraction<00:01:47.549> process<00:01:48.290> that's<00:01:49.290> what<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the contraction process that's what you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.460 
the contraction process that's what you
do<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.729> guys<00:01:50.939> are<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.329> hypnotized<00:01:51.930> by<00:01:52.079> form

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
do but guys are so hypnotized by form

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.910 
do but guys are so hypnotized by form
okay<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.149> perfect<00:01:54.390> form<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.649> makes

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
okay it's the perfect form that makes

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.190 
okay it's the perfect form that makes
the<00:01:56.159> muscle<00:01:56.520> grow<00:01:56.700> no<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.630> not

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the muscle grow no it's not

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.679 
the muscle grow no it's not
it's<00:01:58.469> intense<00:01:58.950> muscular<00:01:59.430> contractions<00:02:00.119> if<00:02:00.390> it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it's intense muscular contractions if it

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.660 
it's intense muscular contractions if it
was<00:02:00.840> perfect<00:02:01.200> form<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.920> could<00:02:02.100> sit<00:02:02.369> here<00:02:02.399> with

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
was perfect form you could sit here with

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.639 
was perfect form you could sit here with
no<00:02:02.820> weight<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.329> do<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.259> life<00:02:04.439> would<00:02:04.590> be

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
no weight and do this and life would be

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.119 
no weight and do this and life would be
great<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.520> mean<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.719> think<00:02:07.020> about<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.500> it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
great I mean when you think about it it

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.160 
great I mean when you think about it it
does<00:02:08.700> make<00:02:08.729> sense<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.080> be

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
does make sense but you just have to be

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.550 
does make sense but you just have to be
open<00:02:10.560> minded<00:02:10.770> about<00:02:11.009> it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
open minded about it

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.040 
open minded about it
example<00:02:12.069> when<00:02:12.880> guys<00:02:13.090> talk<00:02:13.420> about<00:02:13.660> doing

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
example when guys talk about doing

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.550 
example when guys talk about doing
dumbbell<00:02:14.890> flyes<00:02:15.610> lying<00:02:16.120> dumbbell<00:02:16.480> flyes<00:02:16.780> you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
dumbbell flyes lying dumbbell flyes you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.710 
dumbbell flyes lying dumbbell flyes you
see<00:02:17.770> them<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.130> they<00:02:18.190> hold<00:02:18.520> their<00:02:18.640> arms<00:02:19.000> too

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
see them and they hold their arms too

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.510 
see them and they hold their arms too
far<00:02:20.050> out<00:02:20.260> they<00:02:20.530> hold<00:02:20.800> their<00:02:20.920> arms<00:02:21.220> too

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
far out they hold their arms too

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.699 
far out they hold their arms too
straight<00:02:21.910> well<00:02:22.690> what<00:02:22.870> happens<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.680> that

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
straight well what happens is is that

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.699 
straight well what happens is is that
creates<00:02:24.670> almost<00:02:24.970> like<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.510> mixed<00:02:26.170> martial<00:02:26.380> art

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
creates almost like a mixed martial art

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.400 
creates almost like a mixed martial art
arm<00:02:26.980> bar<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:28.209> weight<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.690> have<00:02:28.720> at<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.260> end

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
arm bar the weight you have at the end

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.979 
arm bar the weight you have at the end
of<00:02:29.739> your<00:02:29.920> hand<00:02:30.370> creates<00:02:31.150> too<00:02:31.420> much<00:02:31.569> pressure

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
of your hand creates too much pressure

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.100 
of your hand creates too much pressure
on<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.860> shoulder<00:02:33.430> okay<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.269> can't<00:02:34.660> create

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
on the shoulder okay so you can't create

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.290 
on the shoulder okay so you can't create
a<00:02:35.410> good<00:02:35.739> contraction<00:02:36.190> because<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.090> have<00:02:37.269> a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
a good contraction because you have a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.570 
a good contraction because you have a
long<00:02:37.630> lever<00:02:38.019> with<00:02:38.590> art<00:02:38.920> with<00:02:39.130> weight<00:02:39.400> at<00:02:39.550> the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
long lever with art with weight at the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.610 
long lever with art with weight at the
end<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.030> okay<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:40.840> what<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:41.140> like<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.410> tell

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
end of it okay so what I like to tell

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.820 
end of it okay so what I like to tell

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
guys is bring your arm in so your hand

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.699 
guys is bring your arm in so your hand
is<00:02:45.069> almost<00:02:45.549> directly<00:02:46.120> above<00:02:46.269> your<00:02:47.019> elbow<00:02:47.410> and

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
is almost directly above your elbow and

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.870 
is almost directly above your elbow and
you<00:02:48.610> do<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.790> fly<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:50.019> way<00:02:50.459> okay<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.489> guys<00:02:51.760> are

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
you do a fly that way okay and guys are

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.729 
you do a fly that way okay and guys are
gonna<00:02:51.970> go<00:02:52.150> oh<00:02:52.180> no<00:02:52.510> hey<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.319> looks<00:02:53.500> like<00:02:53.650> a

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
gonna go oh no hey that looks like a

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.580 
gonna go oh no hey that looks like a
press<00:02:54.160> Steve<00:02:54.610> yeah<00:02:55.480> yeah<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.840> does<00:02:56.019> yeah

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
press Steve yeah yeah it does yeah

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.839 
press Steve yeah yeah it does yeah
they're<00:02:56.980> very<00:02:57.250> close<00:02:57.580> okay<00:02:58.269> but<00:02:59.019> this<00:02:59.650> is<00:03:00.130> just

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
they're very close okay but this is just

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.390 
they're very close okay but this is just
slightly<00:03:01.180> different<00:03:01.900> than<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.560> this

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
slightly different than this this

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.550 
slightly different than this this
creates<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:03.940> little<00:03:04.239> more<00:03:04.569> stretch<00:03:04.989> than<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
creates a little more stretch than a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.600 
creates a little more stretch than a
bench<00:03:05.830> press<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:07.150> however<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.720> define<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.769> fly

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
bench press so however you define a fly

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.660 
bench press so however you define a fly
is<00:03:10.150> irrelevant<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:11.560> most<00:03:12.069> important<00:03:12.519> thing

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
is irrelevant the most important thing

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.970 
is irrelevant the most important thing
is<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.599> do<00:03:13.840> an<00:03:13.989> exercise<00:03:14.290> or<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.739> movement

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
is that you do an exercise or a movement

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.009 
is that you do an exercise or a movement
that's<00:03:15.340> going<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.640> give<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:16.180> maximal

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
that's going to give you maximal

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.780 
that's going to give you maximal
contraction<00:03:17.680> of<00:03:17.769> your<00:03:18.070> chest<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.519> shoulders

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
contraction of your chest and shoulders

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.520 
contraction of your chest and shoulders
so<00:03:19.239> by<00:03:19.870> moving<00:03:20.260> your<00:03:20.769> hand<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:22.079> okay<00:03:23.079> you're

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
so by moving your hand in okay you're

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.590 
so by moving your hand in okay you're
able<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:23.920> handle<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:24.850> much<00:03:25.060> more<00:03:25.359> weight

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
able to handle so much more weight

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.690 
able to handle so much more weight
because<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.290> have<00:03:26.500> much<00:03:26.799> better<00:03:27.130> leverage

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
because you have much better leverage

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.449 
because you have much better leverage
over<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.959> weight<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.829> weight<00:03:29.859> doesn't<00:03:30.220> have

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
over the weight the weight doesn't have

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.750 
over the weight the weight doesn't have
leverage<00:03:31.000> over<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:32.549> hope<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.640> can

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
leverage over you I hope you can

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.620 
leverage over you I hope you can
understand<00:03:34.239> that

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
understand that

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.979 
understand that
so<00:03:35.049> again<00:03:35.650> simple<00:03:36.489> concepts<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.600> people<00:03:37.900> are

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
so again simple concepts but people are

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.690 
so again simple concepts but people are
just<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:38.380> hypnotized<00:03:38.920> by<00:03:39.130> what's<00:03:39.340> occurring

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
just so hypnotized by what's occurring

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.420 
just so hypnotized by what's occurring
in<00:03:39.880> magazines<00:03:40.359> and<00:03:40.840> on<00:03:41.260> websites<00:03:41.799> that<00:03:42.250> they

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
in magazines and on websites that they

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.039 
in magazines and on websites that they
don't<00:03:42.639> believe<00:03:42.970> it<00:03:43.209> they've<00:03:43.690> got<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.870> be<00:03:43.989> able

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
don't believe it they've got to be able

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.080 
don't believe it they've got to be able
to<00:03:44.170> think<00:03:44.410> for<00:03:44.590> themselves<00:03:45.069> so<00:03:45.850> when<00:03:46.000> you

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
to think for themselves so when you

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.680 
to think for themselves so when you
think<00:03:46.299> about<00:03:46.389> lifting<00:03:47.200> weights<00:03:48.359> think<00:03:49.359> about

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
think about lifting weights think about

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.979 
think about lifting weights think about
creating<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.829> maximal<00:03:51.579> contraction<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.600> if

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
creating a maximal contraction and if

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.080 
creating a maximal contraction and if

variety of other exercises that require

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.840 
variety of other exercises that require
a<00:05:04.480> little<00:05:04.900> bit<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.200> movement<00:05:05.410> or<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:06.400> different

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
a little bit of movement or a different

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.810 
a little bit of movement or a different
placement<00:05:07.300> of<00:05:07.360> your<00:05:07.390> feet<00:05:07.720> of<00:05:07.840> your<00:05:07.960> hands<00:05:08.410> so

again if you open up your mind and you

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.660 
again if you open up your mind and you
say<00:05:11.170> wow<00:05:11.350> what<00:05:11.590> I'm<00:05:11.710> really<00:05:11.920> interested<00:05:12.190> in<00:05:12.430> is

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
say wow what I'm really interested in is

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.850 
say wow what I'm really interested in is
lifting<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.270> big<00:05:13.480> weight<00:05:13.690> now<00:05:13.990> we<00:05:14.560> don't<00:05:14.650> want

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
lifting a big weight now we don't want

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.560 
lifting a big weight now we don't want
to<00:05:14.920> throw<00:05:15.160> it<00:05:15.250> around<00:05:15.460> we<00:05:15.820> want<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:16.060> flop<00:05:16.360> over

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
to throw it around we want to flop over

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.570 
to throw it around we want to flop over
like<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:16.840> dead<00:05:17.140> fish<00:05:17.440> I<00:05:17.650> get<00:05:18.010> it<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.310> get<00:05:18.520> it

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
like a dead fish I get it you get it

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.060 
like a dead fish I get it you get it
okay<00:05:19.540> but<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.050> whole<00:05:20.200> idea<00:05:20.500> is<00:05:20.560> to<00:05:20.710> create

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
okay but the whole idea is to create

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.580 
okay but the whole idea is to create
some<00:05:21.670> additional<00:05:21.880> momentum<00:05:22.690> so<00:05:22.870> we<00:05:23.230> can<00:05:23.410> then

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
some additional momentum so we can then

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.640 
some additional momentum so we can then
complete<00:05:24.420> 90%<00:05:25.420> of<00:05:25.480> the<00:05:25.570> movement<00:05:25.990> with

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
complete 90% of the movement with

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.710 
complete 90% of the movement with
muscular<00:05:27.430> contraction<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:28.300> then<00:05:28.480> at<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.690> end

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
muscular contraction and then at the end

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.300 
muscular contraction and then at the end
of<00:05:29.080> that<00:05:29.200> movement<00:05:29.470> we've<00:05:29.800> created<00:05:30.100> an

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
of that movement we've created an

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.490 
of that movement we've created an
intense<00:05:30.670> muscular<00:05:31.120> attraction<00:05:31.660> contraction

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
intense muscular attraction contraction

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.230 
intense muscular attraction contraction
because<00:05:32.620> we<00:05:32.800> are<00:05:32.890> handling<00:05:33.250> heavier<00:05:33.790> weight
