so the batch deploy just to give you
guys<00:02:26.420> an<00:02:26.540> idea<00:02:26.629> what<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.019> is<00:02:27.080> actually<00:02:27.319> doing

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
guys an idea what this is actually doing

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
guys an idea what this is actually doing
this<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.069> where<00:02:28.190> we're<00:02:28.280> gonna<00:02:28.370> actually

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
this is where we're gonna actually

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.509 
this is where we're gonna actually
deploy<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.690> IMC<00:02:30.200> components<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:30.890> IMC<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.489> a

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
deploy the IMC components so IMC is a

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.830 
deploy the IMC components so IMC is a
modular<00:02:32.440> NMS<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.700> we're<00:02:35.390> gonna<00:02:35.510> deploy

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
modular NMS and and we're gonna deploy

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.720 
modular NMS and and we're gonna deploy
everything<00:02:36.170> here<00:02:36.319> it<00:02:36.890> does<00:02:37.069> require<00:02:37.370> a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
everything here it does require a

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.030 
everything here it does require a
database<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:39.080> in<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.379> case<00:02:39.590> we<00:02:39.830> have

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
database so in this case we have

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.320 
database so in this case we have
