it with a black with one glass of water

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.959 
it with a black with one glass of water
to<00:02:01.640> make<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:01.880> um<00:02:02.530> basically<00:02:03.530> dissolve<00:02:04.130> and

to make it um basically dissolve and
then

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
then

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.300 
then
uumm<00:02:08.840> use<00:02:09.840> some<00:02:10.050> special<00:02:10.350> moves<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.920> get<00:02:11.100> over

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
uumm use some special moves to get over

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.930 
uumm use some special moves to get over
here<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.640> get<00:02:11.819> three<00:02:12.540> lives<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.940> super

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
here to get three lives with this super

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.500 
here to get three lives with this super
mushroom<00:02:15.270> or<00:02:15.690> something<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.319> um<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:17.510> do
