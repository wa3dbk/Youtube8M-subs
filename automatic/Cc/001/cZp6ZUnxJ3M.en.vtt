00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.610
 hello must have been with you and you 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.830
 looked into the corner of moto nexus today we 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.890
 with our comrades and friends in the helmet 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.080
 tell you how to choose a motorcycle 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.720
 what you should pay attention to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.390
 approach this choice and how not to get 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.160
 at the same time you would 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.669
 further you Sergei everything sounds all 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.590
 will outline his lab and i will show 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.140
 clearly what it looks like and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.250
 at the end we made some results 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.250
 let us draw some conclusions 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.590
 if you do not find this video and you 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.800
 someone advised him 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.629
 know you already got this person 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.750
 with your questions about choosing the first 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.970
 motorcycle in general i'm sergy breaking and oh 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.160
 choice of today and will be discussed this 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.160
 the manual is designed for sensible 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.449
 people and a clinical case like on it 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.820
 16 years old I want to hayabusa 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.580
 does not consider at first we shall understand than 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.430
 differ in weight motorcycles 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.560
 or maybe design actually 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.270
 they differ in purpose therefore 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.250
 buy and liter sportbike for 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.090
 daily driving through urban traffic jams with 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.890
 work to work 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.710
 it's like nailing 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.700
 microscope scientifically scheme 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.179
 selecting 1 bike looks like this start with 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.920
 each axis assignment diagram has 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.630
 5 divisions depending on frequency 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.259
 use of the motorcycle in certain 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.780
 conditions 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.550
 all you have to do is not lie to yourself and 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.830
 prioritize properly 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.959
 and when you will be clear before your eyes 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.440
 scheme of own needs shaven 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.849
 motorcycle class becomes a matter of technique 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.380
 for example, these charts look like this 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.380
 for different motorcycles 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.730
 now we will make amorphous 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.730
 motorcycle assignment view 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.190
 more specifically weight and carrying capacity 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.200
 everything is simple you must have power 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.480
 lift a fallen motorcycle alone 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.149
 so if you are 45 kilogram 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.220
 a girl 300 kilogram bike is not 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.920
 best choice to start at the same time 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.050
 if your weight is good for a hundred and ride you 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.960
 prefer with equal luggage 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.490
 or homosapiens similar build 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.260
 then on our roads 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.220
 anime hundred twenty-five vat 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.650
 the bikes will be for you not transport from 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.230
 consumables like socks 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.730
 saddle height in the first stage you 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.830
 it will be much easier to handle 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.870
 motorcycle if during the stop though 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.940
 would one foot securely reach to 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.830
 land as driving improves 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.590
 skill height motorcycles ceases 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.540
 play a decisive role 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.660
 ergonomics driving you should be 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.220
 convenient is an axiom of design and power 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.260
 you get used to your motorcycle 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.050
 but an uncomfortable fit will be for you 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.700
 as a millennium task for mathematicians 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.970
 so you need to buy 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.130
 sit on the chosen motorcycle for 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.989
 This has three options to come to the place 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.600
 collecting bikers of the city itself and bye 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:15.760
 the owner does not see sit down on your favorite 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:21.450
 motorcycle in drink account they are cool here 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.450
 this is a real motorcycle nishtyak 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.910
 get for it in the face and after a week 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.410
 try to sit back on a bike 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.239
 before politely asking for it 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.440
 owner to look into the nearest motor show 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.480
 the manager will certainly not beat you 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.850
 about teybl but before 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.160
 sitting on a motorcycle is desirable too 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.019
 ask permission if the previous two 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.930
 options for whatever reason you 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.269
 unavailable 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.879
 just go to the lander website 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.040
 choosing a motorcycle model and entering your 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.079
 anatomical parameter you will be able to 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.459
 evaluate how you look at that 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.349
 or other tales 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.700
 as well as how it will look 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.659
 Fedor Makhnov or 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.639
 junri baluing new or was most often 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.040
 I watch a picture when they take cash 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.549
 very cool but extremely used 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.680
 motorcycle 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.689
 naively believing that he will descend on him 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.959
 divine grace and he will be like that 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:17.660
 as reliable as the years of his youth 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.910
 will not be if you are well versed in 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.070
 technicians have a full set of workshop 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.639
 professional tools and not 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.410
 shy away 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.060
 dirty hands in oil you can take 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.919
 even the bottom valve of the last century 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.900
 lain several decades in 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.270
 swamp and before that damaged by the explosion 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.250
 yeah bombs but if questions like 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.349
 adjust valve clearance like me 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.180
 clutch discs oil seals forks or 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.370
 steering column bearings 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.630
 you answer shrug who 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.300
 best choice for you 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.400
 less steep but much more fresh it 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.380
 prices or budgeting expenses 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.900
 on regular visits moti table 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.940
 now when you painted in imagination 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.919
 image of a perfect motorcycle 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.880
 move on to the last item which 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:00.530
 will bring you back to reality cost 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.780
 motorcycle should be absolutely for you 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.560
 lifting do not get into debt or 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.630
 take a loan 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.400
 since in the first three seasons chance 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.800
 break the bike as high as possible 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.690
 focus only on your financial 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.479
 opportunities and laying in advance 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.620
 repair pirates not less than 20 percent of 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.599
 motorcycle value 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.849
 also donâ€™t donate 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.729
 outfitting for the purchase of more expensive 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.310
 yamaha r1 motorcycles and bought for delivery 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.840
 the chinese member is the best way in person 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.270
 make sure the existence of the afterlife 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.690
 life after analyzing the experience of hundreds 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.500
 bikers i can add one more tip 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.530
 seventy three and a half percent 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.759
 cases, the choice of the first motorcycle 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.919
 turns out to be erroneous and 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.870
 rider in a year seeks to change 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.270
 therefore analyze it 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.510
 price changes and choose a motorcycle with 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.130
 the lowest reduction rate 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.080
 greatest demand on 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.120
 secondary market if same you hesitate 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.100
 between several similar models 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.670
 can use classic 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.380
 decision matrices learn but not 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.060
 forget to subscribe to our channel 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.770
 because in the next issue we 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.750
 compare the braking performance on 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.750
 sbs motorcycle and without 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.740
 well and the most important thing you should not forget when 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.270
 choosing a motorcycle what is the principle of choice and 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.180
 motorcycle akin 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.760
 choice of underwear for a loved one 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.750
 because it is still very much 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.060
 scrupulous 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.490
 and personal action for each 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.930
 human in particular negative you would 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.720
 may result in 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:38.610
 you will blame me all in a row 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.010
 our friends in the helmet 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.830
 van operator will blame for the fact that they 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.990
 advised you a motorcycle which you 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.720
 the result did not like this 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:52.110
 there is no specific manual 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.210
 the choice of models that is, we do not say 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.700
 to you here and children if you such it here 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.950
 go such a motorcycle choose no we 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.360
 told you the general concept that is 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.700
 general principle 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.400
 how should I approach the choice of a motorcycle I 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.889
 I hope not to overwhelm him 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.370
 will not be like questions and we on 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:14.039
 root we will cut this tree between times 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.950
 open PM and our subscribers 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:20.700
 thank you very much sergey for participating in this 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.740
 I think you all appreciated the project if so 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.470
 like and subscribe to our 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.789
