like the another loss that pop my pecs
parallax<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.450> before<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
parallax is like the one before the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.440

Falcons<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> Raptor<00:00:35.489> yourself<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.360> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
Falcons on the Raptor yourself what is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.850 
Falcons on the Raptor yourself what is
that<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.340> bought<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.840> 210<00:00:39.840> bucks<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that like I bought it for 210 bucks and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.990 
that like I bought it for 210 bucks and
I<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.210> think<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.719> place<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.530> good<00:00:43.680> for

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.450 
I I think the place is really good for
this<00:00:45.000> type<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> Farrell's<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:47.250> first
