00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
using the RPG on this map because rust

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.509 
using the RPG on this map because rust
is<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> very<00:00:20.130> small<00:00:20.490> map<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.119> with<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> rpd<00:00:22.830> you

is a very small map and with the rpd you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
is a very small map and with the rpd you
have<00:00:23.699> low<00:00:24.029> mobility<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.050> don't<00:00:25.439> really

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
have low mobility so you don't really

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.160 
have low mobility so you don't really
need<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.949> move<00:00:26.160> because<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> spawn

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
to me kind of funny but not really

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.140 
to me kind of funny but not really
that's<00:01:04.710> how<00:01:04.830> horrible<00:01:05.220> spawn<00:01:05.549> systems<00:01:05.970> are

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
that's how horrible spawn systems are

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.039 
that's how horrible spawn systems are
and<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:08.400> best<00:01:08.610> tip<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.000> give<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.750> Russ

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
and the best tip I can give you on Russ

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.160 
and the best tip I can give you on Russ
is<00:01:10.290> aiming<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.100> site's<00:01:11.430> down<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.869> time

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
is aiming your site's down all the time

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.710 
is aiming your site's down all the time
because<00:01:13.890> enemies<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:14.970> come<00:01:15.210> out<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> nowhere

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
because enemies will come out of nowhere

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.520 
because enemies will come out of nowhere
from<00:01:16.439> any<00:01:16.770> given<00:01:17.670> angle<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.049> kind<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
from any given angle and it's kind of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.880 
from any given angle and it's kind of
funny<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.159> again<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.229> don't<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.740> think

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
funny but again I don't really think

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
funny but again I don't really think
this<00:01:23.310> should<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> free-for-all<00:01:24.210> map

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
this should be a free-for-all map

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.560 
this should be a free-for-all map
because<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.280> very<00:01:26.549> horrible<00:01:27.000> spawn

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
because it's just a very horrible spawn

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.120 
because it's just a very horrible spawn
and<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.350> don't<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> should<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and I don't think it should be a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.260 
and I don't think it should be a
multiplayer<00:01:29.610> unless<00:01:29.850> you're<00:01:30.030> playing<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
multiplayer unless you're playing a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.289 
multiplayer unless you're playing a
private<00:01:30.659> map<00:01:30.900> match<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.700> that's<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.180> my

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
private map match but that's just my

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.050 
private map match but that's just my
opinion<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.040> picking<00:01:35.040> guys<00:01:35.159> off<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.759> i<00:01:35.820> use
