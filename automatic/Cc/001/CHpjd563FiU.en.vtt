00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
then whatever that is I don't know quite

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.200 
then whatever that is I don't know quite
what<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.689> fractal<00:01:34.549> camo<00:01:35.549> maybe<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:36.090> not

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
what it is fractal camo maybe I'm not

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.340 
what it is fractal camo maybe I'm not
sure<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.509> doesn't<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:36.810> look<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
sure it doesn't really look like the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
sure it doesn't really look like the
same<00:01:37.560> kind<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> print<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.640> they<00:01:38.759> use<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
same kind of print that they use on the

same kind of print that they use on the
the<00:01:39.479> lining<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.110> got<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.380> carbon

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the lining then you got that carbon

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130 
the lining then you got that carbon
fiber<00:01:40.920> shank<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:42.090> shank<00:01:42.390> does<00:01:42.600> not<00:01:42.750> run<00:01:42.990> all

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
fiber shank this shank does not run all

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.420

the<00:01:43.229> way<00:01:43.320> through<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> toe<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> two's

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the way through the toe like the two's

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
the way through the toe like the two's
did<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.479> these<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.750> way<00:01:45.960> more<00:01:46.200> flexible<00:01:46.350> than

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
did so these are way more flexible than

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.380 
did so these are way more flexible than
those<00:01:47.009> things<00:01:47.280> those<00:01:47.759> things<00:01:47.970> were<00:01:48.060> really

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
those things those things were really

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.880 
those things those things were really
really<00:01:48.509> stiff<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.200> needed<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.530> lot<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
really stiff and you needed a lot of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.469 
really stiff and you needed a lot of
break-in<00:01:50.220> time<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.549> get<00:01:50.670> them<00:01:50.790> through<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
break-in time to get them through and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.240 
break-in time to get them through and
these<00:01:51.899> guys<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.770> feel<00:01:52.979> like

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
these guys here they just feel like

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.770 
these guys here they just feel like
almost<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> weight<00:01:54.060> ones<00:01:54.360> where

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
almost like the weight ones where

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.740 
almost like the weight ones where
they're<00:01:55.619> very<00:01:55.799> flexible<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.520> front<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.479> far<00:01:57.659> as

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
they're very flexible up front as far as

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.270 
they're very flexible up front as far as
the<00:01:57.869> cushion<00:01:58.170> goes<00:01:58.320> these<00:01:58.799> are<00:01:58.950> actually<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the cushion goes these are actually a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.590 
the cushion goes these are actually a
new<00:02:00.560> style<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.950> new<00:02:02.369> kind<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.119> construction

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
new style or a new kind of construction

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.569 
new style or a new kind of construction
for<00:02:03.990> leaning<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:05.040> something<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.460> they

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
for leaning it's something that they

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.180 
for leaning it's something that they
call<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> four<00:02:06.570> piece<00:02:06.780> construction<00:02:07.190> so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
call like a four piece construction so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.880 
call like a four piece construction so
the<00:02:08.879> first<00:02:09.660> layer<00:02:09.929> are<00:02:10.259> four<00:02:10.679> layer

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the first layer are four layer

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.040 
the first layer are four layer
construction<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.430> should<00:02:12.030> say<00:02:12.180> but<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> first

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
construction I should say but the first

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.820 
construction I should say but the first
layer<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.379> this<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
layer is this the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
layer is this the
rubber<00:02:14.010> outsole<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.360> second<00:02:15.690> layer

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
rubber outsole and then the second layer

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.580 
rubber outsole and then the second layer
is<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> cushioned<00:02:16.940> foam<00:02:17.940> midsole<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.630> then<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
is a cushioned foam midsole and then the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.040 
is a cushioned foam midsole and then the
third<00:02:19.800> layer<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.480> carbon<00:02:21.480> fiber<00:02:21.690> plate

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
third layer is the carbon fiber plate

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.930 
third layer is the carbon fiber plate
and<00:02:22.350> then<00:02:22.980> there's<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.220> fourth<00:02:23.430> layer<00:02:23.700> which<00:02:23.910> is

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
and then there's a fourth layer which is

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.290 
and then there's a fourth layer which is
the<00:02:24.180> red<00:02:24.330> section<00:02:24.570> it's<00:02:24.840> also<00:02:24.990> another<00:02:25.320> foam

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
the red section it's also another foam

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.490 
the red section it's also another foam
piece<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> midsole<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.200> almost<00:02:28.350> like

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
piece of the midsole so it's almost like

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.650 
piece of the midsole so it's almost like
dual<00:02:28.770> density<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.400> some<00:02:29.580> supportive<00:02:30.120> a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
dual density you get some supportive a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.600 
dual density you get some supportive a
denser<00:02:31.260> foam<00:02:31.470> up<00:02:31.680> top<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.100> then<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.250> get<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
denser foam up top and then you get the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.240 
denser foam up top and then you get the
cushion<00:02:32.970> softer<00:02:33.660> midsole<00:02:34.620> underneath<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.160> it

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
cushion softer midsole underneath and it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.790 
cushion softer midsole underneath and it
feels<00:02:35.430> pretty<00:02:35.700> pretty<00:02:36.690> soft<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.500> won't<00:02:37.650> know

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
feels pretty pretty soft you won't know

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.230 
feels pretty pretty soft you won't know
for<00:02:37.830> sure<00:02:38.010> until<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.490> start<00:02:38.700> running<00:02:38.730> and

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
for sure until you start running and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.700 
for sure until you start running and
breaking<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.930> things<00:02:40.080> like<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.470> but

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
breaking it in and things like that but

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.740 
breaking it in and things like that but
for<00:02:40.920> right<00:02:41.460> now<00:02:41.580> they<00:02:41.850> feel<00:02:42.060> pretty<00:02:42.300> good<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
for right now they feel pretty good and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.450 
for right now they feel pretty good and
this<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.230> insole<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.620> think<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.010> insole<00:02:44.310> is

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
this is the insole I think the insole is

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.920 
this is the insole I think the insole is
probably<00:02:44.790> one<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> coolest<00:02:45.420> features<00:02:45.510> of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
probably one of the coolest features of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.880 
probably one of the coolest features of
the<00:02:46.080> shoe

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
the shoe

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.860 
the shoe
mostly<00:02:47.520> because<00:02:47.670> they've<00:02:48.120> got<00:02:48.360> some<00:02:48.690> cool

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
mostly because they've got some cool

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.990 
mostly because they've got some cool
design<00:02:49.230> concepts<00:02:49.770> here<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.220> these<00:02:50.760> little

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
design concepts here and these little

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.050 
design concepts here and these little
triangles<00:02:51.300> will<00:02:51.690> compress<00:02:52.110> for<00:02:52.820> some<00:02:53.820> really

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
triangles will compress for some really

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.540 
triangles will compress for some really
nice<00:02:54.209> step<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.600> comfort<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.170> then<00:02:55.800> also<00:02:56.070> the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
nice step in comfort and then also the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.600 
nice step in comfort and then also the
heel<00:02:56.880> has<00:02:57.209> an<00:02:57.390> extra<00:02:57.780> foam<00:02:58.740> crash<00:02:59.100> pad<00:02:59.370> much

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
heel has an extra foam crash pad much

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.300 
heel has an extra foam crash pad much
like<00:02:59.850> a<00:02:59.880> a<00:03:00.060> deep<00:03:00.600> reme<00:03:00.780> plus<00:03:01.110> something<00:03:02.100> that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
like a a deep reme plus something that

go<00:03:14.580> true<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:14.850> size<00:03:15.350> but<00:03:16.350> most<00:03:17.280> people<00:03:17.580> might

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
go true to size but most people might

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.050 
go true to size but most people might
want<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.060> go<00:03:18.480> half<00:03:18.690> size<00:03:18.930> up<00:03:19.170> at<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.440> least

want to go half size up at the least

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.400 
want to go half size up at the least
just<00:03:21.060> because<00:03:21.300> they<00:03:21.450> were<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.660> little<00:03:21.810> bit<00:03:22.050> a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
just because they were a little bit a
