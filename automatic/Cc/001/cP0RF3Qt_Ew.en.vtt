00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Greetings and hammering for all 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.520
 titan hammer and I bring you a mode of 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.490
 minecraft called better world ' 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.240
 generations which you have here in the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.250
 list of forks 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.080
 and well what it does basically is 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.150
 add us a new map generator 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.189
 when we give here the option of 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.320
 create a new world 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.240
 we give you more world options here 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.769
 in this button where it puts type of world 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.330
 by default we select bw g4 and 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.990
 we have a lot of new options 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.519
 we can choose between nine different 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.610
 better default that would be the map by 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:40.690
 defect improved beta about 73 alpha 120 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.930
 inc 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.549
 indep survival island and that of 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.159
 survival 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:51.549
 survival sky land or this would be a 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.460
 floating island of survival sky block 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:57.100
 which is the famous map that you all know 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.220
 of extreme survival and skay 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.560
 dimension that would be a map like the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.900
 normal but all with floating lands 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.510
 then in each of the options as 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.200
 you see here below comes configuration of 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.720
 the biomes you see that there are enough of 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.060
 fact there are new languages ​​that are not in 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.460
 the default engine can also be 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.580
 change the size and according to which 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.730
 choose as you see you can choose 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.730
 example type floating island in land 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.220
 the normal theme hell paradise forest 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.740
 it's snow and so on 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.340
 well I'm going to show you a map first 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.380
 normal how would it be created 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.350
 after having it select it from 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.930
 to accept 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.189
 we give a name here and we will 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.189
 to put the world on him 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.909
 good as you see here we are going to 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.909
 activate the creative to fly 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.159
 we are here a desert area 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.780
 and for example here just start 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.290
 we see a different biome because it has 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.349
 besides the desert of the sand has 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.140
 also blocks of earth with grass and 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.940
 it also has grass 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.760
 as if the desert had won 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.850
 land to the forest and was covering 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.310
 grass areas the truth is that 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.770
 It looks pretty cool if we look for 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.230
 example also in these trees we see 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.780
 the different way that they have to not 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.870
 they were not in the map generator either 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.860
 original we see a forest with very trees 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.820
 high like this 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.640
 with pretty flattened cups and 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.920
 pretty cool I will also teach the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.819
 other types of maps so you can see the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.969
 variety there 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.709
 we give you here in single player mode let's 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:57.709
 teach for example the sky land 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.980
 good as you can see here is the map of 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.489
 east skyline 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.640
 they are all floating earths indeed if 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.500
 you see the water falling the lava also from 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.650
 these small structures 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.410
 that clear as there is no subsoil is 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.870
 subject by some chains and there are the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.570
 Two mobile pounders are two of the most 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.570
 easy to find and good here what 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.660
 you are seeing all the waterfalls 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.240
 and all that the other guys taught me 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.370
 of map 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.370
 in this case survival island 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.670
 here you have it as you see an island 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.670
 deserted 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.900
 with palm trees something else that either 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.480
 was in the generator by default in the 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.409
 normal generator and the truth is that it is 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.650
 very cool the island looks like the island of 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.120
 some adventure map like there is out there 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.810
 and the truth is that it is very successful with 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.610
 the mountain and others 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.610
 well let's see the others too 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.760
 survival skyline 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.660
 that would be a floating island survival to 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.120
 difference from the previous one 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.750
 what was it 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:33.770
 a normal paradisiac island if you look 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:37.550
 a huge mountain of jungle with 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.080
 with the pauner mobiles down there and 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.419
 everything in the air the truth that also 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.909
 is very cool is already saying the 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.220
 examples of maps that can be and one 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:50.060
 of which more than the most curious 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.360
 more similar is the hell type here 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.250
 you have it 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.789
 that does not have any grass if you notice 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.699
 is all land and instead of sea we have 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:03.360
 everything full of lava is very cool and very 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.860
 cool are the trees come out burning 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.620
 they are basically going to devastate 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.650
 the whole island the truth is that for 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.469
 some adventure map or for some 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.539
 halloween type event or things like that 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.670
 it's really cool and it's very 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.680
 cool 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.730
 and I'm going to show you how 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.730
 would perform the installation 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.500
 First the download links 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.449
 they will be in the description of the video 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.449
 from jsa jump advertising 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.490
 take us to the mega website 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.460
 we accept the conditions and we lower them 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.620
 I as always as I have it lowered 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.349
 I have it here look here on the button 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.970
 start to percentage app data percentage 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:52.819
 it is also possible that your folder 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.370
 of installation be users names of 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:58.250
 minecraft user i get married i got it 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.210
 here and not to lose it, I'm going to change it 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.190
 name 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.190
 to be able to do a zero installation 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:10.430
 now it's worth now we will not follow here and 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:14.260
 we will run the minecraft launcher and 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.260
 we perform the installation as always 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:22.619
 once it is installed 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:22.619
 we execute the game and close it 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.660
 and now we are going to install force 804 them 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:38.870
 we bring here we give them double click or 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:41.400
 Right click to open with java platform 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.980
 we choose the installation route and I 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.990
 I have this I do not change it if you have two 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.320
 user points user names 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:52.040
 minecraft cambiéis with this button you will 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.040
 we give to accept 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.660
 now let's run minecraft other 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.280
 time 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.370
 so that all the 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.030
 necessary files we select a 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.030
 giffords 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.920
 and we give him to play 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:15.820
 we close minecraft 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.570
 and now we take the file and we're going to 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.380
 the folder here point minecraft 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.710
 we enter the folder that has been 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:27.310
 generated a mods and inside we copied the 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:31.020
 better world file 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.020
 we run again minecraft 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:43.210
 and as you see here you have better world 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.210
 innovation 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.400
 and nothing I finally recommend that 

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.020
 do in the installation of optimal comfort 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.330
 with mods because it's going to give us no 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.650
 problem and it's going to go perfect and you're going to 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.639
 can install all the modes that 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.720
 want 

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:59.180
 if you liked to give it to and 

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.300
 subscribe and do not forget to share 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.300
