00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:09.130
 In the drop kick after dry 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:11.710
 All kick-offs and conversions will be drop kicks 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.730
 Masu's a very important 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.620
 There are two ways to kick in drop kick 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.100
 First of all 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.030
 Come up like coming in and raise the open ball 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.670
 Method then a 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.420
 Like a conversion kick 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.650
 It flies relatively low relatively far 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:37.380
 Two important kick points are how to drop the ball 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:41.250
 How to use the ankle will be the timing to kick 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.730
 Mud pick features once dropped to the ground 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.010
 A ball that has been allowed to bounce from allowed to bounce 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.570
 But 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.410
 I was a little genius 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.400
 First, each prefecture pitch 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.040
 Like veins 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.720
 I've been this high 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.540
 I often fix over the ankle 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.960
 I will do my best 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:08.330
 And it is how to drop the ball, but slant 40 toward the direction you want to cut 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.880
 Hiko 22 people 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.260
 It is the sun's back in the direction you want to kick 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.530
 Let suited it for 45 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.670
 The basic form is to stand up well 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.340
 And Kedomo is how to drop the ball 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:32.210
 Just like the ball comes from above Mavel 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:34.810
 Politely put back the timing to live a little timing and just came up timing 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.409
 I fixed my ankle but 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.070
 It is important to say 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.070
 I'll try 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.600
 It is like this 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.600
 So the two eyes 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.490
 Fly away rather than far away like a little witch kick 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.000
 And f 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.680
 There is also a point and this time the ankle is just like normal listening 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.190
 What to do 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.190
 Chopsticks Te crops will be important that that is meat 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.970
 Me 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.110
 If you want to cut it help like a photo shop now 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.140
 It does not change, but how to drop the ball is fine 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.660
 If you hear this version will arrive a run-up 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.700
 If the shemales are vacant, the speed will increase considerably 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.819
 Since the All 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.939
 Straight straight and alumni ball is nice 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.270
 Because in front there is a broadcast of Kansai 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.950
 Let all go positive 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.850
 Because there is a thing that it falls 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.540
 Basically I'll bring it a bit towards myself 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.020
 Towards was Tsu a goal 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:59.459
 It is important to say that 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:02.740
 Kedomo it from the high-Keru kick was called the kicking and swung a face-to-face little by bound 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.430
 The kick that kicks far is not 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.680
 At the moment of bunting 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.680
 I try to kick in a moment 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.930
 is this good 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.290
 Drop kick is very difficult 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:29.230
 In the chair type 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:32.450
 Is very to I mean and what kind of timing but Toka how to hold the ball 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.830
 I think each person has individuality 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.450
 And the repeated practice wearing a sense of my own 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.959
 I want to go to progress 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.959
 that's all
