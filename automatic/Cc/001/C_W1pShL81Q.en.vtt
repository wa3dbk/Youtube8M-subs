00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
so for the first giveaway I figured that

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.170 
so for the first giveaway I figured that
I<00:02:49.299> would<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.720> go<00:02:50.379> to<00:02:50.409> random.org<00:02:51.040> type<00:02:52.030> in

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
I would just go to random.org type in

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.089 
I would just go to random.org type in
the<00:02:52.269> number<00:02:52.569> of<00:02:52.620> people<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.709> have<00:02:53.890> entered

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
the number of people that have entered

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.129 
the number of people that have entered
and<00:02:54.549> then<00:02:54.670> it'll<00:02:54.970> generate<00:02:55.299> a<00:02:55.569> random<00:02:55.840> number

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
and then it'll generate a random number

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.509 
and then it'll generate a random number
for<00:02:56.379> me<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.709> then<00:02:56.799> I'll<00:02:56.889> go<00:02:57.069> through<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.340> list
