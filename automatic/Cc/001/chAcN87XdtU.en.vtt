00:00:01.377 --> 00:00:02.749
Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.127 --> 00:00:03.750
Hello.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.751
Hi.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.563
This is Kyeong-eun Choi.

00:00:06.812 --> 00:00:07.438
I am Seokjin Jin.

00:00:07.438 --> 00:00:08.561
I'm Hyojin An.

00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:10.250
Seokjin, you are really excited.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.687
You were surprised right? Right?

00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:15.811
As always, infront of food, Seokjin is the most excited.

00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:16.937
It's just an acting concept.

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:17.563
Really?

00:00:17.563 --> 00:00:19.063
Since everyone knows me like that.

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:22.313
"Ah, since Seokjin is in a video, so he will like something to eat." 

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:26.749
So then, you maintain your acting concept 24 hours?

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.186
It's tiring. Yes. Maintaining this character.

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:32.375
Then don't eat this, since it's just a character you're acting.

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:33.500
He is really sad.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.375
Yes.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.248
Yeah. Kyeong-eun, what are we going to talk about today?

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:40.125
We have some ice cream here.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:40.936
I like ice cream so much.

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:41.625
Really?

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:42.247
Yes.

00:00:42.247 --> 00:00:46.122
To be honest, I don't like ice cream that much.

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:48.874
You get thirsty when you eat ice cream.

00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:52.686
When it's hot, it's nice and cool when you have something to drink instead of eating ice cream.

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:55.060
If you eat ice cream, it's sweet....

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.374
Ice cream is not for eating because you feel hot.

00:00:57.374 --> 00:00:58.000
Then?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.246
You eat it because it tastes good.

00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:01.748
Don't you eat ice cream in winter?

00:01:01.748 --> 00:01:03.623
No, I don't. Why would I have ice cream when it's cold?

00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:05.811
Because it tastes good.

00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:06.684
I see.

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:08.685
Why are you pretending not to know Seokjin?

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:09.872
He's pretending not to know.

00:01:09.872 --> 00:01:13.935
It's true that it's delicious, but I have not eaten it in winter.

00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:15.558
Don't lie.

00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:18.247
I've seen Seokjin eat ice cream in winter.

00:01:18.247 --> 00:01:19.624
Okay.

00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:25.561
Then, we have chosen our ice creams, and I actually...

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.185
You chose it because of old memories right?

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:27.872
Yes. That's right.

00:01:27.872 --> 00:01:33.371
I don't like ice cream that much, but this is a really really old ice cream.

00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:37.499
If you look at it now, this is funny, jaws.

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:40.060
Even the name is funny, "Jaws Bar". It's "Jaws Bar" and,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.497
There is a shark drawing like this.

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:46.432
There was a movie like that a long time ago.

00:01:46.432 --> 00:01:48.432
I think it's a parody of the movie.

00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:50.056
But this is really old.

00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:50.744
That's right.

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:55.681
And it's really old, and, the tast, is good. It tastes good.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:57.809
And it looks like...

00:01:57.809 --> 00:02:00.565
Like Jaws.

00:02:00.565 --> 00:02:01.872
It really looks like Jaws, right? Jaws.

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:03.807
It's Jaws Bar. And it tastes really good. 

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:09.182
There were many stories, that this is a kind of junk food. Because when you eat this, your lips turn blue.

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:09.870
That's right.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.370
The outside, this... kind of...

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.744
I think it's because of the coloring.

00:02:12.744 --> 00:02:19.182
My lips do get blue from the coloring, but even if it's junk food, it's cool and tastes good.

00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:20.242
Yes.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.994
Then, shall we eat it?

00:02:22.994 --> 00:02:24.619
There is no way that ice cream is healthy anyway.

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:28.558
Personally, I like cookies and cream the best.

00:02:28.558 --> 00:02:33.306
Whereever I go, I eat cookies and cream, and I really think it's the best taste in the world.

00:02:33.306 --> 00:02:34.181
Really?

00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:36.055
Yes, it's really good.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.618
It's really fattening.

00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:40.680
Speak after finishing eating. Please?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.807
Sorry.

00:02:42.554 --> 00:02:45.308
If you eat this, you get fat.

00:02:45.308 --> 00:02:49.243
Even if you do get fat, ice cream is normally... All ice creams are fattening.

00:02:49.243 --> 00:02:51.306
You might as well eat something tasty, since you'll get fat anyway.

00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:53.180
That's a good way of thinking.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.243
What did you choose Seokjin?

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.181
Me, this is something called "Rice cake Monaca", I'm not picky usually.

00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:01.568
I like all ice creams.

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:06.504
So I got it because I wanted to try something new.

00:03:06.504 --> 00:03:11.255
I'm like this, and the cone, things on the cone, you know? I like it a lot.

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:12.378
Ah... Things like chocolate...

00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:16.314
There's chocolate, biscuits, I think it is so good.

00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:17.939
It's going to melt, hurry and open it.

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.315
Oh no...

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:26.752
I think it has already melted a little. Since it is like this, there is chocolate, cookies and cream ice cream on the cone.

00:03:26.752 --> 00:03:27.814
Isn't it too sweet?

00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:30.169
Does it taste good?

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.356
What is this one here?

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:33.045
Here... Shall we see this?

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:37.482
Normally, this is... this has a wood holding,

00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:40.481
This also has something wrapping on the outside. Some biscuit...

00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:45.857
I think it's a bit similar to this. But this it not in a cone shape, tada! It's the shape of a rice cake.

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.794
Is this the shape of a rice cake?

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:49.918
It's not the shape of a rice cake.

00:03:49.918 --> 00:03:50.792
It's flat.

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:57.543
So there is ice cream inside, and normally red beans, and chocolate.

00:03:57.543 --> 00:04:00.021
I think this tastes good when you're hungry.

00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:01.669
If there are red beans, then the taste is no good.

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.731
You think so? There are a lot of ice creams with red beans inside.

00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:08.355
Things like that, my mother enjoys...

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:14.603
Hyojin, you will get to like red beans when you get a bit older.

00:04:15.044 --> 00:04:17.291
It's not because you are older that you like red beans.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.415
I also hated red beans when I was young.

00:04:19.415 --> 00:04:21.104
Don't lie.

00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:23.291
You also liked to eat when you were young.

00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:24.540
I did like to eat!

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.103
But the good thing about this is, it's cool because there is rice cake inside.

00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:36.916
Could I say that it is a unique kind of ice cream because there is rice cake, ice cream, and things like this, like biscuits, are all inside at once?

00:04:36.916 --> 00:04:39.668
Yes. As I'm eating it right now, it's really chewy.

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:42.103
Yes. I think it's a type of ice cream you can only see in Korea.

00:04:42.103 --> 00:04:45.977
You can't feel chewy taste while you are eating a cone ice cream, right?

00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:48.978
Why are you looking for chewy taste, when you are having an ice cream?

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:51.730
When you want chewy taste, you should have rice cake.

00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:54.539
Eating ice cream and rice cake at the same time.

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.417
It's so innovative, no?

00:04:57.104 --> 00:05:02.415
Then, Kyeong-eun and Seokjin, unlike ice creams that you buy in stores like this,

00:05:02.728 --> 00:05:06.603
There are seperate ice creams stores, which taste do you get when you go there?

00:05:07.977 --> 00:05:08.789
Tell us.

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.539
I actually don't go there much, I usually don't.

00:05:15.788 --> 00:05:24.041
If I do, you know that really simple tastes, like cherry? I just have that. I don't have something that I like a lot.

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.037
Is that so?

00:05:25.037 --> 00:05:26.726
Yes. Since I don't go often.

00:05:28.164 --> 00:05:31.350
If I have cake, I even eat only ice cream cakes.

00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:32.228
I see.

00:05:32.537 --> 00:05:34.288
Seokjin eats. Just eats.

00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:39.287
Then, leave us a comment and tell us if you have had Korean ice cream.

00:05:39.287 --> 00:05:42.852
Tell us which ice cream you like in the comment. Ok?

00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:43.975
I like Shooting Star.

00:05:43.975 --> 00:05:44.663
Ah... Ok....

00:05:44.663 --> 00:05:46.412
Good bye!
