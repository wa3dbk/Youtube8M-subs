00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.259
 very good all super gamer and finally 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.060
 has come out of giving me the deep 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.650
 darkness the first expansion of 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.719
 distinguishes I'm pretty excited about 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.040
 try before anything else I went to a 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.389
 moment the earth to talk to him and 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.490
 if I ask for the mission because I know what 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.170
 you have to go to her to ask for the mission and 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.240
 I have not seen anything at all yet so 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.430
 let's go there let's play the fist of 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.680
 Crete in ancient Russia face the 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.190
 crete of chalk that lives the progeny of the 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.140
 earth so let's go there 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.330
 or I heard out there that you could play the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.920
 level 30 I do not know if that is true can 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.740
 that the daily heard that I think the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.110
 daily but let's play this mission in 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.060
 level 28 we go alone we do not need 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.620
 help so good maybe but I have 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.880
 as is a new mission I will let 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.890
 the robot says what he has to say 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.510
 I would try to silence everything 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.280
 At the moment you speak to us, make us a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.390
 thematic or something like that but he does not know 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.950
 found us first 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.600
 the son of oris 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.320
 we had never faced anything 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.540
 similar to the end just that from it 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.510
 trotta and her armies destroyed the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.150
 Moon 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.080
 and if we do not finish with them the earth 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.880
 will suffer the same fate so let's 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.950
 finish them or that's it already 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 I heard out there that bone during all 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.460
 these missions the one that is going to talk to you is 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.560
 series but the robot that I pause 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.979
 maybe the robot says or does something works 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.979
 The teacher 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.520
 find that mons 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.990
 so let's go there also this is the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.550
 first time I try this bike I know that 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.700
 you can do tricks and this but I do not know 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.810
 how they are made or just gave it to vale I think 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.040
 that with the also skips is that 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.320
 I've also been without a block for some time 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.130
 finally we go there 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.350
 and 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.420
 I really should be walking 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.289
 tranquilito doing everything right those 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.649
 enemies that assail me at the beginning but 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.649
 as we saw 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.000
 I'm sorry if I do not quiet sometimes 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.590
 but I do not realize when the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.939
 Cretan goats have begun the ritual 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.549
 that's what came out the other day before 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.990
 that they drew the sword so it's worth 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.440
 there he will be doing the ritual outside 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.780
 outside 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.310
 or know of the crota and is at level 28 new 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.140
 this is much more like that level 3 to 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.960
 that he sees in front of the other day he runs for 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.570
 back when you super shotgun with the 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.150
 how good can I focus pretty well 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.700
 I think I think everything is fine at the moment 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.230
 little by little and now give me your sword now 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.390
 I think I only have one minute to 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.000
 try it out so let's take advantage of it 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.220
 It's cool that a mission appears 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.990
 of the stick or I do not know if it has been 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.940
 totally random of that from which they have 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.840
 appeared there from the stick or if he was already 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.760
 prepared but up to web 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.250
 in we signed clear this area here with 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.379
 the back mike poles also cool that 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.879
 have put on hatred god god with the 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.280
 calm and care 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.680
 God, or less bad than by reappearing 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.250
 because they go very hard to her 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.590
 first 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.540
 and you also know that I play very much 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.940
 crazy very very weird what this mission 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.950
 It's also new so do not expect a 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.840
 totally professional gameplay as if 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.600
 as if he knew what I'm doing 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.130
 just be killing investigating and 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.690
 testing I do not know if the sword and this one the 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.820
 can all the time I do not think that 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.770
 not because it's already turning green like that 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.770
 that we are going to take advantage of it and 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.030
 and I think we have to go through the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.470
 beehive through the hole itself there 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.850
 that is the one that takes you to the beach I do not know 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.420
 if you have ever decided out there dominates 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.650
 ms caballada my first iris contract 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.790
 so that's good 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.790
 die thanks 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.420
 and now we are going to investigate here to see what 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.860
 what happens is the first mission that we 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.940
 they put us here I do not know if the 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.319
 you have already done on patrol 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.030
 probably yes you have already come 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.709
 enough around here but it's an area 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.230
 pretty pretty and quite interesting a 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.420
 sir, it 's like the hive in the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.160
 land I think is the only hive 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.010
 in quotes so to speak I do not know very 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.950
 alright how to call this 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.750
 the grottos do not look like it or just 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.530
 speak the robot and I do not know if it was iris or 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.930
 the robot we continue here should have 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.280
 a lot of enemies and that that is silent and 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.129
 It reminds me of the light we 've seen 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.480
 before where the sword appeared so 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.860
 well it goes without saying that here is the 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.630
 is going to roll a lot if it is that 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.680
 It has all the paint you do not make 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.479
 change my weapons just 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.610
 to see what happens to this light I do not know if 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:31.199
 I want to get closer, you have to carry me this 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.199
 the dark charge or first light or god 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.120
 of software or I can not fly I can not 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.639
 use my powers I create the charge 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.199
 dark is what makes sardà a fist of 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.430
 creta hates this is the boss 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.770
 god wisla my son said is the shit that 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.680
 makes with the sword the power of ball 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.780
 poisons the air my god this is just 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:01.020
 a mission with enough variables that is 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:03.630
 I have no idea what the ass is and 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.560
 today I have only noticed hatreds that comes to 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.020
 beehive out there too 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.639
 I can not fly I forget good I have 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.960
 I have my joker in case it happens to me 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.960
 I do not know if I could use it 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.280
 go dead 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.280
 how the grenades are 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.320
 God 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.520
 those are graves or something this site is 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.530
 quite interesting I really want 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.100
 look at it more closely as soon as 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.100
 finish with this 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.830
 you are already dead 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.590
 or new god grimoire letter sent 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.360
 so many new grimoire cards eliminates 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.140
 to the creta chicken and I've already 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.950
 removed 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.950
 I think everything is fine 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.169
 the other disciples of crota not cease 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.460
 until the land is ready for 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.460
 return of his lord 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.860
 so good guys here you have the 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.770
 first cooking mission to give it to me 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.290
 to be pretty pretty and there you see 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.600
 has enough changes, that is, the 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.280
 charge seizes you or what comes 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.840
 of the air and all that and the sword or 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.220
 you can see that they are much more 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.080
 dynamics that we have played up to 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.430
