00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
we saw them mainly on television because

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:35.929 
we saw them mainly on television because
we<00:01:35.100> were<00:01:35.189> too<00:01:35.310> young<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.579> see<00:01:35.729> them<00:01:35.850> in

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the correct order which is probably a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.219 
the correct order which is probably a
good<00:01:39.060> thing<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> lot<00:01:40.200> of
