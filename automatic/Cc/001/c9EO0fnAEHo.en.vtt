the active display and all sorts of

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.520 
the active display and all sorts of
stuff<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:51.570> stay<00:01:52.140> tuned<00:01:52.409> because

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530

it's<00:01:52.770> getting<00:01:52.950> better<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.399> better<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.820> think

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it's getting better and better I think

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.120 
it's getting better and better I think
it's<00:01:54.479> one<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.899> best<00:01:55.200> implementations<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
it's one of the best implementations of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.429 
it's one of the best implementations of
active<00:01:56.520> display<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:57.060> not<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.570> best<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.140> yeah

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
active display if not the best so yeah

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.109 
active display if not the best so yeah
