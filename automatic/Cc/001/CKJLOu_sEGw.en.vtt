00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
 Taking in the hustle and bustle example of appointing Posts to case and together we will introduce 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.160
 First of all, if you take the urban area 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:22.539
 I will send and run on the Monter when starting 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:27.429
 quick acceleration and lucky day in morning system can be obtained with ev 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:31.560
 If you are fully charged, you will most likely run in the city 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.560
 Posting is possible without being in Eve mode 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.840
 When a fan areas and sudden acceleration 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.310
 In such a case, a larger output is required, but in this case it shifts to series mode. 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.210
 I will 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.210
 Steam the power generated by the engine to generate a large driving force 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.079
 During deceleration or in the second half 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.879
 Stop the engine and hold the principle energy 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.879
 Battery tree will be charging for the disabled 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.680
 I will train both the engine motor and electronic 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.610
 On the other hand, when going out 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.470
 Urban area mode just before in urban area 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.750
 As well as 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.750
 I will run the battery ev 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.930
 Even if you get on the highway, it lasts up to about 20 km 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.250
 What 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.250
 ev can travel 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:43.330
 While we continue to ev traveling 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:47.160
 The engine starts when the battery level is gradually increasing. 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.160
 I will do this in parallel 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:58.310
 Traveling at such as high-speed overtaking to be 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:00.960
 When a larger output is required, in addition to running the engine, the motor 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.640
 Without assistance at the boater 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.640
 Press the balloon mode say 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.850
 If you return to city driving when the battery level is low 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.280
 What 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.120
 If it is less, it is a series mode that runs with a motor while generating electricity with an engine . 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.120
