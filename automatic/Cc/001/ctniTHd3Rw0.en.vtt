00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.290
 stylized letter s means all 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.849
 one of the most interesting brands in 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.639
 big family volkswagen 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.639
 Today we are getting acquainted with a new seat leon 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.020
 this car is built on the same 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.699
 platform as 7 volkswagen golf and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.070
 new audi a3 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.830
 he has much the same technique but 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.230
 other settings and of course your 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.450
 design actually i think that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.270
 Crimeans must intuitively 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.059
 understand that this car is yours for 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.370
 people like us mountains and seas sun 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.469
 asphalt serpentine 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 just like in the homeland of this 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.230
 car in spain looks like seat leon 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.899
 tasty and adult fully LED 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.600
 head optics are a few bold lines in 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.879
 silhouette and concise taillight and this 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.520
 you are not technological German drawing 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.309
 the creators themselves call this style 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.559
 engineering title built on the game 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.229
 words get pleasure Angie 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.240
 and create perfect things engineering 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.280
 with a more emotional seat 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.590
 turned out and more accessible than 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.990
 related golf by the way completely 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.090
 LED lights are not just the best 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.220
 visibility on the road but less fuel 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.210
 energy and therefore the best fuel 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.759
 economy 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.650
 as well as the LEDs themselves compared to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.920
 incandescent bulbs live practically 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.829
 forever we got a test seat leon in 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.759
 top grade equipment f.r. externally from 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.520
 cars in the base 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.950
 it is distinguished by wheels 17 inches more 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.530
 interesting bumpers and factory toning 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.530
 but the most delicious difference in the suspension 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.590
 unlike less powerful versions of 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.140
 Our Lena independent rear suspension 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.990
 wheels and it is clear for the car in 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.740
 which under the hood is a sick herd 180 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.410
 Horse power 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.610
 she should be just like that 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.960
 simultaneously provide comfort and 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.350
 excellent handling 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.510
 1.8 liter turbocharged engine 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.120
 allows Leon to shoot from spot to 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.820
 first hundred on the speedometer in 7 seconds and 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.130
 this is a seven-speed transmission keep 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.770
 thrust stock at this engine 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.290
 always at hand or rather under the right 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.530
 driver's foot thing is that this motor 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.420
 produces maximum torque 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.880
 255 meters already at around one and a half 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.220
 thousands of revolutions then there is such a diesel 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.980
 thrust on the revs even less than that 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.680
 diesel and torque does not weaken 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.510
 hd 4000 rpm therefore no 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.950
 need to turn the engine up 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.440
 metallic ringing in the ears 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.540
 to achieve decent dynamics when 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.310
 this is even a stock engine seat leon 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.910
 remains very economical 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.459
 cars 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.600
 suburban consumption of gasoline is less than five 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.480
 liters per hundred 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.430
 in less than 8 as for me very 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.230
 decent performance for a car 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.110
 which can accelerate to the first 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.110
 hundreds in 7 seconds it is clear that there is 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.360
 options and ask for 1 and 2 or 1 and 4 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.480
 liter well and there with the dynamics everything is in order 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.459
 for example a version with a motor of 1400 cubes 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.590
 to the first hundred accelerates only 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.830
 seconds slower german motors 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.570
 really good by the way on saving 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.760
 fuel besides driving style 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.770
 the system starts and stops 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.900
 the manufacturer assures that she is here 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.660
 saves up to four percent 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.660
 fuel, if desired, it can be disabled 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.519
 of nice and helpful helpers also 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.070
 worth noting help system at startup 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:38.080
 on the rise on our roads with difficult 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.080
 relief thing is really useful 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.930
 length seat leon 4 meters 26 centimeters in 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.360
 other situations i would say typical 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.670
 golf class but here the case is even more 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.950
 typical because we have a car 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.200
 built on the same platform as 7 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.450
 golf is true in the cabin he seemed to me 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.970
 stylistically closer to the water is enough 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.550
 spacious in this car and in front and 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.260
 rear trunk almost 400 liters with 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.940
 possibility of increase due to 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.940
 folding rear seats 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.750
 front sports seats exactly on 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.940
 so much to be comfortable health 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.340
 securely hold the driver and passenger as well 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.470
 cornering but do not deliver 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.780
 inconvenience during frequent landings 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.100
 the city 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.410
 once driving I notice that on 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.540
 button learning process and addictive 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.460
 it takes just a few minutes all 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.980
 extremely clear and understandable on the intuitive 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.790
 level for example separate 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.230
 climate control 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.790
 and on top of the control box 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.860
 climate control 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.290
 color multifunction monitor 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.320
 from here you can change the character of the car 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.240
 this system is called drive mode with its 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.720
 help you can choose one of the three 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.600
 modes 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.250
 normal eco or sport depending on 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.050
 the selected setting changes 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.630
 sensitivity and effort on the steering wheel 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.510
 reaction to pressing the gas pedal and even 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.830
 climate control 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.470
 sport mode steering wheel poured 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.380
 effort and engine speed rests on 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.210
 maximum torque 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.550
 If you turn on the eco mode then the car 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.980
 it will be as easy as possible to drive simply 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.960
 drive like a normal car seeking 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.240
 as soon as possible go to 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.430
 top gear and on the descent opens 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.560
 clutch in transmission keep and so 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.750
 way to imitate motion on neutral 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.090
 and all for better fuel efficiency 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.280
 and there is still the opportunity to make your 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.500
 own mode set up each of 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.920
 categories individually this is what it is not 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.870
 asking 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.150
 that fashionable chip feels good on 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.370
 meandering highways translate to 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.070
 Sport mode changes car behavior 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.620
 lightning fast from comfortable but quite 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.030
 normal hatchback seat leon turns 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.190
 into a real lighter 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.470
 simultaneously with the increasing effort on 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.010
 the steering wheel changes and the exhaust sound 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.350
 systems 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.170
 he becomes louder and more 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.750
 juicy by the way selector hold in this 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.270
 the case of the usual drive position is better 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.040
 also translate into sport mode what 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.680
 need on the Crimean mountain roads 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.900
 Transmission to the maximum use 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.980
 motor capabilities and does not go to 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.710
 overdrive 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.690
 when moving downhill it is also convenient 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.030
 engine braking 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.750
 principle, if necessary, you can 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.970
 engage 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.280
 and manual shift mode for 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.770
 extra money can be ordered and 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.600
 paddles we tried 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.030
 manually shift gears 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.040
 electronics in sport mode did 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.320
 it's also fast so why 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.240
 distracted by the gear shift if 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.180
 you can fully devote 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.280
 attention to the road and taxiing itself in all 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.600
 without exception grade seat leon 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.180
 equipped with a course system 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.980
 sustainability in its effectiveness we 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.240
 made sure as soon as the road fell 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.920
 first drops of rain 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.380
 felt like electronics 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.960
 retarding the Lego the right wheel 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.840
 and gives the car confidently spectacularly 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:04.200
 register a bunch of turns without her speed 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:06.330
 speed definitely would be less than that 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.750
 that the seat is almost premium 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.610
 mark 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.650
 say not only the materials of the finish 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.870
 Salon find useful chips that 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.860
 only available on most cars 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.650
 prestigious brands 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.270
 for example, six standard rb gov can 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.960
 add pad to protect your knees 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.540
 the driver 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.730
 system start and stop help system 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.830
 when starting on the rise finally 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.750
 electronics in this car can 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.610
 independently go from the far 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.570
 Light on the near so as not to dazzle 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.120
 oncoming drivers 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.580
 special system monitors the physical 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.860
 condition of the driver and if he starts 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.480
 nodding will sound unpleasant 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.760
 five-second beep and 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.540
 there will be an offer to stop for 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.670
 recreation sparkling mix the most 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.250
 perfect German technical solutions 

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.990
 and sensual Spanish design here 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.750
 what is the new seat leon 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.880
 and you can easily choose the heart but 

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.280
 you choose him and mind if carefully 

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.230
 examining the price list and understand what is here 

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.420
 There is almost everything that German 

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.420
 related competitors but to the foot
