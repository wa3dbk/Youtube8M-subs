00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
that I don't want to go okay so I've

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.060 
that I don't want to go okay so I've
hooked<00:05:27.030> up<00:05:27.240> it<00:05:27.630> up<00:05:27.660> over<00:05:27.930> here<00:05:28.260> here's<00:05:28.950> the

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
hooked up it up over here here's the

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.680 
hooked up it up over here here's the
system<00:05:29.490> I've<00:05:29.640> hooked<00:05:29.910> it<00:05:30.090> into<00:05:30.150> the

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
system I've hooked it into the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.750 
system I've hooked it into the
electricity<00:05:31.410> and<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.650> plugged<00:05:32.400> in<00:05:32.580> what<00:05:32.730> I

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
electricity and I plugged in what I

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.570 
electricity and I plugged in what I
think<00:05:33.090> was<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.330> you<00:05:33.960> know<00:05:34.080> audio<00:05:34.980> visual<00:05:35.310> feed

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
think was the you know audio visual feed

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.580 
think was the you know audio visual feed
into<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.390> cable<00:05:36.570> here<00:05:36.930> if<00:05:37.110> I<00:05:37.200> remember<00:05:37.440> how<00:05:37.530> to

into the cable here if I remember how to

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:45.010 
into the cable here if I remember how to
do<00:05:37.740> this<00:05:37.770> we<00:05:38.730> activate<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.420> television<00:05:39.840> set
