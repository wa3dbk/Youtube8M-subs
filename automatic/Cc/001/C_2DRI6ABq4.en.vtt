ricochets and BRP skid plates together

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.840 
ricochets and BRP skid plates together
they<00:02:34.140> look<00:02:34.320> easier<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.800> clean<00:02:35.040> than<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> gen1

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
they look easier to clean than the gen1

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.910 
they look easier to clean than the gen1

little more preload to the shock and
what<00:04:48.760> we're<00:04:48.910> finding<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.660> with<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.590> gen<00:04:50.860> 2

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
what we're finding is with the gen 2

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.400 
what we're finding is with the gen 2
chassis<00:04:51.580> doesn't<00:04:51.910> hurt<00:04:52.060> them<00:04:52.210> at<00:04:52.300> all<00:04:52.420> the

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
chassis doesn't hurt them at all the

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.080 
chassis doesn't hurt them at all the
shocks<00:04:53.650> are<00:04:53.920> a<00:04:53.950> little<00:04:54.250> plush<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.670> start<00:04:54.910> off

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
shocks are a little plush to start off

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.940 
shocks are a little plush to start off
with<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.510> we<00:04:55.630> add<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:55.960> onto<00:04:56.230> it<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:56.560> stiffens

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
with so we add this onto it it stiffens

with so we add this onto it it stiffens
the<00:04:57.010> ride<00:04:57.280> up<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.670> it<00:04:57.730> makes<00:04:57.910> it<00:04:58.030> actually

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
the ride up and it makes it actually

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.500 
the ride up and it makes it actually
very<00:04:58.780> nice<00:04:59.020> very<00:04:59.530> well<00:04:59.800> for<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.610> mud<00:05:00.820> some

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
very nice very well for the mud some

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.970 
very nice very well for the mud some
very<00:05:01.720> nice<00:05:01.870> clutch<00:05:02.170> work<00:05:02.410> we've<00:05:02.590> added<00:05:02.770> we've

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
very nice clutch work we've added we've

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.030 
very nice clutch work we've added we've
put<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.340> best<00:05:03.580> on<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.360> QSC<00:05:04.930> primary<00:05:05.800> and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
put the best on it the QSC primary and

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.270 
put the best on it the QSC primary and
the<00:05:06.610> STM<00:05:07.150> secondary<00:05:07.930> they're<00:05:08.650> both<00:05:08.860> roller

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
the STM secondary they're both roller

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.920 
the STM secondary they're both roller
clutches<00:05:09.910> so<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.750> very<00:05:11.230> quick<00:05:11.850> reaction<00:05:12.930> power

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
clutches so a very quick reaction power

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.930 
clutches so a very quick reaction power
transfer<00:05:14.590> through<00:05:14.860> it<00:05:15.010> we've<00:05:15.250> also<00:05:15.430> added<00:05:15.730> the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
transfer through it we've also added the

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.270 
transfer through it we've also added the
heavy-duty<00:05:16.570> BRP<00:05:17.410> belt<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:18.010> it

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
heavy-duty BRP belt to it

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.430 
heavy-duty BRP belt to it
this<00:05:18.700> is<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.000> best<00:05:19.210> attempt<00:05:19.690> for<00:05:19.900> performance

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
this is the best attempt for performance

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.280 
this is the best attempt for performance
in<00:05:20.590> belt<00:05:20.830> light<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:22.540> we<00:05:22.630> can<00:05:22.660> do<00:05:22.900> different

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
in belt light and we can do different

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.150 
in belt light and we can do different
stages<00:05:23.740> to<00:05:23.890> this<00:05:24.070> you<00:05:24.340> can<00:05:24.580> just<00:05:24.610> have<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.090> QSC

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
stages to this you can just have the QSC

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.980 
stages to this you can just have the QSC
with<00:05:27.160> a<00:05:27.190> stock<00:05:27.550> clutch<00:05:27.880> onto<00:05:28.150> it<00:05:28.480> you<00:05:28.600> can<00:05:28.810> do

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
with a stock clutch onto it you can do

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.660 
with a stock clutch onto it you can do
clutch<00:05:29.290> kits<00:05:29.620> but<00:05:29.770> this<00:05:29.950> is<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.220> way<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.430> go

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
clutch kits but this is the way to go

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.549 
clutch kits but this is the way to go
for<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:30.970> mud<00:05:31.210> built

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:32.559 
for a mud built

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.319 
for a mud built
like<00:05:33.039> I<00:05:33.159> said<00:05:33.309> that<00:05:33.489> bolt<00:05:33.759> roller<00:05:34.029> design

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:34.329 
like I said that bolt roller design

00:05:34.329 --> 00:05:36.899 
like I said that bolt roller design
clutches<00:05:34.989> so<00:05:35.019> they're<00:05:35.379> better<00:05:36.099> technology

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
clutches so they're better technology

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:44.660 
clutches so they're better technology
than<00:05:36.939> what<00:05:37.179> you<00:05:37.329> get<00:05:37.479> with<00:05:37.689> stock
