00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.600
 as soon as you lose who says you 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.400
 loose the brakes latif 20 towards the 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.879
 left to take your tone correctly 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.879
 right turn 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.950
 camel I could not have a bike that 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.450
 I got to langer in Algiers as 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.650
 follows in fact 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.290
 could not afford to buy a bike 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.590
 but to go to the post office does not know 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.700
 to swim 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:35.190
 I feel good morally 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:38.760
 I am the magic of cycling is to fall 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.590
 at a standstill and ride in balance for 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.560
 we security first is the drees 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.660
 in shape not young people who will hurtle 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.430
 mountain bike slopes in the shape of adults 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.720
 who want to walk first 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.730
 with their children to go to 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.660
 towers so a security is an element 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.130
 essential 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.260
 again it's by 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.020
 learning the press and everything 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.530
 lots of little things to know for sure 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.520
 not fall 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.500
 the goal is not their 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.500
 to learn how to fall out does not fall 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.700
 over two hours there are three students 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.250
 for which this is the first class 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.509
 had never done it and I think that 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.140
 the end of the session and they will have found 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:20.580
 the keys look annick me I'm serving to 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.290
 to say that I'm going there to ride a bike 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.720
 we always say everyone knows how to do 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.940
 of the bike not everyone knows is going to do 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.990
 biking 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.399
 So here I know what I need 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.380
 almost alone I'll never get there 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.759
 then when we learn with someone from 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.090
 his family people get mad all over 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.009
 after 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.050
 so in fact it's good there we are all 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.000
 at the same level as it's great it puts in 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.890
 Confidence has not seen in apparent 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.990
 so, it's OK 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.220
 we have fun last week on 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.150
 had a little pain in the buttocks when coming in 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.150
 but hey that's fine 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.530
 it's people who realize a dream 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.820
 that they had considered 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.970
 impossible even in their best 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.970
 rules
