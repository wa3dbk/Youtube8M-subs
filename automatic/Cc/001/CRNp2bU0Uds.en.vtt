00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.420
 olives and olive oil and 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.140

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.480
 salt pepper to taste and such 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.969
 walnuts will add a piquant touch and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 so I put it in my plate 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.530
 I need the portion of arugula but we have very 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.170

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.260
 cherry tomatoes you need one 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.240

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.130

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.130

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.730
 cut into circles 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.730
 and we literally divide it into 3 parts 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.690
 add olives to our salad 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.360
 Now I will cut the mozzarella and I cut it 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.090

 Perfectly the best not visas are torn that not 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.450

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.270
 now take walnuts and optional 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:12.080
 a small handful and just break them 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:17.270

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.889
 Now you need to salt our delicious river 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.069

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:28.689

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.010
 improvised sour cream 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.939
 relatively similar to sour cream and here 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.650

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:46.000
 convenient to cut it in circles at the ceremony 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.600
