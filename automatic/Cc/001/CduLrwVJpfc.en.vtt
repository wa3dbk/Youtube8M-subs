00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.370
 well here I bring you another video where 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.290
 will show how to install the recovery 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.930
 clockwork mode how to make copies of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.969
 up and restore installed in 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.740
 this case we are going to install the network of 100 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:23.430
 mod 10 with android and in living 4.1.1 os 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.810
 I'll leave the links of x of a in the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.080
 description of the video and files 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.840
 what we need to do this is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.329
 need to be root if I'm not root yet 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.860
 I recommend that you watch the first video of 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.019
 how to become root that left him also in 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.000
 the description 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.860
 download the files that 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.250
 we need like the recovery clone wars 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.000
 mod 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.240
 5 026 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.850
 the room and the glasses that are the 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.250
 Google applications like for example 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.520
 the play store that normally the student 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.010
 has them installed as standard we copy to 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.390
 been files on the phone sd and 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.390
 We're already on the phone 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.690
 once we have put the files in 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.450
 the headquarters we organize the phone in mode 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.450
 recovery and we give to apply that decade 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.799
 we select the recovery clover moore 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.310
 and now the recovery is installed 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.240
 it is already installed recovery therefore 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.240
 we will now make the system 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.560
 we have already made the phone and we have 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.360
 entered again in the recovery mode and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.479
 as we can see here the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.750
 version that we wanted the 5 026 that brings 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 options like backing up 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.810
 to advanced option to clean the memory 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.450
 cache quite more options than recovery 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.310
 that our daughter series 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.289
 then now the first thing we're going to 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 do before changing the room is to do 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.729
 a backup of the ROM 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.800
 we have and the data we release for 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.640
 we go down here until backup 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.540
 soon store 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.540
 we select and select backup 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.180
 therefore it will begin to become a 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.180
 backup of the entire system 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.550
 the backup has already been created 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.170
 as when and backup complete and now if 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.940
 We would like to restore that copy of 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.520
 security we go back to the layer the rest 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.840
 we select and instead of giving the cow 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.989
 as before we give the rector 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.550
 and here we see the different 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.129
 security that we have sorted by 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.670
 date and time and selection we would now 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.670
 what did he do 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.160
 Now let's clean up the report we will 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.170
 erase everything that has one side of the 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.280
 sd is not deleted 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.280
 to be able to install the rumba 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.459
 for this we go here you have to do these 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.580
 two white wildlife astÃ©rix reset and the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:18.180
 white cache partition 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.180
 we do the same the order we enter 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.330
 we confirm it and I start to format it 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.550
 the partition 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.090
 already done and right now with the 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.090
 following 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.530
 we confirm 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.709
 and it is done and now we proceed to 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.110
 set the room in this case the images 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.850
 very well 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.590
 we do it in the same way that 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.310
 what we did before paraphrasing the 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.310
 other files 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.100
 we confirmed the installation and it's already starting 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.270
 to install the rom 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.660
 Now we come back when I finish 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.660
 install 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.960
 I have already installed and reset the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.030
 phone to finish installing 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.880
 let's go back we have ribot system 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.470
 side to start the system the first 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.790
 it will take longer than usual because 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.790
 they continue to install 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.560
 so you have to wait a while and 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.110
 Now when you finish installing 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.590
 we all come back with the room to move 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.590
 a little 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:38.219
 here we have the rumba 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.219
 as we see it was removed 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.360
 and it works pretty fluid 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.760
 I have not had time to try it on 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.950
 background or nothing seems to be going well 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.520
 we are going to make the phone as 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.520
 you see the version 4.1 points here 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.289
 now what remains is to install the glasses 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.379
 in the opposite action in the play this 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.779
 because as you see here it does not seem like this 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:13.020
 let's go to it we have to go in 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:15.270
 new to the recovery but the rom 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.249
 custom is usually not necessary 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.869
 to let press the two buttons or nothing 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.540
 we have only pressed the button 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:23.560
 blocking 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.060
 we give you a restart and they do not appear here 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.880
 different options then we give 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.790
 here to recovery to enter recovery and 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.790
 already restarts directly to the recovery 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.759
 we are here in the recovery and we are going to 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.759
 be here 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.300
 to install as we have already installed 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.300
 all 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:51.370
 and we beat them 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.190
 gaps living jmi 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.580
 to install it 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.509
 we confirm it 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.509
 they are installing 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.020
 and it's already installed and we made 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.020
 new the phone 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.940
 to buy sanz 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.940
 because they have enlisted 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.409
 it's already finished 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.559
 today we are going to verify that they have 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.559
 installed 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.630
 and the play store has also installed the 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.970
 voice search 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.630
 I do not remember anymore this application of 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:35.160
 google and well that basically and already 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:38.730
 we have prepared our rom for 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.560
 to use it we will make another video by casting 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.380
 a look at this theft and personalizing 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.120
 how to remove the applications that do not 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.610
 let's use for example in dialing 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.200
 by voice or file manager because this is not 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:55.040
 can install as an application 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.040
 normal, and see you next video
