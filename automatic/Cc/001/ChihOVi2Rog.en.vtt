00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.040
 second part of the top 10 best autumn 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.900
 animes on the fifth place me 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.519
 especially proud that it shows that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.830
 my subscribers quite something 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.789
 crimson what is not so typical 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.170
 And the speech is from kinga increase - one 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.330
 romance drama that is about the boy 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.130
 Pianist's course is already turning in 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.680
 boy has lost his mother 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.390
 and never played piano again 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.369
 but one day then a leader 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.460
 know violinist and she represents his 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.809
 live completely again on the head 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.520
 chicago - that's beautiful 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.200
 history and at first I was even 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 not sure if it really is 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 a good drama is there for me 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.430
 history with the mother just not 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.020
 was enough 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.270
 but over time, it evolves 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.160
 then much more and place five 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.870
 is more than justified for 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.870
 this beautiful drama 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.809
 fourth place is claimed 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.109
 further on him he out of the field 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.239
 universe and indeed fate unlimited blade 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.219
 works and sven again legendary heroes 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.920
 summoned to fight for the sacred 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.450
 gral discharge pay day night is one 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.770
 the few not seen animistically 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.509
 but that is not really 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.369
 because I do not think he's good 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.380
 It's just because I'm just 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.940
 fans over and over got the place 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.100
 is certainly earned and me 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.720
 become facebook lite unlimited blade 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.720
 works will certainly catch up 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.399
 third place goes to the adventure anime 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.290
 to be only the one in which the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.180
 own holy knights magical powers 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.899
 to the sacred botanical empire too 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.700
 defend 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.799
 but there are seven among them 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.570
 to the enemies of the most holy knights 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.530
 People were calling them the 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.299
 seven deadly sins 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.909
 but these are now over ten 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.170
 years lost to each other 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.220
 I must be really hard 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.380
 break a lance 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.929
 he is one of my absolute highlight 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.429
 and probably would be my number two there 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.289
 season really also some others 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.060
 had to offer highlights 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.289
 Characters are really crazy and 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.030
 refreshingly different 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.770
 although they are clear stereotypes 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.049
 are very far ahead 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.390
 of course, a melody us that too 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.130
 Domestic pig squatting the doctor's target 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.420
 me just as well as the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.920
 soundtrack and the running gags 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.140
 work here for once 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.880
 really very good as well 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.519
 really the scraps fly here if it 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.530
 the thing is to do ana to the not ice 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.250
 In any case, we have a very clear one 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.250
 recommendation 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.840
 the second place could be the second 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.220
 secure scale of psych 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.560
 in which we still history 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.000
 from agnico mori follow the now as 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.040
 senior inspectors against the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.440
 crime in the near future in tokyo 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.180
 I fought ipad 2 was personal to me 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.310
 one of the series I'm looking for 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.290
 I was especially happy because I had the first 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.280
 Season very much liked the second season 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.109
 still really good 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.180
 the character development of akw is 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.040
 hard to miss the newly introduced 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.239
 characters come good but you miss 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.790
 also some from the previous ones 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.209
 season without too much anticipation 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.069
 to take 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.350
 the real sticking point is then 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.690
 the end because they rather than 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.549
 unsatisfactory felt nonetheless 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.650
 is it a really good anime 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.920
 certainly landed in my top five 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.920
 would 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.219
 and place number one goes to 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.790
 or if the user 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.380
 First place goes to a teenager and gentlemen 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.420
 it is about parasites in the 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.220
 head of people drill around them as 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.350
 to misuse the values ​​and the complete 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.640
 to take control over them and 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.020
 they have to survive so they can survive 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.650
 people eat meat and not too 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.720
 situate 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.130
 and so it comes to numerous 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.390
 but I can kill these the police 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.400
 do not really explain they call it 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.780
 kill the minced meat and then there is 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.520
 also a parasite that tries that 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.320
 to take control of shinichi 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.970
 but instead of putting it in the head 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.920
 he only succeeds in control over 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.870
 to gain the arm and so they have to 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.240
 now coexist together 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.580
 I have to honestly say crisis is 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.500
 really an absolute stunner 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.810
 Great action drama that both me 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.830
 takes along emotionally as well as a tremendous 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.930
 builds up tension 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.790
 every consequence brings new exciting 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.330
 information and always has something to 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.980
 Offer 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.900
 besides, the setting is still very much 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.450
 unused and diagonal between 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.160
 media the parasitic arm in jazz and him 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.660
 themselves are just great 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.690
 as well as the character development 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.480
 divorced goes through a personal 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.790
 top 3 would have looked like it would 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.980
 only in number three men to the emergency 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.510
 skating number three with something 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.550
 projection then or paris seyed on 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.920
 place number one as well as it does 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.900
 killed on square number one yes 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.880
 that was it for today again 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.740
 That was the top 10 of the best autumn 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.650
 animes now coming soon 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.300
 the voting for the current season times 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.729
 look what comes i think in a two 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.620
 Three weeks more towards the end of the 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.990
 you hate that as well 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.220
 well, an anime is maybe like that 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.940
 last part also no insider 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.770
 information 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.479
 There are two animes you do not have 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.250
 in the top ten commandments I I 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.550
 personally but still seen that are 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.320
 on the one hand magic kalthof 14 12 and cross 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.340
 I can not match for the two 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.360
 an unqualified recommendation 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.430
 output 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.849
 especially percent is something 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.990
 special and 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.059
 I do not know myself exactly what I am 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.819
 of it is to hold magic eito is just 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:19.219
 no upps from poland you know 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.610
 Maybe it is nice if you have the 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.139
 market 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.879
 Of course I have to say that is very much 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.979
 episodic and does not have it 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:27.589
 somehow the mega bang capital story 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.789
 but still nice and one more 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:30.619
 small tip if you the complete 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.539
 list so you want the complete 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:34.279
 list of anime daily the top 10 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.499
 but were so 11 12 13 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.509
 thus places all with voting again 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:39.439
 listed and liked with you 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.409
 It likes to write in the comments 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:46.659
 or load thumbs who are quite nice and 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.659
 with it shot and see you next time
