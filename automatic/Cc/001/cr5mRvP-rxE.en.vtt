00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.569
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.280
 twelfth episode of right away this 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.840
 once again devoted to the future of movies 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.100
 adapted video games then you 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.630
 surely know all the excellent 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.250
 chronic prost who was dealing with the link 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.109
 between these two media to perfection 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.520
 but that's not a reason not to 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.240
 talk about it on this channel then 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.980
 let's go 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.109
 video games are an important part 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.240
 of our culture is today more 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.650
 than ever from a smartphone everyone 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.419
 had hundreds of games within range of 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.849
 inch and this for free 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.500
 and even if you have never played there 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.450
 do not tell me you do not know super 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.550
 mario or when dick rock from 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.379
 always extremely popular games 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.570
 video have known over time how to weave 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.910
 powerful links with the other arts that 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.699
 this is music painting or again 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.590
 obviously the cinema but the video game 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.109
 it's also strong licenses and that 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.579
 says license says fan and who says fan says 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.030
 market to conquer for the industry 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.800
 Hollywood 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.600
 very quickly the rights of many games 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.219
 video are purchased by the majors and 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.190
 adaptations is born and it's 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.690
 always always a disaster you have 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.850
 certainly heard about 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.760
 regrettable adaptations of super mario 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.610
 tivo residents alone in the dark 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.040
 fell raider and so on it's always 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.500
 critical failure and often failure 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.750
 public with a few exceptions well 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.520
 sure in recent months a number 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.930
 hallucinating of the adaptation of licenses 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.540
 popular video games have been 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.729
 announced and I find it pretty amazing 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.829
 so before I continue I have to 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.020
 to clarify the situation 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.689
 adapted from the novel we know how to adapt 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 tales of poems legends 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:38.049
 we have adapted video games 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.790
 still no one has been successful there this is 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.979
 the exception that confirms the rule would be 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.119
 the first century silent but if we are 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.250
 not happen it's for a reason of 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.729
 size can not be transcribed 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.320
 the interactivity provided by the video game 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.659
 it's a strong bond that unites the player and 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.189
 the character he embodies the player himself 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.140
 project in the proposed adventures 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.090
 by the game since it is he who makes the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.340
 gait 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.740
 to press the buttons that will make 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.329
 unfold the adventure that's why the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.759
 movies that deal with video games or 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.099
 inspire without being adaptations are 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.530
 more interesting I think among other things 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.470
 to scott pilgrim vs the world a wargame 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.629
 or so blamed a pixel that on which 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.879
 sony put a lot and that seems to be 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.500
 honest and uninhibited entertainment 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.940
 what's funny is that the studios 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.280
 seemed to have calmed down these last 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.590
 years indeed even though bonuses except 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.510
 persia de disney released in 2010 is fast 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.730
 become the adaptation of a video game the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.110
 more profitable story 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.120
 the results on the territory 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.250
 american did not enthuse disney 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.079
 and therefore did not put a continuation into 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.970
 construction site today it's more of a 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.269
 twenty video game adaptation 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.980
 are programmed among them hitman who has 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.569
 already made a lot of ink 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.060
 effect the trailer is already out and 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.230
 promises a 100% action movie while the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.750
 game is supposed to stage a 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.799
 discreet assassin we also warcraft by 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.079
 a duncan jones 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.310
 the director of his score the film is 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.440
 already in post-production elsewhere and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.390
 promises to be extremely spectacular 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.579
 for the moment only two posters have 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.410
 been unveiled we should know more 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.630
 this year since it should come out the 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.670
 March 9, 2016 in France 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.049
 another highly anticipated film surely 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.799
 the one with the most interesting cast is 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.230
 full of promise 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.989
 it's assassin's creed led by 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.250
 Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.690
 who will arrive in our dark rooms on 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.940
 December 21, 2007 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.530
 animation side we will have the right to a 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.599
 feature film about the moron rabbits 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.400
 even though their game are on the decline the 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.799
 popularity of the protagonists have 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.090
 obviously not flaying ubisoft 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.130
 have a good surf on it 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.890
 Finnish revios are in the process 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.450
 of 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.670
 art is a feature film centered on a 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.560
 grill burns is still a place 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.790
 that we owe much of the wave of 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.040
 games on smartphones 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.260
 finally the most crazy project and 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.360
 science- style tetris adaptation 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.069
 fiction no more information for 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.230
 the moment but it's a project 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.420
 will follow closely on his channel visibly 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.830
 the film industry has decided to believe 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.950
 again in the power of video games 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.420
 and I confess that I searched but 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.070
 I did not find an official reason to 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.020
 this so what am I going to say now 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.850
 is that my opinion and it may be that this 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.920
 be completely wrong I think the 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.260
 studios anticipate the shambles of movies 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.670
 superhero is undeniable the super 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.709
 production of superhero movies 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.840
 valence and sooner or later this effect of 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.090
 rejection and the public will look for some 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.810
 fresh thing 2.9 but that would answer to 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.760
 their expectations 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.769
 indeed it's not a secret the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.750
 superhero lovers have often been 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.970
 immersed in the culture of video games and 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.770
 that the majors have understood this is 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.870
 so maybe without our knowledge 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.030
 an audience recovery program 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.290
 who is getting ready is frankly at their 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.060
 place I would do the same 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.550
 anyway I do not hide my 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.560
 waiting to see assassin's creed a mass 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.140
 effect 1 warcraft or even to tetris 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.460
 would give the cinema that could really 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.590
 bring new blood into the block 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.080
 busters that really starts to get everything 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.490
 looks like and this is episode 12 of 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.500
 right now and now finished 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.419
 I hope you have liked it here it is 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.640
 the case I encourage you to share a 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.380
 max the video to put also an inch 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.419
 green and if you want to participate in 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.669
 debates to put a little comment 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.990
 in the meantime, I'll tell you very soon 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.990
 on this ciao channel
