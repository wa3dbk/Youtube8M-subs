booster<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:14.570> look<00:00:15.570> at<00:00:15.690> my<00:00:15.780> pedal<00:00:16.080> board<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.350> see

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
booster I look at my pedal board you see

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.670 
booster I look at my pedal board you see
I<00:00:16.560> love<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.980> small<00:00:17.220> size<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.350> tuner

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
I love the small size of the the tuner

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.560 
I love the small size of the the tuner
of<00:00:19.859> everything<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:20.850> put<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.119> many<00:00:21.270> as<00:00:21.480> I

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
of everything I can put as many as I

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
of everything I can put as many as I
want<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.230> few<00:00:22.560> as<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.740> want<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.369> carry

want or as few as I want and I can carry
them<00:00:23.939> easily<00:00:24.140> here's<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.289> spark

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
them easily here's the spark

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.320 
them easily here's the spark
here's<00:00:26.699> dry<00:00:27.689> without<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.380> mean<00:00:29.330> there's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
here's dry without it I mean there's

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.590 
here's dry without it I mean there's
some<00:00:30.449> reverb<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.300> makes<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.420> nice

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
some reverb but with it makes a nice

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.430 
some reverb but with it makes a nice
booster<00:00:38.210> set<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> level<00:00:39.629> anywhere<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> want

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
booster set the level anywhere you want

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.010 
booster set the level anywhere you want
and<00:00:40.710> there's<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> cool<00:00:41.910> feature<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.570> if

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
and there's a cool feature about it if

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
and there's a cool feature about it if
you<00:00:43.200> hold<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> momentary<00:00:43.950> switch<00:00:44.219> down<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you hold the momentary switch down you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700 
you hold the momentary switch down you
get<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> boost<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.809> as<00:00:45.960> long<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.500> foot

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
get the boost for as long as your foot

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.299 
get the boost for as long as your foot
is<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> pedal<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.480> say<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.890> doing<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
is on the pedal so say you're doing a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.680 
is on the pedal so say you're doing a
ripping<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> them<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
ripping you just want one of them to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
ripping you just want one of them to
jump<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> little<00:00:52.860> bit<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.730> just

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.610 

that<00:01:06.760> gives<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.090> dynamics<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:07.810> some<00:01:08.380> men

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
that gives you dynamics and some men

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.560 
that gives you dynamics and some men
love<00:01:08.860> when<00:01:09.160> you<00:01:09.250> have<00:01:09.400> good<00:01:09.640> dynamics<00:01:10.150> because

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
love when you have good dynamics because

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.150 
love when you have good dynamics because
that<00:01:11.020> means<00:01:11.200> they<00:01:11.350> can<00:01:11.500> put<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.800> in<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.980> mix

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
that means they can put you in the mix

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.010 
that means they can put you in the mix
one<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:12.970> things<00:01:13.120> I<00:01:13.240> love<00:01:13.420> about<00:01:13.450> this<00:01:13.780> is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
one of the things I love about this is

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.710 
one of the things I love about this is
it's<00:01:14.530> clean<00:01:14.980> but<00:01:15.850> you<00:01:16.090> can<00:01:16.240> dirty<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.630> up

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
it's clean but you can dirty it up

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.260 
it's clean but you can dirty it up
enough<00:01:17.080> let<00:01:17.560> me<00:01:17.650> give<00:01:17.800> you<00:01:17.890> an<00:01:17.950> example<00:01:18.270> here's

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
enough let me give you an example here's

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.110 
enough let me give you an example here's
my<00:01:19.479> semi<00:01:20.320> distorted<00:01:20.890> rhythm<00:01:21.580> sound<00:01:21.850> I<00:01:21.970> use

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
my semi distorted rhythm sound I use

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:31.510 
my semi distorted rhythm sound I use
this<00:01:22.270> for<00:01:22.990> well<00:01:23.650> for<00:01:24.520> rhythm<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.850> lot

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.330 

it's<00:01:32.420> got<00:01:32.600> plenty<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:32.960> chunk<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.439> it<00:01:33.590> when<00:01:34.310> I

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
it's got plenty of chunk to it when I

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.940 
it's got plenty of chunk to it when I
add<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.729> boost<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.360> suddenly<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.229> I<00:01:36.619> could

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
add the boost to it suddenly and I could

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.399 
add the boost to it suddenly and I could
use<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.250> like<00:01:37.399> a<00:01:37.460> like<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.390> solo<00:01:38.780> sound<00:01:39.110> it's<00:01:39.290> got

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
use it like a like a solo sound it's got

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.910 
use it like a like a solo sound it's got
plenty<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:40.040> booths<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.790> carry<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.920> here's

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
plenty of booths to carry it here's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
plenty of booths to carry it here's
without<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.280> with<00:01:44.090> it

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.120 

it's<00:02:05.940> pretty<00:02:06.150> loud<00:02:06.300> and<00:02:06.600> here's<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.260> noise<00:02:07.440> no

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
it's pretty loud and here's the noise no

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.600 
it's pretty loud and here's the noise no
noise<00:02:08.160> gate<00:02:09.259> that's<00:02:10.259> with<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> boost<00:02:10.770> on<00:02:10.979> it's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
noise gate that's with the boost on it's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.210 
noise gate that's with the boost on it's
one<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:11.970> quietest<00:02:12.360> ones<00:02:12.540> I've<00:02:12.660> heard<00:02:12.870> so

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
one of the quietest ones I've heard so

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.960 
one of the quietest ones I've heard so
this<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.370> definitely<00:02:14.760> happening<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:16.820> due<00:02:17.820> to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
this is definitely happening and due to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.490 
this is definitely happening and due to
its<00:02:18.090> small<00:02:18.360> size<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.960> fact<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.380> so

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
its small size and the fact that it's so

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.940 
its small size and the fact that it's so
clean

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
clean

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.270 
clean
and<00:02:21.710> usable<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.000> think<00:02:24.650> I'm<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> get<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> few

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
and usable I think I'm have to get a few

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.490 
and usable I think I'm have to get a few
of<00:02:26.370> these
