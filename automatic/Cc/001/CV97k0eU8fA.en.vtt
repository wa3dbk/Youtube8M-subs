00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 I love you today with you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.640
 make this delicious bee sting 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.529
 I had that up some time ago 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.170
 instagram was posted there after the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.120
 The recipe last Sunday was ours 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.580
 Brunch and that's what I did 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 goes super fast is super easy 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.730
 and you do not need any 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.100
 exceptional ingredients 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.350
 you only need for the dough 500 grams 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.750
 wheat flour 100 grams sugar a pinch 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.180
 salt a cube of fresh yeast three 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.060
 tablespoon of oil a quarter liter of soy milk 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.180
 and for the lining and for the lining 75 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.160
 grams of margarine 50 grams of sugar and 200 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.860
 grated almonds the recipe ideas 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.120
 comes from the cookbook vegan the karl 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.980
 I'll ecker you down again 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.670
 link first we go the 500th 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.430
 Add van meel to a large bowl 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 then add sugar 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:01:00.870
 then scare the yeast in and give 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:01:04.110
 then we add salt to the salt 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.390
 in a small pot the soy milk and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.939
 the oil so that the yeast keeping track 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.659
 can rise and the dough also good 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.659
 can rise 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.840
 We will add the whole thing to the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.490
 add dough and knead well 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.650
 I 'm doing this in one now 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.729
 You can do that, of course 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.250
 often with a normal one 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.380
 hand stirrer make that works then 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.650
 Of course it's good that way, of course 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.350
 much more practical and goes great 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:47.350
 just so should the finished dough then 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.350
 appearance 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.080
 this should now be half an hour 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.390
 best put a dishcloth double 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.070
 track and in the meantime you can 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.490
 ever prepare the covering as 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.300
 said the 75 grams as seen in one 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.130
 give a small pot than we say then 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.250
 melted again then you can too 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.910
 already add the sugar and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.880
 then if all this then 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.050
 The planed almonds melted 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.510
 fold in and then the lining is too 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.850
 already done if the dough now 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.610
 then went the best way 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.920
 small cool rows spread then the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.370
 almonds on top of it so it just stops 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.370
 covered 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.810
 the whole thing looks like that to me 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.120
 and this now has to be preheated 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.000
 oven for about 15 minutes at 200 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.680
 baking degrees looks best 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.890
 after ten minutes with me he is now 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.510
 But then it turned brown 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.400
 still very delicious and you 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.470
 could still enjoy very well 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.420
 Just look a little bit at the time 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.740
 maybe yours is just as strong 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.050
 like minor and you need a bit 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.210
 less and just try it 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.250
 if you want it then if now 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.630
 I also had the appetite for another baking recipe 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.550
 then have a look here 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.560
 i already made hazelnut biscuit and 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.070
 white chocolate chip cookies until the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.070
 next time
