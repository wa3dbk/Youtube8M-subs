00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello, today we will discuss 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 advantage of the weapon bullpup design 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.790
 before the weapon of standard design decided 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.320
 touch on this topic because I realized that 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 many simply do not know what the difference is 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.540
 actually concludes so to begin 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.210
 let's see what is bullpap 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.100
 design this arrangement arrangement 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.080
 rifles and machine guns at which 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.480
 trigger brought forward and 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 located in front of the store and shock 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.740
 mechanism thanks to this arrangement 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.250
 significantly reduced overall length 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 weapons without changing the length of the barrel and 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.180
 respectively, without loss in accuracy and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.290
 shooting accuracy as well as effective 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.020
 firing range 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 it was a quote from wikipedia right away 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.980
 make a reservation what to show and tell 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.350
 I will take the example of assault rifles 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.420
 therefore all the meanings of which I will voice 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.120
 will relate exclusively to this 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.219
 weapons class since the bullpup design 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.750
 there is also in the class of carbines pdv 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.820
 rifles de amar 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.010
 and even in sniper rifle class with 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.129
 the slide gate in the description under this 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.309
 video I will give a link to site 7 fig where 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.450
 all these parameters can be found before 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.700
 how to tell about 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.580
 I will tell you the advantages of the bullpup design 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 about the four underlying factors 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.479
 affecting accurate shooting by example 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.799
 standard design assault rifle 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.659
 it will be m 416 why this is all 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.939
 it will just be easier for you to compare and understand 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.860
 exactly what design fits your 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.170
 style of play and so we start take m 416 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.790
 no additional gadgets affecting 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.780
 on accurate shooting for purity 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.700
 experiment 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.950
 the shooting will be full 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.530
 auto mode while standing 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.570
 as i said earlier there are four different 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 shooting options with any weapon and 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.230
 hence four scatter patterns 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.110
 corresponding to these four options 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.870
 option number one we stand still and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.180
 we shoot through the scope in this case we 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.890
 we get the minimum spread value 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.320
 which for rifles standard 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.190
 design is 0.2 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.850
 the lower the value the better 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.190
 option number two 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.960
 we shoot everything also through the sight but in 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.420
 shooting process moving in any 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.400
 direction the scatter value in this 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.830
 option increases significantly and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.680
 is already a unit which is five times 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.600
 worse than the first option 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.890
 option number three stand still but 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.650
 shoot from the hip 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.650
 we get the scatter value of 3 that is 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.710
 the spread is 15 times worse than the first version 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.870
 option number four shoot motion 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.520
 from the hip is the worst version of the plan 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.000
 accuracy since in this case 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.640
 the scatter value is 3.5 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.830
 with a standard design rifle we 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.810
 sorted out now let's see how 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.360
 same in these four options will lead 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.070
 yourself bullpup design take a weapon with 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.950
 about the same rate of fire 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.350
 let it be aug just as well without 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.180
 extra gadgets 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.340
 remember the wikipedia status at the beginning of this 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.840
 video since the bullpup design 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.660
 mean by themselves more 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.680
 ergonomic and de facto weapon 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.110
 hence the days decided it 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.910
 advantage realize in the game like me 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.610
 it seems they did it now 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.860
 I will explain why and so all the same four 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.200
 options in the same sequence 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.610
 option number one stand still and 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.640
 shoot through sight 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.500
 I remind for 416 the scatter value 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.950
 is 0.2 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.950
 case with oog we get 0.25 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.810
 where are the benefits ask you should not 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.410
 they will continue to be upset 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.870
 0.25 for bulpup rifles 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.760
 implemented just for the sake of balance to 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.709
 leave the choice to the player which one 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.520
 rifle use depending on 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.280
 play style 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.069
 option number two shoot through sight 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.310
 moving either way 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.859
 the scatter value and here is 0.8 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.010
 that is, the variation in this variant is 25 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.569
 percent less than m 416 for example 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.760
 face advantage 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.200
 option number three stand still 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.310
 shoot from the hip 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.040
 the value of the spread is 2.25 which is 25 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.909
 percent better than m 416 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.379
 option 4 shoot movement from the hip 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.819
 scatter value three point three hundred 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.430
 seventy five thousandths 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.079
 which is only almost 4 percent better 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.320
 than m 416 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.820
 but incidentally it is not surprising so obvious 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.160
 advantage of bullpup design 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.009
 traced in variants number 2 and 3 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.320
 but that 's not all let's go back on 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.970
 weapon setup screen and discuss one 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.340
 interesting feature 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.949
 namely ergonomic or vertical 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.660
 a handle that is 50 percent 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:39.509
 reduces scatter when shooting 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.530
 movement from the hip and attention to 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.080
 target mode 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.419
 in description it is not indicated wears fig 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.910
 the truth will not hide now let's compare 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.720
 two polar settings for different styles 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.940
 games m400 16 + potato meaning 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.690
 scatter when shooting in motion 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.000
 makes up a unit 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.090
 aug plus vertical handle 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.440
 respectively 0.4 i.e. in two 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.289
 half times better 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.310
 it is essentially trust me and so 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.409
 let's sum up 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.180
 if you have a habit before 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.159
 shooting stop for you 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.409
 ideal rifle standard 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.479
 design due to the minimum variation in 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.280
 such conditions if you are used to 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.050
 shoots at the enemy 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.630
 respectively, under your style of play well 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.940
 fit the score on the rifle 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.259
 equipped with ergonomic handle 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.599
 I hope explained and everything is very simple 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.599
 Thank you all for your attention.
