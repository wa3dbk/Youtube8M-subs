too concerned with it because it's gonna

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.720 
too concerned with it because it's gonna
be<00:01:04.680> hidden<00:01:04.860> under<00:01:05.129> hair<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.489> you're<00:01:05.580> probably

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
be hidden under hair so you're probably
