00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.299
 that a people like this is not because 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.400
 are very well that they do not call me li and 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.810
 well it was mentioned tutorial of what 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.450
 it would be a new map of origins 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.770
 of good xbox would appear good hector 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.660
 what I'm extracting today is like 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.779
 see the title is how to improve what 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.480
 would be the purple cane of rays or 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.739
 lightning as it says in the good game what 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.840
 first thing that we have to do is 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.280
 solve the riddle that they put us to 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.960
 to be able to improve each of the canes 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.850
 Well, in this case, we're going to be purple like that 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.580
 that we have what would be this 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.430
 panel that we saw right now what we have 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.930
 What to do is solve a series of notes 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.460
 that are going to put us that are these that 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.019
 we are seeing on the screen 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.570
 they would solve with a musical staff 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.059
 which is like this because we have a 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.190
 piano and good if you want to understand 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.650
 Well here you have the tools 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.379
 I'm going to tell you in the most 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.339
 easy that there is that is putting numbers 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.579
 to each of these one 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840
 of the pieces ok right now in the background 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.670
 is also what I already put a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.079
 password so to speak the note 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.969
 musical I put what would be 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:20.280
 15 and 10 here I leave what is 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.469
 right now on screen just 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.209
 they have to give him in this order I have 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.729
 understood that it never changes so 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.590
 trying so they do not lose anything at all 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.030
 case would go up again the good tutorial 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.729
 here he used what would be 5 8 and 12 them 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.439
 I'm going to leave this the annotation that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.000
 we will use we will do with 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.860
 numbers because if it's easier because not 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.119
 we all know music then 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.429
 they just have to hit him with the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.739
 purple cane obviously the 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.079
 numbers that I am telling you if you want 

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:50.879
 do it and understand it is pretty easy 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.310
 if they know of music if not the truth or what 

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:56.650
 try for what and good for the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.570
 next would be 3 16 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.180
 following the same annotation that 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.770
 put on the screen right now just 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.260
 they are counting from the beginning towards 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.009
 up and down and in the two that are 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.030
 together they would go from 5 to 6 nothing more like this 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.460
 from simple 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.500
 it looks quite difficult but rather it 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.150
 looks rather shielded because it does not 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.640
 we all know about music we do not all know 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.080
 of notes we know piano about 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.480
 all because this is an octave of a 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.670
 piano is not in piano is simply from 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.060
 finger to do 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.550
 what is a musical note ok and those of 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.770
 up are the sharp ones so not 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.060
 It has a lot of science and well that would be 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.220
 all since they solve it only in the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.800
 typical music that is when you solve 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.900
 a step of interest or do something here 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.610
 machin and good now what we have to 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.569
 do go there's going to be this spread out by 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.770
 the map 8 or 9 I do not remember well panels 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.180
 like these that are going to be taking out 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.700
 sparks what do we have to do 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.440
 is to turn the buttons that have these 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.170
 panels until they stop being removed 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.300
 sparks in our case there are panels that 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.390
 we did not get sparks then we had 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.700
 to move others to take them out 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.040
 sparks for example if in this case there 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.140
 two in the church if for example 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.390
 I was not getting sparks from 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.159
 this that is that in excavation not 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.750
 is sparking then we had 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.340
 that go to move the one that is in place 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.739
 Now, just give me the example 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.540
 to see the location we have 2 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.760
 in the church an excavation one here 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.599
 then counting the excavation there is another 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.420
 on the road that I think no no no no no 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.950
 are this is in this clip I put it in 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.680
 fast camera to be able to show you more 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.349
 places is just opposite the is 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.060
 my not from the location of this view - 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.340
 but on the contrary in that very same 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.409
 I can not bardita can not find 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.720
 this panel we also have another what 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:49.370
 it would be the start we have another one we already have 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:52.190
 the quantity of five or five panels 24 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.349
 simón 5 with this one that is here in the 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.620
 tank would be 6 we have another one in the 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.690
 journal would be 7 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.670
 and I think I need another one out there because 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.290
 it's eight but well you watch the 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.569
 example that I put them in the background so that 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.010
 see locations as I tell you this 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.480
 for example they took me not me not me 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.830
 the one who is afterwards sparks 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.239
 raising the excavation does not get me out of 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.409
 sparks the one that is in the beginning does not 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.629
 it takes out of sparks the one that is in 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.849
 digging and it was because there was no 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.130
 remembered the location of which is 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.350
 in the place which if I took sparks 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.380
 so they have to do it 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.240
 I recommend you do it between 2 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.889
 so they can do it faster 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.420
 for example this is the one I tell you that 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.430
 I took sparks is the one that I was missing 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.350
 that's why the others brought us sparks in 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.060
 how much I move the others started 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.290
 to make sparks and just the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.750
 they arrange until they stop pulling 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.910
 sparks I recommend that you wait 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.860
 tantito because sometimes tolerated and this 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.680
 it seems that no longer sparks but then 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.210
 it starts like that with delay not like this 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.890
 Do not leave, wait 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.970
 patience 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.410
 remember, have a lot of patience 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.930
 this is the most tedious of list because 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.000
 it does not even start direct yet 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.080
 any encounter the video that you 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.729
 tell of lister is that 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.740
 they are going to tell you that it is a requirement 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.379
 have the canes the four canes and 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.699
 improved so well do this good 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.340
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.930
 come here to the bottom of the pack 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.620
 to pons and move the levers until 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.349
 everyone 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.539
 all these wheels are put in color 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.490
 Pink is not complicated simply 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.210
 they give him movement until each one 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.729
 put on pink and put on 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.099
 Rosa is going to get an orb down here 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.810
 they just shoot him and he goes to 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.569
 illuminate was going to shoot out towards 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.639
 above 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.039
 already after they do this what 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.409
 we have to do is go to christie 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.419
 place a crazy place opening any 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.069
 portal here if it does not matter that therefore 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.569
 it only matters when they go to grab 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.849
 the crystal to create his cane but 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.849
 process is another thing what we have to 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.679
 to do here is to kill zombies simply 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.839
 in this area they do not have to be force 

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:55.960
 about his cane and the zombies 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:57.669
 will let go they will begin to release their souls 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.880
 how are they going to realize that it is already 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:04.120
 ready then they will leave this in red 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.590
 in your inventory the cane now go to 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.420
 see how I appear in the corner 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.270
 Upper right 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.950
 the red cane appears a small square with 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.720
 the red cane and it means that it is already 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.110
 ready when you 're ready the only thing 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.180
 have to do is approaching take your 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.700
 your cane and ready will be improved what 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.590
 benefits of having it improved 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.470
 you can load the cane 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.230
 leave the button shot say let 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.720
 pressed the button to shoot and goes 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.910
 to load and will drop this a ball of 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.670
 thunder that will kill several zombies 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.820
 As you can see there, I can take it and that's how it is 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.590
 As it is charged it can be charged up to three 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.850
 levels that would be the bottom part the 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.700
 part of the middle the top part and 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.520
 loose a ball of lightning that kills 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.690
 zombies that are close to her 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.930
 and it also gives you three high school 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:58.419
 shots when ammunition 4 to be able 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.800
 reviving someone is pretty good 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.680
 this 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.940
 this cane but there are better and 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.319
 good people that would be all for this 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.060
 tutorial hope you liked it if

 what is twitter and facebook and in 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.319
 the screen are seeing what andrew 

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:35.050
 senado my playstation haiti my people my 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:38.090
 account of this for games on pc 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.250
 mine for cameras some question to the 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.169
 that you want the context with everything 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.740
 I like my sky so you are in touch

 of origin is so that we can play
