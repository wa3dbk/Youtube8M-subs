I<00:02:12.840> think<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.290> actually<00:02:13.440> not<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:14.130> full

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
I think this is actually not the full

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.240 
I think this is actually not the full
size<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.940> but<00:02:15.239> it<00:02:15.750> works<00:02:16.050> great<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.920> use

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
size one but it works great so I use

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.229 
size one but it works great so I use
this<00:02:17.489> for<00:02:18.950> highlighting<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.280> also<00:02:21.060> for

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
this for highlighting and also for

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.750 
this for highlighting and also for
blending<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:21.780> harshness<00:02:22.170> like<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:22.920> apply

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
blending out harshness like if I apply

I just noticed this today my hair is
getting<00:04:14.310> like<00:04:14.670> crazy<00:04:15.329> long<00:04:16.250> like<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:18.049> feel

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
