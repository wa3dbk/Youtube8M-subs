like<00:06:03.360> leopard<00:06:03.780> and<00:06:04.320> I<00:06:04.560> think<00:06:04.890> what's<00:06:05.190> kind<00:06:05.400> of

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
like leopard and I think what's kind of

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.880 
like leopard and I think what's kind of
longer<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.390> then<00:06:06.570> it<00:06:06.720> has<00:06:06.930> like<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:09.180> bottom

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
longer and then it has like the bottom

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.410 
longer and then it has like the bottom
kind<00:06:10.890> of<00:06:11.010> curves<00:06:11.400> a<00:06:11.670> little<00:06:11.700> bit<00:06:12.030> if<00:06:12.120> you<00:06:12.240> can

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
kind of curves a little bit if you can

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.320 
kind of curves a little bit if you can
see<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:12.930> then<00:06:13.260> the<00:06:13.380> sleeves<00:06:13.740> are<00:06:14.040> rolled<00:06:14.370> up

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
see and then the sleeves are rolled up

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.970 
see and then the sleeves are rolled up
like<00:06:15.360> they're<00:06:15.750> stitched<00:06:16.050> like<00:06:16.410> that<00:06:16.620> and<00:06:16.830> then

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
like they're stitched like that and then

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.220 
like they're stitched like that and then
I<00:06:17.270> thought<00:06:18.270> maybe<00:06:18.360> you<00:06:18.600> can<00:06:18.780> wear<00:06:18.870> it<00:06:18.990> inside

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
I thought maybe you can wear it inside

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.680 
I thought maybe you can wear it inside
out<00:06:19.290> but<00:06:19.530> I<00:06:19.560> don't<00:06:19.800> always<00:06:19.980> think<00:06:20.010> you<00:06:20.250> could

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.540
