hi<00:00:00.900> folks<00:00:01.140> dan<00:00:01.560> Lezama<00:00:01.949> with<00:00:02.340> sundial<00:00:02.760> energy

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hi folks dan Lezama with sundial energy

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.260 
hi folks dan Lezama with sundial energy
here<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.799> really<00:00:04.799> love<00:00:05.009> solar<00:00:05.490> with<00:00:05.759> off-grid

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
here I really love solar with off-grid

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.270 
here I really love solar with off-grid
battery<00:00:06.690> backup<00:00:07.140> capability<00:00:07.859> because<00:00:08.069> it

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
battery backup capability because it

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.180 
battery backup capability because it
really<00:00:08.639> shows<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.840> what<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.349> possible<00:00:10.950> with

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
really shows you what is possible with

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.400 
really shows you what is possible with
solar<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.509> one<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.840> our<00:00:13.019> newest

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
solar so this is one of our newest

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.939 
solar so this is one of our newest
installations<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.670> Knightdale<00:00:15.410> we<00:00:16.410> have<00:00:16.650> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
installations in Knightdale we have a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.640 
installations in Knightdale we have a
2.8<00:00:17.850> kilowatt<00:00:18.359> system<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.289> roof<00:00:19.410> with

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
2.8 kilowatt system on the roof with

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.300 
2.8 kilowatt system on the roof with
very<00:00:19.830> small<00:00:20.160> PV<00:00:20.970> array<00:00:21.560> but<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
very small PV array but we have a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.790 
very small PV array but we have a
off-grid<00:00:24.240> capability<00:00:24.930> that's<00:00:25.080> rather<00:00:25.289> large

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
off-grid capability that's rather large

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.560 
off-grid capability that's rather large
here<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.970> arabian<00:00:28.099> 8,000<00:00:29.099> watt

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
here so we have the arabian 8,000 watt

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.319 
here so we have the arabian 8,000 watt

small battery bank the whole idea of
this<00:00:42.629> job<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.890> give<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.309> customer<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
this job was to give the customer a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
this job was to give the customer a
battery<00:00:46.309> system<00:00:47.780> with<00:00:48.780> solar<00:00:49.140> production<00:00:49.530> if

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
battery system with solar production if

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.279 
battery system with solar production if
the<00:00:50.340> grid<00:00:50.550> goes<00:00:50.820> down<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.570> her<00:00:51.750> critical

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the grid goes down to do her critical

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.459 
the grid goes down to do her critical
loads<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.940> did<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.870> took<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> number<00:00:55.320> of

and<00:01:12.900> disadvantages<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.920> use<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and disadvantages of this we use the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.399 
and disadvantages of this we use the
Outback<00:01:14.760> radiant<00:01:15.360> inverter<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:16.110> an<00:01:16.200> eight

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
Outback radiant inverter it's an eight

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.730 
Outback radiant inverter it's an eight
thousand<00:01:17.009> watt<00:01:17.250> inverter<00:01:17.610> system<00:01:18.740> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
thousand watt inverter system the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.190 
thousand watt inverter system the
advantage<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.280> using<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.700> outback<00:01:21.200> system

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
advantage of using the outback system

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.990 
advantage of using the outback system
here<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.130> had<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:23.729> large

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
here is that it had a very large

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.380 
here is that it had a very large
delivery<00:01:24.770> load<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:26.159> energy<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
delivery load of energy so we can do a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.160 
delivery load of energy so we can do a
number<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.960> circuits<00:01:28.829> off-grid<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
number of circuits off-grid here the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.929 
number of circuits off-grid here the
other<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.310> an<00:01:32.460> advantage<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
other thing with it's an advantage of

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
other thing with it's an advantage of
the<00:01:33.030> Outback<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.840> has<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.259> tremendous<00:01:34.619> surge

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the Outback is it has a tremendous surge

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.020 
the Outback is it has a tremendous surge
capability<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.979> rated<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.340> 8,000

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
capability so it's it's rated for 8,000

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.170 
capability so it's it's rated for 8,000
watts<00:01:39.119> continuous<00:01:39.750> output<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.799> do

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
watts continuous output but it could do

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.639 
watts continuous output but it could do
significantly<00:01:42.180> more<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.960> 1300

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
significantly more I think like 1300

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.980 
significantly more I think like 1300
watts<00:01:44.240> surge<00:01:45.240> if<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> needed

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
watts surge if it needed

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.840 
watts surge if it needed
-<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.100> got<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> lot<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.640> delivery<00:01:48.979> it's<00:01:49.979> its

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
- so it's got a lot of delivery it's its

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.399 
- so it's got a lot of delivery it's its
main<00:01:51.060> competitor<00:01:51.659> would<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> sunny

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
main competitor would be the sunny

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.149 
main competitor would be the sunny
island<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.970> sunny<00:01:54.210> island<00:01:54.450> has<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.350> product

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
island the sunny island has a product

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.160 
island the sunny island has a product
that<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:56.940> bit<00:01:57.150> more<00:01:57.360> expensive<00:01:57.960> so

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that is a little bit more expensive so

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
that is a little bit more expensive so
this<00:01:58.380> product<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.340> bit<00:01:59.460> more<00:01:59.659> cost

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
this product is a little bit more cost

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.850 
this product is a little bit more cost
effective<00:02:01.229> than<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.530> sunny<00:02:01.740> island<00:02:03.860> another

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
effective than the sunny island another

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.010 
effective than the sunny island another
advantage<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.720> comes<00:02:06.930> with

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.500 
organized looks good a really good
product<00:02:16.080> there<00:02:16.459> some<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.700> disadvantages

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
product there some of the disadvantages

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.830 
product there some of the disadvantages
is<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:19.590> really<00:02:19.860> tough<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.489> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
is that it's really tough to get the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.360 
is that it's really tough to get the
certain<00:02:21.840> breakers<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.440> here<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> certain<00:02:22.980> wire

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
certain breakers in here a certain wire

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.100 
certain breakers in here a certain wire
is<00:02:23.519> attached<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.209> battery<00:02:24.480> cable<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.900> very

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
is attached so the battery cable is very

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.199 
is attached so the battery cable is very
difficult<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.130> installed<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.880> here<00:02:27.090> and

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
difficult to get installed in here and

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.790 
difficult to get installed in here and
I've<00:02:27.300> actually<00:02:27.450> read<00:02:27.810> about<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.170> online<00:02:28.380> but

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
I've actually read about this online but

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.400 
I've actually read about this online but
when<00:02:29.280> we<00:02:29.430> did<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.600> realize<00:02:30.989> yeah<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.290> was

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
when we did it you realize yeah it was

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.900 
when we did it you realize yeah it was
pretty<00:02:31.560> tough<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.370> getting<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.730> battery

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
pretty tough so getting the battery

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.710 
pretty tough so getting the battery
cables<00:02:33.420> was<00:02:33.630> difficult<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:36.239> other<00:02:36.360> thing<00:02:36.600> is

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
cables was difficult the other thing is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.740 
cables was difficult the other thing is
on<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.260> type<00:02:37.769> of<00:02:37.850> system<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.570> have

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
on this type of system you have to have

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.180 
on this type of system you have to have
a<00:02:40.050> charge<00:02:40.530> controller

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
a charge controller

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.199 
a charge controller
so<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.269> array<00:02:43.700> goes<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> charge

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
so the array goes to the charge

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.490 
so the array goes to the charge
controller<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:45.930> charges<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
controller and then charges the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.030 
controller and then charges the
batteries<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:48.180> know<00:02:48.300> when<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> sunny

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
batteries you know when you do a sunny

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.580 
batteries you know when you do a sunny
island<00:02:50.280> system<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.600> actually<00:02:52.019> what's

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
island system it's actually what's

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.680 
island system it's actually what's
called<00:02:52.799> an<00:02:52.950> AC<00:02:53.100> coupled<00:02:53.700> system<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.329> you've

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
called an AC coupled system so you've

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.960 
called an AC coupled system so you've
got<00:02:54.900> your<00:02:55.019> solar<00:02:55.350> inverter<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.100> your<00:02:56.610> battery

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
got your solar inverter and your battery

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.580 
got your solar inverter and your battery
inverter<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.630> don't<00:02:57.959> need<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.200> charge

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
inverter you don't need a charge

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.039 
inverter you don't need a charge
controller<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.120> one<00:03:00.360> less<00:03:00.690> thing<00:03:00.720> that

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
controller so it's one less thing that

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.410 
controller so it's one less thing that
can<00:03:01.380> break<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:02.040> kind<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.700> like<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.030> about<00:03:03.329> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
can break I kind of like that about the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.170 
can break I kind of like that about the
sunny<00:03:03.630> island<00:03:03.840> system<00:03:04.610> but<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.850> sunny<00:03:06.090> island

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
sunny island system but the sunny island

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.729 
sunny island system but the sunny island
system<00:03:06.870> cost<00:03:07.470> more<00:03:07.769> has<00:03:08.400> less<00:03:08.940> delivery

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
system cost more has less delivery

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.680 
system cost more has less delivery
capability<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.820> disadvantage<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.600> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
capability so the disadvantage of the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.930 
capability so the disadvantage of the
sunny<00:03:12.900> island<00:03:13.200> is<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:14.100> currently<00:03:14.340> right

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
sunny island is that we currently right

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.500 
sunny island is that we currently right
now<00:03:14.970> cost<00:03:15.420> more<00:03:16.459> each<00:03:17.459> battery<00:03:17.970> inverter<00:03:18.150> from

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
now cost more each battery inverter from

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.590 
now cost more each battery inverter from
sunny<00:03:18.750> island<00:03:19.310> delivers<00:03:20.310> 40<00:03:20.700> amps<00:03:21.000> at<00:03:21.180> 128

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
sunny island delivers 40 amps at 128

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.000 
sunny island delivers 40 amps at 128
volts<00:03:23.329> so<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:24.420> would<00:03:24.750> need<00:03:24.930> two<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.799> those

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
volts so you would need two of those

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.539 
volts so you would need two of those
battery<00:03:26.459> inverters<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.209> do<00:03:28.110> less<00:03:29.070> than<00:03:29.100> what

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
battery inverters to do less than what

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.729 
battery inverters to do less than what
this<00:03:29.730> guy<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.000> do<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:31.140> you're<00:03:31.560> talking

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
this guy can do so you're talking

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.930 
this guy can do so you're talking
significant<00:03:32.730> more<00:03:33.090> cost<00:03:33.420> probably<00:03:34.170> around

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
significant more cost probably around

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.509 
significant more cost probably around
$5,000<00:03:35.940> at<00:03:36.090> least<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:37.170> do<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.950> same<00:03:38.160> amount<00:03:38.489> of

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
$5,000 at least to do the same amount of

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.890 
$5,000 at least to do the same amount of
energy<00:03:38.670> with<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.450> Sun

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
energy with the Sun

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.259 
energy with the Sun
the<00:03:40.799> other<00:03:40.950> disadvantage<00:03:41.670> of<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:41.970> type<00:03:42.239> of

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
the other disadvantage of this type of

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.170 
the other disadvantage of this type of
system<00:03:42.720> is<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.069> because<00:03:44.069> you<00:03:44.819> have<00:03:44.849> this

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
system is that because you have this

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.360 
system is that because you have this
charge<00:03:45.480> controller<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:46.349> there's<00:03:46.860> you<00:03:47.250> have

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
charge controller and there's you have

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.160 
charge controller and there's you have
to<00:03:47.519> take<00:03:47.700> DC<00:03:48.060> wires<00:03:48.239> all<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.659> way<00:03:48.780> from<00:03:48.959> here

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
to take DC wires all the way from here

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.050 
to take DC wires all the way from here
and<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.409> blower<00:03:49.620> voltage<00:03:50.159> you<00:03:50.580> need<00:03:50.790> bigger

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
and so blower voltage you need bigger

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.960 
and so blower voltage you need bigger
wires<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.379> can<00:03:52.830> use<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.190> think<00:03:53.310> minimum<00:03:53.849> of

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
wires so you can use I think minimum of

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.089 
wires so you can use I think minimum of
4<00:03:54.209> well<00:03:54.420> that's<00:03:54.540> that's<00:03:54.870> pretty<00:03:55.019> big<00:03:55.260> wire<00:03:55.470> I

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
4 well that's that's pretty big wire I

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.430 
4 well that's that's pretty big wire I
think<00:03:56.790> they<00:03:56.879> recommend<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.480> 3<00:03:57.870> or<00:03:58.049> up<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.409> a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
think they recommend like a 3 or up to a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.670 
think they recommend like a 3 or up to a
2<00:03:58.769> wire<00:03:59.370> big<00:04:00.239> wires<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:01.019> cost<00:04:01.319> a<00:04:01.500> lot<00:04:01.530> more

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
2 wire big wires that cost a lot more

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.819 
2 wire big wires that cost a lot more
money<00:04:02.069> very<00:04:02.760> difficult<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.599> install<00:04:04.470> so

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
money very difficult to install so

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.559 
money very difficult to install so
another<00:04:05.459> something<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.030> want<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.299> consider

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
another something you want to consider

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.330 
another something you want to consider
you<00:04:06.720> really<00:04:06.989> don't<00:04:07.230> want<00:04:07.409> your<00:04:07.560> weight<00:04:07.799> array

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
you really don't want your weight array

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.119 
you really don't want your weight array
to<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.180> too<00:04:09.629> far<00:04:09.900> away<00:04:10.170> from<00:04:10.230> a<00:04:10.680> system<00:04:11.010> if

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
to be too far away from a system if

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.009 
to be too far away from a system if
you're<00:04:11.250> doing<00:04:11.489> something<00:04:11.790> like<00:04:11.819> this<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.629> kind

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
you're doing something like this we kind

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:13.970 
you're doing something like this we kind
of<00:04:13.079> show<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.319> a<00:04:13.410> little<00:04:13.650> bit<00:04:13.769> of<00:04:13.799> how<00:04:13.920> the

of show you a little bit of how the
system<00:04:14.220> works<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.849> Geo<00:04:15.299> slow<00:04:15.599> Center<00:04:16.489> is<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.549> is

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
system works the Geo slow Center is a is

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.509 
system works the Geo slow Center is a is
a<00:04:18.449> very<00:04:19.109> nice<00:04:19.320> product<00:04:19.650> without<00:04:19.949> that<00:04:20.310> that

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
a very nice product without that that

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.850 
a very nice product without that that
really<00:04:20.760> kind<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.030> organizes<00:04:21.720> all<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.079> input

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
really kind of organizes all the input

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.810 
really kind of organizes all the input
and<00:04:23.039> output<00:04:23.100> circuit<00:04:23.910> breakers<00:04:25.460> what<00:04:26.460> we<00:04:26.669> do

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
and output circuit breakers what we do

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.360 
and output circuit breakers what we do
is<00:04:26.970> we<00:04:27.120> have<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.510> input<00:04:27.900> solar<00:04:28.620> array<00:04:28.949> coming

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
is we have the input solar array coming

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.800 
is we have the input solar array coming
in<00:04:29.490> here's<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.850> breaker<00:04:30.090> for<00:04:30.360> that<00:04:30.510> with<00:04:30.720> the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
in here's the breaker for that with the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.830 
in here's the breaker for that with the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
ground fault protection device it goes

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.050 
ground fault protection device it goes
into<00:04:34.199> your<00:04:34.710> charge<00:04:34.979> controller<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.789> charge

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
into your charge controller the charge

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.629 
into your charge controller the charge
controllers<00:04:36.660> charge<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.380> batteries<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:38.430> is

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
controllers charge the batteries this is

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.060 
controllers charge the batteries this is
the<00:04:38.789> breaker<00:04:39.030> for<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.419> output<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.380> charge

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
the breaker for the output of the charge

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.510 
the breaker for the output of the charge
controller<00:04:42.139> these<00:04:43.139> are<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.530> breakers<00:04:43.950> for

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
controller these are the breakers for

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.159 
controller these are the breakers for
the<00:04:44.849> batteries<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.570> disconnect<00:04:46.080> the

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
the batteries to disconnect the

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.000 
the batteries to disconnect the
batteries<00:04:47.419> then<00:04:48.419> there's<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.139> grid<00:04:49.410> input

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
batteries then there's the grid input

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.370 
batteries then there's the grid input
coming<00:04:50.700> in<00:04:50.940> this<00:04:51.270> also<00:04:51.510> has<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.810> bypass

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
coming in this also has a bypass

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.839 
coming in this also has a bypass
function<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:52.979> can<00:04:53.220> use<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.610> grid<00:04:53.789> to

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
function so you can use the grid to

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.940 
function so you can use the grid to
either<00:04:54.389> charge<00:04:54.630> your<00:04:54.780> batteries<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.740> could

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
either charge your batteries you could

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.850 
either charge your batteries you could
bypass<00:04:56.160> use<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.880> grid<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.120> charge<00:04:57.680> your<00:04:58.680> loads

safe we like them a lot of personal
relations<00:05:35.069> a<00:05:35.280> little<00:05:35.849> bit<00:05:36.000> more<00:05:36.180> expensive

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
relations a little bit more expensive

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.480 
relations a little bit more expensive
than<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.050> regular<00:05:37.410> batteries<00:05:38.099> but<00:05:38.310> they're

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
than the regular batteries but they're

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.580 
than the regular batteries but they're
they're<00:05:38.819> good<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.750> was<00:05:39.930> a<00:05:39.960> good<00:05:40.259> installation

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
they're good it was a good installation

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.650 
they're good it was a good installation
took<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.160> lot<00:05:41.400> longer<00:05:41.430> than<00:05:41.940> we<00:05:42.090> thought<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.509> was

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
took a lot longer than we thought it was

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.180 
took a lot longer than we thought it was
going<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:43.370> but<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.699> do<00:05:44.970> like<00:05:45.389> the<00:05:45.569> product<00:05:46.190> it

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
going to but I do like the product it

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.659 
going to but I do like the product it
definitely<00:05:47.849> does<00:05:48.509> a<00:05:48.539> lot<00:05:49.259> for<00:05:50.070> its<00:05:50.280> price

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
definitely does a lot for its price

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.379 
definitely does a lot for its price
point<00:05:50.699> so<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.389> like<00:05:51.630> it<00:05:52.220> but<00:05:53.220> there's<00:05:53.699> is

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
point so I like it but there's is

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.360 
point so I like it but there's is
definitely<00:05:54.900> more<00:05:55.970> more<00:05:56.970> time<00:05:57.240> consuming<00:05:57.840> and

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
definitely more more time consuming and

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.090 
definitely more more time consuming and
you<00:05:59.370> know<00:05:59.520> installation
