 [Music] 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.859
 the framework is even the cradle of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.320
 some of the best wines they make in 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.840
 world and is once again the stage of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.789
 third edition of the douro film harvest and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.630
 this choice of the organization did not 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:36.619
 wonder what better setting than this 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:36.619
 [Music] 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.830
 As I have great mentor of this douro 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.480
 film harvest the easy manel is immoral is 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.060
 question that arises first is 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.500
 because this is the douro as the stage for a 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.610
 this year's event 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:56.140
 It's good that I was going to say why douro is 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.400
 the only one is and because the cinema is and douro 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.410
 it's all about 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.820
 and because the bond can be inviting 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.330
 to know gol explained 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.430
 is the wine is a moment or 15 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.280
 cements aware link to 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.650
 many themes and and so doubt that helps 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.979
 to take goal begins the film and 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.259
 started this year's crop showing 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.250
 the best if not the best programming 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:24.100
 we do not have an athlete is 60 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.740
 but 80% before debut 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.430
 the dashboard for a car out of the big 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.310
 centralities is something of unusual branches 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.220
 with an accurate Portuguese film is a 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.390
 brand to save a sound absolutely 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.569
 extraordinary and one week in 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.729
 Brazilian is in Portuguese in many 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.880
 nationalities and therefore in the 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.550
 We open the odor or the world that is our 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.710
 great goal is to save money that the 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.920
 people also note that the 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.330
 world is 11 parcels being this is 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.460
 third harvest 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.399
 the organization has already begun to 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.220
 signs of the real impact of the event and 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.970
 that one could see in these three years the wine 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.350
 the region the cinema and the losers everything 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.310
 they go out to win 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.300
 the impact made a beautiful with the com 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.360
 curiosity as it is and we do not have a 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.550
 number adds Italians because the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.620
 Queen and such until last year 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.930
 come to veto them fado sylvain by 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.030
 example is and therefore usually arrive 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.760
 a large number of Italian visitors 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.400
 the goal because they want to be there 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.610
 do is exactly the opposite arrive and 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.430
 is out and gradually our people our 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.220
 Word in paulo I'm going to build a day 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.020
 but what is fact is that we have two 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.870
 Italian filmmakers who are 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.819
 sell the behavior of 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.549
 Let's make an upcoming documentary here. 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.140
 commentary will be on the subject 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.959
 musician to something that 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.110
 In her life she was in love. 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.610
 It is also important for us to create 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.230
 formation of a local public that has 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.040
 entire private what the government 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.510
 This I took the movie the most 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.099
 and more 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.890
 are exhibitions in music is in the background a 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:18.269
 fun even with Carlos 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.379
 wine is our Portuguese product and is 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.200
 center of the table 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.030
 this year the Brazilian cinema has been in 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.720
 featured in the festival with the honors 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.530
 to the director cacá diegues and the actor josé 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.810
 wilker 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.150
 the poster ended Sunday in key 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.290
 of gold as the projection of the film 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.090
 the agreste tieta this year is still 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.670
 normal internet page also the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.859
 right to a mobile application is 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.540
 It is possible to get to know the festival better 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.639
 follow the schedule and until you 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.139
 tickets for the movie we want to see 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.329
 It's obvious that this year we're not going on time. 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.940
 to see any of the movies in theaters but 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.040
 already know that in 2011 will have to 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.599
 reserve its place in that which is 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.070
 considered one of the best rooms 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.220
