 play at the premiere at ica bf 4 and 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:46.300
 nfs for speed rail bump on ps4 and xbox 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.949
 so one so baer 4 on xbox one is in 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.570

 for that and I also want you in 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.579

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.679
 so I will surely make you a 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.659
 nice little editing of my 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.249
 evening ie the entrance or is it 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.640
 that it is this past to happen at the royal 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:03.699
 heap 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.809
 for those who know this is a hotel 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.890
 five stars so already I was 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.240
 really impressed when I'm 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.340
 arrived you see the header you 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.480
 would of course put a cloud 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.350
 it was really very impressive 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.940
 thought I was not going back from 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.830
 comminges and dressed but eventually he 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.270
 there was no problem the welcome was 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.530
 super warm and people said she 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.040
 we said hello welcomed us 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.290
 open arms 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.060
 there were even some developers from 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.620
 iec and who was there for us 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.750
 explain a little to those who 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.070
 were interested precisely how is this 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.230
 that they had developed these two games 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.910
 so I'm going to give you a 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.760
 small impression 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.500
 so I play abf 4 on xbox one 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.320
 it was really great so it was 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.760
 a little moment that I do not want apf and 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.920
 bf3 of course by bf 4 may I really fuck 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.710
 liked the game I really quickly picked up 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.150
 my foot also say that you are everything 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.710
 immediately put at ease I do not find 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.490
 put xbox one is not 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.960
 disturbing 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.540
 I am ps3 player for a very long time 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.280
 the xbox i have almost not touched but 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.770
 it's not that it was not a problem at all 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.060
 next for the game bf 4 in 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.530
 itself there have been advances 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.750
 pretty impressive technological 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.060
 with base iii sentence the graphical engine 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.319
 and audio that frankly balances us with 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.720
 dream ie when you see 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.709
 the picture quality is frankly 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.810
 very very impressive 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.610
 then what else do you say 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.190
 I will be able to test the safe Commander mode 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.200
 when I was there but I could see 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.540
 differences from bf3 which 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.250
 was of course the evolution system 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.680
 which allows you to interact with almost 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.730
 all in the map knowing that the maps 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.550
 are really huge 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.560
 finally you can fart in fuel and 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.959
 basically you can also create 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.099
 shortcuts you can use can 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.269
 block vehicles with 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.610
 shareholders you can close the 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.130
 closed gates doors 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.810
 can you do something else 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.400
 you can fart the lights end and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.780
 you can also totally change a 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.040
 way you can fart windmills 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.430
 farting buildings everything will crumble 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.690
 it will totally change the map 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.730
 next for the xbox live 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.019
 I adhered to the power of the machine 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.780
 and graphic quality 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.450
 on the other hand ergonomics finally 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.830
 intel a console is pretty huge 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.230
 finally you will see it for yourself 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.610
 but think that it is the equivalent of 2 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.950
 ps3 slim one on the other 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.390
 it's a bass drum I call it 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.180
 a big cow but there you go 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.690
 then for nfs I 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.580
 much loved 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.930
 indeed I am since 8h speed 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.239
 underground on gamecube 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.390
 so I do not remember when that date 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.890
 Here and there a low frankly this 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.810
 emotion that the spelling that means that 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.820
 these questions otherwise I do not know 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.170
 it was on ps4 on pc that was turning 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.500
 but such as m ps4 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.519
 and there that the graphic slap was 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.560
 quite impressive that the 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.940
 car-bars breathes reality it's up to 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.420
 to say that as you will see there their 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.540
 picture 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.680
 it's you see cars it's 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.870
 like if you take a picture in a 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.579
 car in a showcase it was 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.829
 the same thing it's more real limit than 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.810
 the real what does it become enough 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.519
 awesome then group 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.630
 finally big difference compared to 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.220
 quite another force since there is no 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.549
 there is no more solo mode more mode 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.380
 online 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.170
 everything is grouped in one mode 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.389
 that's the new need for speed in 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.799
 done ie it's a little bit at the 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.750
 wag the dog it's a connected universe 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.180
 with all your friends you have power 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.530
 run short solo if you want but 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.180
 your friends can join you 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.459
 race to join you as long as 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.100
 cop or as much as people who want 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.940
 race and all that's going to be I 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.229
 think something pretty 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.910
 impressive that will give a duration 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.120
 10 extra to the game 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.530
 then I think that car level 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.870
 will be served I saw lamborghini 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.870
 adventador I saw ferrari I saw 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.420
 porsche gt3 rs deceased poet custom 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.280
 car to infinity the cop cars 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.170
 are also quite impressive you 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.610
 can see them 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.200
 so after what do you see 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.010
 others on this game not much I 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.290
 will have had time to ester 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.840
 a lot there I'm going to put you 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.090
 some videos also of the atmosphere in 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.260
 which nothing was the system so 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.540
 that these innovations was it was 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.290
 really nice 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.120
 the reception was great as I already 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.470
 said I saw a lot of youtube hours 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.760
 I had aspects in the men 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.600
 the v12 warteck and his team toulon was 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.850
 really nice 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.560
 frankly these deaths if it was to 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.690
 redo I offer it to the brothers and I 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.740
 thanks again a fault job on this 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.120
 if you have relative impressions 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.430
 in the game do not hesitate to put them in 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.110
