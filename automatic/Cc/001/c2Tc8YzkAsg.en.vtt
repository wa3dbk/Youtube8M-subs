00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
subscription to Nokia life tools a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
subscription to Nokia life tools a
product<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.140> originally<00:00:43.739> tested<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.370> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
product that was originally tested and I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.180 
product that was originally tested and I
think<00:00:44.879> even<00:00:45.090> designed<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.660> India<00:00:46.129> this<00:00:47.129> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
think even designed in India this is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.930 
think even designed in India this is
basically<00:00:47.789> meant<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.750> give<00:00:48.930> farmers<00:00:49.940> news

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
basically meant to give farmers news

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.470 
basically meant to give farmers news
about<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.020> crops<00:00:52.550> keep<00:00:53.550> people<00:00:53.879> educate<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
about the crops keep people educate and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.229 
about the crops keep people educate and
give<00:00:54.629> people<00:00:54.870> education<00:00:55.940> keep<00:00:56.940> people

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
give people education keep people

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.959 
give people education keep people
interested<00:00:57.480> entertainment<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.820> what

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
interested entertainment so this is what

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.959 
interested entertainment so this is what
Nokia<00:01:00.359> life<00:01:00.449> tools<00:01:00.510> essentially<00:01:01.320> does<00:01:01.969> we

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
Nokia life tools essentially does we

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.170 
Nokia life tools essentially does we

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
will get into that a little later and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.700 
will get into that a little later and
here's<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> device<00:01:07.170> itself

is not entirely a straight device at a
slightly<00:01:18.270> code<00:01:18.720> let's<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.340> let<00:01:20.490> me<00:01:20.520> see

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
slightly code let's can see let me see

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.940 
slightly code let's can see let me see
makes<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> easy<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.920> hold<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:24.650> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.799> easily

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
makes it easy to hold and you can easily

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.490 
makes it easy to hold and you can easily
see<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:28.140> QWERTY<00:01:28.500> keypad<00:01:29.869> looks<00:01:30.869> similar<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
see the QWERTY keypad looks similar to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.030

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the c3 that is there but we will see

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.060 
the c3 that is there but we will see
little<00:01:35.220> later<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> how<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.680> as<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.890> now

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
little later as to how it is as for now

looks<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.939> hallmark<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
looks that are a hallmark to the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
looks that are a hallmark to the
x-series<00:01:45.869> devices<00:01:48.530> it's<00:01:49.530> pretty<00:01:49.829> light

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
x-series devices it's pretty light

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.109 
x-series devices it's pretty light
without<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> battery

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119

without the battery
I<00:01:51.439> don't<00:01:52.439> assume<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> be<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.130> very<00:01:53.280> heavy

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
I don't assume it to be a very heavy

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.090 
I don't assume it to be a very heavy
