00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.189
 Adventskalender door and bake 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.929
 Today we have cookies and cocoa macaroons 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.059
 racists that's now on lyrics 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 I'm talking to the video right now 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.650
 on it and that is the first thing we do 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.070
 is four eggs to separate and broken 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.560
 We only give the protein all quantity information 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.029
 are again in the infobox and power 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.949
 the after that they are really delicious 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.300
 Even me as a person says that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.600
 not so much sweet is so much iron 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.020
 separated then we have to now first 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.590
 beat the egg white stiff 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.360
 the egg white stiff beat that makes you 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.390
 just by going in with the mixer 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.390
 and the whole brand steiff beats 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.699
 there you see that again that's it 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.809
 relatively steep next we need 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.729
 200 grams of sugar so in the actual 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.170
 reception 250 grams vanilla sugar but 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.210
 I thought that was a bit disgusting 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.250
 I have three vanilla sugar sachet 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.259
 we are somehow a 8 gram 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.320
 and have you there filled so 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.600
 200 grams of sugar and 24 grams 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.310
 vanilla sugar that will then be under rome 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.390
 you see this but I have in mine 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.170
 Kitchen worked and it has a lot 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.520
 very funny name really so now 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.890
 come 200 grams of coconut flakes to the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.580
 are also underlined beautifully 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.899
 mix the whole stuff 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.600
 Schwupps luxury and that's what you call it 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.729
 scraper in the kitchen rubber buffer without 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.200
 shit as then my chef cook that 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.679
 first time I told myself 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.140
 kaputtglacht so first clean up everything 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.630
 and then we need a baking tray where 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.640
 I first sniff my mother 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.489
 of which we have no vote baking paper 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.479
 but which is nice first 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.509
 spread 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.160
 snap I do not have to for the 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.479
 apologize qualities so far have the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.670
 picked up my laptop because I had 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.540
 no camera and now we take back 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.310
 opladen 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.650
 You can do that without me too 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.870
 think that is much tastier and also with 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.670
 easier to do daily 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.989
 this technique i make i come 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.470
 come closer later and show you 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.100
 the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.340
 and in front of me then there so small yes 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.390
 that should actually be so belle but 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.020
 I had to go again 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.930
 test 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.530
 that will look better later too 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.530
 beautiful 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.000
 did not have on my big belly 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.180
 that winter bacon I may my beer 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.180
 belly 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.870
 I have for the whole for the whole 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.890
 I think I have 30 pieces 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.850
 find out 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.170
 exactly 30 pieces which one is good for it 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.630
 if you do not use the spoon as well 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.340
 Of course, here's how it comes along 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.250
 you make ice balls or that one 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.750
 spraybag with spraybag year but 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.750
 I can handle the spoons best 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.010
 because you see again this technique the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.180
 I do that I always have it that way 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.650
 and let's make it out of such a small ball 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.810
 and, of course, that will not spill 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.960
 either forget the snails 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.410
 has done too little or you used 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.410
 that you again 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.670
 The recipe is really total in itself 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.550
 Quick you have seen her 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.130
 hardly any ingredients he needs 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.600
 you can not do that even if your focus is not so 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.350
 you can like for example too 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.760
 so there are grated hazel has 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.320
 My mother, my darling 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.480
 You could also do it very well 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.640
 only I had somehow not feel like 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.580
 Cocoa macaroons now often follow suit 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.510
 That's why she also made who you 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.510
 that can look so beautiful 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.860
 in between times again a bit 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.780
 stir 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.250
 because that mass of real paper looks like that 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.530
 in front of it some still with the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.240
 hands always a bit on that 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:29.470
 wash your fingers 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.470
 but I do not have to tell you that 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:42.310
 The whole let you then about 25 minutes 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.750
 bake to 150 degrees 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.910
 it always depends on if the 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.350
 macaroons bigger would never see that 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.940
 right at the last one is one 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.320
 i have become a total monster 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.950
 a few minutes longer in it 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.950
 calmly 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.020
 just until the top is nice and brown 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.410
 have become and already such a 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.410
 a little bit hard 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.980
 as I said, you can do it without it 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.970
 make waffles but I prefer doing that 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:18.370
 more because I also thought for others 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:21.199
 people because I'm not the personal one 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.600
 because we most already know it 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:26.180
 Do not like sweets or 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.090
 sweetie I bake that incredible 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.350
 like here you see again this 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.300
 technology euro 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.180
 you can do it in the end and 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.440
 you can just gloves or something 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.000
 make her like you I want to come because 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.000
 The best with the spoons 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.750
 I'll get that much 34 then 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.639
 minutes in the oven 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:06:00.190
 so that I insert the same immediately 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:02.770
 can and I really did that 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.889
 All day for a sheet metal to create 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.490
 their last one for so looks quite 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.490
 become bigger 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.870
 so and you can see that easily 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.130
 end result 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.139
 I will be glad if you can 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.940
 would imitate me and leave me 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.699
