00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
supplies of type you're starting to see

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.880 
supplies of type you're starting to see
riots<00:02:09.829> around<00:02:10.829> food<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.400> places<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:11.790> 80<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890

other poor countries around the world

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.080 
other poor countries around the world
and<00:02:15.510> what<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.440> also<00:02:16.650> true<00:02:16.829> is<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.670> as

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
and what is also true is is that as

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.390 
and what is also true is is that as
countries<00:02:18.569> like<00:02:18.720> China<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.200> India<00:02:19.400> become

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
countries like China and India become

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.539 
countries like China and India become
wealthier<00:02:21.170> then<00:02:22.170> they<00:02:22.650> trucks<00:02:23.010> start

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
wealthier then they trucks start

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.309 
wealthier then they trucks start
changing<00:02:23.910> their<00:02:24.060> food<00:02:24.329> habits<00:02:24.720> they<00:02:24.959> start

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
changing their food habits they start

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.849 
changing their food habits they start
eating<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.739> meat<00:02:25.799> or<00:02:26.700> animal<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:28.380> what

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
eating more meat or animal and what

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.490 
eating more meat or animal and what
happens<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.630> because<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.900> takes<00:02:31.109> more

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
happens then is because it takes more

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.509 
happens then is because it takes more
grain<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.250> produce<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.940> pound<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.780> beef<00:02:33.959> then<00:02:34.519> if

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
grain to produce a pound of beef then if

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.879 
grain to produce a pound of beef then if
they<00:02:35.730> were<00:02:35.819> just<00:02:35.970> eating<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.329> grain<00:02:36.889> what

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
they were just eating the grain what

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.620 
they were just eating the grain what
ends<00:02:38.069> up<00:02:38.160> happening<00:02:38.220> isn't<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.970> puts<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.389> huge

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
ends up happening isn't it puts a huge

that's something that we should

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.140 
that's something that we should
legislate<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.340> think<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:58.120> is

legislate but I think that it is
something<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.750> as<00:02:58.990> part<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.380> our<00:02:59.500> overall

something that as part of our overall
health<00:02:59.950> care<00:03:00.490> system<00:03:00.970> we<00:03:01.720> should<00:03:01.930> encourage

because<00:03:03.460> for<00:03:03.730> example<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:04.300> we<00:03:04.510> reduced

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
because for example if we reduced

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.480 
because for example if we reduced
obesity<00:03:05.590> down<00:03:05.800> to<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> rates<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.340> existed

in<00:03:06.940> 1980<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:08.290> would<00:03:08.500> save<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:08.920> Medicare

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
in 1980 we would save the Medicare

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.000 
in 1980 we would save the Medicare
system<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:10.030> trillion<00:03:10.810> dollars<00:03:10.860> we<00:03:11.860> would

reduce diabetes rates we would reduce

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.270 
reduce diabetes rates we would reduce
heart<00:03:14.620> disease<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.710> fact<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.070> we

that we're not doing more to make sure

those<00:03:48.850> things<00:03:49.150> don't<00:03:49.420> make<00:03:49.690> sense<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.260> I

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
those things don't make sense and I

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.310 
those things don't make sense and I
think<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.190> does<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.209> important<00:03:52.780> for<00:03:52.810> us<00:03:53.020> to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
think it does it is important for us to

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.610 
think it does it is important for us to
re-examine<00:03:54.070> our<00:03:54.640> overall<00:03:55.209> food<00:03:55.480> policy<00:03:56.080> so

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
re-examine our overall food policy so

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.130 
re-examine our overall food policy so
then<00:03:56.770> we're<00:03:56.950> encouraging<00:03:57.550> good<00:03:57.930> habits<00:03:58.930> and

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
then we're encouraging good habits and

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.380 
then we're encouraging good habits and
not<00:03:59.620> bad<00:03:59.830> habits<00:04:00.220> for<00:04:00.400> example<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.120> know<00:04:01.209> just

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
not bad habits for example you know just

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.850 
not bad habits for example you know just
making<00:04:01.660> sure<00:04:01.959> that<00:04:02.230> there<00:04:02.380> are<00:04:02.440> more<00:04:02.560> fruits

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
making sure that there are more fruits

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.510 
making sure that there are more fruits
and<00:04:02.980> vegetables<00:04:03.550> in<00:04:03.940> school<00:04:04.570> lunch<00:04:04.870> programs

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
and vegetables in school lunch programs

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.680 
and vegetables in school lunch programs
that<00:04:06.520> would<00:04:06.790> make<00:04:07.030> an<00:04:07.180> enormous<00:04:07.450> difference

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
that would make an enormous difference

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.130 
that would make an enormous difference
in<00:04:08.560> how<00:04:08.830> our<00:04:08.860> children's<00:04:09.640> diets<00:04:10.150> develop<00:04:10.720> that

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
in how our children's diets develop that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.810 
in how our children's diets develop that
would<00:04:11.350> make<00:04:11.530> us<00:04:11.709> healthier<00:04:12.190> over<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.640> long

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
would make us healthier over the long

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.300 
would make us healthier over the long
term<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.390> would<00:04:14.050> cut<00:04:14.260> our<00:04:14.380> health<00:04:14.620> care<00:04:14.860> costs

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
term it would cut our health care costs

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.449 
term it would cut our health care costs
and<00:04:15.550> maybe<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.419> would<00:04:16.570> help<00:04:16.830> people<00:04:17.830> elsewhere

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
and maybe it would help people elsewhere

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.340 
and maybe it would help people elsewhere
in<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.910> world<00:04:18.940> war<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.390> less<00:04:19.930> wealthy

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
in the world war and less wealthy

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.680 
in the world war and less wealthy
countries<00:04:20.799> feed<00:04:21.310> themselves<00:04:21.549> as<00:04:22.060> well<00:04:22.330> so

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
countries feed themselves as well so

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.420 
countries feed themselves as well so
it's<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:22.960> great<00:04:23.140> question<00:04:23.320> it's<00:04:23.680> important<00:04:24.130> all

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
it's a great question it's important all

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.520 
it's a great question it's important all
right<00:04:24.690> I've<00:04:25.690> got<00:04:25.900> time<00:04:26.140> for<00:04:26.380> one<00:04:26.410> more

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
right I've got time for one more

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.550 
right I've got time for one more
question<00:04:27.060> I've<00:04:28.060> only<00:04:28.540> got<00:04:28.840> several<00:04:29.200> it's<00:04:29.380> got

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
question I've only got several it's got

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.190 
question I've only got several it's got
to<00:04:29.680> be<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.800> guy<00:04:30.210> she<00:04:31.210> got<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.450> be<00:04:31.570> guy<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:31.780> had<00:04:32.110> to
