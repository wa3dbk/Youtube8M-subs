viewer<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:03.689> question<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.620> not<00:00:05.009> advised

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.340 

hi<00:00:08.650> guys<00:00:08.889> talking<00:00:09.460> more<00:00:09.610> here<00:00:09.940> and<00:00:10.210> today<00:00:10.750> I'm

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.350 
hi guys talking more here and today I'm

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.619 
hi guys talking more here and today I'm
going<00:00:11.410> to<00:00:11.740> show<00:00:11.920> you<00:00:11.980> how<00:00:12.129> to<00:00:12.629> prioritize

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
going to show you how to prioritize

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.269 
going to show you how to prioritize
trains<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.910> first<00:00:16.240> let's<00:00:16.660> build<00:00:17.230> a<00:00:17.590> few

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
trains so first let's build a few

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:25.200 
trains so first let's build a few
stations<00:00:18.820> here<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.820> theater<00:00:23.939> amusement<00:00:24.939> park

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
stations here the theater amusement park

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:34.319 
stations here the theater amusement park
and<00:00:26.250> say<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.309> airport<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:34.000> let's<00:00:34.180> talk<00:00:34.270> about

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
and say the airport so let's talk about

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.940 
and say the airport so let's talk about
prioritizing<00:00:35.140> creams<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:38.260> you<00:00:38.350> prioritize

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
prioritizing creams when you prioritize

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.189 
prioritizing creams when you prioritize
your<00:00:38.980> trains<00:00:39.969> it's<00:00:40.359> not<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:40.870> know<00:00:40.929> like<00:00:41.170> a

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
your trains it's not you know like a

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.529 
your trains it's not you know like a
number<00:00:41.620> thing<00:00:41.859> where<00:00:42.250> you<00:00:42.429> your<00:00:42.640> number<00:00:43.359> your

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
number thing where you your number your

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.180 
number thing where you your number your
trains<00:00:43.870> but<00:00:44.710> rather<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.820> way<00:00:45.999> you<00:00:46.059> build<00:00:46.510> your

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
trains but rather the way you build your

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.040 
trains but rather the way you build your
train<00:00:48.190> tracks<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.820> build<00:00:52.149> them<00:00:52.390> in<00:00:52.749> a<00:00:52.929> special

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
train tracks you build them in a special

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.270 
train tracks you build them in a special
way<00:00:53.530> then<00:00:54.149> trains<00:00:55.149> will<00:00:55.300> enter<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.719> station

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
way then trains will enter the station

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
way then trains will enter the station
orderly<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:59.289> let's<00:00:59.499> connect<00:00:59.949> these<00:01:00.190> trains

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.500 

alrighty<00:01:14.740> now<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.070> chain<00:01:15.430> sir<00:01:15.580> can<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:16.240> train

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
alrighty now the chain sir can the train

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.620 
alrighty now the chain sir can the train
stations<00:01:16.900> are<00:01:17.020> connected<00:01:18.090> let's<00:01:19.090> make<00:01:19.390> some

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
stations are connected let's make some

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.430 
stations are connected let's make some
routes<00:01:19.870> I<00:01:23.940> like<00:01:24.940> to<00:01:25.120> have<00:01:25.270> my<00:01:25.420> trains<00:01:25.780> go

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
routes I like to have my trains go

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.430 
routes I like to have my trains go
behind<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.160> station<00:01:27.400> in<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.790> loop<00:01:28.030> because<00:01:28.440> it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
behind the station in a loop because it

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.610 
behind the station in a loop because it
will<00:01:30.960> prevent<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.640> amount<00:01:34.510> of<00:01:34.690> traffic<00:01:35.110> flow

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
will prevent the amount of traffic flow

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.770 
will prevent the amount of traffic flow
you<00:01:35.950> don't<00:01:36.160> know<00:01:36.280> I'm<00:01:36.430> talking<00:01:36.790> about<00:01:36.850> please

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
you don't know I'm talking about please

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.250 
you don't know I'm talking about please
check<00:01:37.960> out<00:01:38.170> my<00:01:38.200> other<00:01:38.530> videos<00:01:39.960> let's<00:01:40.960> have<00:01:41.230> a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
check out my other videos let's have a

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.140 
check out my other videos let's have a
few<00:01:41.620> trains<00:01:41.980> running<00:01:42.900> so<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.920> can<00:01:45.160> mess<00:01:45.910> with

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
few trains running so we can mess with

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:58.630 
few trains running so we can mess with
the<00:01:46.360> priorities

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:07.690 

alright<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.940> now<00:02:00.330> we<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.770> train<00:02:02.400> routes

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.100 

like<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:13.160> prioritize<00:02:14.160> your

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
like this and so to prioritize your

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.860 
like this and so to prioritize your
trains<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:17.040> which<00:02:17.430> stations<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.209> go<00:02:18.660> into

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
trains to which stations to go into

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.870 
trains to which stations to go into
you're<00:02:19.650> going<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.070> build<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.580> train

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
you're going to have to build your train

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.330 
you're going to have to build your train
tracks<00:02:22.220> intelligently<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:25.440> here<00:02:25.980> as<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.310> can

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
tracks intelligently so here as you can

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.590 
tracks intelligently so here as you can
see<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.880> loop<00:02:27.120> here

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
see we have a loop here

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.240 
see we have a loop here
and<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:30.870> don't<00:02:31.870> know<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.170> notice<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:32.890> but

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and I don't know if you notice this but

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.890 
and I don't know if you notice this but
the<00:02:33.640> trains<00:02:34.060> would<00:02:34.600> not<00:02:34.900> stop<00:02:35.410> at<00:02:36.040> any

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
the trains would not stop at any

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.660 
the trains would not stop at any
entrance<00:02:37.900> or<00:02:38.610> exit<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.690> train<00:02:41.200> tracks<00:02:41.670> so

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
entrance or exit of the train tracks so

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.520 
entrance or exit of the train tracks so
if<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.360> want<00:02:43.630> your<00:02:43.780> trains<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.530> wait<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:47.380> know

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
if you want your trains to wait you know

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.070 
if you want your trains to wait you know
so<00:02:47.800> let's<00:02:48.280> say<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.430> have<00:02:48.670> another<00:02:48.880> train<00:02:49.300> that

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
so let's say you have another train that

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.180 
so let's say you have another train that
enters<00:02:50.830> this<00:02:51.370> loop<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.420> comes<00:02:52.660> out<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.980> they

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
enters this loop and comes out that they

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.350 
enters this loop and comes out that they
will<00:02:54.370> trains<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.420> go<00:02:55.480> into<00:02:55.810> do

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
will trains that go into do

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.180 
will trains that go into do
already<00:02:58.020> because<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.620> trees<00:02:58.830> would<00:02:59.070> be

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
already because the trees would be

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.760 
already because the trees would be
waiting<00:02:59.550> right<00:02:59.580> here<00:03:00.740> at<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:02.340> intersection

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
waiting right here at this intersection

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:11.060 
waiting right here at this intersection
all<00:03:04.770> right<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.900> let's<00:03:07.170> say<00:03:08.060> right<00:03:09.060> now<00:03:09.300> as<00:03:10.200> you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
all right so let's say right now as you

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.120 
all right so let's say right now as you
can<00:03:11.190> see<00:03:11.570> Shane<00:03:12.570> number<00:03:12.900> two<00:03:13.110> has<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.590> power<00:03:13.800> t

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
can see Shane number two has the power t

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.490 
can see Shane number two has the power t
back<00:03:14.370> there

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
back there

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.980 
back there
so

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:26.240 
so
if<00:03:19.320> we<00:03:19.530> fast-forward<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:24.080> trains<00:03:25.080> train<00:03:25.890> to

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
if we fast-forward it trains train to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.030 
if we fast-forward it trains train to
would<00:03:26.550> keep<00:03:26.850> going<00:03:27.240> in<00:03:27.390> there<00:03:27.740> so<00:03:28.740> let's<00:03:28.950> say

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
would keep going in there so let's say

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.190 
would keep going in there so let's say
you<00:03:29.100> want<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.280> fix<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:30.060> want<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.480> have

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
you want to fix this you want to have

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.780 
you want to fix this you want to have
you<00:03:32.160> know<00:03:32.190> train<00:03:32.640> one<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.420> go<00:03:33.570> first<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.860> it's<00:03:35.190> a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
you know train one to go first so it's a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.390 
you know train one to go first so it's a
way<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:35.970> can<00:03:36.270> do<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.990> to<00:03:39.380> have<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.890> train

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
way you can do this is to have the train

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.010 
way you can do this is to have the train
goes<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.240> way<00:03:42.540> instead<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:45.600> original

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
goes this way instead of the original

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.020 
goes this way instead of the original
way<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.240> train<00:03:48.450> has<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.660> go<00:03:49.050> behind<00:03:50.030> train

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
way so the train has to go behind train

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.780 
way so the train has to go behind train
number<00:03:51.330> one<00:03:51.920> if<00:03:52.920> there<00:03:53.340> was<00:03:53.520> one<00:03:53.700> waiting

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
number one if there was one waiting

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.110 
number one if there was one waiting
like<00:03:56.390> this<00:03:56.599> now<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.290> number<00:03:57.590> two<00:03:57.769> train<00:03:58.120> is

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
like this now the number two train is

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.020 
like this now the number two train is
going<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.780> have<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.260> go<00:04:00.530> behind<00:04:01.219> train<00:04:01.760> number

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
going to have to go behind train number

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:09.339 
going to have to go behind train number
one<00:04:02.209> so<00:04:03.049> giving<00:04:03.500> number<00:04:03.890> one<00:04:04.069> is<00:04:04.310> priority<00:04:08.349> so

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
one so giving number one is priority so

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.559 
one so giving number one is priority so
as<00:04:09.560> you<00:04:09.590> can<00:04:09.890> see<00:04:11.769> number<00:04:12.769> one<00:04:13.269> now<00:04:14.269> has

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
as you can see number one now has

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:21.759 
as you can see number one now has
priority<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:16.190> enter<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.759> station<00:04:20.560> get<00:04:21.560> rid<00:04:21.709> of

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
priority to enter the station get rid of

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.210 
priority to enter the station get rid of
some<00:04:21.829> trains<00:04:23.139> because<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:24.380> keeps<00:04:24.620> getting

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
some trains because it keeps getting

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.370 
some trains because it keeps getting
stuck

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.050 

you

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.220 

you

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.680 

so<00:04:35.860> in<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.130> beginning<00:04:36.250> training<00:04:37.180> module<00:04:37.300> has

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
so in the beginning training module has

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.410 
so in the beginning training module has
a<00:04:37.720> priority<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:38.470> enter<00:04:38.920> this<00:04:39.040> station<00:04:39.550> now

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
a priority to enter this station now

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.570 
a priority to enter this station now
train<00:04:40.720> number<00:04:40.900> one<00:04:41.080> has<00:04:41.290> top<00:04:41.470> priority

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
train number one has top priority

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.830 
train number one has top priority
because<00:04:42.580> we<00:04:43.000> have<00:04:43.120> now<00:04:43.650> put<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:46.270> number<00:04:46.630> to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
because we have now put the number to

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.170 
because we have now put the number to
rout<00:04:47.610> behind<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.760> number<00:04:49.030> one<00:04:49.240> trains<00:04:49.780> rels

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
rout behind the number one trains rels

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.360 
rout behind the number one trains rels
keep<00:04:52.180> in<00:04:52.360> mind<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.470> trains<00:04:53.800> would<00:04:54.100> not

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
keep in mind that the trains would not

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.829 
keep in mind that the trains would not
stop

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:56.839 
stop

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.059 
stop
behind<00:04:57.839> another<00:04:58.050> train<00:04:58.409> if<00:04:58.650> there's<00:04:58.889> not

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
behind another train if there's not

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:05.110 
behind another train if there's not
enough<00:04:59.460> space<00:04:59.669> so<00:05:02.990> let's<00:05:03.990> say<00:05:04.139> you<00:05:04.199> want<00:05:04.650> to

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
enough space so let's say you want to

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.760 
enough space so let's say you want to
give

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
give

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.860 
give
number<00:05:08.770> one<00:05:09.810> more<00:05:10.830> parties<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.970> can<00:05:13.120> fill

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
number one more parties you can fill

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.879 
number one more parties you can fill
extra<00:05:14.650> tracks<00:05:15.040> like<00:05:15.460> this

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.260 

then<00:05:20.780> train<00:05:21.780> number<00:05:21.900> two<00:05:22.349> is<00:05:23.310> not<00:05:23.699> going<00:05:24.150> to

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
then train number two is not going to

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.059 
then train number two is not going to
stop<00:05:24.719> here<00:05:25.550> but<00:05:26.550> rather<00:05:26.759> it<00:05:27.389> will<00:05:27.509> stop<00:05:28.069> here

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
stop here but rather it will stop here

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.950 
stop here but rather it will stop here
so<00:05:29.759> that<00:05:29.909> would<00:05:30.060> give<00:05:30.090> train<00:05:30.810> number<00:05:31.169> one<00:05:31.669> a

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
so that would give train number one a

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.939 
so that would give train number one a
higher<00:05:33.960> priority<00:05:34.259> to<00:05:34.830> enter<00:05:35.099> the<00:05:35.219> station<00:05:35.490> oh

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
higher priority to enter the station oh

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.409 
higher priority to enter the station oh
I<00:05:37.949> hope<00:05:38.189> you<00:05:38.310> guys<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.669> little<00:05:38.849> bit<00:05:38.999> with<00:05:39.240> the
