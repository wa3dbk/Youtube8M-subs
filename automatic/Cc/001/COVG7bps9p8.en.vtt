and<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.859> see<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> lot<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.250> people<00:00:23.340> bicycling<00:00:23.910> on

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and I see a lot of people bicycling on

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.509 
and I see a lot of people bicycling on
the<00:00:24.060> sidewalks<00:00:24.570> because<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.470> Gary<00:00:25.830> population

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
the sidewalks because is Gary population

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.880 
the sidewalks because is Gary population
growth<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.060> expected<00:00:27.330> increase<00:00:27.810> along<00:00:28.470> an<00:00:28.769> El

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
growth is expected increase along an El

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.950 
growth is expected increase along an El
Camino<00:00:28.920> rial<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.300> need<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.510> plan<00:00:30.720> for

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
Camino rial and so we need to plan for

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.410 
Camino rial and so we need to plan for
that<00:00:31.019> growth<00:00:31.349> traffic<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> El<00:00:32.640> Camino<00:00:32.759> can

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
that growth traffic on the El Camino can

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.150 
that growth traffic on the El Camino can
be<00:00:33.600> pretty<00:00:34.050> difficult<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.770> trying<00:00:34.950> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
be pretty difficult in trying to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.950 
be pretty difficult in trying to
maneuver<00:00:35.489> through<00:00:35.700> people<00:00:36.390> were<00:00:36.510> honking<00:00:36.719> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
maneuver through people were honking I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.450 
maneuver through people were honking I
mean<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.469> off<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> streets<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
mean like get off the streets the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
mean like get off the streets the
ridership<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.149> our<00:00:39.329> buses<00:00:39.540> are<00:00:39.960> very<00:00:40.350> high<00:00:40.590> we

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
ridership on our buses are very high we

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.040 
ridership on our buses are very high we
have<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.280> 20,000<00:00:42.000> people<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.239> day<00:00:42.450> who<00:00:42.480> ride

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
have about 20,000 people a day who ride

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.529 
have about 20,000 people a day who ride
on<00:00:43.410> El<00:00:43.649> Camino<00:00:43.829> even<00:00:44.670> though<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.149> buses<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
on El Camino even though the buses that

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.750 
on El Camino even though the buses that
we<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.500> El<00:00:46.620> Camino<00:00:46.770> rial<00:00:47.190> are<00:00:47.489> very

we have on the El Camino rial are very

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.850 
we have on the El Camino rial are very
good<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.329> could<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> lot<00:00:48.840> faster<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
good they could be a lot faster I see a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
good they could be a lot faster I see a
need<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.160> better<00:00:50.579> bus<00:00:51.000> service<00:00:51.420> faster<00:00:51.930> more

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
need for better bus service faster more

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:09.410 
need for better bus service faster more
frequent<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.100> El<00:00:53.250> Camino

bus rapid transit is a concept that
started<00:01:12.870> in<00:01:13.050> South<00:01:13.380> America<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.250> advantage

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
started in South America the advantage

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.190 
started in South America the advantage
of<00:01:14.790> having<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.300> they<00:01:15.330> called<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.750> surface

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
of having what they called a surface

this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.510> a<00:01:21.540> fast<00:01:21.990> service<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.130> something

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
this is a fast service this is something

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460 
this is a fast service this is something
that<00:01:23.490> will<00:01:23.790> compete<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.600> car<00:01:24.870> that<00:01:25.290> can

that will compete with the car that can

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.500 
that will compete with the car that can
actually<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.980> better<00:01:26.220> service<00:01:26.760> we're<00:01:27.210> in

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
actually be a better service we're in

the El Camino project that we want to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.600 
the El Camino project that we want to
implement<00:01:45.660> is<00:01:46.050> dedicated<00:01:46.740> bus<00:01:46.950> lanes<00:01:46.980> that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
implement is dedicated bus lanes that

implement is dedicated bus lanes that
would<00:01:47.760> be<00:01:47.910> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.150> median<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.840> El<00:01:49.020> Camino<00:01:49.500> with

would be in the median of El Camino with

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.410 
would be in the median of El Camino with
dedicated<00:01:50.460> lanes<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:50.910> could<00:01:51.060> afford<00:01:51.300> to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
dedicated lanes we could afford to

dedicated lanes we could afford to
operate<00:01:51.510> more<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> subway<00:01:52.650> we<00:01:53.430> could

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
operate more like a subway we could

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.820 
operate more like a subway we could
afford<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.150> do<00:01:54.330> five<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.750> even<00:01:55.170> 2-minute

afford to do five and even 2-minute
frequency<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.970> have<00:01:57.090> single<00:01:57.360> priority<00:01:58.050> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
frequency we have single priority that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.400 
frequency we have single priority that
enables<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:58.950> bus<00:01:59.160> to<00:01:59.430> move<00:01:59.610> through<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
signalized intersections it gets

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.310 
signalized intersections it gets
priority<00:02:02.910> through<00:02:03.300> those<00:02:03.510> intersections<00:02:04.140> and

look<00:03:45.690> like<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:47.030> different<00:03:48.030> Street<00:03:48.300> more

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
look like a different Street more
