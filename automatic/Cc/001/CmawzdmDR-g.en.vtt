beautiful gorgeous blooms that smell so

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.150 
beautiful gorgeous blooms that smell so
good<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.389> then<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> fall<00:00:13.590> they<00:00:13.860> start

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
good and then in the fall they start

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160 
good and then in the fall they start
turning<00:00:14.370> brown<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.849> dying<00:00:15.599> back<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> little

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
turning brown and dying back a little

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.920 
turning brown and dying back a little
bit<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.310> there's<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> few<00:00:17.850> pointers<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.840> you

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
bit so there's a few pointers that you

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.980 
bit so there's a few pointers that you
should<00:00:19.109> follow<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.770> helping<00:00:20.730> them<00:00:20.939> make<00:00:21.840> it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
should follow and helping them make it

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.480 
should follow and helping them make it
for<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> winter<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.710> how<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> prepare<00:00:23.340> them

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
for the winter and how to prepare them

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.310 
for the winter and how to prepare them
for<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.760> winter<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> most<00:00:24.869> important

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
for the winter so the most important

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.900 
for the winter so the most important
thing<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.189> your<00:00:26.310> roses<00:00:26.730> I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
thing that you can do for your roses I

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 
thing that you can do for your roses I
found<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.480> stop<00:00:27.840> fertilizing<00:00:28.680> them

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
found is to stop fertilizing them

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.769 
found is to stop fertilizing them
by<00:00:29.460> mid-summer<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.359> if<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.599> keep

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
by mid-summer because if you keep

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.359 
by mid-summer because if you keep
pumping<00:00:31.019> them<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.439> fertilizers<00:00:32.099> especially

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
pumping them with fertilizers especially

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.139 
pumping them with fertilizers especially
nitrogen<00:00:33.300> based<00:00:33.570> fertilizers<00:00:34.520> then<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.969> get

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
nitrogen based fertilizers then they get

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.970 
nitrogen based fertilizers then they get
all<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.510> new<00:00:36.750> growth<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.410> they<00:00:37.530> don't<00:00:37.710> bloom

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
all this new growth and they don't bloom

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
all this new growth and they don't bloom
very<00:00:38.280> well<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.180> by<00:00:39.329> giving<00:00:39.600> them<00:00:39.750> lots<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
very well so by giving them lots of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.600 
very well so by giving them lots of
nitrogen<00:00:40.290> they're<00:00:40.920> getting<00:00:41.129> lots<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> new

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
nitrogen they're getting lots of new

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.490 
nitrogen they're getting lots of new
growth<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.420> when<00:00:42.600> winter<00:00:42.899> hits<00:00:43.170> they're

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
growth and so when winter hits they're

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.010 
growth and so when winter hits they're
very<00:00:43.770> tender<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.059> lose<00:00:45.270> them<00:00:45.450> so

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
very tender and you can lose them so

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.350 
very tender and you can lose them so
never<00:00:46.440> fertilize<00:00:47.100> your<00:00:47.340> roses<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:48.000> high

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
never fertilize your roses with high

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.229 
never fertilize your roses with high
nitrogen<00:00:48.809> based<00:00:49.230> fertilizers<00:00:49.520> at<00:00:50.520> all<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.149> you

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
nitrogen based fertilizers at all if you

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.100 
nitrogen based fertilizers at all if you
have<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.420> choice

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
have a choice

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.350 
have a choice
past<00:00:52.559> midsummer<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.940> still<00:00:54.210> feel

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
past midsummer and if you still feel

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
past midsummer and if you still feel
that<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> fertilize<00:00:55.170> always<00:00:55.770> use<00:00:55.980> -

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
that you have to fertilize always use -

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.900 
that you have to fertilize always use -
Sates

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
Sates

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.729 
Sates
because<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> phosphates<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.410> prepare

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
because it's the phosphates that prepare

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.920 
because it's the phosphates that prepare
them<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:58.949> winter<00:00:59.340> not<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> not<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.149> nitrogen

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
them for winter not the not the nitrogen

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.049 
them for winter not the not the nitrogen
and<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> lot<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> phosphates<00:01:02.820> in

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and if they have a lot of phosphates in

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.789 
and if they have a lot of phosphates in
them<00:01:03.270> when<00:01:03.480> winter<00:01:03.899> hits<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.619> will

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
them when winter hits then they will

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.370 
them when winter hits then they will
survive<00:01:05.100> much<00:01:05.369> better<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.510> easy<00:01:06.780> trick<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
survive much better so easy trick that I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.230 
survive much better so easy trick that I
found<00:01:07.650> too<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.189> make<00:01:08.400> sure<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.760> trim<00:01:09.060> it

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
found too is make sure and just trim it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
found too is make sure and just trim it
back<00:01:09.290> one-third<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> try<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> trim<00:01:11.520> back<00:01:11.549> my

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
back one-third so I try to trim back my

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480 
back one-third so I try to trim back my
roses<00:01:12.330> any<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> linky<00:01:13.260> starts<00:01:13.650> about<00:01:13.920> 1/3

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
roses any of the linky starts about 1/3

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.210 
roses any of the linky starts about 1/3
so<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.659> cut<00:01:15.990> back<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.500> 1/3<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
so that it's cut back about 1/3 to the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.780 
so that it's cut back about 1/3 to the
size<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> started<00:01:20.549> in

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
size that it was and when you started in

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.870 
size that it was and when you started in
that<00:01:21.450> way<00:01:21.689> next<00:01:22.080> year<00:01:22.259> it'll<00:01:23.130> fill<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.549> really

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that way next year it'll fill in really

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.810 
that way next year it'll fill in really
well<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.390> make<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.720> nice<00:01:25.110> ball<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.250> roses<00:01:26.670> in

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
well and make a nice ball this roses in

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.450 
well and make a nice ball this roses in
a<00:01:26.909> pot<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.930> it'll<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.950> well<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
a pot so it'll do really well over the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.160 
a pot so it'll do really well over the
winter<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:29.850> roses<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> northwest

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
winter because roses in the northwest

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350 
winter because roses in the northwest
can<00:01:31.380> handle<00:01:31.650> cold<00:01:31.829> temperatures<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.240> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
can handle cold temperatures but just to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.670 
can handle cold temperatures but just to
be<00:01:33.479> safe<00:01:33.509> I'm<00:01:33.960> gonna<00:01:34.110> throw<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.470> near<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
be safe I'm gonna throw it near the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.670 
be safe I'm gonna throw it near the
eaves<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.369> over<00:01:36.060> under<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> tree<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> bit<00:01:37.380> because

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
eaves or over under a tree a bit because

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.830 
eaves or over under a tree a bit because
I<00:01:37.950> found<00:01:38.159> any<00:01:38.520> plant<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.119> pot<00:01:39.150> that's<00:01:39.570> better

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
I found any plant in a pot that's better

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.090 
I found any plant in a pot that's better
when<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.439> bit<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> dry<00:01:40.979> side

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
when it's a little bit on the dry side

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.520 
when it's a little bit on the dry side
in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> winter<00:01:41.790> whereas<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> ground<00:01:43.110> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
in the winter whereas in the ground I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.130 
in the winter whereas in the ground I
never<00:01:44.070> lose<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:44.490> roses<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> other<00:01:45.750> trick

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
never lose my roses and the other trick

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.410 
never lose my roses and the other trick
is<00:01:46.380> make<00:01:46.619> sure<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.850> leaves<00:01:48.090> up

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
is make sure and take all the leaves up

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.670 
is make sure and take all the leaves up
when<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.720> lose<00:01:48.899> their<00:01:49.110> leaves<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.500> don't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
when they lose their leaves and don't

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.289 
when they lose their leaves and don't
leave<00:01:49.829> them<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> ground<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:51.149> they'll

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
leave them on the ground because they'll

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.389 
leave them on the ground because they'll
get<00:01:51.420> less<00:01:51.689> black<00:01:51.990> spots<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.740> less<00:01:52.890> mildew<00:01:53.369> on

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
get less black spots and less mildew on

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
get less black spots and less mildew on
the<00:01:53.909> roses<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> keep<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.960> dry<00:01:55.170> underneath

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the roses if you keep it dry underneath

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.410 
the roses if you keep it dry underneath
but<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.310> some<00:01:56.490> mulch<00:01:56.729> or<00:01:56.969> bark<00:01:57.180> dust

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
but in some mulch or bark dust

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.209 
but in some mulch or bark dust
underneath<00:01:58.110> them<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.500> fall<00:01:58.680> helps<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.070> lot

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
underneath them and the fall helps a lot

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.160 
underneath them and the fall helps a lot
too<00:01:59.520> because<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.880> gives<00:02:00.060> them<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.420> lots<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
too because it gives them a lots of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.369 
too because it gives them a lots of
nutrition<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.890> next<00:02:02.100> year
