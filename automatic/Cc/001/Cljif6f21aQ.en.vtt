but<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.280> think<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:50.789> cool<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.960> called

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
but I think it's really cool it's called

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.060 
but I think it's really cool it's called
I<00:00:55.460> would<00:00:56.460> realize<00:00:56.910> there<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.949> think<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
I would realize there it is I think it's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.569 
I would realize there it is I think it's
the<00:00:59.129> bus<00:00:59.579> theme<00:01:00.199> it's<00:01:01.199> very<00:01:01.410> small<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.370> just

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the bus theme it's very small so just

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.240 
the bus theme it's very small so just
let<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> download<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:05.960> now<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.470> time<00:01:08.130> to

theme<00:02:20.489> actually<00:02:21.489> looks<00:02:21.670> much<00:02:21.910> better<00:02:22.319> with

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
theme actually looks much better with

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.030 
theme actually looks much better with
only<00:02:25.500> three<00:02:26.500> rows<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.840> if<00:02:29.319> you<00:02:29.470> if<00:02:29.799> you<00:02:29.950> have

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
only three rows so if you if you have

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.770 
only three rows so if you if you have
only<00:02:30.430> three<00:02:30.850> rows<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.239> steam<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.569> going<00:02:31.720> to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
only three rows the steam is going to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.729 
only three rows the steam is going to
look<00:02:31.870> ten<00:02:32.080> times<00:02:32.110> better<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.549> like<00:02:34.470> get<00:02:35.470> rid<00:02:35.709> of

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
look ten times better so like get rid of

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.800 
look ten times better so like get rid of
the<00:02:36.040> bottom<00:02:36.400> row<00:02:36.549> I'm<00:02:36.819> not<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.540> cusp

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
the bottom row I'm not the cusp

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.180 
the bottom row I'm not the cusp
customize<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:38.620> much<00:02:38.769> more<00:02:38.950> complicated

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
customize it's much more complicated

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.610 
customize it's much more complicated
it's<00:02:40.000> way<00:02:40.330> easier<00:02:40.630> just<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.870> drag<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.290> make

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
it's way easier just to drag it make

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.890 
it's way easier just to drag it make
another<00:02:41.860> page<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:43.739> here<00:02:44.739> we<00:02:44.860> go<00:02:45.750> slide<00:02:46.750> it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
another page and here we go slide it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.089 
another page and here we go slide it
over<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:49.239> advantage<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.900> having

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.530
