00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.520
 in this new video this is mine 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.590
 channel today we are new to you 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.070
 review an unboxing man more than that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.219
 we are always another cooler master 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.800
 hardware suffering as you read from 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.379
 title and today I will come to propose a 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.850
 gaming mouse obviously because it is always 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.860
 of the sim storm which is the division 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.050
 Those master's gaming is a 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.449
 gaming mat because of course 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.129
 a very very important thing that 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.190
 still he had never shown 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:54.200
 let's start from the mat here it is this 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.560
 is the speed rx m very very very nice 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.690
 we will see it at the end of the video with even a 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.149
 small text in which I show how 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.670
 the mouse slips you can say that I have 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.670
 tried both hell for a long time 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.530
 time that the mat in hell gives me 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.240
 it looked really very good and for 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.170
 try it the best they protect mine 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.659
 old mat so as to see how I do it 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.340
 here was how it seemed to me instead 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.569
 the rug to pay for having tried it with 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.619
 the mouse I use regularly so as to 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:30.469
 have a more precise opinion 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.779
 this is precisely the mouse the hell the 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:35.179
 Hell mystery very very beautiful to 

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:38.270
 box and very cool and we have a 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:41.659
 maximum of 4000 dpi which can be 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.779
 changed there are the skillful switch profiles 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.789
 and there is the rate to do this there is some 

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:48.829
 all there were functions for 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.029
 rapid fire ca n't remember if there is really the 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.729
 key 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:54.760
 no it seems to me no ah yes maybe you can 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.620
 anyway 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.350
 yes it seems to me that there was a small key 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.330
 it would come however it is something that I do not 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.390
 very own use law therefore not 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.760
 I can say precisely to a memory 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.369
 internal is 128 kilobytes to be able 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.530
 save all files the profiles more than 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.540
 other than we are going to put 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.560
 inside the mouse file 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.050
 these can be used 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.120
 quietly on all PCs to which 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.370
 we're going to connect this to the unboxing 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.160
 strange thing is that it surprised me too 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.790
 enough and that there was a cd inside 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.770
 with mouse software that is one thing 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.240
 that we don't find in anyone else 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.610
 produced by the master cooler has at least 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.420
 of those I had the pleasure of 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.420
 use 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.870
 practically I can tell you that it is a lot 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.620
 very very very comfortable you see there is 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.480
 this smooth part of the mouse that is 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.070
 very beautiful very much like saying 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.870
 pleasant to the touch here is very pleasant 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.590
 very ergonomic to the touch 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 the only thing maybe with the part 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.380
 so shiny I mean to get a little dirty 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.360
 more precisely with fingerprints 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.260
 if anything it will be but not really clean 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.510
 clean so if anything for that I will 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.270
 I could say that number one of the little ones 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.640
 aesthetic defects this part ii e 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.760
 shiny that is very beautiful to look at but a 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.590
 a little less practical is very convenient 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.680
 software I won't show you why it is 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.910
 very much like that of 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.980
 of the two advance so if you want 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.200
 go and see it go on the review 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.180
 or made in the sentinel advance 2 that 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.790
 always find in the playlist in which 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.870
 find this review of the year 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.180
 my channel 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.210
 here's a very good thing about the mouse 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.980
 hell is that at this wheel a lot 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.340
 very large that unlike that 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.960
 of the dl hears in the question which one if 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.180
 instead this is very small 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.870
 very large second much more comfortable 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.970
 myself 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.760
 here is what the sentinel sees from comparison 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.810
 it is slightly longer though narrower 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.820
 and to this in this part on the left 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.450
 soul in which to lean comfortably 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.160
 the thumb that hell doesn't have though 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.570
 I can tell you that it is very convenient here 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.300
 another small flaw in strength 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.030
 of the grip are the keys to the left 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.220
 after a while you'll see are very 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.560
 very sensitive and pro for them 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.810
 sensitivity but if you are not careful 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.510
 when you go to press you could create 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.240
 of the casini as you see from the rates 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.130
 superior as for the like for the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.840
 sentinel and the various can be developed 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.260
 profiles that are up to 5 if me 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.620
 mistake 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.750
 so however they are not few and 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.630
 and very very beautiful it only lights up of 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.150
 red if I'm not mistaken it soul of red and ea 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.500
 this very big wheel that I owe you 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.290
 say I fell in love 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.639
 especially of the wheel is perhaps 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.380
 the only flaw I found on the 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.460
 sentinel that I find very much indeed 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.660
 comfortable while on hell in fact 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.270
 obviously it is a mouse of a band 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.490
 slightly lower, however, to this 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.260
 ie low head wheel bought at 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.669
 single word on wheels and then the lights 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.500
 in front I am much more powerful than 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.139
 apulia of the sentiment then an inch 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.580
 up to the light very powerful lights 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.039
 from our mouse 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.740
 this is the mat that when I have it 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.419
 taken now you will go to see type 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.669
 Ultra Dual not made I'll let 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.729
 see also very well in the video 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.830
 now move the view so successful 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.949
 here to see the loge are storm is 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.430
 very very sober all black with this 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:30.990
 sam storm logo white and gray and now 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.460
 let us make a comparison with that of 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.330
 diablo iii that I had from ast 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.669
 serial 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.970
 here's this obviously under that 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.160
 of the master look like more double 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.099
 compared to that of the same ires that 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.040
 I assure you or a while but it has always been 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:50.100
 so thin so it is not 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.340
 certainly because of the wear that 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.410
 which is the result here which has arrived 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.260
 now i'm very happy i'm trying it 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.120
 tried so much with mine 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.560
 sentinella de vence two cats are 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.780
 very well found 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.670
 now I'll show you now I'll move 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.920
 even the shot changes everything 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:11.340
 see the little one here made 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.160
 quick test and now once settled 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.490
 the mat will go to show you 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.540
 just like the mouse as it flows that 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.350
 I think it's a very very thing 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.740
 important 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:25.500
 I can tell you that I noticed a sensitive 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:29.910
 improvement of speed and 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.800
 accuracy or this mouse will be that not 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.840
 I know I'm not used to that it will be that anymore 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.310
 smooth but very very nice thesis vi 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.980
 greeting and refer you to the next 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.550
 review enjoy is that if the reindeer with 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.550
 you never
