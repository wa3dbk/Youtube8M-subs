00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello here these girls welcome to 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.860
 this video in which I come to talk 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.710
 a subject that I have been very much asked for 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.300
 which is how I cut the ends of my 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.550
 hair when tampa to your needs 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.050
 horrific I think that most of 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.170
 we surely want to have a 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.199
 nice and healthy long hair but for 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.490
 various reasons our hair is going 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.500
 drying to the point where the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.779
 tips are coming to bloom and 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.180
 it looks really ugly and that does a little 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.490
 that growth stops and you see it's 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.859
 for the 2 then the best solution 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.649
 It is always getting rid of all 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.659
 those ugly tips but go to the hairdresser 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.120
 many times we run the risk of zeebo 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.979
 short of puntitas please just that 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.440
 and we finish the axes with the cuts that 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.940
 does the pixie then there is always a 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.679
 risk and many people do not like 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.039
 make it good I was one of those people 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:54.530
 so one day from a one segment in the 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.969
 geo television did seems to work what 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.769
 I practiced, I've done it several times 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.420
 so I make this video for 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.119
 share them with you because I 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.820
 it is effective to cut all my 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.920
 ugly tips and without sacrificing the long 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.290
 The only thing they will need is a 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.420
 hairdressing scissors this brand 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.430
 rich and I bought it at the pixar house 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.570
 this is the cheapest there is great variety 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.310
 Price 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.040
 this is the cheapest I get about 3 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.570
 thousand 990 Chilean pesos what would come to 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.540
 be about 8 dollars and it will last you 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.420
 a lot of time so it's something that 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.430
 it's worth it and the other things like a 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.259
 bun and a towel all explained the 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.030
 videos are things that you already have in your 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.190
 house only the scissors maybe it can be 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.680
 something that I did not have is very easy very 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.259
 simple to do so I leave you with the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.270
 video because this is my hair before 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.100
 I want them to look at long I 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.600
 I made the break in the middle that is not what 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.490
 that I usually be but for 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.920
 to be able to divide what is good and what you see 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.260
 the long my hair reaches here more 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.540
 or less 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.780
 and which ones are the longest because I have 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.980
 some layers more short cuts ahead 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.600
 so I want you to pay attention to the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.370
 long and then once we finish 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.410
 let's compare what is the length that I'm going to 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.120
 have it I'm going to show you a little more of 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.759
 close that there are tips that are already 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.030
 well happy I let them so grow for 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.680
 to be able to show them well in the video and 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.350
 let's try to get rid of all 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.040
 those ugly spots and without meaning much 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.040
 the long 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.400
 I the one with my hair and it's in this 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.410
 moment when it is wet not stretching 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.110
 the wet disc and this is the point that 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.500
 we need to have it then what 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.890
 let's do now is to make a tail not 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.580
 be citizens of our hair 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.640
 unraveled 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.020
 and we're going to make a line and I'm going to do 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.210
 ponytails 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.940
 I did today here in the highest part 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.350
 of my head then they will be able 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.290
 of equal length in the front 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.650
 but from behind if you want the 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.390
 layers behind were shorter and those of 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.610
 forward longer then there is this 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.610
 much more towards here more forward 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.650
 if you want the back layers 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.140
 they are longer and those in front more 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.780
 short then run it backwards 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.790
 now let's proceed to cut how it's going 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.060
 to fall hair and we do not want to get dirty 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.280
 I'm going to put a towel under here 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.170
 so that later it will be easier 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.450
 pick up the hair you can use I do not know 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.580
 some old shirt some layer or 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.840
 anything for the hair to fall 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.660
 here with the munilla done and well 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.239
 brushed let's take our scissors 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.800
 these are hairdressing are pretty 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.600
 economic and you can find them in 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.280
 Specialty stores are also sold 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.190
 not online you can find it 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.340
 places like pizza house earns things and 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.620
 let's do the following 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.819
 I'm not going to put you aside you can 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.420
 see well 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.390
 I'm going to take my bun 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.400
 here 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.720
 what combed it combed it 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.360
 and I'm going to leave it here planet 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.330
 they fix that 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.800
 there are the little tips and I take my 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.630
 scissors 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.630
 and I'm going to make diagonal cuts 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.160
 first on that depending on each time 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.690
 I'm going to make the cuts I did not tell you 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.630
 all the hair in a single diagonal 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.980
 then 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.980
 brush again 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:37.050
 and I flatten it again 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.050
 and short on the other diagonal 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.729
 also by mechitas there is not a single 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.629
 cut 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.629
 a lie 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.870
 I will try time all number of the same 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.870
 long 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.850
 to plane again 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.790
 it's called staying more even 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.400
 I am already satisfied as it is worse 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.120
 and everything is more or less even and you can see 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.840
 zenit or already the cut or a few good 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.510
 long 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.330
 and I'm going to show you there you can appreciate 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.740
 what cut they have more or less long 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.070
 that they were already with the 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.080
 tips and that's worth getting rid of them 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.129
 and once you 're ready 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.129
 together your hair 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.520
 and comb it if you let it dry like 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.440
 you would normally do and obviously have 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.620
 He spent a lot of time and it is night and 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.449
 who controlled you completely dry and if 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.130
 you notice he kept the same clothes 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.990
 I would stick my hair here in half for 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.539
 that you can compare what the 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.599
 length of the beginning before cutting the 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.550
 tips and now and they notice that we have not 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.380
 sacrificed nothing long looks 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.330
 practically no one could 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.000
 ask yourself to cut your hair because it 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.669
 he sees the same but he is much healthier with 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.970
 much more movement the ugly tips and 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:10.520
 horrible we got rid in 12 in a 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.310
 95% of them so much better your hair 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.470
 will grow healthy strong is going to see more 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.360
 nice healthy that is something that all 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.580
 we want and we sacrifice ourselves long 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.159
 no doubt it is a thing that complicates us 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.919
 it's enough to go to cut more the hair is 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:26.210
 something quick easy to be economical like this 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.729
 I hope you liked this one 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.169
 video and any doubt and is something can 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.460
 write in the comments a kiss 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.460
 strong for each one of you chau
