00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 all were at the doors and your cards 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.490
 point fr it produces at the beginning of the year 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.750
 2014 you first hold yourself 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.970
 send my best wishes for this 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.010
 year of success but especially the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.360
 health so while waiting for the arrival of the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.019
 macbook pro but who na who should 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.630
 arrive shortly 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.100
 we will simply evaluate the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.100
 finished match is represented 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.170
 the mac mini here it is then we get 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.880
 found with a computer flat and 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.490
 the mac mini inscription as usual 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.090
 at apple we also have apples on 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.980
 the side is here at the back ben 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.350
 simply the description of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.300
 connectors on the back of the computer 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.980
 and under, but I'm not going to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.930
 show since there are references 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.880
 products in would end up the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 embedded configuration by the machine 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.030
 to unpack the mac mini bath is 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.339
 very simple because I saw on 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.200
 several unpacking videos that the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.020
 gallery types just simply 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.650
 of all and that's it and in one so 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.869
 the computer that appears like this 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.840
 so of course he was previously 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.369
 unpacked we normally have a movie of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.910
 protection as on all machines 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.190
 apple 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.290
 so I think I'm against 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.850
 day here I say zoom a little bit so here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:35.700
 we end up with the apple of apple 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:38.220
 here the operating witness to 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.350
 the back so we end up with the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.899
 power button so that allows us to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.000
 turn it on focus please 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.179
 has here simply the cord 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.209
 power the ethernet port the 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.250
 firewire 800 we have the hdmi the thunder 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.600
 bolt that is not thunder bolt 2 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.649
 like on macbook pro retina 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.819
 last generation 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.410
 we have four USB ports usb 3 we have 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:05.100
 also a sd card reader 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.740
 here it allows us to ventilate the machine and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.490
 so we have a headphone input and output 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.620
 microphone 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.200
 here we have a small base 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.870
 which allows us very simply to 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.720
 to open the beast as a reminder 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.310
 the mac mini is perhaps the last of the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.510
 apple computers to be able to be 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.340
 dismounted 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.810
 you really are this fragmentation for 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.220
 stalk said take since it's 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.170
 the computer of the family that comes 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.700
 replace the last survivor of the pc 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.310
 who made the light a few months 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.900
 in his already so personam in himself 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.610
 found calais to the computer that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.140
 did not remember it had any pretensions 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.140
 to be very upscale is also 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.120
 very powerful because between 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.250
 quotation marks his computer before apple 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.230
 then his place and especially in 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.659
 salons or oral valued for its side 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.950
 versatile we considered multimedia 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.690
 agrees that family so we will do 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.560
 its size and by its weight to be able 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.720
 carry the day 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.819
 a little bit of everywhere so that's the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.609
 basic configuration so with 4 gigas 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.680
 of ram processor i7 clocked at 2.3 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.470
 gigahertz so it's the same high school that 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.239
 on macbook pro retina found 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.099
 so with a kiosk tomorrow will tell 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.139
 french 1400 tours where for the shot 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.599
 apple was pretty radio over at least a 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.079
 meter in 7200 turns then takes the 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.150
 traffic 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.370
 it's a fairly limited graphics card 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.970
 did not remember even more noble and that's 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.560
 especially an office so I would like us to 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.840
 can do this mac mini has he made 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.000
 one of which 113 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.760
 without a mouse without a screen and in the end this 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.590
 computer that compared to the market itself 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.940
 reveals quite expensive since the silk the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.800
 vision of peat and we end up with 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.660
 an entry-level break it brings to a 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.090
 animal has nothing on board with a mini mac 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.830
 by its design by its dissipation 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.750
 thermal by its performance 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.519
 that's because even the brands 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.040
 German made this cable would have more 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.569
 performing noon after it's true that 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.090
 the advantage we can bring back from 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.489
 everywhere by its climax size is no longer 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.970
 bulky one can also feast his 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.410
 finances 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.079
 that's not bad since you can buy 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.690
 the big fruits separately will be 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.370
 created at that time take out the price 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.440
 of call it must of course the keyboards 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.690
 apple to benefit the affected all 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.640
 and do not get tangled in the corner 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.500
 so they will have to determine this video 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.380
 I was able to test the demand model 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.340
 entry level with high school one 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.530
 it's not a lightning war 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.979
 this remains a ritual processor like 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.190
 on the macbook pro 13 inches and as much 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.030
 to say it is not really versatile 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.080
 I will try for the one who wants 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.419
 to do office automation 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.550
 it's excellent but for its part 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.729
 versatile so I appreciate it on the i7 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.979
 therefore also that some media bienne 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.580
 more beautiful is really very 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.530
 very unity so for the little gap 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.660
 who link between lee singly this one I 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.370
 strongly advise high school after 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.880
 last point is the kiss 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.350
 after that is that magpie its big 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.040
 benefit is perhaps the last 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.590
 this cie machines that can change 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.360
 the components it stops at dollar to 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.330
 hard disk but the advantage is that we 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.470
 can take the entry level and 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.450
 optimize it later so if you to 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.800
 brno crisis will last more hard drives 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.480
 it was in your bones for toulouse 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.310
 story effect there I hope this little 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.840
 and vallage quick presentation does 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.460
 will move more we find ourselves 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.810
 soon for unpacking and 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.020
 maybe they themselves could 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.970
 to leave on the 13th, but I hope the 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.680
 see you soon with domain where after 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.690
 two but since it's been two weeks 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.310
 that I'm waiting for big bikes we get 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.490
 will also find that to leave 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.410
 automobile this time 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.980
 the audi a3 sportback so the last one to 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.850
 2013 equipped with tellines of 850 and the 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.850
 ambition finish 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.900
 so here's a little video a bonus for 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.580
 those who will watch the video until the 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.830
 end for those who would still have 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.900
 doubts about the mini side of the mac mini but 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.330
 here we are with a low the 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.340
 orange decoder which rather small chassis 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.680
 compact and a bone the mini mac 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.670
 so as you can see green in 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.710
 fineness also in terms of width 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.600
 the mac mini prevail and for the 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:24.850
 curious this is what it gives when 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:35.200
 is a mini mac case so we're going to 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:38.560
 relight the little bug to show you 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.070
 what does it mean when you start very 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.070
 poorly finished 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.420
 and finally listen to the noise 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.900
 we hear almost nothing
