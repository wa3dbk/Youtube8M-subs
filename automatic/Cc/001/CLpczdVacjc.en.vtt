00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.090 

little<00:03:10.420> dry<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.440> little<00:03:11.770> on<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> dry

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
little dry that is a little on the dry

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.470 
little dry that is a little on the dry
side<00:03:12.190> guys<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:12.640> gotta<00:03:12.880> be<00:03:13.000> honest<00:03:13.270> that's<00:03:13.390> a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
side guys I gotta be honest that's a

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.480 
side guys I gotta be honest that's a
little<00:03:13.750> dry<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.770> breading<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.220> pretty

heavy also I think that's what's adding
to<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.770> shouldn't<00:03:18.220> really<00:03:18.310> make<00:03:18.490> a<00:03:18.550> difference

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
to it shouldn't really make a difference
