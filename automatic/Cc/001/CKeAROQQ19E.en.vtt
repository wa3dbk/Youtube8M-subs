00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.050
 congo drums maybe 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.220
 the main element of latin american 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 music but his progenitor was 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.879
 ancient african drums 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.300
 made from animal skins 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.599
 strung on the floor in the trunk of a tree 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.949
 these days soon they pull on the cylinder 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.449
 from wood or fiberglass 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.479
 manufacture of stock drums 

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:25.810
 requires great skill cook 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.960
 but 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.560
 however, those to whom made exceptions 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.849
 wood possessing good 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.850
 plastic qualities she 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.850
 reflects sound does not absorb it 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.850
 first, the power is prepared curved 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.870
 boards from which the body will assemble 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.060
 drums 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.170
 he marks the lines from the cut on 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.520
 rectangular russian tree then 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.440
 using band saws saws it 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.970
 fields are not so internal external 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.970
 side has bends 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.850
 n 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.560
 then he goes to the movies installation 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.320
 which supervising disk is possible 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.320
 set at different angles 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.060
 the workpiece is fixed on 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.650
 its edge is bleached by the approach 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.650
 badly 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.990
 then the workpiece is transferred to another 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.050
 the side 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.750
 and the other edge is also increasing thought 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 om 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.500
 masks examines robbed carpentry 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.890
 glue we fold the planks using 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.439
 specially designed 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.780
 adaptations so they form a circle 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.070
 the number of plates varies in 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.110
 depending on the diameter of the body than 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.110
 the larger the diameter the lower the sound of the drums 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.299
 kaleri 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.379
 dries 24 hours 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.099
 without the form of his war like this corps 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.099
 bongo only from boost 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.749
 now the wizard installs 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.629
 dried case on a lathe 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.849
 used a semicircular chisel 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.809
 shoots about six in the element of the working class ruble 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.749
 outer surface of the case 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.169
 then through various 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:33.829
 tools adds 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.159
 decorative items when it is done 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.639
 the surface of the body is treated with three 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.399
 types of sandpaper and in each of 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.899
 which is thinner than the previous then either 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.719
 leave natural color 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.719
 tree either cover it small 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.189
 thick oil based varnish 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.639
 protects the tree father bone and courage 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.929
 now metal parts first 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:04.459
 these are chrome side windows of the wall 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.769
 made of steel they fasten the skin 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.099
 addictive drum top and propriety 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.099
 housing 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.589
 then the master skips the steel 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:19.459
 grandmother 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.519
 through a small car 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.989
 its currency is pressured by the plate 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.989
 turning it into a drum field 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.230
 in another room workshop 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.639
 process cow school which will be 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.639
 tightened on the drums 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.670
 first, it is soaked with the object solutions from 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.969
 cold water and if you lead 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.969
 he literally awaits the wool on the skin 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.399
 after 3 3 days the skin is taken out looking for 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:00.399
 her hair remains 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:08.699
 then she is pulled to another job 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.709
 I'm left for a couple of days to peel off 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.709
 at room temperature 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.479
 after both got drums 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.430
 chrome plating 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.169
 it's time to do the final assembly 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.449
 and the skin is pulled on 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.249
 encased and clamped manner 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.999
 vi shaped protruding loboda attached 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.889
 side plates of reliable cracks they 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.599
 adjusting presses setting 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.699
 there are only tools left now 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.479
 trim excess skin work finished 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:39.479
 you can lose
