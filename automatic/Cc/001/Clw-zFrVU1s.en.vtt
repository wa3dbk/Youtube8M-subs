00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
food right out all over so this is only

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.970 
food right out all over so this is only
about<00:00:36.870> half<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.680> there<00:00:37.860> he

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
about half of what was in there he

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.619 
about half of what was in there he
pulled<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.430> rest<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.850> there's<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> bunch

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
pulled out the rest and there's a bunch

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.119 
pulled out the rest and there's a bunch
sticking<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> glass<00:00:40.350> too<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:40.829> we'll<00:00:40.950> just

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
sticking on the glass too but we'll just

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.280 
sticking on the glass too but we'll just
clean<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.670> now<00:00:41.790> again<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> hog

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
clean this for now again this is a hog

00:00:43.290 --> 00:01:01.479 
clean this for now again this is a hog
one<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> has<00:00:43.800> two<00:00:43.980> LEDs

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.820 

this<00:01:02.489> has<00:01:02.640> been<00:01:02.789> running<00:01:03.089> for<00:01:03.239> quite<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.420> while

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
this has been running for quite a while

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.230 
this has been running for quite a while
probably<00:01:04.830> about<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> year<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
probably about a year or so

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.730 
probably about a year or so
so<00:01:06.810> let's<00:01:06.960> not<00:01:07.110> new<00:01:09.080> there's<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.200> lot<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.590> does

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
so let's not new there's a lot that does

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.609 
so let's not new there's a lot that does
not<00:01:10.890> come<00:01:11.100> off<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:14.780> don't<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:15.960> I've<00:01:16.110> seen<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
not come off I don't think I've seen the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.820 
not come off I don't think I've seen the
white<00:01:16.799> green<00:01:17.789> grabber<00:01:18.060> textures<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.929> months

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.899 

most<00:01:22.830> important<00:01:23.220> parts<00:01:23.429> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
most important parts going to be the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.639 
most important parts going to be the
bubbler<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.750> make<00:01:24.899> sure<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> bubbles

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
bubbler to make sure that it bubbles

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.520 
bubbler to make sure that it bubbles
good<00:01:25.920> but<00:01:26.789> this<00:01:27.390> gets<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.840> thick<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.319> packed

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
good but this gets so thick and packed

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.949 
good but this gets so thick and packed
with<00:01:28.860> even<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.399> freshwater<00:01:29.640> growth<00:01:30.149> that<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
with even the freshwater growth that the

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.330 
with even the freshwater growth that the
bubbles<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.409> gonna<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.740> they're<00:01:32.009> gonna<00:01:32.100> go

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
bubbles are gonna go they're gonna go

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
bubbles are gonna go they're gonna go
wherever<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.819> can<00:01:33.000> manage<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> find<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.929> way

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
wherever they can manage to find a way

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.219 
wherever they can manage to find a way
so<00:01:34.909> absolute<00:01:35.909> perfect<00:01:36.270> pathways<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
so absolute perfect pathways as the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.370 
so absolute perfect pathways as the
bubbler<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.920> critical

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.609 

the<00:01:43.380> goldfish<00:01:43.799> keeps<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.810> holes<00:01:46.170> pretty

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the goldfish keeps the holes pretty

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.380 
the goldfish keeps the holes pretty
pretty<00:01:47.130> open<00:01:47.490> because<00:01:47.789> he's<00:01:47.909> always<00:01:48.090> pulling

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
pretty open because he's always pulling

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.600 
pretty open because he's always pulling
algae<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:49.459> and<00:01:50.459> if<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.539> even<00:01:51.689> try<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:53.340> scrub

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
algae out and if I even try to scrub

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.499 
algae out and if I even try to scrub
this<00:01:53.789> off<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:55.080> white<00:01:55.289> green<00:01:55.920> grabber

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
this off of the white green grabber

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.740 
this off of the white green grabber
textures<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:58.759> it's<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.179> solid<00:02:00.599> just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
textures it's it's just so solid just

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.740 
textures it's it's just so solid just
like<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:04.160> on<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.220> beach<00:02:05.660> when<00:02:06.660> it's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
like it's like on a beach when it's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.330 
like it's like on a beach when it's
attached<00:02:07.019> to<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.289> rock<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.890> she's<00:02:08.069> not<00:02:08.220> gonna

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
attached to a rock and she's not gonna

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.540 
attached to a rock and she's not gonna
let<00:02:08.489> go<00:02:08.670> cuz<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.509> getting<00:02:09.569> hit<00:02:09.780> by<00:02:09.899> waves

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
let go cuz it's getting hit by waves

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.180 
let go cuz it's getting hit by waves
that's<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:11.940> thick<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.540> there<00:02:13.160> try<00:02:14.160> to

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
that's like really thick on there try to

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.750 
that's like really thick on there try to
scrape<00:02:14.459> off<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.950> know<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.370> pretty<00:02:17.580> much

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
scrape off you know it's pretty much

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.759 
scrape off you know it's pretty much
some<00:02:18.030> attack<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.540> remember<00:02:18.930> this<00:02:19.019> this<00:02:19.590> is

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
some attack so remember this this is

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.320 
some attack so remember this this is
completely<00:02:20.190> white<00:02:20.459> when<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:20.849> brand<00:02:21.120> new

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
completely white when it's brand new

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:37.370 
completely white when it's brand new
we'll<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.170> test<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.530> bubbler<00:02:22.800> now

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.890 

and<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.470> should<00:02:38.680> do<00:02:38.770> it
