hi my name is Chris Palmer today we're
gonna<00:00:02.010> talk<00:00:02.220> about<00:00:02.490> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> use<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.240> hand<00:00:03.540> plane

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.230 

hand<00:00:09.900> planes<00:00:10.170> are<00:00:10.440> really<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.070> joy<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.759> use<00:00:11.940> it's

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
hand planes are really a joy to use it's

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.240 
hand planes are really a joy to use it's
just<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.570> pleasant<00:00:12.960> experience<00:00:13.259> from<00:00:14.099> the

just a pleasant experience from the
sound<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:16.080> blade<00:00:16.590> slicing<00:00:17.220> through<00:00:17.400> wood

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
sound of the blade slicing through wood

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.630 
sound of the blade slicing through wood
to<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.180> feel<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:19.130> don't<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.400> intimidated

here a little bit of paste wax on the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.069 
here a little bit of paste wax on the
sole<00:00:37.800> will<00:00:38.610> help<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.090> slide<00:00:39.239> through<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> work

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
sole will help it slide through the work

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.430 
sole will help it slide through the work
as<00:00:40.350> well<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.450> little<00:00:42.450> buff<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.170> some

as well just a little buff with some
paste<00:00:43.860> wax<00:00:44.149> here's<00:00:45.149> my<00:00:45.450> work<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:46.260> tightly

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
paste wax here's my work really tightly

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.010 
paste wax here's my work really tightly
clamped<00:00:47.399> into<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.910> vise<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.809> gonna

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
clamped into this vise it's not gonna

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.889 
clamped into this vise it's not gonna
move<00:00:49.700> sometimes<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.030> use<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.270> bench<00:00:51.629> hook

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
move sometimes you can use a bench hook

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.529 
move sometimes you can use a bench hook
on<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.260> work<00:00:52.440> table<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> bench<00:00:53.760> dog<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
on your work table or a bench dog to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.170 
on your work table or a bench dog to
secure<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.230> work<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.730> like<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.850> keep<00:00:57.000> my

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
secure your work I like to keep my

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.619 
secure your work I like to keep my
pointer<00:00:57.570> finger<00:00:57.600> out<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.910> my<00:00:59.910> work<00:01:00.149> is

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
pointer finger out like that my work is

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.869 
pointer finger out like that my work is
that<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> comfortable<00:01:01.379> height<00:01:01.640> secure<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
that a comfortable height secure in a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.859 
that a comfortable height secure in a
vise<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:05.010> trick<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.420> all

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
vise and the trick is to really use all

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.780 
vise and the trick is to really use all
your<00:01:07.229> body<00:01:07.590> weight<00:01:07.710> behind<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> stroke<00:01:08.700> of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
your body weight behind the stroke of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.270 
your body weight behind the stroke of
the<00:01:08.850> plane<00:01:09.170> yeah<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.380> stay<00:01:10.619> relaxed<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the plane yeah but stay relaxed so you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.350 
the plane yeah but stay relaxed so you
really<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.580> step<00:01:12.119> into<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.320> work<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.360> let

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
really you step into the work and let

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.450 
really you step into the work and let
your<00:01:15.540> whole<00:01:15.720> body<00:01:15.930> carry<00:01:16.830> right<00:01:17.100> through<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
your whole body carry right through that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.870 
your whole body carry right through that
motion<00:01:17.869> stay<00:01:18.869> relaxed<00:01:19.549> keep<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.729> work

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
motion stay relaxed keep your work

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.060 
motion stay relaxed keep your work
secure<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.200> should<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:22.890> good

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
secure and you should have a really good

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.050 
secure and you should have a really good
time<00:01:23.280> using<00:01:23.610> your<00:01:23.729> hand<00:01:23.970> plane<00:01:24.180> I'm<00:01:24.659> going

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
time using your hand plane I'm going

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.370 
time using your hand plane I'm going
with<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.299> grain<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> piece<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
with the grain here this is a piece of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.620 
with the grain here this is a piece of
fur<00:01:28.710> with<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> nice<00:01:29.250> straight<00:01:29.729> grain

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.149 

experiment<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> little<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.560> skew

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
experiment with a little bit of skew

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.749 
experiment with a little bit of skew
angle<00:01:35.600> across<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.770> work<00:01:37.950> piece<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
angle across the work piece that

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.749 
angle across the work piece that
actually<00:01:39.590> reduces<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.619> surface<00:01:41.009> tension<00:01:41.220> of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
actually reduces the surface tension of

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.410 
actually reduces the surface tension of
the<00:01:41.850> wood<00:01:42.180> fiber<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.820> will<00:01:44.820> give<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.149> nice

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the wood fiber and will give you a nice

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.170 
the wood fiber and will give you a nice
a<00:01:45.750> nice<00:01:46.290> cut<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> really

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
a nice cut you're going for a really

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.560 
a nice cut you're going for a really
thin<00:01:48.659> shaving<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.240> go<00:01:51.360> down<00:01:51.540> to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
thin shaving you can go down to

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:04.289 
thin shaving you can go down to
paper-thin

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.059 

it's<00:02:05.299> all<00:02:05.479> just<00:02:05.780> nice<00:02:08.019> nice<00:02:09.019> shavings<00:02:09.800> very

it's all just nice nice shavings very

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.280 
it's all just nice nice shavings very
pleasant<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.819> it's<00:02:11.360> leaving<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.720> nice<00:02:11.900> finish

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290
