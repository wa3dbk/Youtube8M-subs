00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.300
 never before as we told you 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.820
 problems of the prostate gives the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.130
 old people or very old men and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.039
 now not more and more young if so 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.420
 it's from the moment they 're changing 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.689
 classifications that we had 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.779
 medicine 20 years ago project because 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.060
 Of course more and more cancers appear 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.340
 early all in general and those of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.810
 prostate are really having a 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.700
 very high incidence 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.350
 in fact, prostate cancer is the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.020
 cancer that affects men more in 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.180
 the world and mexico is no exception eight 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
 decades and in a man it is estimated that 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.110
 have prostate cancer then of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.610
 according to the figure we have and because 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.410
 the indexes have risen so much 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.620
 feeding the lifestyle like this is 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.870
 that's right, notice that right now we said in the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.370
 segment entry that all 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.289
 cancers this is very clearly 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.390
 finished the science all the cancers 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.130
 are 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.540
 in some way or another they are 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.670
 related to lifestyle 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.710
 then one of the first things that 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.570
 one has to understand is to get there 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.040
 when the cancer arrives that is a 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.440
 situation, believe me it's a situation 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.750
 very hard very heavy was a forecast 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.520
 difficult I do not know anyone who is 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.440
 same how rich half cancer is one thing 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.550
 terrible when people say they signed up 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.650
 everyone regrets what they do not 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.170
 did before that I say we're in a 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.000
 moment where seeing the figures how 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.430
 they are behaving we have to work 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.320
 a little more in prevention that is the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.090
 word that I was going prevention yesterday I 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.380
 I was throwing an eye and I stayed very 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.869
 impressed because there was a series of 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.950
 exercises suggested by a Turkish doctor 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.039
 which means that when you urinate 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.440
 you hold urine for a few seconds and 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.570
 that makes the prostate work for another 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.360
 speed and in another this and in another 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.920
 spectrum of functionality and you can 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 help prevent it I could not have 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.179
 never imagined because but that's a 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.310
 medicine we call kegel exercises 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.470
 those exercises all those that have to 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.759
 see with the contraction of the pelvic floor 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.530
 all the muscles that are at the base 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.750
 the pelvis which are the ones that are used 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.250
 when one has to control the urine 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.690
 the urge to go to the bathroom for example 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.030
 all the muscles that contract 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.590
 help the prostate move and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.240
 somehow it improves a little the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.930
 circulation and it's like giving you a massage 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.970
 the prostate 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.880
 now what happens with that is that the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.110
 prostate is a somewhat difficult organ 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.450
 because it's not like other organs that 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.740
 has a blood supply 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.760
 very easy that all the nutrients 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.290
 they come in very easy and even the 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.120
 medicines that arrive when there 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.550
 infection and there are very few 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.670
 that we have available then since 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.430
 evolves that cancer appears and 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.310
 measures aimed at this are no longer so 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.810
 easy it no longer responds that easy 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.820
 fortunately the speed of 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.070
 Cancer development is not as fast 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.110
 like others that suddenly in a few months 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.760
 we see a terrible evolution in cancer 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.610
 of prostate lasts for many years and all that 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.930
 but it depends a lot on the stage in which 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.489
 to take these times it 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.650
 they discover already when they have metastasis and 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.480
 all of that you have to work a lot a lot in 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.459
 the issue of prevention and is I say the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.630
 most important message where we have to 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.430
 focus because medicine in general 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.200
 is focused on attacking cancer 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.030
 we have to work much more and the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.410
 people who see this program the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.970
 general people all of us 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.280
 we should take average in general 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.210
 but apart from getting to it is the lack of 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.830
 apart from the prevention of the base the 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:22.180
 mythified that is completely the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.180
 exam the exam 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.500
 that has to be part of the measures 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.820
 preventive the test and the antigen 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.770
 Prostate that I'm going to talk about now 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.910
 a little bit because many times when 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.520
 someone says I want to see how is the 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.600
 prostate goes and the test is avoided and if I 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.340
 I do not want them to be doing me the 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.340
 prostate exam and it goes and the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.680
 antigen gentlemen and ladies who see this 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.200
 program the prostate antigen and what 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.880
 says the urologist association of USA and 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.500
 all many agreement can not be a 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.330
 study that tells us yes does someone 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.400
 good prostate cancer is not reliable 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.040
 if it's not reliable for that, you have to 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.080
 take a few contacts and it's touch 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.630
 orbital is the first and best way to 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.880
 do this evolutionary study men of 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.250
 more than 45 years should be making themselves 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.840
 regularly that kind of study of 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.459
 fixed exam schooling is what you're going 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.440
 to ask once a year is recommended 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.760
 now depends depends on factors of 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.300
 risk and now let's start talking 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.950
 other 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.570
 they talk about preventive medicine a 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.810
 person who does exercise that does not have 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.000
 other diseases than its composition 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.410
 body and see how interesting the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.730
 medicine recognizes that men who 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.960
 they have more fat in the body they have more 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.380
 predisposition to have cancer 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.780
 prostate 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.300
 ok then if we see a person who 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.250
 is a little overweight that has what 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.900
 better that you smoke that you do not exercise 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.880
 is taking pills for pressure and 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.040
 all that that person is recommended that 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.690
 the follow-up exam tests 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.680
 follow - up with the urologist or the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.440
 doctor who sees it 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.990
 it has to be annual because at the same 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.520
 time can be generating many 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.100
 diseases and one of them can be the 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.510
 cancer especially if obesity is 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.030
 like in that obesity overdose 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.910
 visceral obesity ran aground 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.560
 walk down so all this is 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.270
 accumulate in the waist and forget and 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.040
 which is very related to diabetes 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.170
 and all of that is known to be very 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.070
 related to there are foods that can 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:12.710
 make it easier to manage a 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.550
 prostate risk and if there are three things 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.980
 which are messages that make it very clear 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.270
 there are two nutrients two minerals that are 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.920
 essential for health 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.690
 and that it has been seen that people who have 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.770
 better levels of those have less 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.710
 incidence of prostate 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.180
 one is zinc zinc is actually the 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.620
 mineral that is most abundant in the 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.870
 prostate already knows what foods contain 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.090
 zinc especially oysters molluscs 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.890
 the options that kind of things generate 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.660
 fish seafood others the 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.790
 selenium the famous is a mineral 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.170
 essential so that they do not develop 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.000
 cancer in general and especially of 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.130
 prostate is where there is selenium selenium 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.520
 especially in some dried seeds 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.530
 and in pistach nuts if it's about 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.700
 everything is not from Brazil they call it the 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.680
 macadamia 370 is the broccoli all the 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.300
 family of lamb and onions and all that 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.250
 It has components that help 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.530
 modulate the hormones in the body as 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.450
 do not generate an excessive effect on that 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.070
 we have already talked about sugar we have already 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.810
 talked about the flour that are inducers 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.160
 of tumors and dairy products are also 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.260
 Inducers of prostate tumors are not 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.180
 keep in mind decision thank you doctor 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.840
 you know that if they want more information 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.790
