when you get your ink cartridges remove

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:25.269 
when you get your ink cartridges remove
the<00:00:02.820> tape<00:00:05.540> remove<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.690> clip<00:00:12.650> open<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.830> up

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.330 

there's<00:00:25.820> probably<00:00:26.150> going<00:00:26.390> to<00:00:26.480> be<00:00:26.539> bubbles<00:00:27.019> in

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
there's probably going to be bubbles in

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.350 
there's probably going to be bubbles in
the<00:00:28.340> tubes<00:00:28.640> from<00:00:29.509> shipping<00:00:30.939> not<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.119> allow<00:00:32.300> the

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
the tubes from shipping not to allow the

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:42.210 
the tubes from shipping not to allow the
ink<00:00:32.660> to<00:00:32.809> flow<00:00:32.989> let's<00:00:33.739> open<00:00:33.949> up<00:00:34.190> these<00:00:34.370> air<00:00:34.610> hole

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.150 

you'll<00:00:42.790> notice<00:00:43.060> that<00:00:43.210> there<00:00:43.690> is<00:00:43.720> pink<00:00:44.620> in<00:00:45.010> the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
you'll notice that there is pink in the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.580 
you'll notice that there is pink in the
large<00:00:45.370> section<00:00:45.880> and<00:00:46.450> there's<00:00:46.690> also<00:00:46.870> ink<00:00:47.260> in<00:00:47.500> a

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
large section and there's also ink in a

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.920 
large section and there's also ink in a
small<00:00:47.920> section<00:00:48.220> we<00:00:48.820> don't<00:00:49.060> want<00:00:49.360> him<00:00:49.570> here<00:00:49.810> in

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
small section we don't want him here in

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.810 
small section we don't want him here in
a<00:00:49.990> small<00:00:50.230> section<00:00:50.530> so<00:00:51.250> we're<00:00:51.400> going<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.700> get

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
a small section so we're going to get

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.110 
a small section so we're going to get
the<00:00:51.940> written<00:00:52.360> containers<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.710> tilt<00:00:54.010> them<00:00:57.120> we

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
the written containers and tilt them we

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.470 
the written containers and tilt them we
never<00:00:58.360> want<00:00:58.690> ink<00:00:58.990> in<00:00:59.230> this<00:01:00.160> section<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.910> if

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
never want ink in this section and if

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.750 
never want ink in this section and if
you<00:01:01.570> ever<00:01:01.750> add<00:01:02.020> ink<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.890> these<00:01:03.040> containers

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
you ever add ink to these containers

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.160 
you ever add ink to these containers
you're<00:01:04.240> going<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.540> have<00:01:04.630> to<00:01:04.750> do<00:01:04.870> this<00:01:04.989> again

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
you're going to have to do this again

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.510 
you're going to have to do this again
you're<00:01:05.500> going<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.740> have<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.010> tilt<00:01:06.280> the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
you're going to have to tilt the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.030 
you're going to have to tilt the
containers<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.720> keep<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.080> ink<00:01:08.290> over<00:01:08.770> here<00:01:08.950> in

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
containers to keep the ink over here in

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.940 
containers to keep the ink over here in
the<00:01:09.130> large<00:01:09.310> sections<00:01:13.440> you<00:01:14.440> may<00:01:14.619> still<00:01:14.890> have

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
the large sections you may still have

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.640 
the large sections you may still have
some<00:01:15.100> bubbles<00:01:15.640> in<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.240> tubes<00:01:16.510> so<00:01:17.260> you<00:01:17.440> may

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
some bubbles in the tubes so you may

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.910 
some bubbles in the tubes so you may
want<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:20.250> lift<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.400> containers<00:01:21.880> up<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:23.290> allow

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
want to lift the containers up to allow

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.350 
want to lift the containers up to allow
that<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.490> integral<00:01:24.850> with<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.119> flow<00:01:25.300> through

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
that the integral with the flow through

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.960 
that the integral with the flow through
the<00:01:25.660> system<00:01:25.810> you'll<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.310> only<00:01:27.520> do<00:01:27.790> this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
the system you'll you can only do this

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.300 
the system you'll you can only do this
in<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.420> situation<00:01:28.830> after<00:01:29.830> these<00:01:29.979> cartridges

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
in this situation after these cartridges

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.310 
in this situation after these cartridges
are<00:01:30.700> in<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:30.970> printer<00:01:31.300> you'll<00:01:31.780> never<00:01:32.020> want<00:01:32.259> to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
are in the printer you'll never want to

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.800 
are in the printer you'll never want to
do<00:01:32.500> this<00:01:32.680> because<00:01:33.160> ink<00:01:33.670> will<00:01:34.210> continue<00:01:34.720> to

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
do this because ink will continue to

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.230 
do this because ink will continue to
flow<00:01:35.020> through<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.440> cartridges<00:01:35.979> out<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.940> the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
flow through the cartridges out of the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.120 
flow through the cartridges out of the
cartridges<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.050> into<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.500> printer<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.040> it

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
cartridges and into the printer and it

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.040 
cartridges and into the printer and it
will<00:01:39.250> leak<00:01:39.430> inside<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.790> printer<00:01:40.060> but<00:01:40.780> now<00:01:40.990> we

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
will leak inside the printer but now we

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.730 
will leak inside the printer but now we
can<00:01:41.380> do<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.590> just<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.369> push<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.759> ink<00:01:42.940> into<00:01:43.240> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
can do it just to push the ink into the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.810 
can do it just to push the ink into the
cartridges<00:01:44.740> if<00:01:44.890> it's<00:01:45.009> not<00:01:45.190> going<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.520> come<00:01:45.670> out

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
cartridges if it's not going to come out

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.270 
cartridges if it's not going to come out
because<00:01:46.030> it's<00:01:46.330> sealed<00:01:46.710> okay<00:01:47.710> now<00:01:48.010> let's<00:01:48.220> put

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
because it's sealed okay now let's put

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.410 
because it's sealed okay now let's put
the<00:01:48.520> cartridges<00:01:49.000> into<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.390> printer<00:01:51.420> that's

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
the cartridges into the printer that's

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.750 
the cartridges into the printer that's
open<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.900> printer

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.300 

and<00:01:59.880> be<00:02:00.630> patient<00:02:00.900> during<00:02:01.440> this<00:02:01.620> part<00:02:01.920> because

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and be patient during this part because

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.610 
and be patient during this part because
these<00:02:02.910> are<00:02:03.120> not<00:02:03.270> glued<00:02:03.690> into<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:04.020> cartridges

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
these are not glued into the cartridges

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.460 
these are not glued into the cartridges
so<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.430> possible<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> pull<00:02:06.300> them<00:02:06.450> out<00:02:06.600> so

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
so it's possible to pull them out so

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.630 
so it's possible to pull them out so
just<00:02:07.650> be<00:02:07.740> very<00:02:07.860> patient

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
just be very patient

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.890 
just be very patient
they<00:02:08.820> won't<00:02:08.970> eventually<00:02:09.240> go<00:02:09.660> in

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.190 

I<00:02:14.930> found<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.130> best<00:02:16.280> ways<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.900> lay<00:02:17.900> them<00:02:18.080> out

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
I found the best ways to lay them out

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.780 
I found the best ways to lay them out
what<00:02:21.640> if<00:02:22.640> they<00:02:22.880> ever<00:02:23.030> pull<00:02:23.599> off<00:02:23.810> all<00:02:24.790> you'll

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
what if they ever pull off all you'll

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:38.890 
what if they ever pull off all you'll
have<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:25.970> do<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.390> push<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.290> back<00:02:27.440> on

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:56.340 

I'll<00:02:39.890> start<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.250> push<00:02:40.459> another<00:02:40.760> one

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.710 

never<00:02:57.310> pull<00:02:57.670> too<00:02:57.910> hard<00:03:03.420> you'll<00:03:04.420> see<00:03:04.630> I'm

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
never pull too hard you'll see I'm

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.780 
never pull too hard you'll see I'm
getting<00:03:04.990> some<00:03:05.170> air<00:03:05.350> bubbles<00:03:05.710> that's<00:03:06.280> okay<00:03:06.640> we

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
getting some air bubbles that's okay we

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:38.960 
getting some air bubbles that's okay we
can<00:03:06.820> fix<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.570> second

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.880 

so<00:03:39.420> have<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.630> few<00:03:39.930> air<00:03:40.110> bubbles<00:03:40.470> because<00:03:40.800> I

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
so have a few air bubbles because I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.160 
so have a few air bubbles because I
lifted<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.280> cartridges<00:03:41.700> up<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.090> high<00:03:42.270> I<00:03:42.570> can

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
lifted the cartridges up so high I can

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.440 
lifted the cartridges up so high I can
bring<00:03:43.320> them<00:03:43.500> down<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.710> little<00:03:43.890> bit<00:03:44.450> Lincoln

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
bring them down a little bit Lincoln
