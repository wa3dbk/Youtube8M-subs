00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.299
 so many people have a refill as a 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:09.520
 concert in reality actually the 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.920
 company itself reports that the 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.590
 refill is just an emergency relief 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.299
 for example are you traveling ever 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.259
 outside of your city 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.820
 So the tire comes to get a nail. 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.159
 piercing object 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.779
 There you make that concert until you get there. 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.730
 in the place where you live 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.310
 When you get to what is the first thing 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.650
 to do is take back the one reviewed again 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.460
 make the organization inside and through 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.070
 off because when you put that refill 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.260
 it may have water infiltration and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.080
 damage the steel meshes that have 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.540
 inside the tire because a lot of people are coming 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.300
 even losing tires will damage to create 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.030
 bubble on the tire because it goes in 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.130
 infiltrating water and painting book 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.040
 reporting the flu does not want wire 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.040
 it does not have a full seal so what is the 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.640
 reality to make the total 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.210
 inside and out is not a cost more 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.770
 high but tire price comparison 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.900
 pays off because you're carrying 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.450
 family by notice and 60 and also 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.500
 take care of the life of someone else's life 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.610
 why and the durability of the tire because 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.440
 doubting the tire 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.450
 maybe the person takes it without speaking of course 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.140
 that I have my commented 5 thousand 10 thousand 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.940
 15 thousand but he did not know how to take care of the tire 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.510
 the first thing to be careful in 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.070
 tire always look on the side 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.130
 that is eating more spending on 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:41.159
 wear and repair as is 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:46.180
 correct or as it is right so jumped 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.159
 used refill strips the piercing object and 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.229
 full shirt it inside and out 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.909
 this is correct 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.650
 now if you leave this stock the refill that 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.659
 It will happen as you give your life. 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.760
 on wear tire 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.670
 He's going to eat that stuff and he's going to 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.130
 damaged opinion then profile is 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.260
 emergency relief until 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.640
 arrive in your locality 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.900
 because today approximately one tire is 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.580
 very personal complains that he was attacking until 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.239
 my business is not expensive 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.069
 As you take care, be careful with him. 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.620
 it lasts a lot of time so i want 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.470
 make clear to all the people who 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.380
 have car and use their vehicles to carry 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.090
 family work day do it 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:42.709
 correct service also then we should 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.380
 do is have a good news on the tire and 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.780
 use the correct material that is needed 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.480
 such as that neither sister 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.970
 recommended not by lateral refining of the tire 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.090
 also often seen tire with refill 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.250
 side is not the right also correct 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.000
 vulcanization the concert inside and through 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.890
 out to prevent water infiltration and 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.890
 to get to get rust on canvas
