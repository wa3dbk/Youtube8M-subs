00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.539 

so<00:00:03.600> I'm<00:00:03.840> doing<00:00:04.049> some<00:00:04.500> research<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.520> think

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
so I'm doing some research and I think

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.059 
so I'm doing some research and I think
it<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.180> cool<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:07.080> this<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:07.620> one<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
it is cool and this is one of the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.339 
it is cool and this is one of the
reasons<00:00:08.550> why<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.760> stayed<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.660> school<00:00:09.840> I'm

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
reasons why I stayed in school I'm

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.610 
reasons why I stayed in school I'm
trying<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.130> make<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.610> safer<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.620> racehorses

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
trying to make it safer for racehorses

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.770 
trying to make it safer for racehorses
and<00:00:13.799> one<00:00:14.340> thing<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.610> may<00:00:14.969> injure<00:00:15.420> them<00:00:15.630> is

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
and one thing that may injure them is

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.779 
and one thing that may injure them is
the<00:00:15.900> surface<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.560> their<00:00:16.740> horses<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.550> main

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
the surface on their horses the main

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.720 
the surface on their horses the main
surfaces<00:00:18.300> our<00:00:18.449> turf<00:00:18.750> synthetic<00:00:19.740> endured<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
surfaces our turf synthetic endured and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.420 
surfaces our turf synthetic endured and
we<00:00:21.000> want<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.420> find<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:22.050> at<00:00:22.289> least<00:00:22.529> likely

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
we want to find the one at least likely

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.000 
we want to find the one at least likely
to<00:00:23.460> her<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.330> investigate<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> surface<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:25.830> put

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
to her to investigate the surface we put

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.429 
to her to investigate the surface we put
equipment<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> horses<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.689> measure<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
equipment on the horses to measure the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.250 
equipment on the horses to measure the
movement<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.550> measure<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:30.179> horses<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
movement in to measure how horses but I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.930 
movement in to measure how horses but I
also<00:00:31.500> built<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> machine<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:32.610> simulates

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
also built a machine which simulates

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.540 
also built a machine which simulates
with<00:00:33.450> him<00:00:33.630> Mac<00:00:33.870> teen<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.680> measure<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
with him Mac teen to measure all the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.209 
with him Mac teen to measure all the
surfaces<00:00:35.870> dynamic<00:00:36.870> properties<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
surfaces dynamic properties so in the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
surfaces dynamic properties so in the
lab<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> track<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.899> measure

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
lab for the track we can measure

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
lab for the track we can measure
properly<00:00:40.739> things<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.550> before<00:00:42.000> step

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
properly things like before step

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.799 
properly things like before step
formation<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> impact<00:00:43.559> velocity<00:00:43.879> I<00:00:44.879> think<00:00:45.329> my

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
formation and impact velocity I think my

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.700 
formation and impact velocity I think my
research<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.680> coolio<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.500> wanted<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
research is coolio and I just wanted to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.139 
research is coolio and I just wanted to
let<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.789> know<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.379> why<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.280> stayed<00:00:53.879> in

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
let you know this is why I stayed in

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.920 
let you know this is why I stayed in
school<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:56.010> why<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.699> stayed<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.660> school

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
