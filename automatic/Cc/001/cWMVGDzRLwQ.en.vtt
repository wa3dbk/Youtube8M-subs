recommended that I get veneers but the

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.789 
recommended that I get veneers but the
result<00:01:40.329> would<00:01:40.509> be<00:01:40.539> having<00:01:41.289> really<00:01:41.649> big

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
result would be having really big

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.830 
result would be having really big
chiclet<00:01:42.280> teeth<00:01:42.310> because<00:01:42.880> me<00:01:43.060> having<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.570> gap

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
chiclet teeth because me having a gap

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.109 
chiclet teeth because me having a gap
having<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:44.950> space<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.640> then<00:01:45.759> trying<00:01:46.060> to

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
having that space and then trying to

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.730 
having that space and then trying to
fill<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.509> space<00:01:46.810> wouldn't<00:01:47.200> make<00:01:47.320> my<00:01:47.500> teeth

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
fill that space wouldn't make my teeth

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.529 
fill that space wouldn't make my teeth
appear<00:01:48.130> too<00:01:48.369> large<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.909> I<00:01:48.939> didn't<00:01:49.179> want<00:01:49.360> that

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
appear too large and I didn't want that

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.020 
appear too large and I didn't want that
that's<00:01:50.200> not<00:01:50.439> a<00:01:50.500> good<00:01:50.710> look<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.729> second

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
that's not a good look so the second

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.149 
that's not a good look so the second
option<00:01:52.360> was<00:01:52.539> Invisalign<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.740> that's<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
option was Invisalign and that's the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.039 
option was Invisalign and that's the
direction<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.119> was<00:01:55.299> going<00:01:55.630> toward<00:01:55.960> but

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
direction that I was going toward but

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.199 
direction that I was going toward but
when<00:01:59.049> I<00:01:59.080> went<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.380> my<00:01:59.590> third<00:01:59.830> dentist<00:02:00.340> he<00:02:00.909> said

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
when I went to my third dentist he said

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.809 
when I went to my third dentist he said
that<00:02:01.539> I<00:02:01.899> didn't<00:02:02.799> qualify<00:02:02.979> for<00:02:03.310> Invisalign

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
that I didn't qualify for Invisalign

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.740 
that I didn't qualify for Invisalign
because<00:02:04.240> my<00:02:04.390> gap<00:02:04.630> was<00:02:04.840> too<00:02:05.049> big<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:06.009> he

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
because my gap was too big so he

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.969 
because my gap was too big so he
recommended<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:07.929> get<00:02:07.990> standard<00:02:08.560> braces

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
recommended that I get standard braces

bad at all I'm really excited and it
moves<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.230> fast<00:03:49.500> when<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:49.950> think<00:03:50.220> oh<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.670> gotta

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
moves so fast when you think oh I gotta

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.300 
moves so fast when you think oh I gotta
wear<00:03:51.150> braces<00:03:51.540> for<00:03:51.690> two<00:03:51.870> years<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.680> oh<00:03:52.890> that's

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
so long but it goes so fast I literally

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.589 
so long but it goes so fast I literally
felt<00:03:56.099> like<00:03:56.129> I<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:56.610> got<00:03:56.819> them<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> few<00:03:57.329> months

felt like I just got them a few months

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.760 
felt like I just got them a few months
ago

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.920 

the<00:04:01.310> pain<00:04:01.610> level<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:02.210> would<00:04:02.390> say<00:04:02.660> when<00:04:02.900> you

six<00:04:05.510> or<00:04:05.630> seven<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.440> that<00:04:06.770> depends<00:04:07.130> on<00:04:07.220> you

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
six or seven and that depends on you

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.430 
six or seven and that depends on you
know<00:04:07.550> how<00:04:07.730> much<00:04:07.940> pain<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.360> can<00:04:08.510> take<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:09.200> only

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:32.749 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.079 

the<00:04:33.259> price<00:04:33.499> will<00:04:33.739> depend<00:04:34.159> on<00:04:34.309> if<00:04:34.519> you<00:04:34.639> get<00:04:34.789> the

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:35.089 
the price will depend on if you get the

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:38.559 
the price will depend on if you get the
metal<00:04:35.989> braces<00:04:36.469> or<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.369> clear<00:04:37.819> the<00:04:38.059> clear<00:04:38.299> do

metal braces or the clear the clear do

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:39.850 
metal braces or the clear the clear do
cost<00:04:38.839> more<00:04:39.080> because<00:04:39.229> they<00:04:39.499> are<00:04:39.529> more

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
cost more because they are more

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.100 
cost more because they are more
desirable<00:04:40.159> they're<00:04:41.059> not<00:04:41.239> as<00:04:41.389> noticeable<00:04:41.839> so

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
desirable they're not as noticeable so

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.389 
desirable they're not as noticeable so
they're<00:04:42.259> gonna<00:04:42.349> cost<00:04:42.679> you<00:04:42.889> a<00:04:42.919> little<00:04:43.129> bit<00:04:43.249> more

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:43.399 
they're gonna cost you a little bit more

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.429 
they're gonna cost you a little bit more
not<00:04:43.669> too<00:04:43.909> much<00:04:44.119> but<00:04:44.479> just<00:04:44.749> do<00:04:45.079> your<00:04:45.259> research

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:45.439 
not too much but just do your research

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.079 
not too much but just do your research
and<00:04:45.949> look<00:04:46.039> up<00:04:46.189> the<00:04:46.309> price<00:04:46.519> they're<00:04:46.819> pretty

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:47.089 
and look up the price they're pretty

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:48.969 
and look up the price they're pretty
much<00:04:47.329> your<00:04:47.569> standard<00:04:47.659> price<00:04:48.259> from<00:04:48.499> back<00:04:48.709> then

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
much your standard price from back then

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.189 
much your standard price from back then
I<00:04:49.279> thought<00:04:49.699> it<00:04:49.759> would<00:04:49.999> be<00:04:50.089> cheaper<00:04:50.479> because<00:04:50.869> of

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
I thought it would be cheaper because of

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.659 
I thought it would be cheaper because of
Invisalign<00:04:51.829> and<00:04:52.009> all<00:04:52.069> of<00:04:52.159> that<00:04:52.279> but<00:04:52.519> they

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
Invisalign and all of that but they

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.999 
Invisalign and all of that but they
still<00:04:52.999> cost<00:04:53.209> the<00:04:53.360> same<00:04:53.599> and<00:04:53.929> but<00:04:54.769> it's<00:04:54.889> so

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
still cost the same and but it's so
