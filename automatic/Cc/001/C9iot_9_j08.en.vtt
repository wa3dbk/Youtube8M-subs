00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.810 

so<00:00:09.290> probably<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.379> most<00:00:10.530> important<00:00:11.430> thing<00:00:11.639> is

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
so probably the most important thing is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.200 
so probably the most important thing is
there<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.709> claps<00:00:13.709> control<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.400> always<00:00:14.670> say

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.009 

we've<00:00:21.210> got<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.449> covered

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019 
we've got it covered

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.769 
we've got it covered
with<00:00:22.560> more<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.099> the<00:00:23.220> control<00:00:23.640> comes<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
with more of the control comes on the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.099 
with more of the control comes on the
throttle<00:00:25.169> you<00:00:25.679> can<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.919> the<00:00:26.070> pro<00:00:26.849> wide<00:00:27.599> open

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
throttle you can have the pro wide open

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.069 
throttle you can have the pro wide open
but<00:00:28.849> controlling<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:29.999> the<00:00:30.119> gas<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.900> get

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
but controlling it on the gas and get

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.170 
but controlling it on the gas and get
instant<00:00:31.529> power<00:00:31.710> from<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.730> react<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.060> lot

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
instant power from that can react a lot

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.060 
instant power from that can react a lot
we'd<00:00:33.450> give<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.720> left<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.829> with<00:00:34.980> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
we'd give this left you can with a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.990 
we'd give this left you can with a
bottle<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:36.630> gas<00:00:36.980> hit<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.130> delay<00:00:38.400> for<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
bottle the gas hit with delay for the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.610 
bottle the gas hit with delay for the
power<00:00:39.180> comes<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.020> build<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.380> power

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
power comes in but you build the power

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.610 
power comes in but you build the power
up<00:00:40.800> first<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:42.540> clutch<00:00:42.870> controls<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> we're

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
up first that clutch controls so we're

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.930 
up first that clutch controls so we're
going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:46.860> an<00:00:46.980> exercise<00:00:47.220> or<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.730> slow

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
going to do an exercise or just slow

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.450 
going to do an exercise or just slow
riding<00:00:48.510> you're<00:00:49.350> trying<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> figure<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
riding you're trying to a figure of

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.970 
riding you're trying to a figure of
eight<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.790> we've<00:00:50.910> got<00:00:51.060> turns<00:00:51.330> both<00:00:52.020> directions

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
eight so we've got turns both directions

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.150 
eight so we've got turns both directions
nice<00:00:53.760> pace<00:00:54.090> here<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.960> goal<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.130> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
nice pace here the goal is get on the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.390 
nice pace here the goal is get on the
fall-off<00:00:56.700> either<00:00:57.450> direction<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.290> nice<00:00:59.010> smooth

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
fall-off either direction a nice smooth

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.390 
fall-off either direction a nice smooth
controlled<00:00:59.970> way<00:01:00.320> holding<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.470> clutch<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
controlled way holding the clutch and

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.020 
controlled way holding the clutch and
that<00:01:02.550> biting<00:01:02.820> point<00:01:03.330> pretty<00:01:04.290> cool<00:01:04.909> when<00:01:05.909> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that biting point pretty cool when you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.349 
that biting point pretty cool when you
get<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.780> control<00:01:07.290> clutch<00:01:07.799> isn't<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.700> or<00:01:08.880> out

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:09.359 
get that control clutch isn't in or out

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.810 
get that control clutch isn't in or out
never<00:01:10.020> disengaging<00:01:10.829> the<00:01:10.859> clutch<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.369> holding

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
never disengaging the clutch is holding

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.910 
never disengaging the clutch is holding
on<00:01:11.969> that<00:01:11.999> biting<00:01:12.539> point<00:01:12.749> just<00:01:13.170> small

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
on that biting point just small

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.889 
on that biting point just small
movements<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.609> a<00:01:14.670> finger<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> adjust

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
movements with a finger just to adjust

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.399 
movements with a finger just to adjust
your<00:01:16.289> speed<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.710> your<00:01:16.829> balance<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:18.409> holding

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
your speed in your balance but holding

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
your speed in your balance but holding
it<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:19.829> biting<00:01:20.429> point<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.119> quite<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it on that biting point that's quite a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.209 
it on that biting point that's quite a
space<00:01:22.340> we<00:01:23.340> touch<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.539> just<00:01:25.020> slipping<00:01:25.289> you<00:01:26.039> can

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
space we touch is just slipping you can

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.209 
space we touch is just slipping you can
adjust<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.819> space<00:01:27.499> to<00:01:28.499> adjust<00:01:28.799> your<00:01:28.920> speed<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
adjust that space to adjust your speed a

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.139 
adjust that space to adjust your speed a
little<00:01:29.429> bit<00:01:29.609> but<00:01:29.969> quite<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.619> where<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.920> can

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
little bit but quite a bit where you can

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.940 
little bit but quite a bit where you can
before<00:01:33.149> it<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:33.389> disengages<00:01:34.319> you're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
before it actually disengages you're

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
before it actually disengages you're
trying<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.280> hold<00:01:35.399> it<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:35.969> adjust<00:01:36.299> your

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
trying to hold it on you can adjust your

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
trying to hold it on you can adjust your
speed<00:01:36.719> so<00:01:37.289> it's<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> balancing<00:01:37.889> exercise<00:01:38.369> as

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
speed so it's a balancing exercise as

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.179 
speed so it's a balancing exercise as
well<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.840> when<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> turn<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.469> at<00:01:40.560> slow<00:01:40.799> speed

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
well so when you turn in at slow speed

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.020 
well so when you turn in at slow speed
it's<00:01:42.030> leaning<00:01:42.359> the<00:01:42.450> bike<00:01:42.740> slightly<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.579> focus

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
it's leaning the bike slightly and focus

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.910 
it's leaning the bike slightly and focus
and<00:01:45.539> people<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> body<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.259> call<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.679> keeping

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and people the body I call it keeping

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
and people the body I call it keeping
the<00:01:47.159> body<00:01:47.310> centered<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.810> means<00:01:49.020> your<00:01:49.170> body

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the body centered just means your body

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.169 
the body centered just means your body
doesn't<00:01:49.590> actually<00:01:49.799> refer<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:50.819> he<00:01:50.909> doesn't

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
doesn't actually refer but he doesn't

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.359 
doesn't actually refer but he doesn't
actually<00:01:51.270> move<00:01:51.569> too<00:01:51.840> much<00:01:52.049> moving<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.159> body

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
actually move too much moving the body

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.210 
actually move too much moving the body
the<00:01:54.119> bike<00:01:54.329> from<00:01:54.569> side<00:01:54.749> to<00:01:54.780> side<00:01:54.990> keep

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
the bike from side to side keep

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.610 
the bike from side to side keep
body<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:57.330> a<00:01:57.420> center<00:01:57.810> position<00:01:58.290> which<00:01:58.410> means

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
body in a center position which means

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.720 
body in a center position which means
it's<00:01:58.860> balanced<00:02:00.650> you're<00:02:01.650> leaning<00:02:01.830> in<00:02:02.130> policy

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
it's balanced you're leaning in policy

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.580 
it's balanced you're leaning in policy
lean<00:02:03.090> your<00:02:03.240> head<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.810> returning<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.350> slow

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
lean your head in and returning at slow

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950 
lean your head in and returning at slow
speed<00:02:04.950> you're<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.060> lose<00:02:06.750> your<00:02:06.930> balance

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
speed you're going to lose your balance

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.859 
speed you're going to lose your balance
and<00:02:07.410> stability<00:02:08.450> we'll<00:02:09.450> see<00:02:09.600> this<00:02:09.720> is

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and stability we'll see this is

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.180 
and stability we'll see this is
different<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:10.229> you're<00:02:10.350> going<00:02:10.470> fast<00:02:10.740> you've

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
different when you're going fast you've

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.650 
different when you're going fast you've
got<00:02:11.310> berm<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.910> lean<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.480> bite

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
got berm you can lean in with a bite

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.530 
got berm you can lean in with a bite
you've<00:02:12.840> got<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.080> speed<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:14.280> hold<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:15.390> that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
you've got the speed to hold you in that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.990 
you've got the speed to hold you in that
position<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.140> slow<00:02:16.410> riding<00:02:16.910> keeping<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
position but slow riding keeping the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.600 
position but slow riding keeping the
body<00:02:18.180> centered<00:02:18.720> low<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> bike<00:02:19.800> as<00:02:20.040> well<00:02:20.070> so

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
body centered low on the bike as well so

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.490 
body centered low on the bike as well so
obviously<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.940> lot<00:02:20.970> easier<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.570> balance<00:02:22.350> when

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
obviously a lot easier to balance when

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.810 
obviously a lot easier to balance when
you're<00:02:22.650> low<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.070> bike<00:02:23.280> your<00:02:23.460> knees<00:02:23.640> are

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
you're low on the bike your knees are

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.090 
you're low on the bike your knees are
bent<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.720> these<00:02:24.870> are<00:02:25.050> ready<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.440> absorb

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
bent and these are ready to absorb

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.990 
bent and these are ready to absorb
anything<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.820> always<00:02:27.660> say<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.910> don't<00:02:29.910> keep

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
anything I always say you don't keep

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.370 
anything I always say you don't keep
your<00:02:30.060> weight<00:02:30.300> over<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.660> back<00:02:30.840> end<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:31.230> well

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
your weight over the back end as well

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.920 
your weight over the back end as well
rear<00:02:31.650> tire<00:02:32.340> pushing<00:02:32.850> in<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.180> grip<00:02:33.420> you're

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
rear tire pushing in for grip you're

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.370 
rear tire pushing in for grip you're
leaning<00:02:34.470> back<00:02:35.600> suspensions<00:02:36.600> compress

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
leaning back suspensions compress

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.780 
leaning back suspensions compress
slightly<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.250> grip<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.550> little

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
slightly and it's going to grip a little

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.850 
slightly and it's going to grip a little
bit<00:02:38.940> from<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> front<00:02:39.990> ends<00:02:40.230> nice<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> light

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
bit from the front ends nice and light

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.400 
bit from the front ends nice and light
so<00:02:41.180> when<00:02:42.180> we<00:02:42.270> you're<00:02:42.540> doing<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.170> flat

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
so when we you're doing this on the flat

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.050 
so when we you're doing this on the flat
you<00:02:43.709> can<00:02:43.860> obviously<00:02:44.100> get<00:02:44.340> away<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.700> making<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
you can obviously get away of making a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.760 
you can obviously get away of making a
lot<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.209> mistakes<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.530> an<00:02:46.620> easy

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
lot of mistakes and you it's an easy

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.070 
lot of mistakes and you it's an easy
exercise<00:02:47.160> just<00:02:47.580> doing<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.910> buter<00:02:48.300> no<00:02:48.600> problem

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
exercise just doing the buter no problem

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.680 
exercise just doing the buter no problem
but<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.500> start<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.220> do<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:51.240> some<00:02:51.510> loose

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
but you start to do this in some loose

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.070 
but you start to do this in some loose
rocks<00:02:51.840> or<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.590> bit<00:02:52.980> slippery<00:02:53.840> techniques<00:02:54.840> gonna

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
rocks or a bit slippery techniques gonna

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.380 
rocks or a bit slippery techniques gonna
have<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.350> be<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> lot<00:02:55.680> better<00:02:55.860> any<00:02:56.280> mistakes<00:02:56.730> you

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
have to be a lot better any mistakes you

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.990 
have to be a lot better any mistakes you
start<00:02:58.080> dabbing<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.890> fighting<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.459> bike<00:02:59.640> so

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
start dabbing and fighting the bike so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.509 
start dabbing and fighting the bike so
more<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.140> perfect<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.280> flat

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
more we can perfect it and the flat

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.780 
more we can perfect it and the flat
ground<00:03:02.900> better<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.170> going<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.380> be<00:03:04.500> later<00:03:04.709> on

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
ground better it's going to be later on

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.220 
ground better it's going to be later on
so<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:08.140> about<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.440> I'll<00:03:09.570> just<00:03:10.570> do<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.780> little

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
so that's about it I'll just do a little

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.350 
so that's about it I'll just do a little
demonstration<00:03:11.530> just<00:03:14.880> trying<00:03:15.880> I'm

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
demonstration just trying I'm

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.510 
demonstration just trying I'm
demonstrating<00:03:16.690> something<00:03:17.320> this<00:03:17.530> time<00:03:17.830> listen

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
demonstrating something this time listen

00:03:18.520 --> 00:04:16.670 
demonstrating something this time listen
to<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.730> engine<00:03:19.060> note<00:03:19.800> position<00:03:20.800> on<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.010> boy

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.319 

so<00:04:17.680> not<00:04:18.340> really<00:04:18.370> important<00:04:19.030> thing<00:04:19.209> to

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
so not really important thing to

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.650 
so not really important thing to
remember<00:04:19.420> is<00:04:20.940> one<00:04:21.940> finger<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.420> front

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
remember is one finger on the front

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.410 
remember is one finger on the front
brake<00:04:22.840> as<00:04:23.080> well<00:04:23.260> obviously<00:04:24.060> when<00:04:25.060> you<00:04:25.150> in

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
brake as well obviously when you in

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.790 
brake as well obviously when you in
general<00:04:25.750> riding<00:04:26.110> your<00:04:26.230> on<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.440> off<00:04:26.500> with<00:04:26.740> the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
general riding your on and off with the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.620 
general riding your on and off with the
front<00:04:26.950> brake<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.520> you're<00:04:27.670> not<00:04:27.790> getting<00:04:28.540> it

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
front brake so you're not getting it

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.360 
front brake so you're not getting it
covered<00:04:28.810> all<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.140> time<00:04:29.320> but<00:04:29.590> on<00:04:29.800> this

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
covered all the time but on this

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.240 
covered all the time but on this
exercise<00:04:30.670> it's<00:04:31.120> good<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.680> get<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.830> extra<00:04:33.040> bit

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
exercise it's good to get that extra bit

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.590 
exercise it's good to get that extra bit
of<00:04:33.310> control<00:04:33.730> with<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.910> front<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.420> rear

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
of control with the front and the rear

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.840 
of control with the front and the rear
brake<00:04:34.900> because<00:04:35.620> when<00:04:36.130> you're<00:04:36.250> riding<00:04:36.400> slow

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
brake because when you're riding slow

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.340 
brake because when you're riding slow
for<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.150> technical<00:04:37.630> stuff<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.930> need<00:04:38.080> all<00:04:38.200> the

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
for the technical stuff you need all the

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.010 
for the technical stuff you need all the
controls<00:04:38.830> just<00:04:39.730> to<00:04:39.910> balance<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.480> get<00:04:40.780> control

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
controls just to balance and get control

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.920 
controls just to balance and get control
of<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.410> bike<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:41.590> slow<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.190> right<00:04:42.370> down<00:04:42.610> I

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
of the bike and slow it right down I

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.390 
of the bike and slow it right down I
think<00:04:43.930> that's<00:04:44.140> probably<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.470> most<00:04:44.680> common

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
think that's probably the most common

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.720 
think that's probably the most common
mistake<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.760> C's<00:04:46.090> slow<00:04:46.840> riding<00:04:47.290> going<00:04:48.220> too<00:04:48.430> fast

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
mistake a C's slow riding going too fast

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.820 
mistake a C's slow riding going too fast
you<00:04:49.030> haven't<00:04:49.240> got<00:04:49.330> time<00:04:49.540> to<00:04:49.600> think<00:04:49.780> and<00:04:50.170> got

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
you haven't got time to think and got

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.250 
you haven't got time to think and got
time<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.250> use<00:04:51.400> your<00:04:51.490> suspension<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:52.420> first

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
time to use your suspension so first

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.560 
time to use your suspension so first
thing<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.620> do<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:53.950> get<00:04:54.640> control<00:04:54.850> of<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.330> clutch

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
thing to do is get control of the clutch

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.170 
thing to do is get control of the clutch
and<00:04:55.990> slow<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.440> bike<00:04:56.620> right<00:04:56.860> down<00:04:57.130> and<00:04:57.970> get

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
and slow the bike right down and get

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.920 
and slow the bike right down and get
nice<00:04:58.480> smooth<00:04:59.380> turning<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.070> flow<00:05:00.750> so<00:05:01.750> it's<00:05:01.870> a

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
nice smooth turning the flow so it's a

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:20.589 
nice smooth turning the flow so it's a
nice<00:05:02.080> area<00:05:02.350> here<00:05:02.880> nice<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.150> soft

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.659 

you
