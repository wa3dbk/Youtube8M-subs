00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.309
 so hello everyone guys attached such 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:23.390
 interesting thing for fishing 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:23.390
 wireless sonar box 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.720
 and let's see what we have inside 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:50.770
 so it turns out goes us sensor itself 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:56.879
 the ship is here at the stub 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.879
 and a battery is inserted in the middle 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 pill 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 there are two mounting holes for yourself 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 adapter some 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.870
 the body itself is rubberized 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:51.039
 He is trying to have 4 batteries microphone 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:57.390
 here we have a rubber strip about 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.390
 moisture he so he is not afraid of moisture 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:10.780
 so with this antenna it will take 50 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:18.099
 meters to T-shirt 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:25.260
 And if you buy a big antenna, then what 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:25.260
 there will be a meter for 300 taking let's turn on 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.680
 So 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.130
 the first menu here we choose to run 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:45.290
 or is there still had to choose 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:50.580
 demarin now he is trying to contact 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.920
 our sensor does not work the sensor without 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.320
 water does not work when it is already water 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.040
 hits then closes us up such two 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:05.490
 contact with water and it then turns on 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:08.900
 how mad does not work yet so what have 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.200
 we are backlight settings 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.320
 can turn the backlight on or off 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.810
 farther 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.900
 sensitivity is set to big less 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:28.010
 next is the auto depth range of 5 meters 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:36.330
 10 situation thirty-forty increase 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:41.450
 increase no 5 10 20 30 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.450
 signal when i and j 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.330
 finale of fish meaning he can not 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.750
 skip fish can skip big 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.510
 fish may show small or 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.440
 image fish itself does not show 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:04.180
 fish image or skip speed 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.360
 processing speed and selection 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.360
 language 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.390
 depth and temperature 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.390
 celsius 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:25.620
 depth unit can be measured and not 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.620
 temperature 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.240
 trucks now let's turn on where on 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.240
 mode look 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:56.810
 we see in the upper left corner with us 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:05:03.410
 the first goes to chapter 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:07.150
 lower temperature goes right now no 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:12.169
 I can go indicator battery charge indicator 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:15.770
 sensitivity indicator is slightly lower 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:20.900
 we have the upper scale 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:24.470
 line of surface one down at the very 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:30.710
 bottom left connection display 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:32.740
 echo sounder and lower right bottom 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:43.759
 scale level 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:46.479
 Here we see our fish relief depth 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.479
 how is changing
