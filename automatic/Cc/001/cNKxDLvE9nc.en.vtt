story

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.919 
story
the<00:02:07.399> engine<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.759> twice<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.209> size<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.750> real

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
the engine is twice the size of the real

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.320 
the engine is twice the size of the real
engine<00:02:09.429> did<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.520> by<00:02:10.610> basically<00:02:10.789> stripping

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
engine did it by basically stripping

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.630 
engine did it by basically stripping
down<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.840> real<00:02:12.050> engine<00:02:12.489> measuring<00:02:13.489> all<00:02:13.610> the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
down the real engine measuring all the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.000 
down the real engine measuring all the
component<00:02:14.239> parts<00:02:14.450> for<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> twice<00:02:15.440> up<00:02:15.620> engines

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
component parts for the twice up engines

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.830 
component parts for the twice up engines
are<00:02:16.129> basically<00:02:16.489> just<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.879> moving<00:02:17.120> internals

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
are basically just the moving internals

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.780 
are basically just the moving internals
and<00:02:18.019> then<00:02:18.230> recreating<00:02:18.860> them<00:02:19.160> in<00:02:19.280> perspex

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and then recreating them in perspex

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.210 
and then recreating them in perspex
using<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.420> variety<00:02:20.599> of<00:02:20.840> machines<00:02:21.530> which<00:02:21.860> patent

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
using a variety of machines which patent

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.850 
using a variety of machines which patent
couple<00:02:22.519> parts<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.269> then<00:02:23.480> they

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
couple parts and then they

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.040 
couple parts and then they
bonded<00:02:24.280> together<00:02:24.400> with<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.760> special<00:02:25.000> UV<00:02:25.540> loop

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
bonded together with a special UV loop

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.860 
bonded together with a special UV loop
because<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.100> all<00:02:27.700> perspex<00:02:28.390> running<00:02:28.720> on

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
because it's all perspex running on

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.080 
because it's all perspex running on
perspex<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.590> has<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.860> be<00:02:29.950> reasonably<00:02:30.580> precise

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
perspex it has to be reasonably precise

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.030 
perspex it has to be reasonably precise
but<00:02:31.480> just<00:02:31.960> with<00:02:32.140> enough<00:02:32.380> place<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.860> doesn't

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
but just with enough place that doesn't

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.910 
but just with enough place that doesn't
all<00:02:33.190> seize<00:02:33.460> up<00:02:34.080> most<00:02:35.080> people<00:02:35.170> think<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.710> oil

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
all seize up most people think the oil

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.340 
all seize up most people think the oil
just<00:02:36.070> sits<00:02:36.280> in<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.520> bottom<00:02:36.670> sump<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:38.200> then

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
just sits in the bottom sump and then

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.750 
just sits in the bottom sump and then
just<00:02:38.560> splashes<00:02:38.890> around<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.220> engine<00:02:39.520> but<00:02:39.610> what

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
just splashes around the engine but what

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.190 
just splashes around the engine but what
you<00:02:39.880> see<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.270> just<00:02:40.480> leave<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.750> oil<00:02:40.780> move

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
you see it just leave the oil move

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.560 
you see it just leave the oil move
