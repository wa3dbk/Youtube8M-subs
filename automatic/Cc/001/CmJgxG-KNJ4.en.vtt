00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
of the bits is getting dull but once we

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.259 
of the bits is getting dull but once we
get<00:00:19.920> these<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.539> it'll<00:00:22.760> cover<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.090> up

get these in here it'll cover that up
you<00:00:24.480> won't<00:00:24.630> see<00:00:24.990> any<00:00:25.500> irregularities<00:00:26.400> in

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
you won't see any irregularities in

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.819 
you won't see any irregularities in
there<00:00:28.220> they're<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.340> nice<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.760> smooth

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.470 

sometimes<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:35.100> they're<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:36.630> bit<00:00:36.899> looser

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
sometimes if they're a little bit looser

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.799 
sometimes if they're a little bit looser
one<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> secrets<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.820> if<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.530> have<00:00:43.530> it

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
one of the secrets is is if you have it

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.369 
one of the secrets is is if you have it
get<00:00:45.809> them<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.430> right<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.020> you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.200> take

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
get them all in right and you can take

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.459 
get them all in right and you can take
something<00:00:51.620> when<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.739> flip<00:00:53.010> them<00:00:54.110> if<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.260> keep

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
something when you flip them if you keep

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.600 
something when you flip them if you keep
them<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.710> falling<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.520> have

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
them from falling out if you have

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.580 
them from falling out if you have
trouble<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.180> falling<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:57.690> that's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
trouble with them falling out that's

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.619 
trouble with them falling out that's
about<00:00:58.890> done<00:00:59.160> anyway<00:01:01.520> but<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
about done anyway but this is you the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.350 
about done anyway but this is you the
one<00:01:03.809> side<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.470> long<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> got<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.280> here<00:01:05.489> at

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
one side as long as it got them here at

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.999 
one side as long as it got them here at
my<00:01:06.600> regular<00:01:06.810> hammer<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> move<00:01:14.250> this

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
my regular hammer and now I move this

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:28.210 
my regular hammer and now I move this
the<00:01:17.270> camera<00:01:18.270> over<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:18.900> not

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.210 

ok<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:30.210> we're<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.200> try<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:32.040> have

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
ok now we're going to try this I have

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.600 
ok now we're going to try this I have
only<00:01:32.400> used<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.940> about<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.600> once<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.430> not<00:01:35.430> as

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
only used this about like once so not as

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.700 
only used this about like once so not as
familiar<00:01:35.910> with<00:01:36.300> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.870> a<00:01:36.900> newer<00:01:37.770> tool<00:01:39.710> but

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
familiar with this is a newer tool but

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
familiar with this is a newer tool but
what<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.450> it's<00:01:42.450> got<00:01:43.400> all<00:01:44.400> these<00:01:44.850> different

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
what it is it's got all these different

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.920 
what it is it's got all these different
bits<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:46.560> all<00:01:46.800> different<00:01:46.980> sizes<00:01:47.370> and<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:48.630> picked

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
bits of all different sizes and I picked

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.670 
bits of all different sizes and I picked
the<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.710> remember<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.580> one<00:01:50.880> tends<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
the one I do remember this one tends to

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.430 
the one I do remember this one tends to
it<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:53.910> it's<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.300> of<00:01:54.390> got<00:01:55.320> that

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
it up you can see it's kind of got that

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.910 
it up you can see it's kind of got that
curve<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.140> ends<00:01:58.410> up<00:01:58.619> wider

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
curve like this and so it ends up wider

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.560 
curve like this and so it ends up wider
than<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.400> think<00:01:59.580> it's<00:01:59.790> going<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:02.570> then

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
than you think it's going to be so then

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.060 
than you think it's going to be so then
I<00:02:04.340> marked<00:02:05.340> these<00:02:05.550> in<00:02:06.290> fact<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.470> actually<00:02:07.680> went

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
I marked these in fact I actually went

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.590 
I marked these in fact I actually went
like<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.700> murmur<00:02:11.940> yeah<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.450> can

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
see if this works easier should come

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.160 
see if this works easier should come
right<00:02:25.950> through<00:02:26.310> oh<00:02:26.580> my<00:02:26.850> gosh<00:02:27.380> yeah<00:02:28.430> ok<00:02:30.170> this

that<00:02:57.540> when<00:02:57.689> you<00:02:57.780> get<00:02:58.019> quite<00:02:58.319> through<00:02:58.650> I<00:03:02.510> worked

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
that when you get quite through I worked

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:13.330 
that when you get quite through I worked
well<00:03:04.939> let's<00:03:05.939> see<00:03:07.220> they're<00:03:08.220> fairly<00:03:08.609> snug

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.160 

I<00:03:13.459> don't<00:03:14.030> think<00:03:14.090> they'll<00:03:14.450> fall<00:03:14.690> out<00:03:14.930> return

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
I don't think they'll fall out return

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.680 
I don't think they'll fall out return
yep<00:03:18.069> I<00:03:18.250> could<00:03:18.490> smoke<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:21.239> they<00:03:22.239> have<00:03:22.270> these

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
yep I could smoke and they have these

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.430 
yep I could smoke and they have these
come<00:03:22.989> different<00:03:23.560> um<00:03:25.020> there's<00:03:26.020> different

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
come different um there's different

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.770 
come different um there's different
kinds<00:03:26.520> in<00:03:27.520> all<00:03:27.670> different<00:03:27.970> shapes<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.569> stuff

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
kinds in all different shapes and stuff

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.940 
kinds in all different shapes and stuff
but<00:03:28.959> basically<00:03:29.470> they're<00:03:31.080> just<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.290> spread<00:03:32.770> it

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
but basically they're just to spread it

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:43.520 
but basically they're just to spread it
out<00:03:33.069> on<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.430> other<00:03:33.520> side<00:03:41.730> these<00:03:42.730> bigger<00:03:43.030> ones

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
out on the other side these bigger ones

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.699 
out on the other side these bigger ones
we<00:03:44.530> could<00:03:44.769> really<00:03:45.190> see<00:03:45.459> how<00:03:45.640> they<00:03:45.850> split<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
we could really see how they split the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:04:04.850 
we could really see how they split the
backside<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.489> Iowa<00:03:57.750> there<00:03:58.750> we<00:03:58.989> go<00:04:00.000> now<00:04:01.000> and

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.840 

this<00:04:05.860> would<00:04:06.190> be<00:04:08.069> what<00:04:09.069> they<00:04:09.280> would<00:04:09.459> look<00:04:09.610> like

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
this would be what they would look like

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.820 
this would be what they would look like
and<00:04:10.299> this<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.540> all<00:04:10.810> from<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.080> one<00:04:11.440> sheet<00:04:11.799> of

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
and this is all from that one sheet of

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.340 
and this is all from that one sheet of
paper<00:04:12.100> that<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:14.340> picked<00:04:15.340> out<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:16.840> wasn't

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
paper that you picked out and I wasn't

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.199 
paper that you picked out and I wasn't
really<00:04:17.500> sure<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:18.010> wanted<00:04:18.579> to<00:04:18.669> hear<00:04:18.880> from<00:04:19.030> you

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
really sure I wanted to hear from you

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.840 
really sure I wanted to hear from you
before<00:04:19.389> i<00:04:19.900> actually<00:04:20.260> used<00:04:20.889> your<00:04:21.250> paper<00:04:21.579> in

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
before i actually used your paper in

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.400 
before i actually used your paper in
here<00:04:22.120> because<00:04:22.479> i<00:04:22.600> can<00:04:22.750> always<00:04:22.900> use<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.260> for

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
here because i can always use it for

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.180 
here because i can always use it for
something<00:04:23.560> else<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:25.330> didn't<00:04:26.050> know<00:04:26.110> if<00:04:26.289> if<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.979> got

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
something else I didn't know if if I got

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.090 
something else I didn't know if if I got
too<00:04:27.580> wild<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.120> crazy'<00:04:28.590> keep<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.800> know<00:04:29.919> not

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
too wild and crazy' keep you know not

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.250 
too wild and crazy' keep you know not
having<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.580> like<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.060> plain<00:04:31.479> color<00:04:31.810> on<00:04:32.110> the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
having a like a plain color on the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.940 
having a like a plain color on the
inside<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:34.090> either<00:04:34.840> one<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.140> these<00:04:35.410> can<00:04:35.770> be

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
inside so and either one of these can be

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.760 
inside so and either one of these can be
the<00:04:36.130> cover<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.450> guess<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.840> just<00:04:37.870> arbitrarily

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
the cover and I guess I just arbitrarily

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.659 
the cover and I guess I just arbitrarily
picked<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.400> dark<00:04:39.669> to<00:04:40.030> be<00:04:40.180> at<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.510> base<00:04:40.720> of<00:04:41.669> it

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
picked the dark to be at the base of it

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.640 
picked the dark to be at the base of it
and<00:04:42.880> like<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.360> say<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:43.720> can<00:04:44.020> either<00:04:44.140> use<00:04:44.289> it

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
and like I say you can either use it

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.940 
and like I say you can either use it
this<00:04:44.979> way<00:04:45.280> you'll<00:04:46.150> be<00:04:46.180> or<00:04:46.570> this<00:04:47.169> way<00:04:47.470> whichever

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
this way you'll be or this way whichever

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.930 
this way you'll be or this way whichever
way<00:04:48.600> so<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.900> will<00:04:50.260> wait<00:04:50.890> until<00:04:51.039> I<00:04:51.400> hear<00:04:51.669> from<00:04:51.700> you

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
way so I will wait until I hear from you

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.740 
way so I will wait until I hear from you
before<00:04:54.940> I<00:04:55.539> I<00:04:55.930> actually<00:04:56.229> so<00:04:56.590> anything<00:04:57.039> together

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
before I I actually so anything together

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.340 
before I I actually so anything together
so<00:04:58.750> alrighty<00:04:59.440> there<00:05:00.070> we<00:05:00.220> go
