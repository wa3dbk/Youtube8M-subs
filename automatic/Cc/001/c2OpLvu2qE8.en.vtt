00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.340
 hello people today i want one 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.450
 lentil stew to prepare 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.200
 for that we need lentils root vegetables 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.859
 potatoes 2 ham crackers something 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.859
 away 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.480
 my key shell 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.989
 and a big pot to prepare 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:54.839
 First , I was the bacon in 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:01:06.050
 rustic slices so next 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:06.050
 the onions are fried 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:17.729
 Subsequently, the root vegetables 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:21.450
 virtually everything that processes 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.210
 be rusted now just the time 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.780
 potatoes into bite-sized pieces 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:39.079
 cut and then it can be the same 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:44.009
 start roasting so all sist 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:47.659
 prepared small and we can 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.659
 start with the saute 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.009
 first the bacon 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:09.830
 which should be slightly crunchy 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.390
 That's why we start with them first 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.610
 The bacon is already a bit clear 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.610
 So the nation 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.830
 but they should not burn 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:34.190
 Of course, the rest are 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.190
 root vegetables 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.170
 also the potatoes 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.820
 after the root vegetables and the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.310
 potatoes are so sauteed 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.970
 Let's erase the whole thing with my trainer 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.620
 I can do the following in advance of the lenses 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.420
 I say yesterday afternoon 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.830
 started to give way to the one 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.030
 even though they said they were 45 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:17.200
 minutes of cooking obviously also 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:22.140
 not but then I do not leave me 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.140
 on it so the pot is full 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:33.250
 Now comes the rest of the napoleon 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:38.110
 or rather concrete monkeys with it 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:42.750
 I'll pour some of it first 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.750
 Add water to the lenses 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:54.790
 almost enough 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:57.519
 in case means though salt 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.370
 not so much because the bacon 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.550
 even bring some salt that is 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.550
 Well 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.260
 yes, that was the whole thing 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:23.030
 Let's now see 30 35 40 times 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.910
 simmer for a few minutes and then we taste it 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.650
 and then that's it 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:36.560
 Lentil Stew the easy now 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:42.250
 20 25 minutes ago now comes 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:45.260
 our crackers take only one 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.830
 I do not want that then that 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.410
 second time it's the second fish too 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.840
 cut and the shilling can now 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:05:02.540
 also from the Bible if you fit 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:05.080
 and now after 20 25 minutes then should 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.080
 to finish it 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:16.130
 a wonderful consistency of a 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:19.340
 That's not too much 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:22.360
 lens in the pot but not too much 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.360
 water out
