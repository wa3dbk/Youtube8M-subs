00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.850 

today<00:00:00.989> we're<00:00:01.199> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.439> learn<00:00:01.560> how<00:00:01.829> to

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
today we're going to learn how to

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.450 
today we're going to learn how to
daisy-chain<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.850> climbing<00:00:03.810> rope<00:00:04.069> now<00:00:05.100> daisy

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
daisy-chain a climbing rope now daisy

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.700 
daisy-chain a climbing rope now daisy
chain<00:00:05.730> climbing<00:00:06.210> rope<00:00:06.390> will<00:00:07.170> put<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.529> two

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
chain climbing rope will put the two

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.150 
chain climbing rope will put the two
ends<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.670> rope<00:00:08.849> together<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.860> then<00:00:10.860> we'll

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
ends of the rope together and then we'll

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.259 
ends of the rope together and then we'll
just<00:00:12.349> run<00:00:13.349> our<00:00:13.530> hands<00:00:13.769> along<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.940> full<00:00:15.240> length

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
just run our hands along the full length

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.710 
just run our hands along the full length
of<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> rope

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
of the rope

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.849 
of the rope
keeping<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:19.680> end<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.220> our<00:00:20.400> hand

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
keeping one end in our hand

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.820 
keeping one end in our hand
so<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.010> get<00:00:23.160> some<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:24.380> might<00:00:25.380> take<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> little

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
so we get some in might take a little

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.780 
so we get some in might take a little
while<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.349> know<00:00:31.470> how<00:00:31.740> long<00:00:32.040> your

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
while and you know how long your

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.260 
while and you know how long your
climbing<00:00:33.210> rock<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:34.190> here<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.340> right<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
climbing rock is here we go right the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.000 
climbing rock is here we go right the
end<00:00:36.860> now<00:00:37.860> we've<00:00:38.190> got<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.520> looped<00:00:39.239> end<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:40.800> two

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
end now we've got the looped end the two

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.900 
end now we've got the looped end the two
friends<00:00:41.460> we'll<00:00:41.760> put<00:00:41.969> them<00:00:42.120> together<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
friends we'll put them together and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.720 
friends we'll put them together and
we'll<00:00:44.910> tie<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:48.260> simple<00:00:49.260> noose<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:51.149> very<00:00:51.360> end

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
we'll tie a simple noose on the very end

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.689 
we'll tie a simple noose on the very end
climb<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:54.770> then<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:58.699> put

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
climb on then all we have to do is put

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.889 
climb on then all we have to do is put
our<00:00:59.850> hand<00:01:00.090> through<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.359> loop<00:01:02.780> grab<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
our hand through that loop grab the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.330 
our hand through that loop grab the
standing<00:01:04.830> part<00:01:05.240> the<00:01:06.240> rest<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.570> our<00:01:07.340> pull

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
standing part the rest of our pull

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.399 
standing part the rest of our pull
through

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
through

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.130

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
new loops that in-crowd and pull broke

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.740 
new loops that in-crowd and pull broke
until<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.640> get<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> end

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.550 

almost<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:41.150> then<00:01:42.150> when<00:01:43.050> you<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.470> the

almost there then when you get to the
end<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.980> rope<00:01:45.080> you<00:01:46.080> just<00:01:46.500> pull<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
end of the rope you just pull the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.570 
end of the rope you just pull the
remaining<00:01:47.480> all<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.630> way<00:01:48.720> through<00:01:49.520> now<00:01:50.520> you

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
remaining all the way through now you

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.360 
remaining all the way through now you
have<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.000> complete<00:01:51.450> climb<00:01:52.440> line<00:01:53.030> or<00:01:54.860> nice<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
have you complete climb line or nice and

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.490 
have you complete climb line or nice and
compact<00:01:57.590> now<00:01:58.590> done<00:01:59.250> do<00:02:00.020> your<00:02:01.020> climbing<00:02:01.350> rope

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
compact now done do your climbing rope

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.040 
compact now done do your climbing rope
again<00:02:01.620> all<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.150> pull<00:02:03.600> from

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
again all you have to do is pull from

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.210 
again all you have to do is pull from
the<00:02:04.200> end<00:02:05.090> pull<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.210> through<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.600> loop<00:02:07.220> and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the end pull it through that loop and

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.820 
the end pull it through that loop and
then<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.840> whole<00:02:10.020> thing<00:02:10.260> just<00:02:10.590> falls<00:02:11.580> apart
