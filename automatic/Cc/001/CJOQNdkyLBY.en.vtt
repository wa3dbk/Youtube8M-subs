 next black sesame and white sesame 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.660
 general prescription 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.760
 White sesame is needed but because 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.649
 the market simply did not have white 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.719
 bought a black-black by the way who does not know 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.430
 it is considered as unpolished 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.070
 his illness begins a little with 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 bitter but he is healthier so if not 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.730
 White is safe to buy it black 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.219
 yes that's water and salt, in principle, a recipe 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.469
 very simple 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.239
 I first learned about this soup on 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.260
 picnic tips which was held under 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.809

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.090
 liked this recipe i remembered and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.659
 I cook from time to time I mean he 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.549
 quite piquant and nourishing and so 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.580
 here's an interesting taste therefore from 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.890
 I recommend you try so 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.280
 let's begin that is all resets advisers 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.869
 usually cooked very quickly that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.759
 there is if here you are ready 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.920
 ingredients are prepared in principle 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.810
 five to ten minutes and you have a ready dish 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.939
 that is, it is incomparable with what you 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.420
 need something here on the stove shaitan guy 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.159
 all quick dishes are always clean 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.869
 as there is no fat just 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.270
 enough under water and rinse and 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.150
 clean dishes as a result you save your 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.220

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.380
 let's start with us 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.159
 blender we have such a bender 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.229
 it means we are now 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:06.319
 mass carrot and and cut into more 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:08.810
 shallower smaller happiness carrot 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.870
 by the way who doesn't know carrots on 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.879
 cut she looks like a pupil 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.230
 here look my doctor okinawa carrot 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:20.769
 It seems like hour is useful for 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.489
 the eye is all that resembles 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.220
 physiological some part of the body 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.849
 exactly useful for this part of the body then 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.989
 have it here 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:32.750
 people noticed the wise and so she 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.970
 there is for example a walnut in the middle 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.480
 reminds gyrus brain useful for 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.690
 brain 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.209
 a persimmon speaking for the heart is useful tomatoes 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.640

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.319
 remembering the demand immediately and do not remember 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.379
 all but about Kerch we were joking 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.810

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.799
 a joke so here's a carrot means mode 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.269
 just like these cubes if powerful 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.660
 blender can not bother too much 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:06.319
 There trim when on whale large parts 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.380
 cut another moment in their 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.680
 recipes I basically never fail 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.870
 weigh in and if i watch this recipe poison 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.030
 well in ignoring there literacy in 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.590
 principle I do everything on the eye that is 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.419
 the main thing to highlight some major 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.220
 ingredient that is in our recipe 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.769
 main ingredients this carrot and 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.109
 sesame and ingredient and auxiliary 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.359
 then the cashew that is the principle of the eye here 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.630
 so here we are putting Bender later 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.489
 just try again, beat and that's that 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.889
 what is missing we taste add something 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.980
 there is some kind of clear there 200 grams of that 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.150
 200 grams of that one thousand I will not give it 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.720
 have I leave you the opportunity for 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.930
 creativity for your fantasies and so here 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.970
 we put a carrot here with us 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.849
 white sesame we come here it later 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.620
 add to black sesame that is 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:03.310
 a bunch of white somewhere there was a spoon somewhere 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.280
 three tablespoons and here are the spoons three tablespoons 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.990
 add 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.540
 black sesame and add cashews 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.930
 food is desirable before being with him 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.239
 do something resident on his dunk on 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.230
 three or four hours you can at night just in 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.230
 cold clear water 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.350
 so that he swelled a little and lived but we 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:27.340
 there was no such possibility therefore we 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:31.170
 fall asleep in such three tablespoons 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:36.160
 Fall asleep in such a form as it is and 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:39.910
 add water as you know beginner 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.280
 sarah food is very important to drink water despite 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.090
 the fact that the diet ration environment consists 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.560
 from fruits to vegetables per day comes to three 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.830
 four pounds of fresh fruit vegetables 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.510
 which are 90 percent water 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.400
 nonetheless began to 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.250
 dilute lymph to accelerate 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.870
 toxin withdrawal 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.190
 I recommend all the same 5 per day 2 liters 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.050
 clean water between food intervals 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.910
 drink a glass of water drink for 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.120
 half an hour before the start and before and after meals 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.590
 water an hour not to drink that is between 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.480
 intervals of drinking water we drink and so 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.680
 here we have everything ready you can add 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:20.220
 here is a little pink and the same 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.870
 Himalayan salt it to taste such 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.080
 boiled egg smell and taste 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.330
 slightly boiled egg 3 salt principle 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.400
 you can add a little bit like a 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:35.740
 spoon tip 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.770
 so proceed close and paste into 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:43.260
 blender with a recipe as you see very 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.260

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.080
 continue to beat
