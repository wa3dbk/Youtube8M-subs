00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
going to roll it out into a coil so this

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.040 
going to roll it out into a coil so this
is<00:00:08.400> going<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.730> become<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.330> spout<00:00:09.690> I'm<00:00:09.929> just

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
is going to become the spout I'm just

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:31.339 
is going to become the spout I'm just
going<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.260> go<00:00:10.349> up<00:00:10.410> there<00:00:10.650> like<00:00:10.830> that

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
so I'm trying to get it fairly round a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:45.299 
so I'm trying to get it fairly round a
big<00:00:34.290> fat<00:00:34.559> round<00:00:34.800> coil

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.819 

and<00:00:45.910> I'm<00:00:46.030> gonna<00:00:46.120> take<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.570> down<00:00:46.600> again<00:00:47.230> there's

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
and I'm gonna take it down again there's

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.579 
and I'm gonna take it down again there's
a<00:00:47.890> lot<00:00:48.039> of<00:00:48.159> dowels<00:00:49.050> little<00:00:50.050> thicker<00:00:50.289> dowel

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
a lot of dowels little thicker dowel

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.069 
a lot of dowels little thicker dowel
this<00:00:50.859> time<00:00:51.269> and<00:00:52.269> then<00:00:52.390> just<00:00:52.570> push<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.899> right<00:00:53.019> up

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.469 
start a hole there and I'm gonna put a
another<00:00:57.100> hole<00:00:57.429> on<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.699> other<00:00:57.850> side<00:00:58.119> that<00:00:58.149> I

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
another hole on the other side that I

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.539 
another hole on the other side that I
hope<00:00:58.629> I<00:00:58.780> hit<00:00:59.019> so<00:00:59.890> I'm<00:00:59.979> gonna<00:01:00.100> try<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.399> go

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
hope I hit so I'm gonna try to go

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:01.619 
hope I hit so I'm gonna try to go
straight<00:01:00.879> through<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.180> middle<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.449> this

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
straight through the middle of this

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.529 
straight through the middle of this
thing<00:01:01.690> i<00:01:02.640> sharpened<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.940> dowel<00:01:04.149> a<00:01:04.180> little

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:04.539 
thing i sharpened that dowel a little

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.100 
thing i sharpened that dowel a little
bit<00:01:04.629> on<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.869> end

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.750 

so<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.890> coming<00:01:11.190> up<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.640> right<00:01:11.820> spot<00:01:13.760> now

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
so I just coming up the right spot now

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.000 
so I just coming up the right spot now
just<00:01:15.630> put<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.020> down<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.770> roll<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:18.570> I'm

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
just put this down and roll it so I'm

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.750 
just put this down and roll it so I'm
expanding<00:01:20.010> this<00:01:20.370> thing<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:25.520> can<00:01:26.520> make

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
expanding this thing out you can make

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.320 
expanding this thing out you can make
really<00:01:27.390> large<00:01:27.810> pots<00:01:28.260> doing<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.830> method<00:01:29.330> it's

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
really large pots doing this method it's

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.820 
really large pots doing this method it's
fun<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:31.410> use<00:01:31.650> bigger<00:01:31.950> dollars<00:01:32.480> to<00:01:33.480> make<00:01:33.830> huge

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
fun just use bigger dollars to make huge

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.850 
fun just use bigger dollars to make huge
pots<00:01:35.160> like<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.640> well<00:01:36.480> you<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.440> clay<00:01:37.680> will

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
pots like this well you the clay will

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.440 
pots like this well you the clay will
start<00:01:38.100> collapsing<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.760> think<00:01:38.910> it's<00:01:39.030> too<00:01:39.240> big

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
start collapsing I think it's too big

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.810 
start collapsing I think it's too big
but<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:40.500> learn<00:01:40.650> how<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> handle<00:01:41.160> it<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.610> can

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
but you learn how to handle it you can

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.780 
but you learn how to handle it you can
do<00:01:41.940> fairly<00:01:42.270> large<00:01:42.630> pots<00:01:42.900> this<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.520> said<00:01:44.520> huge

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
do fairly large pots this one said huge

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.310 
do fairly large pots this one said huge
a<00:01:44.880> second<00:01:45.240> ago<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.510> I'm<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:45.990> fairly

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
a second ago and I'm down to fairly

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.560 
a second ago and I'm down to fairly
large<00:01:46.650> so<00:01:46.979> somebody

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.960 

I'm<00:01:54.050> trying<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.440> get<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.740> thickness<00:01:55.550> of<00:01:55.729> the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
I'm trying to get the thickness of the

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.760 
I'm trying to get the thickness of the
rim<00:01:56.240> more<00:01:56.780> or<00:01:56.870> less<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.200> same<00:01:59.409> now<00:02:00.409> I<00:02:00.470> can

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
rim more or less the same now I can

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.090 
rim more or less the same now I can
shape<00:02:01.040> it<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.400> that<00:02:01.690> shape<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.870> I<00:02:02.960> want

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.220 

now<00:02:07.640> this

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.949 

maybe<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.920> little<00:02:15.069> bit<00:02:15.280> big<00:02:15.459> for<00:02:15.490> this<00:02:15.880> part

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.849 

so<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.370> shy<00:02:20.700> about<00:02:21.290> doing<00:02:22.290> things<00:02:22.439> again

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
so I'm not shy about doing things again

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.819 
so I'm not shy about doing things again
it's<00:02:23.340> it's<00:02:23.640> hard<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.879> do<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.780> know<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.079> as<00:02:25.769> a
