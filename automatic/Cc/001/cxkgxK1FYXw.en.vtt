00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
pedals that you can use to layer up

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.150 
pedals that you can use to layer up
different<00:00:32.820> parts<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.510> song<00:00:33.750> or<00:00:34.050> use<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> as

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
different parts in a song or use it as

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.069 
different parts in a song or use it as
the<00:00:35.430> main<00:00:35.610> sound<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.300> we're<00:00:36.750> going<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.930> show

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the main sound so we're going to show

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.990 
the main sound so we're going to show
you<00:00:37.110> how<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> sounds<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.920> comparison<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.489> with

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you how it sounds in comparison to with

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.610 
you how it sounds in comparison to with
it<00:00:39.090> off<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.989> then<00:00:40.110> I'm<00:00:40.200> gonna<00:00:40.350> play

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
it off and on and then I'm gonna play

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.900 
it off and on and then I'm gonna play
with<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> settings<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.370> let's<00:00:41.399> give<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
with the settings so let's give this a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:01:37.660 
with the settings so let's give this a
shot<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> pedal<00:00:43.559> off

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.190 

so<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.760> can<00:01:38.880> hear<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> modulation<00:01:39.690> effects

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so you can hear the modulation effects

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.110 
so you can hear the modulation effects
slowly<00:01:40.740> working<00:01:41.160> its<00:01:41.370> way<00:01:41.550> over<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.850> sound

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
slowly working its way over the sound

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.390 
slowly working its way over the sound
there<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:42.510> already<00:01:43.080> have<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:43.350> depth<00:01:43.620> on<00:01:43.830> about

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
there I already have the depth on about

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.950 
there I already have the depth on about
one<00:01:44.670> o'clock<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> go<00:01:45.540> ahead<00:01:45.660> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
one o'clock so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.900 
one o'clock so I'm going to go ahead and
turn<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.650> way<00:01:46.740> up<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.490> having<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
turn it all the way up so having the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.670 
turn it all the way up so having the
depth<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.480> way<00:01:48.660> up<00:01:48.870> gets<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.410> crazy

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
depth all the way up gets a little crazy

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.080 
depth all the way up gets a little crazy
but<00:01:49.830> this<00:01:50.070> will<00:01:50.280> make<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.610> effect<00:01:50.940> more

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
but this will make the effect more

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:11.210 
but this will make the effect more
prominent<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> check<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.170> out<00:02:10.220> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
prominent so you can check it out that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.740 
prominent so you can check it out that
delay<00:02:11.490> effect<00:02:11.820> you're<00:02:12.030> hearing<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.510> actually

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
delay effect you're hearing is actually

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.810 
delay effect you're hearing is actually
on<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.380> amplifier<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
on the amplifier so this is with the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.310 
on the amplifier so this is with the
delay<00:02:15.150> off<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:15.960> get<00:02:16.110> some

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
delay off just so you can get some

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.240 
delay off just so you can get some
context

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.310 

now<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.030> definitely<00:02:25.420> wouldn't<00:02:25.900> run<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.200> with

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
now I definitely wouldn't run it with

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.950 
now I definitely wouldn't run it with
that<00:02:26.500> much<00:02:26.710> depth<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:27.760> let's<00:02:28.330> go<00:02:28.480> ahead<00:02:28.600> and

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
that much depth so let's go ahead and

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.450 
that much depth so let's go ahead and
turn<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.140> back<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.680> rate<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:30.070> kind<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.310> like

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
turn it back the rate is kind of like

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.850 
turn it back the rate is kind of like
the<00:02:30.550> speed<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.090> effect<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.600> just<00:02:32.560> for

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
the speed of the effect so just for

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.340 
the speed of the effect so just for
comparison<00:02:33.790> I'm<00:02:34.210> gonna<00:02:34.450> run<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.840> all<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.080> way

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
comparison I'm gonna run it all the way

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:52.980 
comparison I'm gonna run it all the way
up<00:02:35.380> right<00:02:35.740> now<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.760> gets<00:02:51.940> pretty<00:02:52.030> crazy<00:02:52.510> all

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
up right now so it gets pretty crazy all

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.120 
up right now so it gets pretty crazy all
the<00:02:53.260> way<00:02:53.350> up<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.740> really<00:02:53.950> hear<00:02:54.070> it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
the way up you can really hear it

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.070 
the way up you can really hear it
working<00:02:54.490> so<00:02:55.030> I've<00:02:55.300> got<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.540> back<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.930> one

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
working so I've got it back to one

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:07.080 
working so I've got it back to one
o'clock<00:03:04.620> I'm<00:03:05.620> turning<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.010> rate<00:03:06.220> down<00:03:06.790> a

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
o'clock I'm turning the rate down a

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:18.410 
o'clock I'm turning the rate down a
little<00:03:07.330> bit<00:03:07.450> more<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.840> now<00:03:07.959> add<00:03:08.170> 11<00:03:08.530> o'clock

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.360 

and<00:03:19.420> we'll<00:03:20.050> turn<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.380> all<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.590> way<00:03:20.709> down<00:03:20.740> show

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
and we'll turn it all the way down show

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:45.720 
and we'll turn it all the way down show
how<00:03:21.520> slow<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:21.880> can<00:03:22.030> go

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.820 

the<00:03:46.730> risk<00:03:47.000> control<00:03:47.480> here<00:03:47.870> on<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.290> right<00:03:48.500> is

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
the risk control here on the right is

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.010 
the risk control here on the right is
the<00:03:49.100> control<00:03:49.490> that<00:03:49.700> adjusts<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.270> feedback<00:03:50.810> of

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
the control that adjusts the feedback of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.840
