00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.800
 Tcho Tcho the little wolves taskiller of 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.890
 little special with a little surprise 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.020
 so I advise you not to leave 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.110
 do not leave the screen of the eyes and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.030
 goods to listen to what I say so as 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 usually 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.910
 I always try to prepare you 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.930
 you like it so you'll like it 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.040
 here is an image that we do not have 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.329
 the habit of finally seeing me 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.089

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.470
 I saw her live and after I 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.969
 will show you how it's going 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.320
 how did I get there 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.989
 because everyone can do it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.649
 and how do we go out of the map 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.690
 in studio mode 1 of course not to see 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.339
 big thing that has to do with the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.700
 secret but but at least to see the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.950
 map 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.690
 sometimes even feel the fog 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.170

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.240

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.229
 colors rape pÃ©tantes 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.229
 it's a little bit 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.370

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.990

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.000

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.710

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.170

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.780
 I did not want to make you 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.950
 joke me too that's why 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.060

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.580

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.830

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.060
 I laugh a little bit of home 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.340

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.320
 you followed 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.060
 I showed you the way out 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.870
 of the map one once you are in 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.520
 la in the lava that is at the central 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.290
 you go along the rock in 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.420
 truck slightly to the right and in 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.810
 moving slightly you have to see some 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.209
 weird things down 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.520
 and then we can come out we can 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.739
 bring out my part either by lap or 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.170
 directly through the earth you go back 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.420
 and you will eventually find an exit 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.040
 and with a little luck you will 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.270
 will find like me with very little 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.000
 fog or not at all 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.980
 places and it allows to walk a 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.900
 little bit discover the map differently 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.099
 that in fog was saying like 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.730
 usually have made words known to 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.470
 each video 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.720
 I do what I want I will drop 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.540
 a label for new words here 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.040

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.200
 pretty cool there is no gollum ago 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.110

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.420

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.730
