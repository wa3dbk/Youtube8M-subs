00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.810 
remember hearing things about him in in
the<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:39.270> when<00:00:39.480> he<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.989> first<00:00:40.520> coming<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.670> or

get him more over but we um the the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.090 
get him more over but we um the the
decisions<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.229> were<00:01:46.320> made<00:01:46.350> were<00:01:46.649> Vince's
