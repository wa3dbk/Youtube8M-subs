00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:09.050
 today we learn to prepare a mousse of 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.910
 in fact, simple and light chocolate 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:17.660
 we will only use 120 grams of 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.920
 dark chocolate 3 fresh eggs 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:27.439
 which we will use that album i am you on 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.810
 spoon of sugar and 50 grams of 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.919
 milk chocolate or some other 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.919
 chocolate you prefer 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.690
 the preparation is very simple and 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.460
 fast but the various steps must be 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.239
 followed with precision and without 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.239
 break 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.800
 as first thing we put to dissolve a 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.510
 bain-marie dark chocolate e 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.989
 while waiting we separate the egg whites from 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:00.019
 egg yolks the egg whites can 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:04.730
 be placed directly in container 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:08.770
 which will be mounted of the three yolks 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.770
 instead we put it aside 1 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.490
 in reality the yolk is used to give 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.980
 greater consistency, the mousse therefore if 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.840
 you only have advanced egg whites maybe from 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.000
 another recipe you can use 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.980
 quietly only these so the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.980
 mousse will be even lighter 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.260
 the chocolate that we didn't melt it 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.240
 let's reduce to flakes 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.310
 or we can use nuggets already 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 ready as we have done in this case 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.240
 with white chocolate 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.259
 when the chocolate had melted 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.330
 add a tablespoon of sugar and 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:18.720
 we mix for a while while we take it off 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:21.600
 from the fire waiting for the chocolate to come 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.620
 cool a little we take the whips and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.620
 whip the egg whites 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.340
 we must be careful to stop first 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.430
 that the egg whites are completely 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.150
 mounted so we will finish mounting them in 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.150
 a second time 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.310
 back to the melted chocolate to which 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.820
 we incorporate the yolk we previously had 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.820
 put aside 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.510
 be prepared to mix a lot 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.610
 energetically because when we go to 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.040
 lie the turn in chocolate and 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.040
 compound will become very compact 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.720
 once we mix the yolk with 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.390
 the dark chocolate we add the 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.190
 all with egg whites and we continue to mount 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.540
 until we get a compound 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.700
 homogeneous and dense pay attention to 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.500
 mount for maximum minute otherwise 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.500
 the egg whites are removed 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.530
 now all we have to do is pour it all 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.180
 in a large or various base cup 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.510
 cups to be served 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.980
 individually while we are pouring the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.930
 final compound 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.299
 add the flakes the nuggets of 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.950
 chocolate that will go to give more 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.950
 consistency to our mus 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.590
 at this point we put the cup in 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.519
 fridge at least two or three hours before 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.519
 serve it in a hurry 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.419
 enjoy your meal and let us know if i 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.419
