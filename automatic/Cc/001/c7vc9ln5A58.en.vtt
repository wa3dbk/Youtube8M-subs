00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.509
 and I believe that today the prime example of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.340
 this has been and I do it 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.460
 completely different used tones that a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.009
 36 years he struggled for 95 minutes like 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.389
 lions and a half to two power plants and us 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 we follow given to believe and believe that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.869
 this for the boys we have names 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.869
 team 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.130
 must be an example to be seen 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.080
 above all to understand how she feels 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.669
 precisely the game turned after having 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.360
 started so well on the goal of 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.820
 draw when the mine a little if there is a 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.610
 a little loose here he had started a 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.930
 take some balls too many 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.129
 some counter-attacks at that time there 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.420
 the game had to be managed so 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.300
 different 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.890
 on the first corner and 2 place yes 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.280
 confirms that it was placed on 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.400
 counterattack but it was in the air yes and the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.589
 sensations were not positive 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.210
 seeing the progress the game and think again 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.100
 the parts can also be lost 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.290
 then when you play with a spirit 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.979
 different beyond tones who has it 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.170
 impressed by the Verona but had done 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.820
 a good game there have been a lot 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.820
 after the first difficulty factor 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.850
 eighty minutes for good and I repeat year 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 they deserved the victory and us instead 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.819
 we did everything to lose 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:34.890
 however, this party will start this way 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.179
 which already described sufficiently is 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.860
 worried that again 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.659
 environment taken with his kick from 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.850
 firm on head shots or it's the last one 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.640
 such problems but I believe that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.420
 be the last problems because why 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.420
 I believe that in certain situations 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.950
 the school's attitude must be 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.450
 completely different 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.700
 and normal when you have this 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.500
 attitude is also easier too 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.560
 take goals and apologize max over tones 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:14.010
 that you stayed balotelli that 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.900
 like them but I think that today he has to talk 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.090
 of the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.269
 as always, the team is not the team 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.510
 he did a good game overall 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.950
 I repeat, 15 minutes were not enough 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.040
 and they will never be enough to make gods 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.040
 results 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.540
 I always want to know according to time 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.520
 athletically inferior to the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.710
 first part of the first is a consequence 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.950
 of the spirit that says of everything a 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.360
 problem is that surely the game of 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.700
 Tuesday had a little on his legs 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.890
 we have material played after two 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.410
 months today is certainly a little bit more 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.760
 tired 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.560
 I wanted those same national ones 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.540
 that led to a little more though 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.270
 this does not mean we have to 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.470
 play a game of the normal kind 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.210
 when you play against a team that me 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.090
 starts off guard knew the 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.980
 energy expenditure is the double e 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.900
 so you didn't have to be good 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.880
 especially with one to zero to change the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.000
 reading have a better reading of the 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.000
 game
