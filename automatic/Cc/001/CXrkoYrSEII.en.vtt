00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.090
 hello friends welcome to another tuto 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.880
 Tuesday 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.820
 I am leonardo pÃ©rez grandson and today we are going 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.350
 to make a sketch of a horse in the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.350
 Beach 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.790
 we start by tracing the head the way 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.860
 general body the legs first in 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.040
 its general form and then we are giving it 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.140
 more and more detail we also make a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.989
 girl on the horse 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.530
 then with a rule we draw the line 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.949
 from the horizon 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.930
 and using the blue pencil we make 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.750
 some clouds 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.810
 to give the shadows in this case I use a 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.020
 inclined lines pattern this 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:57.010
 It can give a good atmosphere 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.400
 well now with a white pencil we give the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.680
 You can make reflections in the sea 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.520
 different intensities and with some 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.850
 points that will appear flashes and 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.940
 then with the same pencil we create light in 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.130
 the sky for this I use the same pattern 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.940
 Inclined stripes 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.500
 blurred with the finger and then clarified the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.680
 pencil line with an eraser 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.230
 moldable I do not recommend that you blur with 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.120
 your finger when you're using graphite but 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.610
 with colored pencils as they are very 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.410
 Greasy there is so much trouble me 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.040
 I mean that the fat that can leave 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.620
 the finger on the paper does not affect him 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.650
 we illuminate the horse and the figure then 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.410
 flat without shadows because 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.130
 I just want it to be a silhouette to 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.530
 backlighting 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.670
 of the child some contours that had 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.619
 lost and darkened some parts 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.490
 when the spum and we can not blur the 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:03.850
 color to achieve a more even tone 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.970
 well with white we created some waves 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.610
 and with the dark blue we make the beach 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.220
 also there we put some reflections 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.500
 I see that the horse looks very static 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.510
 erased one of the front legs and the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.060
 let's draw how it is giving a 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.060
 step this should give you more movement 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.019
 we make the final details and ready
