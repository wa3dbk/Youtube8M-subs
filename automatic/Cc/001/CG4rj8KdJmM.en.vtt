this<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.630> certainly<00:01:18.960> wasn't<00:01:19.229> crisp<00:01:19.740> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
this but it certainly wasn't crisp it

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.560 
this but it certainly wasn't crisp it
certainly<00:01:20.310> didn't<00:01:20.549> feel<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.970> good<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> say<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
certainly didn't feel as good to say the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.320 
certainly didn't feel as good to say the
PlayStation<00:01:22.080> 3<00:01:22.320> controller<00:01:22.470> or<00:01:23.060> even<00:01:24.060> an

which<00:01:26.189> had<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> very<00:01:26.700> very<00:01:26.970> good<00:01:27.210> d-pad<00:01:27.630> indeed

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
which had a very very good d-pad indeed

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.100 
which had a very very good d-pad indeed
however<00:01:29.299> we<00:01:30.299> don't<00:01:30.450> know<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:30.930> been

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
however we don't know if that's been

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410 
however we don't know if that's been
improved<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.250> anyone<00:01:32.490> who's<00:01:32.759> expecting

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
improved but for anyone who's expecting

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.990 
improved but for anyone who's expecting
say<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> screen<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.250> Wii<00:01:35.369> U<00:01:35.549> controller

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
say a screen like the Wii U controller

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.649

or<00:01:36.299> attached<00:01:36.840> pad<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.860> ps4<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:39.060> doesn't

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
or attached pad that the ps4 it doesn't

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.929 
or attached pad that the ps4 it doesn't
seem<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> case<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.770> obviously<00:01:41.460> this

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
seem to be the case and obviously this

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.760 
seem to be the case and obviously this
has<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.270> been<00:01:42.329> 100<00:01:42.810> thing<00:01:42.960> confirmed<00:01:43.439> we're

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
has not been 100 thing confirmed we're

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.999 
has not been 100 thing confirmed we're
not<00:01:43.920> actually<00:01:44.070> seeing<00:01:44.490> images<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.270> yet

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
not actually seeing images of a yet

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.260 
not actually seeing images of a yet
there<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> couple<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.549> reasons<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:48.149> this

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
there are a couple of reasons for this

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.200 
there are a couple of reasons for this
and<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.369> they<00:01:50.610> were<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.180> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and that is that if they were to do this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.840 
and that is that if they were to do this
is<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> possibility<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.590> Microsoft<00:01:53.579> would

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
is a possibility that Microsoft would

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.929 
is a possibility that Microsoft would
know<00:01:54.240> who<00:01:55.049> link<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> photo<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.610> allow<00:01:56.909> me

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
know who link to the photo and allow me

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.359 
know who link to the photo and allow me
to<00:01:57.180> illustrate<00:01:57.270> further<00:01:57.810> there<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> series

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
to illustrate further there are a series

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.940 
to illustrate further there are a series
of<00:01:59.700> radiating<00:02:00.689> black<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> white<00:02:01.350> stripes

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
across the peripherals and and for those

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.760 
across the peripherals and and for those
of<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.329> who<00:02:06.509> are<00:02:06.659> unfamiliar<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.439> mean<00:02:07.619> by

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
of you who are unfamiliar what I mean by

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.680 
of you who are unfamiliar what I mean by
that<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.250> simply<00:02:08.729> means<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.090> looks<00:02:09.330> kind<00:02:09.629> of

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
that it simply means it looks kind of

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.850 
that it simply means it looks kind of
like<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.899> zebra<00:02:10.080> pattern

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
like a zebra pattern

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.530 
like a zebra pattern
and<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.900> theory<00:02:13.350> behind<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.220> that

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
and the theory behind this is that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.910 
and the theory behind this is that
remember<00:02:15.540> how<00:02:15.750> when<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> PlayStation<00:02:16.620> 4

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
remember how when the PlayStation 4

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.950 
remember how when the PlayStation 4
stuff<00:02:17.220> started<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.970> get<00:02:18.060> leaked<00:02:18.360> especially

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
stuff started to get leaked especially

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.590 
stuff started to get leaked especially
their<00:02:19.050> control<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.440> images<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.600> remember

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
their control the images and remember

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.670 
their control the images and remember
that<00:02:21.810> all<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.170> control<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.590> were

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
that all the control that were

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.160 
that all the control that were
completely<00:02:23.040> black<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.850> it's<00:02:24.030> very<00:02:24.360> very<00:02:24.780> very

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
completely black and it's very very very

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.590 
completely black and it's very very very
hard<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.830> figure<00:02:26.460> out<00:02:26.670> who<00:02:26.760> leaked<00:02:27.030> what<00:02:27.360> if

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
hard to figure out who leaked what if

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.060 
hard to figure out who leaked what if
the<00:02:27.720> controllers<00:02:28.140> black<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.680> not<00:02:28.890> like

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
the controllers black it's not like

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.120 
the controllers black it's not like
there's<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:30.060> know<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.360> stick<00:02:31.320> on<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.830> thing

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
there's you know a stick on that thing

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.570 
there's you know a stick on that thing
that<00:02:32.160> says<00:02:32.550> Electronic<00:02:33.150> Arts<00:02:34.280> prototype<00:02:35.280> or

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
that says Electronic Arts prototype or

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.310 
that says Electronic Arts prototype or
whatever<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.090> even<00:02:36.270> if<00:02:36.360> there<00:02:36.510> was<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.080> could

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
whatever and even if there was you could

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.080 
whatever and even if there was you could
very<00:02:37.530> easily<00:02:37.620> Photoshop<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.820> course

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
very easily Photoshop that out of course

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.910 
very easily Photoshop that out of course
with<00:02:39.870> something<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.740> lot<00:02:40.890> harder

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
with something like this is a lot harder

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.040 
with something like this is a lot harder
indeed<00:02:41.700> obviously<00:02:42.209> there<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.540> still<00:02:42.810> always

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
indeed obviously there is still always

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.710 
indeed obviously there is still always
you<00:02:43.770> could<00:02:43.950> smudge<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.580> or<00:02:44.700> whatever<00:02:44.880> but

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
you could smudge it or whatever but

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.050 
you could smudge it or whatever but
although<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> solvent<00:02:47.310> obviously<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.910> not

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
although the solvent obviously is not

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.540 
although the solvent obviously is not
confirmed<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:49.200> certainly<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.650> theory<00:02:50.250> behind

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
confirmed it's certainly a theory behind

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.900 
confirmed it's certainly a theory behind
there<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.370> case<00:02:53.400> that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
there so if that is the case that

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.550 
there so if that is the case that
obviously<00:02:54.239> no<00:02:54.540> one<00:02:54.750> wants<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:55.050> take<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.350> risk

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
obviously no one wants to take the risk

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.880 
obviously no one wants to take the risk
of<00:02:55.739> really<00:02:56.340> really<00:02:56.760> damaging<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
of really really damaging the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.810 
of really really damaging the
relationship<00:02:58.890> with<00:02:59.010> Microsoft<00:02:59.580> and

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
relationship with Microsoft and

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.850 
relationship with Microsoft and
obviously<00:03:00.540> there's<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> good<00:03:00.959> possibility<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
obviously there's a good possibility the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.190 
obviously there's a good possibility the
end<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.520> month<00:03:02.820> or<00:03:03.510> by<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.780> end<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.110> this

end of this month or by the end of this
month<00:03:04.410> we<00:03:04.590> could<00:03:04.709> have<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> lot<00:03:05.100> more

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
month we could have a lot more

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.520

that's roughly the time period that we

that's roughly the time period that we
