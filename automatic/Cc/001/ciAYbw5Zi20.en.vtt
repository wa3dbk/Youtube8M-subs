00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.389 
i've been testing some jelly bean roms
and<00:00:48.840> i<00:00:48.989> highly<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.680> recommend<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.219> right

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and i highly don't recommend it right

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.100 
and i highly don't recommend it right
now<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.879> I've<00:00:51.059> been<00:00:51.090> ending<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.840> boot

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
now because I've been ending up in boot

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.040 
now because I've been ending up in boot
loop<00:00:52.140> time<00:00:52.590> after<00:00:52.739> time<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:54.329> would<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.960> say

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
loop time after time I would just say

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.549 
loop time after time I would just say
just<00:00:55.590> wait<00:00:55.860> until<00:00:56.840> that<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.199> settled

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
just wait until that all that is settled

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.369 
just wait until that all that is settled
down<00:00:58.800> because<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> completely<00:01:00.750> stable

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
