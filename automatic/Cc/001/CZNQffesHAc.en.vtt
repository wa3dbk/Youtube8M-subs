up to your expectations for him in the
scale<00:02:02.229> when<00:02:02.619> we<00:02:02.860> knew<00:02:03.040> where<00:02:03.220> we<00:02:03.250> were<00:02:03.759> pretty

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090

good<00:02:04.180> on<00:02:04.330> defense<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:04.930> was<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.049> little<00:02:05.229> bit

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320

worried about a plant imbalanced off

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.150 
worried about a plant imbalanced off
hence<00:02:07.149> they<00:02:07.299> could<00:02:07.450> run<00:02:07.659> in<00:02:07.840> throw<00:02:08.140> our<00:02:08.920> pass

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
hence they could run in throw our pass

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.919 
hence they could run in throw our pass
