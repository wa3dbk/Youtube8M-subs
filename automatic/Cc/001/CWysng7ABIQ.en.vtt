00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
in information technology or even people

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.170 
in information technology or even people
that<00:04:46.310> are<00:04:46.669> studying<00:04:46.910> photography<00:04:47.979> and<00:04:49.180> using

that are studying photography and using
digital<00:04:50.390> media<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.880> very<00:04:53.810> easy<00:04:54.200> to<00:04:54.530> use

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
digital media it is a very easy to use

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.920 
digital media it is a very easy to use
pen<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.430> lot<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:56.030> times<00:04:56.210> you<00:04:56.390> don't<00:04:56.479> even<00:04:56.600> have

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
pen a lot of times you don't even have

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.140 
pen a lot of times you don't even have
to<00:04:57.110> actually<00:04:57.500> touch<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:58.010> pad<00:04:58.190> you<00:04:58.490> just<00:04:58.940> hover

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
to actually touch the pad you just hover

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.610 
to actually touch the pad you just hover
over<00:04:59.300> the<00:04:59.600> pad<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.080> draw

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
over the pad and draw

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.200 
over the pad and draw
so<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.490> sensitivity<00:05:02.850> is<00:05:03.419> really<00:05:04.199> remarkable

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
so the sensitivity is really remarkable

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.520 
so the sensitivity is really remarkable
very<00:05:06.660> similar<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.260> normal<00:05:07.919> pen<00:05:09.229> other<00:05:10.229> than

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
very similar to a normal pen other than

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.980 
very similar to a normal pen other than
putting<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:10.949> in<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.280> stand<00:05:11.550> if<00:05:12.449> you<00:05:12.570> leave<00:05:12.810> it

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
putting it in the stand if you leave it

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.490 
putting it in the stand if you leave it
out<00:05:14.000> you<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.479> would<00:05:15.630> almost<00:05:15.750> mistake<00:05:16.199> it<00:05:16.350> for

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
out you you would almost mistake it for

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.040 
out you you would almost mistake it for
our<00:05:16.590> normal<00:05:16.919> pen<00:05:17.240> but<00:05:18.240> it's<00:05:18.510> important<00:05:18.990> to

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
our normal pen but it's important to

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.879 
our normal pen but it's important to
protect<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:20.449> not<00:05:21.449> only<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.780> tip<00:05:22.139> but<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.500> the

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
protect it not only the tip but the the

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.040 
protect it not only the tip but the the
whole<00:05:23.040> structure<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.790> go<00:05:24.389> ahead<00:05:24.630> and<00:05:24.780> put<00:05:24.930> it

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
whole structure and go ahead and put it
