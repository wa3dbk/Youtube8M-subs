00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.410
 hello to all I propose to you 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.790
 today in the art of celebration for 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.269
 shine brightly the night of the 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.099
 Eve 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.700
 so I propose you to discover the 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.700
 material list 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.689
 for those born the art I start with 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.210
 realize some sort of degrade at the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.649
 foam with a silver polish so people 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.059
 first put a drop on a 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.280
 palette then using a foam I 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.510
 will take hold of the color and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.040
 apply it on my nail 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 so I did not apply on the whole 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.790
 surface of the nail i did like a 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.420
 kind of crescent moon on one of 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.420
 sides of the nail 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.280
 I will then clean the varnish that has 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.520
 exceeded with a flat brush soaked in 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.520
 remover 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.910
 I will now come and affix 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.320
 glitter only on my gradient 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.180
 so I'm good loads and the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.480
 brush of a costing top I will come 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.670
 posed by for sure my crescent 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.200
 moon degrade to silver moss 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.540
 then I will take some powder 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.070
 extrafin holographic I'm going 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.440
 sprinkled from far enough to have a 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.780
 made quite diffuse and not too packaged 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.150
 I will then crush the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.430
 glitter on my fingernail and using the 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.750
 fanbrush come sweep the surface of my 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.020
 name to remove the excess of 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.020
 flakes 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.020
 I'm doing the same now with a mix 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.000
 silver glitter so a mix of 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.799
 glitter it's just a 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.720
 straw mixture is size 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.060
 different so here at big payet 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.409
 hexagonal of the straw is thinner and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.409
 then from the intermediate planet 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.640
 to amplify a little bit this side 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.990
 gradient I'm going to add glitter 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.940
 hexagonal which I'm going to first 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.340
 sprinkle a little bit of my mix on 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.290
 a support I will add a little bit 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.460
 top coat an then with a stick 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.740
 from him I'm going 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.320
 soaked in top coat for him 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.030
 glue I'm going to sting a year the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.740
 hexagonal glitter and I'm going in 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.550
 add as well based on the ngo 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.550
 on the end 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.150
 to make it even more sparkling I 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.590
 added some rhinestones so I apply 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.420
 at first a layer of top 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.040
 coat all over the surface of my nail 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.569
 and then using a boxwood stick I 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.170
 will come loot rhinestones of sizes 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.420
 different 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.610
 so there are carousels composed of 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.319
 size rhinestones really crescendo so 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.209
 here I chose finally big trace 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.280
 then I put a way and then a whole 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.000
 small and I'm going to do the same on 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.000
 the end of the ngo 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.469
 and then to finish a very step 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.510
 important using my stick of 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.700
 boxwood I'm going to crush each rhinestone 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.950
 for it to become encrusted in the varnish 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.659
 lasts as long as possible for 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.969
 plastic rhinestones I prefer not to 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.799
 add top coat if not rhinestone fabuler 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:06.920
 and therefore we will not have the glitz laurent 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.150
 and rhinestones it's not theirs 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.530
 is now over you can 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.090
 find all the material I have 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.829
