movie I mean I really enjoyed the first
two<00:02:26.790> acts<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.240> thought<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.780> was<00:02:27.870> building

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
two acts I thought that it was building

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.840 
two acts I thought that it was building
up<00:02:28.350> cool<00:02:28.560> characters<00:02:29.070> there<00:02:29.580> were<00:02:29.670> some

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
up cool characters there were some

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.610 
up cool characters there were some
really<00:02:30.000> fun<00:02:30.330> scenes<00:02:30.660> but<00:02:30.960> as<00:02:31.050> soon<00:02:31.230> as<00:02:31.350> Damon

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
really fun scenes but as soon as Damon

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.350 
really fun scenes but as soon as Damon
got<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.070> suit<00:02:32.340> melded<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.850> his<00:02:32.970> body<00:02:33.240> I

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
got that suit melded to his body I

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.850 
got that suit melded to his body I
thought<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.720> movie<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.110> propelled<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.770> this

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
thought the movie is propelled to this

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.800 
thought the movie is propelled to this
really<00:02:35.280> awesome<00:02:35.610> fun<00:02:36.150> movie<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.780> really

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
really awesome fun movie and I really

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.090 
really awesome fun movie and I really
enjoyed<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.320> fact<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.770> director

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
enjoyed the fact that the director

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.160 
enjoyed the fact that the director
didn't<00:02:38.340> try<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.580> repeat<00:02:39.000> himself<00:02:39.180> again<00:02:39.810> even

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
didn't try to repeat himself again even

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.240 
didn't try to repeat himself again even
though<00:02:40.260> there<00:02:40.380> were<00:02:40.470> certain<00:02:40.830> elements<00:02:40.920> of

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
though there were certain elements of

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.530 
though there were certain elements of
district<00:02:41.550> 9<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.850> are<00:02:41.910> definitely<00:02:42.090> here<00:02:42.480> for

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
district 9 that are definitely here for

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.420 
district 9 that are definitely here for
one<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.140> definitely<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.890> science<00:02:44.280> fiction

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
one it's definitely a science fiction

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.520 
one it's definitely a science fiction
movie<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:45.000> has<00:02:45.180> social<00:02:45.660> commentary<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.410> it

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
movie that has social commentary in it

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.650 
movie that has social commentary in it
but<00:02:46.710> it's<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.130> quite<00:02:47.460> as<00:02:47.760> brainy<00:02:48.180> or

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
but it's not quite as brainy or

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.470 
but it's not quite as brainy or
thought-provoking<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:50.190> district<00:02:50.760> 9<00:02:50.970> was<00:02:51.000> but

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
thought-provoking as district 9 was but

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.880 
thought-provoking as district 9 was but
it's<00:02:51.630> definitely<00:02:51.810> not<00:02:52.020> trying<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.530> be<00:02:52.650> either

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
it's definitely not trying to be either

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.160 
it's definitely not trying to be either
and<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.220> think<00:02:53.460> if<00:02:53.580> you<00:02:53.820> discredit<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.930> film

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
and I think if you discredit the film

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.620 
and I think if you discredit the film

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
performance a lot of her lines felt like

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.050

they were audio dubbed and she had this

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.580 
they were audio dubbed and she had this
sort<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.300> accent<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:39.930> didn't<00:03:40.350> feel

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
like it was on the same level of realism

that<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.900> rest<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.290> actors<00:03:43.620> were<00:03:43.770> on<00:03:43.890> I

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
that the rest of the actors were on I

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.260

didn't really feel that she brought
something<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.080> movie<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.530> really

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
something to the movie that really

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.960
