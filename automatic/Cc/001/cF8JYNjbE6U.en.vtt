 here just like any post may 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.480
 for example one of them was arrested 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.900

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.080

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.649

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.259
 Of course, energy columbus are offline 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.820
 and that was just how it was on the day 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.229
 was the second december or so 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.969

 So this tournament is a tournament 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.789
 Of course , those have to follow with two 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.020
 the whole server around the whole things 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.710

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.750
 server but that can also often 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.540
 happen and I just want you 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.280
 so choose 400 before on christmas 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.230

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.670
 winter, the update came out 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.040
 these could not gamble online 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.540
 xerox game service server or how to 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.290

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.120

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.280
 There it is with scott 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.810

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.400
 has taken offline and it takes 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.430
 of course hours again until rockstar 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.560

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.280
 freed and so on 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.420
 Actually, that's what you wanted to do with it 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.459
 So do not choose that then you 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.550
