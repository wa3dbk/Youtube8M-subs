00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.309
 hi girls then i'll do you today 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.280
 see as before 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.019
 pro to loads of Provencal and that me 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.879
 however I adore as a product is a 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.489
 also spoke very well in the review 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.070
 but having the ingredients, I decided 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.809
 you can also make apples 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.510
 in fact the ingredients that are there 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.960
 if you read on the jar on a butter 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.600
 shea almond oil and vitamin 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.729
 and 8 co ferullo so let's proceed 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.110
 we take the shea butter here I am 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:05.850
 here pure gods of aro mason you take 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.479
 you can find a pure shea butter in 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:15.300
 herbal medicine you know is around 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:17.910
 and it's very hard you see the texture and 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.190
 I tell you already I put you 8 teaspoons 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.720
 of shea butter I have not prepared one 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.430
 abundant quantity but anyway 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.120
 You can also prepare it 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.010
 prepare even more because it is one 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.620
 light keeps this well by having it alone 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.540
 a share of buti and holy see monkey 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.160
 quietly well does not need to 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.790
 stay cool unless you do o 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.360
 exaggerated heat keeps well because 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.710
 in short, it does not need preservatives 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 you can safely keep the bathroom 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.030
 so you can get this recipe 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.120
 prepare even more 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.730
 then I put 8 teaspoons of butter 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.230
 of shea and then used almond oil 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.660
 Provencal sweets 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.580
 however, I usually do almond colors 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.530
 sweet the scented one with mandola 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.720
 will bring green that I showed you 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.330
 in the review so I also have the perfume 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.310
 now wanted to use this because I think 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.580
 that you all have a bit so it's more 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.680
 easy for you and I put three teaspoons 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.200
 of pure sweet almond oil though 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.420
 you have no taste of Provencal and a 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.250
 another always pure and then at the end 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.209
 we will put a fragrance on a 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.430
 almond no problem if you have 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.020
 the one in the green shop or one 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.330
 I send it back to the scented almonds 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.860
 put what looks even better 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.040
 because it also leaves you the perfume and not 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.760
 you need to put your roma after 15 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.680
 to drive away with the spoon for 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.570
 reduce your operation easier 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.610
 after I have to use the blender 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.430
 here it starts to crush well to 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.560
 mix everything a little and with the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.500
 teaspoon you set yourself up a little if 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.780
 you like it harder softer and more basic 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 this you set yourself with oil and I ad 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.730
 example I prefer it much more 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.620
 soft because I find it more spreadable e 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.720
 so for this I prefer 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.950
 add two more teaspoons of oil 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.890
 sweet almond you if you like this 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.470
 consistency so a little to not hard 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.600
 put no more oil in me 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.820
 I prefer yes, I repeat why it is 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.390
 I find it softer and spreadable on the 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.190
 skin 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.740
 and then add two more teaspoons 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.490
 so in all I put five 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.020
 teaspoons of sweet almond oil and 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.180
 this point I also add the 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.790
 tocopherol then the vitamin E that I 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.940
 I've always taken it up to this area 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.750
 vitamin is liquid and I put half of it 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.720
 teaspoon 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.740
 after which he began to blend the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.540
 vitamin is still a 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.710
 useful also the inter is a 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.109
 antioxidant serves as 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.540
 for the skin 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:55.790
 in short, the vine is the same 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.469
 butter no problem I have it 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.049
 lament because the very recipe of gods 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:02.659
 Provencal provides so that there is 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:06.409
 see with whisk this must come 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:08.380
 cream and you whisk until it is online 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.420
 points 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.750
 and this beautiful bra has to come 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:18.220
 completely soft and really creamy 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.810
 and very pleasant on the skin and to this 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.820
 point let's take the jar I have 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.210
 preserved this Provencal painting that 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.060
 you know that I never throw them, of course 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.360
 clean and less I fill my good rho 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.310
 my version which is very similar to 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.140
 the original one neither Provencal only 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.510
 were I do a little softer I repeat 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.820
 because I like it better to spread it on a 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.860
 spread apple tree 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.850
 and here is this soft creamy sauce 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.680
 soft and at this point I make you 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.940
 see also how on the skin before 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.710
 put an almond roma if you like 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.990
 acquires very soft consistency i vi 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.960
 advice to apply it on the skin a 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.940
 bit wet because the humidity we say 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.950
 the water you have on your skin this 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.530
 butter makes a very much emotion 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.230
 moisturizing and does not leave my skin greasy 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.600
 but in a soft and very hydrated way 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.060
 then absorbs the fragrance a 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.730
 almond three drops simply of a 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.560
 rome for sweets the one for or an all 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.500
 in short, what you prefer is essential 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.910
 or nothing and you just keep it 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.830
 that's all 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.830
 so I greet you bye
