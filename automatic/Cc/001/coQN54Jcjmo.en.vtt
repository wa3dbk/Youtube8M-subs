00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello everyone today we have an autopsy 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:13.860
 package parcel of another site aliexpress 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:17.820
 Here it is written an estimated cost of 10 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.510
 dollars and a half pound of gas but strange 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.910
 why half a kilogram so how are they 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 I will not check 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.119
 used to have to run to the kitchen for 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.790
 kitchen scales 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:39.350
 and now it is much easier to actually 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.520
 whether in the package just 156 grams 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.590
 suspiciously why they wrote 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.800
 half a kilogram but there should not be 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.690
 nothing heavy 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.969
 for the package was very worried because 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.230
 inside keep the fragile thing screen for 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:03.750
 e-books then let's actually 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.949
 let's see what yes how there what 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.949
 condition came 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:18.140
 don't know how to start 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:43.200
 because scary 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:48.920
 I will honestly say this on the principle not bad 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.920
 but why 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:59.700
 there is and because it is not very good 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.700
 composition 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:22.020
 look 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.020
 opening process can rewind 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:59.489
 We need to take already to speak . 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.280
 eprom cost something around $ 35 y 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:28.980
 we are much more expensive but we will shift it 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:33.780
 was seemingly whole 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.780
 but damn it is not like this 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:48.060
 tree-stick here on the train 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:50.750
 not as good as I wanted okay 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.750
 We will try 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:06.290
 packed well but not that I probably 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:11.450
 wanted damn okay i'll try 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.830
 I'll show it to him along with the book 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.570
 Astana, there is nothing more 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:21.019
 display and grant us what kind of a 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.019
 it feels good 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:36.590
 such is the model they have all right 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.590
 thank you for your attention bye 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.050
 decided to shoot 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.090
 still 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.629
 addition as if it was noticeable in 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.400
 At the end of the video, my voice has changed 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:59.169
 because of what I saw is not such a train 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:04.900
 as it was necessary now if you 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:11.379
 already see i checked it already changed 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:14.530
 picture on the sixth book this 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:17.340
 the firm of the book that I have with my son 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:22.750
 here I already have parts with are not 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:24.270
 actually what happened to the old one 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:32.139
 screen 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:34.770
 such a different situation why why am I 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.770
 right away 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:45.509
 scared because look what 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:45.509
 here is a train and which one is here 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:59.560
 fewer tracks try 22 together 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.060
 show well here is seen as less 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:07.599
 Basically, I connected 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:11.409
 In a hurry, it seems to be quite like everyone else 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:14.430
 The screen works a little bit of sparkles but 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:18.639
 this is a protective film 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:23.919
 well actually see the following i video i 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:27.300
 show you how to change the screen in principle 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.300
 there is nothing complicated 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:38.340
 I hope that this whole thing will work 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:44.010
 Thank you all 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.010
 this time already until the next video
