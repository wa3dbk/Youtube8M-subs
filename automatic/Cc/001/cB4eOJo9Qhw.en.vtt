00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.260 
these kill streak rewards it's best to
use<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.999> on<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.149> big<00:01:24.390> open<00:01:24.719> map<00:01:24.899> like<00:01:25.200> carrier

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
use them on a big open map like carrier

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.209 
use them on a big open map like carrier
or<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.420> other<00:01:27.569> one<00:01:27.810> there<00:01:27.990> turbine<00:01:28.499> that

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
or that other one there turbine that

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.520 
or that other one there turbine that
doesn't<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.549> very<00:01:29.609> many<00:01:29.969> buildings<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
doesn't have very many buildings and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
doesn't have very many buildings and
you'll<00:01:31.679> get<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.889> most<00:01:32.009> kills<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> them<00:01:32.759> so

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you'll get the most kills out of them so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.989 
you'll get the most kills out of them so
I<00:01:33.299> don't<00:01:33.600> think<00:01:33.749> we<00:01:33.810> got<00:01:33.929> the<00:01:34.170> most<00:01:34.409> kills<00:01:34.999> we

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
I don't think we got the most kills we

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:38.270 
I don't think we got the most kills we
could<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.869> okay<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.829> alright<00:01:38.189> because

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
could have but okay it's alright because

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.669 
could have but okay it's alright because
we're<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.759> compare<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.679> compare

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
we're just gonna compare the compare

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:41.959 
we're just gonna compare the compare
these<00:01:40.829> three<00:01:41.009> here<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.520> since<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
these three here and since it's on the

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.190 
these three here and since it's on the
same<00:01:42.090> map<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> should<00:01:42.749> be<00:01:42.840> fair<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.929> here<00:01:45.929> we<00:01:46.049> go

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
same map it should be fair so here we go

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
same map it should be fair so here we go
and<00:01:46.520> now<00:01:47.520> he's<00:01:47.609> gonna<00:01:47.700> call<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.030> his<00:01:48.149> lodestar

screwy<00:04:39.760> with<00:04:40.030> domination<00:04:40.630> games<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:41.350> oh<00:04:41.650> well

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
screwy with domination games so oh well

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.100 
screwy with domination games so oh well
so<00:04:42.820> let's<00:04:43.389> take<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.570> look<00:04:43.750> at<00:04:43.810> our<00:04:43.900> lodestar

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
so let's take a look at our lodestar

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.570 
so let's take a look at our lodestar
which<00:04:44.770> required<00:04:45.280> 1,500<00:04:45.850> points<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.450> get<00:04:46.630> and

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
which required 1,500 points to get and

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.970 
which required 1,500 points to get and
run<00:04:48.580> 1<00:04:48.790> got<00:04:49.060> us<00:04:49.180> 90<00:04:49.690> out<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.230> run<00:04:50.620> 2<00:04:50.800> got

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
run 1 got us 90 out of it and run 2 got

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.220 
run 1 got us 90 out of it and run 2 got
us<00:04:51.070> only<00:04:51.220> 105<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.389> that's<00:04:52.900> because<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.200> only

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
us only 105 and that's because you only

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.040 
us only 105 and that's because you only
get<00:04:53.410> 15<00:04:53.860> points<00:04:54.130> per<00:04:54.310> kill<00:04:54.730> that's<00:04:55.480> it<00:04:55.750> that<00:04:55.930> is

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
get 15 points per kill that's it that is

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.659 
get 15 points per kill that's it that is
not<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.260> lot<00:04:56.500> but<00:04:56.740> when<00:04:57.070> you<00:04:57.130> look<00:04:57.280> at<00:04:57.340> this<00:04:57.490> war
