00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 pretty good I 'm the same here 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.429
 I present the pri the first interest is 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.130
 with enough time through 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.410
 interests that it's an expert that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.719
 has been active yet round in the mission 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.359
 number 3 of the episode and this expert does not 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.740
 it looks like vision number 3 or 4 this 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.900
 good but we have to do as now 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.010
 watching here is to start the mission in 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.260
 contains difficulty, no need 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.760
 no difficulty in specific flipping 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.529
 backwards shoot them the controller 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.570
 that we saw in the controller are going to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.279
 start to shoot sparks or shoot him is 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.980
 a giant that makes the list of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.170
 correctly and that's why we'll go out 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.850
 of the room and we will see the esportÃ³n 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.730
 so do not learn how calm is emotion 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.590
 here I see the screen right now but I do not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.870
 very fast is sad is very simple 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.280
 but it 's pretty fun and especially 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.230
 very well hidden by part of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.850
 opportunisms we need a gun look 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.590
 since to see it without using a little bit 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.719
 know that if we approach the spartan 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.340
 will stop doing tribal and will continue with 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.899
 the mission normally so we already have 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.219
 a little bit away and hit him with the look 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.219
 to see more this 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.610
 As friends pass by and we'll see each other 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.020
 until the next video by the way 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.470
 let's say a number to videos 100 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.720
 plane number 7 but with that and alternates me 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.570
