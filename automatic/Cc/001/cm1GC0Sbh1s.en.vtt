00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.190 
back so you get a very good fit in terms
of<00:01:27.680> comfort<00:01:28.130> it's<00:01:28.250> fantastic<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.090> it's<00:01:29.930> all

multi<00:01:30.560> impact<00:01:31.010> as<00:01:31.189> well<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.790> will<00:01:31.939> take

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
multi impact as well so it will take

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.030 
multi impact as well so it will take
repeated<00:01:32.510> impacts<00:01:33.049> without<00:01:33.380> breaking<00:01:33.890> or

repeated impacts without breaking or

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.039 
repeated impacts without breaking or

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
degenerating so unlike traditional

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.950 
degenerating so unlike traditional

old-school body armor and they want

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.929 
old-school body armor and they want
something<00:03:34.199> that's<00:03:34.379> slim<00:03:35.040> lightweight<00:03:35.729> and

amount of impact energy and that's what

to<00:03:53.909> fit<00:03:53.939> a<00:03:54.090> customer<00:03:54.569> so<00:03:55.109> long<00:03:55.259> as<00:03:55.379> you<00:03:55.500> get<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
to fit a customer so long as you get the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.439 
to fit a customer so long as you get the
right<00:03:55.919> size<00:03:55.949> of<00:03:56.489> back<00:03:56.669> protector<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.329> will

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
right size of back protector it will

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:58.999 
right size of back protector it will
mold<00:03:57.659> with<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.989> warmth<00:03:58.229> from<00:03:58.349> your<00:03:58.530> body<00:03:58.769> so

00:03:58.999 --> 00:03:59.009 
mold with the warmth from your body so

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.979 
mold with the warmth from your body so
essentially<00:03:59.879> it<00:04:00.090> becomes<00:04:00.239> more<00:04:00.689> comfortable

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
essentially it becomes more comfortable

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.199 
essentially it becomes more comfortable
the<00:04:01.409> longer<00:04:01.739> you're<00:04:01.889> wearing<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:03.060> only

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
the longer you're wearing it for it only

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.089 
the longer you're wearing it for it only
takes<00:04:03.540> 10<00:04:03.780> or<00:04:03.900> 15<00:04:04.169> minutes<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.590> mold<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:05.069> your

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
takes 10 or 15 minutes to mold to your

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.890 
takes 10 or 15 minutes to mold to your
body<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.639> then<00:04:05.790> if<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.329> can<00:04:06.479> wear<00:04:06.629> it<00:04:06.750> all<00:04:06.870> day

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
body and then if you can wear it all day

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.140 
body and then if you can wear it all day
quite<00:04:07.319> comfortably<00:04:07.799> in<00:04:08.040> fact<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.699> longer<00:04:09.030> you

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
quite comfortably in fact the longer you

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.119 
quite comfortably in fact the longer you
wear<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.509> for<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.959> more<00:04:10.259> comfortable<00:04:10.799> and<00:04:10.979> I

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
wear it for the more comfortable and I

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.940 
wear it for the more comfortable and I
guess<00:04:11.370> less<00:04:11.639> noticeable<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.569> because

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
guess less noticeable it because

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.040 
guess less noticeable it because
to<00:04:13.160> work<00:04:13.340> which<00:04:13.580> is<00:04:13.730> how<00:04:14.450> long<00:04:14.629> can<00:04:14.810> they<00:04:14.900> last

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
to work which is how long can they last

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.490 
to work which is how long can they last
for<00:04:15.519> well<00:04:17.109> potentially<00:04:18.109> they<00:04:18.230> have<00:04:18.380> an

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
for well potentially they have an

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.650 
for well potentially they have an
unlimited<00:04:18.769> lifespan<00:04:19.519> because<00:04:20.060> they're<00:04:20.510> not

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
unlimited lifespan because they're not

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.780 
unlimited lifespan because they're not
prone<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.019> damage<00:04:21.380> or<00:04:21.799> breakage

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
prone to damage or breakage

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.700 
prone to damage or breakage
I<00:04:22.820> mean<00:04:23.330> we've<00:04:23.510> tested<00:04:23.750> back<00:04:24.080> protectors<00:04:24.560> that

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
I mean we've tested back protectors that

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.440 
I mean we've tested back protectors that
five<00:04:24.919> or<00:04:25.070> six<00:04:25.250> years<00:04:25.490> old<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.030> we<00:04:26.120> get<00:04:26.330> the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
five or six years old and we get the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.450 
five or six years old and we get the
same<00:04:26.750> test<00:04:27.110> readings<00:04:27.590> as<00:04:27.860> we<00:04:28.100> would<00:04:28.250> with<00:04:28.430> a

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
same test readings as we would with a

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.780 
same test readings as we would with a
new<00:04:28.639> one<00:04:28.790> out<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.030> box<00:04:29.200> so<00:04:30.200> I<00:04:30.650> mean<00:04:31.130> I'd

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
new one out of the box so I mean I'd

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.550 
new one out of the box so I mean I'd
like<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.300> say<00:04:32.479> they<00:04:32.630> would<00:04:32.750> last<00:04:32.930> forever<00:04:33.139> but

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
like to say they would last forever but

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.140 
like to say they would last forever but
I<00:04:33.740> mean<00:04:33.889> in<00:04:34.010> reality<00:04:34.220> they'll<00:04:34.760> last<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.060> a

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
I mean in reality they'll last you a

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.550 
I mean in reality they'll last you a
good<00:04:35.210> four<00:04:35.540> or<00:04:35.570> five<00:04:35.810> years<00:04:36.080> before<00:04:36.260> you'd

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
good four or five years before you'd

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.110 
good four or five years before you'd
look<00:04:36.710> at<00:04:36.830> replacing<00:04:37.010> base<00:04:37.430> it<00:04:37.580> depends<00:04:37.910> on<00:04:37.970> how

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
look at replacing base it depends on how

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.450 
look at replacing base it depends on how
much<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.450> weigh<00:04:38.600> yeah<00:04:39.260> essentially<00:04:39.800> but<00:04:40.340> they

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
much you weigh yeah essentially but they

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.219 
much you weigh yeah essentially but they
do<00:04:40.520> take<00:04:40.910> as<00:04:41.090> I<00:04:41.180> say<00:04:41.300> they'll<00:04:41.479> take<00:04:41.660> unlimited

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
do take as I say they'll take unlimited

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.170 
do take as I say they'll take unlimited
impact<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.010> they'll<00:04:43.310> potentially<00:04:43.820> last<00:04:44.030> you

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
impact so they'll potentially last you

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.969 
impact so they'll potentially last you
for<00:04:44.330> years<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:45.169> really<00:04:45.260> depends<00:04:45.740> how<00:04:45.830> much

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
for years it really depends how much

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.560 
for years it really depends how much
you're<00:04:46.130> gonna<00:04:46.190> use<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.610> thing<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:47.000> what<00:04:47.389> kind

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
you're gonna use the thing and what kind

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.629 
you're gonna use the thing and what kind
of<00:04:47.600> price<00:04:47.810> are<00:04:47.960> we<00:04:48.020> looking<00:04:48.290> at<00:04:48.410> they<00:04:49.040> start<00:04:49.460> at
