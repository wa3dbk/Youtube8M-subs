growing<00:00:35.750> fish<00:00:36.500> since<00:00:37.430> 85<00:00:38.330> and<00:00:38.720> I<00:00:39.290> started

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
growing fish since 85 and I started

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.119 
growing fish since 85 and I started
experimenting<00:00:40.430> with<00:00:40.610> aquaponics<00:00:41.480> in<00:00:41.750> 92<00:00:42.379> we

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
experimenting with aquaponics in 92 we

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.340 
experimenting with aquaponics in 92 we
started<00:00:43.579> at<00:00:43.670> this<00:00:43.790> location<00:00:44.420> about<00:00:44.900> five

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
started at this location about five

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.680 
started at this location about five
years

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.880 

our<00:00:48.590> ranches<00:00:49.220> where<00:00:49.430> we<00:00:49.580> do<00:00:49.870> aquaponic

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
our ranches where we do aquaponic

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.500 
our ranches where we do aquaponic
growing<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.190> food

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
growing of food

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.590 
growing of food
we<00:00:53.780> grilled<00:00:54.410> tilapia<00:00:54.590> here<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.550> then<00:00:56.420> we<00:00:56.570> use

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
we grilled tilapia here and then we use

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.270 
we grilled tilapia here and then we use
the<00:00:57.050> aquaculture<00:00:57.650> water<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:59.000> enroll<00:00:59.360> plants

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.950 

so<00:01:04.280> in<00:01:04.369> other<00:01:04.460> words<00:01:04.699> we<00:01:04.879> feed<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.239> fish<00:01:05.449> the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
so in other words we feed the fish the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.109 
so in other words we feed the fish the
fish<00:01:05.990> feed<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.619> plants<00:01:07.010> and<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.670> planet

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
fish feed the plants and the planet

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.630 
fish feed the plants and the planet
moves<00:01:08.390> enough<00:01:09.080> water<00:01:09.409> for<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.770> fish<00:01:09.950> this

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
moves enough water for the fish this

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.990 
moves enough water for the fish this
particular<00:01:10.970> setup<00:01:11.450> is<00:01:11.930> organic<00:01:12.560> farming<00:01:13.000> but

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
particular setup is organic farming but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.600 
particular setup is organic farming but
it's<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.509> is<00:01:14.630> actually<00:01:15.050> a<00:01:15.080> higher<00:01:15.320> tech<00:01:15.619> Ganic

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
it's it is actually a higher tech Ganic

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.520 
it's it is actually a higher tech Ganic
farming<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.210> we<00:01:17.390> try<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:17.930> get<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.259> most

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
farming so we try to get the most

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.320 
farming so we try to get the most
production<00:01:19.130> out<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:19.520> at<00:01:19.670> least<00:01:19.850> amounted

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
production out of at least amounted

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.450 
production out of at least amounted
round<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:21.020> least<00:01:21.200> amount<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.530> space<00:01:21.770> in<00:01:22.280> these

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
round the least amount of space in these

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.070 
round the least amount of space in these
grow<00:01:22.700> beds<00:01:22.940> we<00:01:23.090> have<00:01:23.210> about<00:01:23.390> 10<00:01:23.659> inches<00:01:23.690> of

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
grow beds we have about 10 inches of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.200 
grow beds we have about 10 inches of
water<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:24.789> the<00:01:25.789> roots<00:01:26.090> just<00:01:26.479> freely<00:01:28.000> go<00:01:29.000> down

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
water and the roots just freely go down

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.500 
water and the roots just freely go down
right<00:01:29.509> into<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.869> water

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.600 

they<00:01:32.900> get<00:01:33.080> all<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.440> nutrients<00:01:33.830> on<00:01:34.010> any<00:01:34.220> soil

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
they get all the nutrients on any soil

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.700 
they get all the nutrients on any soil
they<00:01:34.850> don't<00:01:35.030> need<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.210> be<00:01:35.300> inside<00:01:35.630> we<00:01:36.380> start

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
they don't need to be inside we start

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.230 
they don't need to be inside we start
them<00:01:36.860> in<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.160> little<00:01:37.370> bit<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.640> soil<00:01:37.970> this<00:01:38.180> is

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
them in a little bit of soil this is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.200 
them in a little bit of soil this is
called<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.660> net<00:01:38.870> fun<00:01:39.140> right<00:01:39.350> here<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:40.700> we<00:01:40.850> start

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
called a net fun right here so we start

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.020 
called a net fun right here so we start
it<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.510> soil<00:01:41.750> how<00:01:42.320> did<00:01:42.500> they<00:01:42.590> not<00:01:42.740> get

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
it in the soil how did they not get

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.720 
it in the soil how did they not get
flooded<00:01:44.030> or<00:01:44.210> drown<00:01:45.010> certain<00:01:46.010> plants<00:01:46.490> do<00:01:46.700> well

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
flooded or drown certain plants do well

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:56.429 
flooded or drown certain plants do well
just<00:01:46.940> have<00:01:47.510> it<00:01:47.600> all

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.580 

and<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.310> one<00:01:57.609> of<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.789> benefits<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.590> growing

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
and so one of the benefits of growing

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.279 
and so one of the benefits of growing
produce<00:02:00.039> with<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.880> fish<00:02:01.600> waste<00:02:01.899> as

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
produce with the fish waste as

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.109 
produce with the fish waste as
fertilizer<00:02:02.319> as<00:02:03.069> opposed<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.640> in<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.789> ground

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
fertilizer as opposed to in the ground

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.209 
fertilizer as opposed to in the ground
or<00:02:04.509> with<00:02:04.659> synthetic<00:02:05.200> fertilizers<00:02:05.890> one

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
or with synthetic fertilizers one

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.850 
or with synthetic fertilizers one
benefit<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.299> we<00:02:07.750> don't<00:02:07.929> have<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.349> discard

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
benefit is that we don't have to discard

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.670 
benefit is that we don't have to discard
that<00:02:09.160> fish<00:02:09.970> waste<00:02:10.239> into<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.899> environment

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
that fish waste into the environment

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.160 
that fish waste into the environment
the<00:02:11.890> average<00:02:12.220> salmon<00:02:12.760> farm<00:02:13.000> today<00:02:13.269> puts

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
the average salmon farm today puts

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.270 
the average salmon farm today puts
enough<00:02:14.650> raw<00:02:15.190> manure<00:02:16.150> raw<00:02:16.989> sewage<00:02:17.440> into<00:02:17.980> the

enough raw manure raw sewage into the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.270 
enough raw manure raw sewage into the
environment<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.060> equal<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> town<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:20.280> 65,000

clean<00:02:23.620> it<00:02:23.739> up

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
clean it up

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.890 
clean it up
and<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:24.430> could<00:02:24.580> be<00:02:24.700> using<00:02:24.879> us<00:02:25.120> as<00:02:25.269> food<00:02:25.510> or

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
and they could be using us as food or

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.170 
and they could be using us as food or
they<00:02:26.260> could<00:02:26.530> they<00:02:26.709> could<00:02:26.769> be<00:02:27.180> concentrated

they could they could be concentrated
fish<00:02:28.390> waste<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:29.610> basically<00:02:30.610> concentrated

sewer we're able to use it as a
commodity<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.780> nature<00:02:38.349> there<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.650> no<00:02:39.099> waste

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
commodity and nature there is no waste

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.420 
commodity and nature there is no waste
there's<00:02:40.360> every<00:02:40.810> waste<00:02:41.079> product<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.769> becomes<00:02:42.160> a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
there's every waste product it becomes a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.910 
there's every waste product it becomes a
benefit<00:02:42.910> for<00:02:43.150> another<00:02:43.510> event<00:02:44.349> that<00:02:44.530> happens

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
benefit for another event that happens

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.920 
benefit for another event that happens
in<00:02:45.069> nature<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.879> that's<00:02:46.150> what<00:02:46.390> we<00:02:46.480> try<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.750> do

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
in nature and that's what we try to do

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.530 
in nature and that's what we try to do
here<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:47.530> on<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.129> produce<00:02:48.340> side<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:49.299> can

here so on the produce side you can

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.960 
here so on the produce side you can
control<00:02:49.870> all<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.170> inputs<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.680> have<00:02:50.829> very<00:02:51.430> in

control all the inputs you have very in

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.869 
control all the inputs you have very in
a<00:02:52.120> sense<00:02:52.359> pure<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.230> fresh<00:02:53.590> ingredients<00:02:54.069> that

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:14.139 
fish which they're now doing and then we

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.080 
fish which they're now doing and then we
don't<00:03:14.319> do<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.650> hormonal<00:03:15.040> manipulation<00:03:15.549> and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
don't do the hormonal manipulation and

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.199 
don't do the hormonal manipulation and
very<00:03:17.019> often<00:03:17.530> in<00:03:17.739> traditionally<00:03:18.459> raised<00:03:18.700> fish

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
very often in traditionally raised fish

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.210 
very often in traditionally raised fish
they're<00:03:19.599> using<00:03:19.959> hormones<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.709> stimulate

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
they're using hormones to stimulate

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.490 
they're using hormones to stimulate
growth<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.940> then<00:03:22.569> they<00:03:22.750> also<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:23.290> what's

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
growth and then they also do what's

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.530 
growth and then they also do what's
called<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.799> sex<00:03:24.040> reverse<00:03:24.310> process<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.150> tilapia

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
called a sex reverse process and tilapia

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.020 
called a sex reverse process and tilapia
the<00:03:25.930> males<00:03:26.139> grow<00:03:26.380> faster<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.370> they<00:03:27.579> change<00:03:27.849> the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
the males grow faster so they change the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.110 
the males grow faster so they change the
females<00:03:28.480> male<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.859> that<00:03:29.889> makes<00:03:30.519> the<00:03:30.730> family

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
females male and that makes the family

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.440 
females male and that makes the family
then<00:03:31.510> grow<00:03:31.780> faster<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:33.250> that's<00:03:33.519> why<00:03:33.730> we<00:03:34.030> spawn

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
then grow faster so that's why we spawn

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.309 
then grow faster so that's why we spawn
the<00:03:34.690> fish

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
the fish

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.520 
the fish
our<00:03:35.860> selves<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.480> that<00:03:37.659> we<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:37.989> ensure<00:03:38.500> that

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
our selves so that we can ensure that

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.630 
our selves so that we can ensure that
there's<00:03:39.040> no<00:03:40.170> hormonal<00:03:41.170> manipulation<00:03:41.620> down<00:03:42.219> it

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
there's no hormonal manipulation down it

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.759 
there's no hormonal manipulation down it
might<00:03:42.849> do<00:03:42.969> anything<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.480> plants<00:03:43.930> it'll

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
might do anything to the plants it'll

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.470 
might do anything to the plants it'll
affect<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.159> fish<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.730> if<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:45.939> do<00:03:46.000> anything<00:03:46.299> to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
affect the fish and if I do anything to

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.929 
affect the fish and if I do anything to
the<00:03:46.659> fish<00:03:46.900> it'll<00:03:47.469> affect<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.769> plans<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.909> I

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
the fish it'll affect the plans and so I

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:57.539 
the fish it'll affect the plans and so I
have<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.689> keep<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.170> balance<00:03:56.129> there's<00:03:57.129> a<00:03:57.220> little

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
have to keep a balance there's a little

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:04.140 
have to keep a balance there's a little
kitty<00:03:59.310> hiding<00:04:00.310> in<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.519> corn<00:04:00.819> crop<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:03.150> think

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
kitty hiding in the corn crop I think
