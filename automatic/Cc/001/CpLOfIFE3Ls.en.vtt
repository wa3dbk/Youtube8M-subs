00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.700 
since 2011 but when he was in trouble
this<00:01:38.579> guy<00:01:38.970> almost<00:01:39.270> costs<00:01:39.869> multiple<00:01:40.350> people

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
this guy almost costs multiple people

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.859 
this guy almost costs multiple people
their<00:01:40.920> lives<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.520> would<00:01:41.610> happen<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.939> be<00:01:42.060> MVP<00:01:42.540> of

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
their lives it would happen to be MVP of

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.440 
their lives it would happen to be MVP of
last<00:01:42.899> year<00:01:43.470> Miguel<00:01:44.189> Cabrera<00:01:44.490> he's<00:01:45.210> probably

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
last year Miguel Cabrera he's probably

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
last year Miguel Cabrera he's probably
the<00:01:45.689> best<00:01:45.960> hitter<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.290> baseball<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:47.070> now<00:01:47.100> I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the best hitter in baseball right now I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249 
the best hitter in baseball right now I
think<00:01:47.970> he's<00:01:48.119> damn<00:01:48.360> near<00:01:48.390> at<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> top<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
think he's damn near at the top of the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.740 
think he's damn near at the top of the
MLB<00:01:49.619> charts<00:01:50.189> when<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.610> comes<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.939> home<00:01:51.090> runs<00:01:51.390> he

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
MLB charts when it comes to home runs he

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.260 
MLB charts when it comes to home runs he
leads<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.259> world<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.680> RBIs<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.189> 55<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.240> he's

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
leads the world in RBIs with 55 and he's

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.260 
leads the world in RBIs with 55 and he's
batting<00:01:55.020> 390<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.460> probably<00:01:56.729> want<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
batting 390 but you probably want to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.450 
batting 390 but you probably want to
keep<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.659> guy<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.200> Florida<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.219> away

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
keep this guy out of Florida and away

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.190 
keep this guy out of Florida and away

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420 
this or not but when he son with the New
York<00:02:42.359> Knicks<00:02:42.569> last<00:02:42.749> season<00:02:43.230> he's<00:02:43.680> celebrated

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
by going to the Hamptons and basically

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.220 
by going to the Hamptons and basically
getting<00:02:46.889> wasted<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:48.060> crashing<00:02:48.629> into<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.900> pole

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
getting wasted and crashing into a pole

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.920 
getting wasted and crashing into a pole
at<00:02:50.069> least<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.489> think<00:02:50.549> he<00:02:50.849> crashed<00:02:51.269> into<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.689> pole

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
at least I think he crashed into a pole

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.629 
at least I think he crashed into a pole
but<00:02:52.139> listen<00:02:52.500> when<00:02:52.949> you<00:02:53.040> signed<00:02:53.310> with<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.519> new

but listen when you signed with the new
york<00:02:53.939> knicks<00:02:54.209> i<00:02:54.480> guess<00:02:55.079> it's<00:02:55.379> cause<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.949> drink

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219
