00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 we are always there live from the fifa 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.710
 14 academies you know it's the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.830
 fifa community on the google + network 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.900
 we are here to talk about fifa it's normal 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.590
 it's the game we all love 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.750
 best football game 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.210
 I say it every time but I repeat 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.350
 I like doing that so today 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.359
 special lesson on training and 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.609
 tactics the strategic aspect of fifa 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.260
 anyway we would like 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.600
 would like us to see a little 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.489
 little retouched reworked by the studios 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
 that's the that's the first thing 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.010
 I will keep in the conclusion after he 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.960
 is the best training that is the cap 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.020
 three rooms used by the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.520
 most pros 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.050
 it's supposed to be the best training 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.850
 after now, I think we can 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.060
 do something else in fifa the toule has 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.980
 shown with your 4 1 4 1 and lately 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.590
 I want to say also that the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.660
 mentality and personal tactics it takes 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.600
 not neglect the need to know how 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.970
 moment really on the ground the hull 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.860
 and apply them adapt to what's going on 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.380
 going on it's going to adapt to the situation 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.600
 well, if you're led, did not lead 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.950
 it's normal but I mean there are 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.570
 maybe moments where you can feel 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.430
 your opponent has a little more soft 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.380
 and maybe active and an offensive that 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.509
 will not allow you to put him the 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.790
 coup de grace so here is the 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.320
 strategy we said we are a little bit 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.840
 limited but I feel like we can 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.170
 to go further and we'll see that in 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.960
 teeth here they are that's what I 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.090
 could say in conclusion with any 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.830
 modesty 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.630
 so listen and we come to the end of this 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.369
