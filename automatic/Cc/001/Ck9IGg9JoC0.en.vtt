building to a larger groups how much

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.810 
building to a larger groups how much
ahead<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.880> the<00:00:52.000> curve<00:00:52.210> we<00:00:52.390> are<00:00:52.540> I<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:54.460> that

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
ahead of the curve we are I think that

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.490 
ahead of the curve we are I think that
we<00:00:54.970> are<00:00:55.060> very<00:00:55.239> aggressive<00:00:55.450> when<00:00:56.079> it<00:00:56.170> comes<00:00:56.380> to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
sustainability initiatives I think there

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.760

are<00:00:59.230> ahead<00:00:59.380> of<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.590> curve<00:00:59.920> I<00:01:00.250> think<00:01:00.880> that<00:01:01.000> we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
are ahead of the curve I think that we

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.730 
are ahead of the curve I think that we
were<00:01:02.770> doing<00:01:02.950> green<00:01:04.140> initiatives<00:01:05.140> and<00:01:05.560> we're

they want to change one to improve and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.110 
they want to change one to improve and
the<00:03:19.380> green<00:03:19.560> team<00:03:19.830> takes<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.370> runs<00:03:20.580> with<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.910> of

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
the green team takes it runs with it of

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.640 
the green team takes it runs with it of
course<00:03:21.300> we<00:03:21.450> have<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.570> lot<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.750> suggestions<00:03:22.080> also

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650

and

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
and

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.830 
and
it's<00:03:25.380> everyone's<00:03:26.280> involved<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.880> but<00:03:27.660> then

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
the planning and say I think this is a

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.440 
the planning and say I think this is a
good<00:03:32.340> idea<00:03:32.430> let's<00:03:32.790> see<00:03:32.910> what<00:03:33.090> everybody

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
good idea let's see what everybody

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.420 
good idea let's see what everybody
thinks<00:03:33.660> out<00:03:33.900> there<00:03:34.110> as<00:03:34.230> well<00:03:34.500> whether<00:03:35.160> it's

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
giving out me you know everyone a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.430 
giving out me you know everyone a
recycling<00:03:38.069> bag<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.490> they<00:03:38.550> think<00:03:38.610> it's<00:03:38.910> great

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
recycling bag and they think it's great

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.430

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
whether it's doing the light fare be

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.920 
whether it's doing the light fare be
right<00:03:43.620> before<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.920> holidays<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.700> so<00:03:45.600> forth
