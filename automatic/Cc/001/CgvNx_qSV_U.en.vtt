00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello welcome example with 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.540
 I've got this box recently 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.480
 here my first magic show of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.870
 ravensburger shown suitable the whole 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.020
 for children over six years and that is 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.449
 a magic box with which you completely 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.910
 can do different magic tricks 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.859
 many utensils are included and in 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.449
 This video will give you a trick 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.710
 you can even betray that 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.980
 imitate at home 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.990
 you need a box for that 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.710
 So the square is really like that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.480
 a cube is formed 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.610
 because this box is here but sometimes 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.320
 There are also so small cardboard boxes the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 maybe have small gift boxes 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.870
 her too much at home and one 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.649
 cube that has exactly the size that you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.649
 there fits in 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.089
 Of course, you can also do that yourself 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:00.289
 made of cardboard and the track is 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:03.859
 now the audience next to this dice 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.269
 here in the box with some color 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.720
 for example, this is up 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.720
 here place close the box and give 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.810
 then the sorcerer behind the box 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.690
 so the wizard will get you the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.399
 crate here behind the back and see 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.729
 Of course not bad color is 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.130
 but the wizard can hold it 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.149
 find out what color it is 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.119
 but of course it does not do it 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.920
 but a good trick i will give you 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.890
 betrayed this trick today 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.860
 And that is the number of men that takes 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.649
 behind the back has very carefully the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.310
 Cover and makes him so much through 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.470
 gray red the crate then forward and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.110
 keeps so tough then so itself which 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.659
 color front is but for the audience 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.490
 those who watch from here still see it 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.289
 from like a normal box with 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.340
 cover 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.430
 that's why it's important that it does 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.200
 a square box is and the 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.509
 of course now would be the crate 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.539
 with lid and up here would be the color 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.660
 But the color is behind here 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:12.250
 wizards they all so and 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.760
 Connection made then simply said 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:20.250
 it is i am laying i watch with magic 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.510
 and I'm out is orange and then 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.040
 then the guests fall in the moment 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.040
 quickly back up with one 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.540
 move to courage and you then us me 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:37.450
 was right it is orange centrica 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.830
 funny and I can imagine that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.300
 that works pretty well, too 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.410
 Of course, I would like to do it that way 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.090
 in a forest 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.280
 you can even in the comments 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.230
 Write like you ever do magic tricks 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.980
 and binds if we already have this trick 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.260
 knew 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.010
 if he thinks well you think so too 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.530
 that we might be there 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.330
 so it will happen 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.950
 just everything in the comments and 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.560
 I also write to you even more 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.300
 magic tricks should betray or whether I 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.510
 you sometimes simply to demonstrate a 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.130
 So a magic trick where then 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.200
 no one really knows how i do that 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.910
 it just seems to me to have done that 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.160
 everything in the comments I think completely 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.290
 excited and we'll see you at the next 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.170
 then again and look at ours 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.920
 other videos subscribed to our channel 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.920
