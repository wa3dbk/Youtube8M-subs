00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.920
In this video we will compare the Samsung
Galaxy S II and the Sony Xperia P. The two

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.599
phones cost exactly the same at the moment,
the Samsung Galaxy S II is the former flagship

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.570
from Samsung and the Android 
phone of last year. 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.490
The Xperia P is brand new and off course has some new 
features, 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.820
but also has some disadvantages to the S II.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.880
In this video, we will look at the differences.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.900
The design off course is a big difference.
The Xperia P design is a real Sony design,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.420
it has a transparent strip, is really clean,
a bit square and has an aluminium unibody.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.650
That's really nice. The Galaxy S
II doesn't have that

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.400
and has a quite simple plastic design.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.610
So the build quality is a
bit worse, the phone feels a lot worse

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.229
in the hand than the Xperia P. The phone is a
bit bigger, has a bit bigger screen,

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.229
although the size doesn't differ that much.
But the Galaxy S II is clearly bigger.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:14.100
The design is above all more boring, so the
Xperia P is the winner in that aspect.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.090
The screens of the two phones are quite different. The
Xperia P wins in that aspect if you ask us.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.090
The Galaxy S II has a Super Amoled, or
even a Super Amoled Plus display.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.569
4.3" with a WVGA resolution.
The Plus means

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.030
it doesn't have a PenTile matrix, so the pixel
layout in this Super Amoled screen is the same as

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.450
in the LCD display on the Xperia P.
The Xperia P has a qHD screen,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.599
so it has a higher resolution than the Galaxy
S II. The screen is also smaller,

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.340
so all in all the screen is quite a bit sharper.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.180
And also the screen is a lot brighter. The
Xperia P has a White Magic display.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.620
That doesn't work that well and gives you unnatural colours,
but if you keep the brightness low it is a nice screen

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.420
with nice colours, and it's still
a lot brighter than the Galaxy S II.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.439
The colours are not as lively,
but they are more realistic

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.569
and the screen is brighter
and sharper

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.360
so we think the Xperia P has a better screen
than the Galaxy S II.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.250
The camera of the two phones are roughly
the same. The Xperia P has a bit better camera,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.250
they are both 8 megapixel cameras, are able to film
in 1080p. So spec wise there are not too many differences,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.330
but the Xperia P delivers a bit better quality
and the options are more advanced.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.330
The interface of the two phones is different
and the Galaxy S II is the better one.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
Not quite with the interface, but with
the operating system anyway.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.950
The Galaxy S II runs Android 4.0 at the moment.
The Xperia P will get an update to that version also

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.349
but at the moment it's stuck at Android 2.3.
Android 2.3 is simply a bit worse

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.930
and some applications don't run on it because it's a
bit older. And that's a pity, also because the Xperia P

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.930
is newer than the Galaxy S II. The Galaxy S II
has had the update, the Xperia P will get it

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.049
in a couple of months, maybe a bit
less, we'll have to see that.

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.049
But the Galaxy S II wins in that aspect.
The processor in the Galaxy S II is a bit faster,

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.549
in theory anyway. Sony optimised the software a bit
better so in the end the difference is not that big.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.000
But the Galaxy S II is a bit faster.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.389
Furthermore, the Sony has a nice
unique selling point, namely NFC.

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.389
There are two smart tags in the box,
and if you touch them with the phone

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.219
you can start an app or change your profile.
That's nice for instance in your car,

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:40.219
if you put the phone in your carkit you can launch
navigation, switch off Wi-Fi and switch on GPS or

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:47.529
whatever you want. So that's quite handy, and isn't
there in the S II. The S II has the advantage that

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.789
it has a lot of memory, also expendable memory.
You can just put a MicroSD card in it, that's

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:58.389
not possible with the Xperia P. The Xperia
P has 16GB, which is fine, but you can't expand it.

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.740
The Galaxy S II also wins with its battery,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.149
the standard battery is quite bad so it loses
with that one. But with the Galaxy S II

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:10.330
you can insert a bigger battery, as we have.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.080
Normally the phone is a bit thinner and it will get
a big thicker, you will get a replacement backside with it.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.080
But then you will have a
bigger battery time

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.719
and then it wins from the Sony Xperia P.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.770
Certainly if you have the two batteries
and you leave home for a couple of days,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.589
you can take both batteries and you
will be able to keep you phone running much

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:29.589
longer than with the Xperia P. The Xperia
P has one battery which is built in, so you

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:39.080
can't buy a second one. That's a pity in this
phone. While the phones cost the same,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.139
at the moment we would buy the Xperia P without
doubt. The camera is better, but above all

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:49.309
we like the body a lot more. It's an aluminium
unibody, that's really nice and the phone

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:55.550
is a bit more compact, the phone looks nicer
and the design is more special. And the phone

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.589
doesn't have too much cons compared to Samsung's
last year's flagship. The Samsung has a bit

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:05.589
faster processor and is a bit faster, the
screen is a bit bigger, the phone is a bit

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.580
thinner and as said the memory is expendable.
But apart from that the advantages of the

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.020
Samsung aren't that big compared to the Sony.
The Sony has some bigger advantages with it's

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:21.050
better camera, better screen and additional
NFC than the Samsung if you ask us.
