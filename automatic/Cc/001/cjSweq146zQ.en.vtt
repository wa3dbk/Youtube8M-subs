00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.499 
he's a videogame store clerk now what
that<00:01:48.440> tells<00:01:48.619> me<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.069> he's<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.909> big<00:01:50.179> fan<00:01:50.479> of

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
that tells me is he's a big fan of

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.480 
that tells me is he's a big fan of
Assassin's<00:01:51.200> Creed<00:01:51.440> 4<00:01:51.470> where<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.220> main

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
Assassin's Creed 4 where the main

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.780 
Assassin's Creed 4 where the main
character<00:01:52.940> is<00:01:53.179> Edward<00:01:54.110> Kenway<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.520> think

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
character is Edward Kenway so I think

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.789 
character is Edward Kenway so I think
that<00:01:56.180> definitely<00:01:56.450> shows<00:01:56.869> a<00:01:56.899> direct<00:01:57.320> link

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
that definitely shows a direct link

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.459 
that definitely shows a direct link
between<00:01:58.070> both<00:01:58.520> universes<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.509> each<00:01:59.659> other<00:01:59.899> I'd

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
between both universes to each other I'd

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.230 
between both universes to each other I'd
