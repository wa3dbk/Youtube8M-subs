about<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:25.019> little<00:00:25.260> bit<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.500> make

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
about that just a little bit to make

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.929 
about that just a little bit to make
sure<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.980> understand<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> mechanism

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
sure that you understand the mechanism

sure that you understand the mechanism
behind<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.390> our<00:00:28.380> body<00:00:28.590> does<00:00:28.710> need<00:00:29.070> high

order to function properly it provides

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.380 
order to function properly it provides
us<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.070> lot<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.280> amino<00:00:35.520> acids<00:00:35.969> which<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
us a lot of amino acids which are the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.900 
us a lot of amino acids which are the
building<00:00:36.540> blocks<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.260> only<00:00:37.440> muscle<00:00:37.910> but

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
building blocks for not only muscle but

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.479 
building blocks for not only muscle but
also<00:00:39.059> brain<00:00:39.540> matter<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.219> day<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
also brain matter and in this day and

also brain matter and in this day and
age<00:00:41.700> proteins<00:00:42.239> seem<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.600> be<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:42.989> bit

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
age proteins seem to be a little bit

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.049 
age proteins seem to be a little bit
harder<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> come<00:00:43.860> by<00:00:43.890> rather<00:00:44.700> than<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
harder to come by rather than the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.639 
harder to come by rather than the
carbohydrates<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.170> every<00:00:46.260> snack

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
carbohydrates that are in every snack

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.410 
carbohydrates that are in every snack
machine<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.489> are<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:47.700> simple<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
machine or that are very simple and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.950 
machine or that are very simple and
cheap<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.870> acquire<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.120> an<00:00:51.239> extent<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.809> all

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
cheap to acquire so to an extent we all

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
cheap to acquire so to an extent we all
do<00:00:52.320> need<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.829> our<00:00:52.949> protein<00:00:53.370> intake<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
do need to up our protein intake just a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.490 
do need to up our protein intake just a
little<00:00:54.390> bit<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.020> don't<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> go

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
little bit but you don't want to go

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
little bit but you don't want to go
overboard<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.120> you're<00:00:57.239> only

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
overboard with it because if you're only

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.840 
overboard with it because if you're only
eating<00:00:57.809> proteins<00:00:58.590> there's<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.550> things

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
eating proteins there's a lot of things

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.639 
eating proteins there's a lot of things
that<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.270> body<00:01:00.480> isn't<00:01:00.780> getting<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.500> can

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
that your body isn't getting that can

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.290 
that your body isn't getting that can
cause<00:01:01.829> health<00:01:02.129> problems<00:01:02.190> anything<00:01:03.180> from

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
cause health problems anything from

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.560 
cause health problems anything from
problems<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> kidney<00:01:04.379> liver<00:01:05.570> even

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
problems with the kidney liver even

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.200 
problems with the kidney liver even
problems<00:01:06.840> somewhat<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> intestines<00:01:08.430> so

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
problems somewhat in the intestines so

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.750 
problems somewhat in the intestines so
eating<00:01:10.170> protein<00:01:10.470> also<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> an

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
eating protein also can have kind of an

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.490 
eating protein also can have kind of an
effect<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.210> being<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.510> diuretic<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
effect of being a diuretic which is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.160 
effect of being a diuretic which is
going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> make<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.600> retain<00:01:15.600> less<00:01:15.840> water

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
going to make you retain less water

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.380 
going to make you retain less water
weight<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.009> sometimes<00:01:17.280> those<00:01:17.670> quick<00:01:17.970> results

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
weight so sometimes those quick results

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
weight so sometimes those quick results
that<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.890> only<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> last

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that you get only are going to last

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.399 
that you get only are going to last
temporarily<00:01:21.270> while<00:01:21.659> you're<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.170> high

though<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.990> would<00:01:28.439> recommend<00:01:29.240> more<00:01:30.240> protein

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
though I would recommend more protein

than<00:01:30.689> people<00:01:31.079> typically<00:01:31.439> eat<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> can

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
than people typically eat so if you can

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
than people typically eat so if you can
