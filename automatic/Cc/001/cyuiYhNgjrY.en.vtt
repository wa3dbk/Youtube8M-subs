Hi!

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.750
I'm Moro Smylodon and I'm going to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.570
give a lesson about Arpeggios and Sweep Picking.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.360
Ok. I'm gonna show you some Arpeggios Shapes.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.800
the most used

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.230
and I'm gonna tell you how does the technique of Sweep Picking Works.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.070
Previously, I will explain the difference between the minor and mayor chord.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.960
The mayor chord

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.770
for example, G. From 3 to 7 on the 6th string.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.000
5 on the 5th and 4th strings.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.480
8 on the 4th

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:26.480
Here on the third, 7. On the 2nd the 8, 7 and 10on the 1st.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.650
For the minor chord, we are going to use A minor, on the 6th, 5 and 8.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.180
7 on the 5th and 4th strings.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.300
10 also on the 4th.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.170
9 on the 3rd.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.500
10 on the 2nd.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.050
8 and 12 on the 1st. Right?

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.480
We can play Sweep Picking on

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.649
these Arpeggio Shapes. This is when you play it fast.

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:18.649
If you play it slow, it's better to use alternate picking.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.389
You see? Now, How to play Sweep Picking? For example, we are going to take a section

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.009
of both arpeggios. For example,

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.029
on A minor, we take this last part.

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.319
from the 4th string.

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.689
and we are going to take

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.219
G, also on the 4th string...

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.699
So, what now?

00:02:53.699 --> 00:03:00.699
Let's supose that we start from this sector.

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.529
When we play

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:16.529
two notes on one single string, we use alternate picking.

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:22.059
When we go up or down playing one single note per string, we play with sweep.

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:29.059
I mean, we sweep with the pick. Not alternate picking. So here we alternate and

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:44.929
we start sweeping until we arrive here, and alternate again.

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:51.489
Watch my right hand.

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:58.489
The same happens with mayor chord.

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.749
This is valid for the whole Chord Shape.

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:08.919
We are going to play it.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:15.049
Alwais remembering, alternate picking when we play two notes per string, and when we play one single note per string

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:22.049
we play sweep. That is Sweep Picking.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.879
