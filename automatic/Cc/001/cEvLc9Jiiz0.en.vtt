00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 today we go to tamriel 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.560
 We treasure hunt that once the matze 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.599
 Hello and I am the oli of the water 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.450
 Actually, you are more like stations 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.700
 gang why did you do what wanted so 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 in the discos online, there are so synonymous 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.500
 How to find treasure cards here 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.010
 looks like you can be lucky 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.510
 somewhere loaded crates or something 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.090
 and on it is just like seeing him 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.269
 picture to see what a stylized 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.529
 landscape represents aha that is for 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.120
 somehow a map with me 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.340
 the xtra zone dashed line like 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.020
 you get there but rather only one 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 You have to find out the exact scenery 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.530
 where on the sometimes quite large 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.969
 cards are in this scenery 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.550
 I could know how to find that 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.850
 would google and then guess these 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.899
 or summer will be after release 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.879
 may be so, but i think so 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.739
 somehow you take that with you 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.550
 enjoy the whole story 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.350
 the items how did you come up with that 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.940
 what could they be on site 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.979
 Switzerland is looking for there was still here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.119
 another note another 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.799
 there are no hints but in this 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.659
 case is in the middle something round 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.540
 structure and then I get up 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.090
 the map looked at what structure 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.280
 could it be here so it was there 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.750
 is there such a round mark on the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.430
 But that was just not the case 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.210
 That's why I go now a little under it 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.830
 look at this more because it is so synonymous 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.350
 seamless round ruin or something 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.070
 is drawn 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.130
 I already had a ticket 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.930
 There was a double waterfall on it 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 see and on the map there was only 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.320
 So influential was the possibility 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.079
 Quite limited okay and so you have to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.030
 then the stories are difficult enough 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.530
 is time in such cases where just stop 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.720
 to see ruins are actually 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.250
 stand around everywhere 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.840
 but does not that automatically and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.159
 West was generated in the world 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.500
 and then display exactly with meter 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.920
 still running would be really boring 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.960
 Yes 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.520
 normal quests are already with everyone 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.930
 so you can also get one 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.880
 little to explore 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.470
 go and have to do a bit of what it does 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.640
 also gives proper education for that 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.530
 can I say we worth it because 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.420
 the effort at all yes there is always 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.239
 neatly valuable items in there like that 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.880
 four to five pieces poorer and those were 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.380
 also mostly all on my character 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.690
 adapted in the case heavier 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.370
 Armor heard that was also very cheap 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.690
 Is it always like this or was it 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.110
 now by pure chance 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.310
 so I think I have three or four 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.319
 made treasure hunts and there it was always 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.630
 so it is actually a wish 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.680
 treasure chest that checks you off immediately 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.560
 and hey says 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.330
 The man needs this and that very much 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.700
 cool from the level years are the old ones 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.500
 always about in the area where 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.299
 so is the area so if 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.420
 I am now in the low limit area suddenly 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.190
 a treasure chest search are only synonymous 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.600
 level items in there so with those I can 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.640
 then no longer as a high level character 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.840
 So much to start should one then 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.780
 if you do it in the same way 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.269
 area is tailor made so i praise you 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.470
 In any case, I ask a question how come 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.760
 you a sweetie what you said 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.320
 It is simply a whole way 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.910
 normal job or was that then already 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.670
 special intermediate water the endboss 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.040
 Euro I myself have not found the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.350
 treasure cards used here stem from 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.190
 the pre-order bonuses of the imperial 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.390
 edition for each area one so here 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.260
 I look just spent the thing 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.910
 and I realize that I probably 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.940
 I'm in the right place because of the ruin 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.070
 behind it looks quite similar 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.030
 very nice 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.680
 I hope there is such a thing 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.640
 basic feature so if you that the 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.350
 song that was the puzzle solved 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.959
 In general, that's not how it is 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.900
 Great sandbox always ok but it has 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.879
 also many such elements the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.920
 so from the classic role-playing game 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.629
 holder stalkers that were looking for more 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.129
 must discover so and see here 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.420
 we are now relatively big 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.159
 match between the treasure map 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.780
 and the real world is there, then 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.680
 I am in the right place and must now 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.390
 just find this extra and 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.209
 to get potential opponents out of the way 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.510
 or are you not me and go 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.459
 this time because I am with them 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.620
 wanted to create necessarily while I the 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.209
 darling, because here is the treasure of 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.890
 you will always find such a one 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.889
 buy track and still has to be sick 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.329
 pedestrian fast is also relatively short 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.130
 been a few minutes wet for that 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.199
 invested I think that stands in one 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.199
 very good relation to the acquisition
