00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.860
 hey people and welcome to with 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.270
 We are just getting started with this video 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.100
 the imac through and already there 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.200
 Another apple product is that 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.880
 this time the macbook pro retina and 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.950
 215 2 variant 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.080
 and before again a lot of 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.910
 ask if the mainz is because it is 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.619
 is not mainz belongs to my father though 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.480
 So I can just stop at least videos 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.019
 over it and that is the macbook 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.620
 per retina 15 inches with the 2 6 ghz quad 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:37.030
 core i7 processor 16 gb ram and the 650 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.980
 m from nvidia 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.570
 as always, it's the same with apple products 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.710
 that the box still with the plastic 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.660
 the packaged one is down there 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.670
 can cut and then you can 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.440
 just push up the box 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.180
 then it is already on the retina 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.590
 macbook pro what you then easily 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.809
 these very small holes after 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.219
 can lift up and take out that can 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.960
 Let's just start now 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.760
 page and look at what else in 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.079
 the box is right, we have that first 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.850
 extension cable what a 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.129
 voltage converter from the actual 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.080
 connection for charging the macbook pros 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.700
 may include plus there's then 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.110
 also a small adapter one 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.090
 just do not need such a long cable 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.190
 Then it's a magsafe 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.570
 2-connection so it's a magnetic one 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.369
 connection your go off if you turn 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.689
 rum Jerking around and should be synonymous before 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.729
 protect that the macbook if it 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.650
 is charged and some trolls 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.850
 comes over and pulls the cable away 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.320
 it does not fall off then 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.970
 otherwise we still have that 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.770
 favorite part of every apple giggs 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.210
 apart from the product itself, which one 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.000
 Of course unpacks and indeed are the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.670
 again the guide with hello macbook 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.090
 per the sticker and of course the pulse 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.799
 high 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.600
 in order to get to the macbook pro 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.400
 We like every apple product 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.540
 first break the seal and the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.460
 make film away 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.740
 It already stands out how thin that is 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.869
 macbook pro with retina is really me 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.820
 had no macbook pros in yet 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.079
 the hand in the longer use but 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.399
 that is really nice if you 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.049
 Consider how much power there is 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.280
 we believe that's what it's all about 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.170
 first time on this must first 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.850
 remove the aluminum foil to see how 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.159
 beautiful is really so i mean it 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.030
 looks really classy because you just have to 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.770
 agree 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.840
 besides, it is at the displays or that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.549
 at that time it was also announced that 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.750
 you now have less reflections on it 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.759
 like the new imac 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.110
 as well, a product name said retina 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.910
 macbook a year already that's just the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.769
 tina macbook is franky captain obvious 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.640
 and we have a resolution here 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.260
 from 2,880 1800 pixels and I can now 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.060
 already say you can see the pixel really 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.060
 Do not aim the connections on the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.520
 in the case usb 3.0 a hdmi port and 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.569
 a sd card slot on the left 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.489
 we have the side then 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.060
 headphone jack again a usb port 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.920
 200 ports and the magsafe 2 connection 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.239
 to recharge then again to 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.950
 Comparison of the thickness for mac book pro 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.840
 retina we have the magic here once 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.819
 mouse and the magic mouse is handy 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.010
 as thick as the macbook pro retina everyone 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.660
 the reader knows now what you know 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.580
 it has to be expected and that is 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.050
 display also closed 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.420
 Another is the macbook pro retina 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.620
 twice as thick as the iphone 5 with the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.600
 Handy, you can ten I really 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.549
 compare but only so you know how 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.140
 Thats that it really is then it was too 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.910
 again from me for this video 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.950
 I think that will not now 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.569
 be sure to give a complete review 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.640
 but rather a comparison video 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.360
 between the new imac and the retina 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.640
 macbook pro 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.140
 since I myself partially before the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.750
 question if I now retina 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.459
 mcgee pole or rather an imac 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.110
 then I thank you as always for 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.310
 of course we see ourselves in the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.750
 next video i would go over one 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.180
 comment on a thumbs up or 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.260
 maybe even an abo happy and then 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.440
 see you in the next video 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.440
 then
