does<00:00:58.949> changing<00:00:59.340> our<00:00:59.460> diet<00:00:59.699> help<00:01:00.090> how<00:01:00.300> our

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
does changing our diet help how our

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.110 
does changing our diet help how our

help our brain function do drugs help us

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.950 
help our brain function do drugs help us
so<00:01:10.320> we're<00:01:11.070> concerned<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.960> understanding

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so we're concerned with understanding

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
so we're concerned with understanding
caught<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.530> complex<00:01:13.920> network<00:01:14.369> we're

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
caught this complex network we're

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
caught this complex network we're
concerned<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.960> understanding<00:01:16.710> how<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
concerned with understanding how the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.240 
concerned with understanding how the
brain<00:01:17.549> develops<00:01:17.960> how<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.140> behaves<00:01:19.560> through

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
brain develops how it behaves through

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.840 
brain develops how it behaves through
maturity<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.970> through<00:01:21.360> aging<00:01:22.159> but<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.310> central

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
maturity and through aging but a central

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.609 
maturity and through aging but a central
question<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.810> given<00:01:25.470> these

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
question we have then is given these

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.410 
question we have then is given these
interests<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.060> want<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
interests what do we really want to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.679 
interests what do we really want to
measure<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.380> deciding<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.130> measure<00:01:29.689> is

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
measure so deciding what to measure is

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.080 
measure so deciding what to measure is
quite<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> difficult<00:01:31.320> question<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.890> answer<00:01:32.090> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
quite a difficult question to answer the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.640 
quite a difficult question to answer the
reason<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> brain<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
reason for that is the brain is a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.399 
reason for that is the brain is a
complex<00:01:35.220> system<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.880> coupled<00:01:36.810> neurons<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
complex system of coupled neurons and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.460 
complex system of coupled neurons and
the<00:01:37.890> behavior<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.729> any<00:01:38.970> single<00:01:39.630> neuron<00:01:40.020> may

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the behavior of it any single neuron may

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
the behavior of it any single neuron may
be<00:01:40.530> only<00:01:40.710> weakly<00:01:41.100> coupled<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.909> behavior

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
be only weakly coupled to the behavior

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.260 
be only weakly coupled to the behavior
of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.290> brain<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> we<00:01:44.790> need<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> measure

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
of the brain so we need to measure

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.480 
of the brain so we need to measure
things<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.810> different<00:01:45.990> scales<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.399> look

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
things on different scales we can look

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.609 
things on different scales we can look
on<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> smallest<00:01:48.060> scales<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.780> single<00:01:49.200> neurons

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
on the smallest scales of single neurons

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.370 
on the smallest scales of single neurons
we<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.430> look<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> meso<00:01:51.060> scale<00:01:51.270> where<00:01:52.229> we

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
we can look on the meso scale where we

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.830 
we can look on the meso scale where we
have<00:01:52.619> many<00:01:53.310> many<00:01:53.579> neurons<00:01:53.970> covered<00:01:54.540> together

have many many neurons covered together

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840 
have many many neurons covered together
or<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.619> look<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> macro<00:01:56.159> scale<00:01:56.610> of

or we can look on the macro scale of

interesting problem and that is what is

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.240 
interesting problem and that is what is
normal<00:03:12.170> deciding<00:03:13.170> what<00:03:13.319> is<00:03:13.440> normal<00:03:13.829> is<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:13.980> very

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
normal deciding what is normal is a very

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.580 
normal deciding what is normal is a very
difficult<00:03:14.489> question<00:03:15.180> it's<00:03:16.170> like<00:03:16.409> our

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
difficult question it's like our

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.250 
difficult question it's like our
fingerprints<00:03:17.220> as<00:03:18.030> embryos<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:18.810> all<00:03:18.959> grow

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260

fingerprints as embryos we all grow
limbs<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.829> fingers<00:03:20.010> we<00:03:20.970> all<00:03:21.090> do<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.450> same

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
limbs and fingers we all do the same

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.129 
limbs and fingers we all do the same
things<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.230> yet<00:03:22.380> at<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:22.859> detailed<00:03:23.340> level<00:03:23.639> our

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
things and yet at a detailed level our

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.830 
things and yet at a detailed level our
fingerprints<00:03:25.139> are<00:03:25.410> highly<00:03:25.829> individual<00:03:26.459> and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
fingerprints are highly individual and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.080 
fingerprints are highly individual and
so<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.019> with<00:03:28.139> the<00:03:28.379> brain<00:03:28.669> we<00:03:29.669> develop

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
so it is with the brain we develop

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.390 
so it is with the brain we develop
similar<00:03:30.419> functions<00:03:31.109> we<00:03:31.680> develop<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.160> same

similar functions we develop the same

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.089 
similar functions we develop the same
abilities<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.239> yet<00:03:33.720> some<00:03:34.109> of<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.410> detail<00:03:34.680> is

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
abilities and yet some of that detail is

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.159 
abilities and yet some of that detail is
your<00:03:35.489> response<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.239> stimuli<00:03:36.810> we've

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
your response to the stimuli we've

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.069 
your response to the stimuli we've
received<00:03:37.709> so<00:03:38.700> part<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.150> what<00:03:39.209> we<00:03:39.510> see<00:03:39.720> inside<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
received so part of what we see inside a

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.619 
received so part of what we see inside a
brain<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.620> highly<00:03:41.010> individual<00:03:41.639> and<00:03:41.819> part<00:03:42.480> of

brain is highly individual and part of

brain is highly individual and part of
it<00:03:42.780> is<00:03:42.930> normal<00:03:44.480> often<00:03:45.480> we<00:03:45.599> define<00:03:45.959> normal<00:03:46.230> in

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
it is normal often we define normal in

it is normal often we define normal in

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the sense of what isn't pathological so

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.569 
the sense of what isn't pathological so
if<00:03:49.319> you<00:03:49.410> have<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.590> child<00:03:49.889> that<00:03:50.099> isn't<00:03:50.250> growing
